  "description": "Cleaning up the city is a worthy task, and local control is dysfunctional.",
  "content": "President Trump took federal control of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department on Monday, pledging to \u201crescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor\u2014and worse.\u201d He\u2019s also calling up 800 troops from the D.C. National Guard to assist. Now Washingtonians and visitors can judge Police Commissioner Trump by the results he gets.\n\nThe Constitution establishes the District of Columbia as a federal enclave, so there\u2019s no abuse of power in Congress and the President exercising authority over it. (Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to intervene in the policing of Chicago, say, are a different matter.) These days D.C. largely governs itself, using delegated powers, but the law preserves Presidential control of the police during emergencies, generally up to 30 days unless Congress approves.\n\n\u201cCrime is out of control,\u201d says Mr. Trump\u2019s emergency declaration. \u201cThe city government\u2019s failure to maintain public order and safety has had a dire impact on the Federal Government\u2019s ability to operate efficiently to address the Nation\u2019s broader interests.\u201d In a news conference at the White House, the President mentioned the recent assault of a former DOGE staffer, Edward Coristine. He said murders hit a high in 2023, when 274 were killed.\n\nViolent crime has since fallen, as the press quickly pointed out, and fair enough. Nobody can accuse Mr. Trump of understatement, given his vision of D.C. as painted by Hieronymus Bosch. \u201cOur capital city,\u201d he said, \u201chas been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs, and homeless people.\u201d Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents are in the awkward position of arguing it\u2019s no emergency if last year a mere 187 people were murdered and only 1,026 were assaulted with a dangerous weapon.",

The move comes amidst concerns about crime and the inability of the federal government to act efficiently. The Constitution allows for presidential control of police during emergencies, usually up to 30 days unless Congress approves. However, critics argue that this is not an emergency, as violent crime has decreased significantly since the previous year.",
