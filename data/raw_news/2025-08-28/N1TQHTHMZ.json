  "description": "Comprehensive cloud-based network monitoring for IT teams",
  "content": "Auvik excels at automated network discovery and provides excellent visibility for IT teams managing distributed networks. While the pricing can escalate quickly for larger deployments, its ease of use and comprehensive feature set make it a strong contender in the network monitoring space.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nAuvik positions itself as a comprehensive network management solution designed specifically for modern IT teams and managed service providers. The platform automatically discovers and maps your entire network infrastructure, providing real-time visibility into device health, traffic patterns, and performance metrics.\n\nTechradar reviewers spend several weeks researching each major IT platform in the market, testing core functionality and evaluating real-world performance. We found that for the most part, Auvik delivers on its promise of simplified network management through automation.\n\nWhile LogicMonitor remains our pick for the best network monitoring tool of 2025 thanks to its AI-powered IT workflows, Auvik offers compelling advantages for teams seeking straightforward deployment and management.\n\nAuvik delivers a feature-rich platform that's particularly well-suited for IT teams and MSPs managing multiple network environments. It excels in automated discovery, real-time monitoring, and data visualization, with over 64 pre-configured alerts out of the box.\n\nWhile the feature execution is generally solid, we noticed gaps in advanced customization options that competitors like SolarWinds NPM offer. The device-based pricing model justifies the cost for smaller networks, but larger deployments may find better value elsewhere.\n\nAuvik's automated topology mapping stands out as one of its strongest features. The platform uses automated discovery protocols to map your entire network infrastructure, creating visual representations that update in real-time as devices connect or disconnect. You can track traffic flow between devices, even across VLANs and subnets, and investigate issues with interactive maps that provide instant access to device details.\n\nThe platform provides comprehensive real-time monitoring across all network devices.

Monitoring extends beyond basic metrics to include geo data analysis and application performance tracking.\n\nAuvik automatically backs up device configurations and tracks changes over time. This feature is invaluable for maintaining business continuity and conducting audits. You can compare configurations side-by-side to spot unauthorized changes and restore previous configurations when needed.\n\nUsing NetFlow data, Auvik delivers detailed insights into traffic patterns and application usage. You can identify bandwidth-consuming applications, detect potential congestion points, and plan capacity upgrades based on real usage data. This helps optimize network performance and justify infrastructure investments.\n\nAuvik includes three key remote management features: an in-app terminal, remote tunneling, and a remote browser. These tools allow you to SSH or Telnet into devices, access web interfaces remotely, and establish secure tunnels for any network protocol. This reduces the need for on-site visits and enables faster issue resolution.\n\nAuvik prioritizes user experience with an intuitive interface that requires minimal training. New users consistently praise how quickly they can get up and running, the platform scans networks automatically and populates dashboards without extensive configuration. The learning curve remains gentle even for less experienced IT staff, though some advanced features require deeper networking knowledge to fully utilize.\n\nThe platform's design philosophy centers on reducing complexity through automation. Interactive network maps provide hover-over details for quick troubleshooting, while pre-configured alerts eliminate weeks of manual setup. However, some users report that the interface can feel restrictive when trying to customize views or create complex monitoring scenarios that deviate from standard implementations.\n\nAuvik's device-based pricing model offers transparency but can become expensive as networks grow. The five-device minimum means you'll pay at least $175 monthly for the Essentials plan, even with fewer devices.\n\nWhile the pricing includes unlimited users and sites, larger organizations often find the costs escalating quickly compared to competitors that offer flat-rate enterprise pricing.\n\nAuvik provides support through multiple channels including live chat, email, and a comprehensive knowledge base. Support hours run from 4 AM to 10 PM ET, Monday through Friday, with response times varying by severity level. Critical issues (Severity 1) receive responses within two business hours, while lower-priority requests may take up to 24 hours.\n\nThe support team demonstrates strong technical expertise, particularly helpful given Auvik's focus on complex network environments. However, the limited weekend coverage could pose challenges for organizations requiring 24/7 support. Educational institutions and non-profits can access discounted pricing, though specific support tier differences aren't clearly documented.\n\nAuvik occupies a strong position in the mid-market network monitoring space, competing primarily with Paessler PRTG, SolarWinds NPM, and NinjaOne. The platform appeals most to IT teams and MSPs who value automated discovery and simplified management over extensive customization options. Its cloud-based architecture makes it particularly attractive for organizations managing distributed networks.\n\nKey competitors include Paessler PRTG for Windows-focused environments, LogicMonitor for AI-driven insights, and SolarWinds for enterprise-scale deployments. While Auvik excels in ease of deployment and automated mapping, larger enterprises might find more value in platforms offering advanced analytics, custom reporting, or integrated IT service management capabilities.\n\nAuvik delivers exactly what it promises: simplified network monitoring that works well out of the box. The automated discovery and mapping capabilities save significant time during deployment, while the intuitive interface ensures teams can become productive quickly. For IT teams and MSPs managing multiple client networks, these advantages often outweigh the platform's limitations.\n\nHowever, the device-based pricing model and limited customization options may not suit all organizations. Larger enterprises or teams requiring custom monitoring scenarios might find better value with more flexible alternatives. Despite these constraints, Auvik remains a solid choice for organizations prioritizing ease of use and automated network visibility.\n\nWhat types of devices does Auvik monitor?\n\nAuvik monitors network infrastructure devices like routers, switches, firewalls, and wireless controllers as billable devices. Non-billable devices including servers, workstations, access points, and printers are monitored for free, providing comprehensive network visibility without additional per-device costs.\n\nHow long does Auvik take to set up?\n\nInitial setup typically takes just a few hours, with the platform automatically discovering and mapping your network infrastructure. Most users report having full visibility within their first day of deployment, thanks to Auvik's automated discovery protocols and pre-configured monitoring templates.\n\nCan Auvik integrate with other IT management tools?\n\nYes, Auvik offers API access and various integrations to connect with existing IT workflows. The platform supports integration with ticketing systems, documentation tools, and other network management platforms, though the specific integration catalog isn't as extensive as some enterprise-focused competitors.\n\nAuvik operates as a cloud-based SaaS solution, with on-premises collectors that securely relay network data to the cloud platform. This provides the benefits of cloud management while keeping sensitive network data collection local to your environment.\n\nAuvik offers a 14-day free trial with full access to all platform features. No credit card is required for the trial, and you can monitor your entire network infrastructure during the evaluation period to assess the platform's fit for your specific requirements.\n\nWe list the best website monitoring software.",

The interface is noticeably easy to understand and navigate, which contributes to effective network monitoring. The main drawback we observed is that it\u2019s relatively expensive, with prices starting from $375 per month. You can take advantage of the free trial to test the platform before making your final decision.\nBest network monitoring tool for advanced users\n2. Datadog\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDatadog is a very popular network monitoring tool. It\u2019s one of the most advanced such tools you can get, offering numerous features. The platform has a simple REST API, which enables integration with virtually any third-party service.\nDatadog lets you generate a lot of metrics on your network devices. You can pick any server, router, switch, etc., and it'll show you all the information it's collecting from it. You can customize your dashboard to show you just the information you need. It keeps logs of any errors it detects so that you can revise them later.\nIt's noticeably easy to set up Datadog for your network devices; you can use an installation agent. You can automate and schedule certain tests to ensure you always stay on top of your network.\nDatadog provides great customer support, and you\u2019ll often see this highlighted in reviews. Support staff are always there to help customers sort out their issues.\nThe main drawback of Datadog is that it\u2019s one of the most expensive network monitoring tools out there. Monitoring starts at $5 per month per host, which can add up to a huge amount for organizations with massive networks.\nBest network monitoring tool for Azure users\n3. Microsoft System Center\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMicrosoft is the tech giant famous for its Windows software and Azure cloud computing system. The company offers countless software tools including the System Center for network monitoring.\nMicrosoft System Center makes it easy to monitor your network and data infrastructure. You can monitor all the devices connected to your network with a simplified dashboard giving you a bird's eye view. System Center scans the devices connected to your network to identify issues. It tries to resolve any issues it detects and report to the administrators if further human review is needed.\nThis tool works best if you host your cloud computing resources on Azure. Because of the easy integration with Microsoft's own cloud platform, you can easily monitor the availability and performance of all your cloud resources. Yet, it\u2019s also compatible with other cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nSystem Center has a very broad feature set, so there\u2019s a lot to learn about the platform. It can be pretty difficult to use for a first-time user.\nBest network monitoring tool for ease of use\n4. Dynatrace\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDynatrace is a popular cloud-based network monitoring tool. It helps you monitor devices connected to your network to ensure they\u2019re up and running at all times.\nYour Dynatrace dashboard provides insights into your entire IT infrastructure, including networks, virtual machines, servers, containers, and more. It has native integrations with popular cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need much work to monitor your resources on these providers.\nA good thing about Dynatrace is that it incorporates artificial intelligence techniques to scan networks and detect anomalies. The AI-based system can help detect the root cause of any issue it detects, which reduces complexity for your IT team.\nDynatrace integrates with IT service management solutions such as ServiceNow to provide real-time updates and automatic ticketing when it detects any issue. This platform scales well without sacrificing performance and has an intuitive interface that is easy to understand.\nPricing starts at $0.04 per hour per network host, which is quite expensive. The platform also has a steep learning curve due to having numerous features.\nBest network monitoring tool for hybrid clouds\n5. Intermapper\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIntermapper is a good network monitoring software. As the name suggests, it gives enterprises a network map that offers a live view into their network. IT administrators can monitor every aspect of their network from this map, and there are a variety of layout options to select. The map has color-coded statuses to show what networks are up and which ones are down.\nIf you spot any issues on your network via Intermapper, the software can troubleshoot it to identify the root costs and save your IT team time and efforts. With Intermapper, you can automatically discover every device connected to your network and know if there's any unauthorized one lurking somewhere. You can manage the network from your dashboard and generate analytics and reports to show superiors.\nIntermapper has native integrations with AWS to extract performance data from the cloud provider. You just need to add your AWS EC2 instances, and you can start tracking performance metrics.\nThere\u2019s no standard pricing for Intermapper. You\u2019ll have to contact the company\u2019s sales team for a custom quote.\nBest network monitoring tool for custom support\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNinjaOne is an endpoint management platform with some excellent remote monitoring tools.\nThe software\u2019s monitoring capabilities provide real-time oversight of the health and performance of all managed devices. It\u2019s accompanied by a highly customizable and easy-to-use interface. In fact, you can create your own views on the main screen showing exactly the metrics you want to see.\nOn top of that, NinjaOne automatically keeps track of all the devices and monitors their performance, sending a warning if something goes awry.\nThe software's patch management also enables automated patching for a variety of systems, including Windows, Mac, and a wide range of third-party applications.\nSecurity-wise, NinjaOne takes security and data protection seriously. The platform is certified to meet several key standards, including GDPR, SOC 2 Type II, SOC 3, and HIPAA. In a demonstration of its commitment to security, the company also adheres to PCI-DSS standards, even though this framework is not legally required for its specific business operations.\nWhen it comes to customer service, NinjaOne has an impressive Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score of 98. You\u2019ll also get a response to questions quickly, usually within 65 minutes. Notably, in September last year, the company won the SC Award for Best Customer Service, where it was pointed out that NinjaOne spends about two to four times more on customer support than most other B2B SaaS companies.\nOne issue, or annoyance to be more precise, is the fact that you won\u2019t find full pricing details on the official website. Instead, you\u2019ll have to fill out a form and ask the sales team for a quote after describing exactly what you need.\nWe've also listed the best network switch.\nBest network monitoring tool FAQs\nFeatures of a network monitoring tool\n1. Automated discovery\nYour network monitoring tool should automatically seek out threats or anomalies in your network and alert you immediately to anyone it detects. The good thing is that many tools now employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to spot such threats more easily. Automated reporting will help IT administrators respond more swiftly to fix issues.\n2. Device monitoring\nYou should be able to monitor the performance of every device connected to your network. Watch out for issues such as power outages, database crashes, router failures, etc. If you observe a flaw with a specific device, you should be able to troubleshoot it and identify the issue to fix it.\nYour platform should have network maps giving administrators a bird\u2019s eye view of the network. This network map is double important for large enterprises with a massive number of devices connected to their network.\nConstant monitoring will help you prevent issues that can cause a widespread network collapse.\n3. Scalability\nYour network monitoring tool should scale without sacrificing performance. It should be able to handle increasing monitoring needs as you add more devices to your network. Any network monitoring tool that can\u2019t scale well isn\u2019t a good one.\nHow to choose a network monitoring tool\n1. Cost\nCost is the main consideration when choosing any software. It\u2019s essential to choose a platform that you can afford in the long term. Check if there\u2019s a free trial and use it to test the platform\u2019s features before making your final purchase decision.\nThe pricing for network monitoring tools is often not straightforward. There are many variations and the final bill depends on the size of your network. Hence, always read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs.\n2. Ease of use and setup\nYour network monitoring tool should be easy to set up and configure. It should be easy to navigate or else will frustrate your IT administrators and probably lead to costly mistakes. It should also be easy to customize to fit your needs.\n3. Customer support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you\u2019ll likely need external help to sort out the issue. You should be able to contact a human support representative via live chat, email, or telephone depending on the urgency of the issue. Your platform should also offer complementary support resources such as video tutorials, user guides, and extensive documentation covering all features.\nMore on network monitoring\nThe best network monitoring tools make it simpler and easier to manage all aspects of remote monitoring of your IT infrastructure.\nThis is important because IT is now at the heart of any given business, and applies to every department, every section, and every employee. Yet the larger the business, the more difficult it can be to monitor and maintain the network infrastructure, and keep it monitored for security threats.\nThis means that remote networking monitoring tools, sometimes referred to as RMM (Remote Monitoring Management), have become an essential part of securing and keeping IT networks safe.\nIt's not even just external threats such as malware and ransomware that need to be guarded against, but more mundane issues such as maintaining security protocols and ensuring network connectivity in the face of upgrades and constant patch management.\nThe more machines worked with, the more challenging this can become. General hardware and software asset management becomes essential as either can easily become out of date, leaving the entire IT network vulnerable to failures which can undermine productivity and efficiency.\nIt's not just physical hardware that needs to be secured though, as identity management and firewalls are also now integral security features, as are mobile device management solutions for smartphones and tablets brought to work.\nHowever, there are solutions out there aimed not just at managing those networks, but making the whole process easier. The challenge is to find the best network monitoring tools that work for you and your business.\nHere we feature the network monitoring tools currently available.\nHow we test the best network monitoring tool\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service. We also analyze whether there are collaboration features for multiple users, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nLogicMonitor is Techradar\u2019s best network monitoring tool for 2025, thanks to powerful AI automation and more than 3000 integrations.

We\u2019ve spent weeks comparing the best network monitoring tools of 2025 and LogicMonitor consistently leads the pack for the enterprise crowd.\nAt TechRadar Pro, our reviewers dive deep into every major IT platform, evaluating features, integrations, and real-world usability. We look for the things that IT teams actually need, beyond the elevator pitch and the blown-up promises.\nFor 2025, LogicMonitor is our pick among network monitoring tools. Its AI-powered suite can automate many day-to-day IT workflows, reducing manual effort and helping teams focus on what matters. If your organization values proactive issue detection, automated insights, and seamless scalability, LogicMonitor is well worth a closer look.\nLogicMonitor: Features\nLogicMonitor is loaded with features for modern IT teams managing complex hybrid environments. It\u2019s best suited for medium-to-large organizations that need precise visibility, automation, and scalability. Execution is generally excellent, with AI-driven insights and 3000+ integrations being a major upside.\nBut we\u2019d still like to see more intuitive onboarding for new users and some advanced analytics that competitors like Datadog already offer. Given its features, the price feels justified, but only if you plan to use all the features.\nInfrastructure monitoring\nLogicMonitor tracks the health and performance of all your devices, like servers, storage, VMs, and more, across both on-premise and cloud environments. It automatically discovers devices and provides detailed metrics for each one.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nNetwork monitoring\nTheir platform continuously monitors network traffic, device status, and bandwidth usage. It auto-discovers devices, maps network topology, and uses intelligent alerting to notify you of anomalies in real time.\nLog analysis\nLogicMonitor centralizes log data from across your infrastructure, correlating it with metrics to give you context for troubleshooting.

The new design focuses on usability, with resource-level dashboards, streamlined navigation, and a consistent look across the platform. The resource explorer and enhanced topology mapping make it easier to manage complex environments and troubleshoot issues quickly.\nHowever, there\u2019s still a learning curve, especially for users new to network monitoring. Some advanced features and customizations require time to master, and a few UI elements can feel clunky or buried under menus. While onboarding guidance has improved, junior engineers may still need extra training to get comfortable. On the plus side, LogicMonitor offers live training webinars and plenty of documentation to help teams ramp up faster.\nLogicMonitor: Pricing\nPlan | Starting price (paid annually) | What\u2019s included |\n|---|---|---|\nInfrastructure Monitoring | $22/resource/month | Standard events and metrics, 900+ integrations, servers, VMs, SD-WAN, storage, network devices, cloud |\nCloud IaaS Monitoring | $22/resource/month | AWS EC2, Azure VM, cloud infrastructure, standard integrations |\nWireless Access Points Monitoring | $4/resource/month | Juniper Mist, Cisco Meraki devices, wireless network monitoring |\nCloud PaaS & Container Monitoring | $3/resource/month | AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, MongoDB Atlas, Docker |\nLog Intelligence |\n$2.50\u2013$7/GB/month\n| Log analysis, 7-day to 1-year retention |\nEdwin AI | Contact sales | AI automation, advanced analytics |\n*All prices USD/month, billed annually. \u201cPer resource\u201d means each monitored device or instance.\nLogicMonitor\u2019s pricing is resource-based, which can add up quickly for large environments. The entry-level plans cover most standard monitoring needs, but advanced features (like AI automation or extended log retention) may require add-ons or higher-tier plans.\nCompared to competitors, LogicMonitor is on the expensive side, but the depth and breadth of features help justify the investment for organizations that need them.\nLogicMonitor: Customer support\nLogicMonitor is known for responsive, knowledgeable customer support. Most users consistently praise the team for proactive communication, regular check-ins, and genuine advice. Support is available via live chat, email, and phone, and there are live training webinars every other week for ongoing education.\nSupport packages come in tiers: Standard support is included for all customers, while Premier and FedRAMP plans add proactive monitoring, health checks, and remediation assistance. Premier customers get regular account reviews and early alerts about potential issues, plus priority access to senior engineers. The main caveat is that some advanced support features are only available at higher tiers, so small teams may not get the same level of hands-on help.\nLogicMonitor: The competition\nLogicMonitor sits at the high end of the network monitoring market, best suited for organizations that need deep, automated insights across hybrid and cloud environments. It\u2019s a top pick for enterprises, managed service providers, and fast-growing IT teams who want to future-proof their monitoring stack.\nMain competitors include Datadog, Dynatrace, and New Relic. Datadog offers similar AI-powered monitoring and a broader analytics suite, but at a comparable or higher price. Dynatrace is praised for ease of use and tight cloud integrations, making it a good fit for teams focused on cloud-native infrastructure. New Relic stands out for its flexible pricing and developer-friendly tools, but may lack some of LogicMonitor\u2019s enterprise features. For smaller organizations or those with simpler needs, these alternatives might offer a better balance of features and cost.\nLogicMonitor: Final verdict\nLogicMonitor is a powerhouse for network monitoring, offering unrivaled visibility, automation, and AI-driven insights. Its real-time alerting, deep integrations, and automated topology mapping make it an invaluable tool for IT teams managing complex environments. While the learning curve and premium pricing may give some pause, the overall value is hard to beat if you need best-in-class monitoring.\nFor 2025, LogicMonitor is our pick for the best network monitoring tool, especially for organizations ready to invest more for reliability and consistency. If you want to automate IT workflows with full transparency, LogicMonitor is well worth the investment.\nFAQs\nIs LogicMonitor suitable for small businesses?\nLogicMonitor is designed for mid-sized to large organizations. Its pricing and feature set may be overkill for small businesses, but it can be scaled down if you only need to monitor a handful of resources.\nWhat kinds of devices can LogicMonitor monitor?\nLogicMonitor supports a wide range of devices, including routers, switches, firewalls, servers, wireless access points, storage systems, and cloud resources.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nNinjaOne offers a great mix of power and simplicity for IT teams handling many endpoints. Its automation features and user-friendly design make it a top choice, even with its higher price.\nPros\n- +\nUser-friendly interface\n- +\nPowerful automation capabilities\n- +\nExcellent remote monitoring tools\n- +\nResponsive customer support\nCons\n- -\nHigher pricing than competitors\n- -\nLimited reporting flexibility\n- -\nMobile app needs improvement\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nNinjaOne is a complete endpoint management platform that simplifies IT tasks. We loved its clean and easy-to-use interface, unlike the cluttered dashboards of many competitors. The platform offers a clear view of all endpoints, making it simple to monitor device health, deploy patches, and troubleshoot issues remotely.\nBut what impressed us most were NinjaOne's strong automation features. These can help you streamline routine maintenance tasks with little effort. We set up automated patch management policies that kept systems updated without needing manual work, which greatly reduced the workload. The remote monitoring tools provided real-time insights into system performance. Customizable alerts help fix potential issues before they impact end users.\nNinjaOne delivers good value with its wide range of features. However, its pricing is higher than some competitors. While the reporting function meets basic needs, it lacks flexibility for creating highly customized reports for specific business needs. Despite these issues, our experience was very positive, especially because of its helpful customer support team.\nNinjaOne: Plans and pricing\nNinjaOne has a tiered pricing model. This model depends on the number of endpoints you manage and the modules you need. Pricing starts at about $3 per endpoint each month for the Essentials plan. The Professional and Enterprise tiers provide advanced features at higher prices. Note that the company requires annual billing, which may be a concern for smaller businesses with changing needs.\nNinjaOne is not the cheapest option available, but it offers good value. It has a wide range of features and time-saving automation tools. The platform also has a 14-day free trial with full functionality. This lets you test the software thoroughly before making a decision. For larger organizations managing many endpoints, custom pricing is available. Volume discounts can make the platform more affordable for those with hundreds or thousands of endpoints.\nNinjaOne: Features\nNinjaOne offers a complete set of IT management tools that simplify endpoint monitoring, maintenance, and support. It combines strong features with an easy-to-use design. Here are the key features that make NinjaOne a top choice for IT professionals:\nRemote monitoring and management\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nNinjaOne's remote monitoring is key to its offering. It gives real-time visibility into the health and performance of all managed endpoints. We found the dashboard very customizable. It was able to create different views to highlight various important metrics. Plus the platform collects detailed inventory data automatically. And it tracks system performance and alerts admins to potential issues.\nPatch management\nNinjaOne's patch management feature supports automated patching for Windows, Mac, and third-party apps. It offers granular controls for scheduling and approval workflows. We liked the option to create different patching policies for various device groups. That way, you could have aggressive update schedules for test machines while keeping tighter control over production systems.\nRemote access and support\nNinjaOne's remote access tools allow for instant connections to company-owned devices without extra software requirements. During testing, we found that the remote sessions ran smoothly, even on devices with limited bandwidth. The platform offers screen sharing, file transfer, and command-line access. It can also work in the background without bothering end users, which could be useful for support leaders.\nAutomation and scripting\nNinjaOne's automation features are a key strength. We could build advanced workflows with less manual work compared to competitors. The platform has a strong library of pre-built scripts and automation policies. These can be used right away or tailored to meet your needs. You can automate routine tasks like disk cleanup, temporary file removal, and application deployments to cut down on admin workload.\nNinjaOne: Analytics\nNinjaOne offers reporting tools that give clear insights into your IT environment's health, performance, and security. Its pre-built report templates meet most common needs, like patch compliance, hardware inventory, and security vulnerabilities. The platform can also automatically send scheduled reports to stakeholders, saving your team a lot of time going back and forth between emails.\nWhile the reporting features are strong, we did find some limits when making highly customized reports with specific data. The dashboard provides good options for real-time monitoring, but exported reports focus more on function than style, with basic formatting choices. Despite these small issues, the analytics capabilities can help you identify trends, track compliance, and make informed decisions about your infrastructure.\nNinjaOne: Ease of use\nThe NinjaOne dashboard is pretty intuitive and easy to navigate. You get a panel on the left with a list of all connected endpoints. All you have to do is click on a connected system to view its status.\nYou also get a health overview of all the systems in your network. The platform offers tabs like overview, OS patches, software, tools, backup, etc. under each system setting. The activities tab, for example, gives you a detailed list of what each person was doing on the network, including login and logout times and software and hardware changes, among others.\nAnother thing we particularly liked about NinjaOne is its detailed URL addresses. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re checking the inventory status of one of your offices and want to share it with a team member. Instead of guiding them through the entire path, you can share the URL right down to the inventory list. Such detailed and specific URL addresses make navigation and internal communication pretty easy.\nNinjaOne: Support\nCustomer service is another area where NinjaOne excels. With a CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) score of 98 and an average response time of 65 minutes, the platform is currently ranked number one based on a survey of 380+ MSPs.\nIn fact, you get free customer onboarding services with valuable technical advice, which makes initial onboarding and troubleshooting seamless.\nNinjaOne: Security\nNinjaOne employs strict compliance, product, and information security protocols. The platform is compliant with GDPR, SOC 2 Type II, SOC 3, and HIPAA. NinjaOne goes out of its way and also complies with PCI-DSS, even though it\u2019s not applicable to the company.\nOther product-based security protocols include extensive audit logs, multi-factor authentication, and rule-based access controls. Apart from this, the platform uses industry-standard AES-256 for data encryption. All of your data is encrypted and stored on a secure, non-publicly accessible server.\nNinjaOne also offers several security and backup tools to keep your data safe from external threats. You can remotely edit registries, manage applications, deploy scripts, and manage endpoint protection automatically on all devices.\nThere\u2019s also a credential exchange that helps you store and inject credentials seamlessly while deploying patches or remote device connections. Furthermore, you can leverage the Ninja Data Protection feature to recover and backup critical information from a particular workstation or from entire servers with three storage options \u2013 local-only, cloud-only, and hybrid.\nNinjaOne: The Competition\nNinjaOne is an ideal solution if you\u2019re a large business with around 500 to 1,000 endpoints. However, for smaller businesses with only a few systems, NinjaOne can be expensive. In this scenario, you can look at alternatives like AnyDesk, which costs just $14.90/month, allowing you to manage around 100 devices with just a single licensed user.\nAnother option you can consider is TeamViewer, which also offers a handy free plan for personal use. Besides this, you can choose from different plans, depending on the size of your business. What\u2019s more, TeamViewer can help you with internal communication through audio and text conversations, and you also get a video conferencing feature along with a screen recorder.\nNinjaOne: Final Verdict\nNinjaOne is, quite simply, one of the best RMM tools around, especially when it comes to patch management. You can automate various tasks across systems on an easy-to-use dashboard.\nThe best thing about the platform in our testing was its quick onboarding. With its complementary onboarding services, you can expect to manage endpoints within hours. Plus, its customer service team boasts a CSAT score of 98, which is always a huge positive.\nThe only downside to NinjaOne, if there were ever one, is its non-transparent pricing. You will have to contact the sales team and describe your needs in detail to get a quote.\nAdditionally, smaller teams with only a handful of endpoints may find NinjaOne to be a tad bit expensive. That said, NinjaOne is an excellent choice for large teams with more than 500-1000 systems to manage.\nFAQs\nWhat is NinjaOne used for?\nNinjaOne is a remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform with the aim of simplifying monitoring and managing endpoints through a lightweight agent application on the device. Not only can you monitor all your devices from a single place, but you can also run functions like OS and software patching, backups, and several automations.\nHow much does NinjaOne cost?\nYou\u2019ll need to reach out to a NinjaOne sales representative to get a custom quote, which would be based on your organization's needs and the number of endpoints. On average, you can expect to spend around $2-4 per endpoint if you have more than 1,000 endpoints to manage.\nFor anything less than that, NinjaOne may prove to be slightly pricey. If you want something more affordable, you can look at AnyDesk. However, you may not get the superior patch management and customer service that NinjaOne offers.\nWhat type of devices can I monitor with NinjaOne?\nYou can manage and monitor Windows, Mac, Linux, and VMware endpoints, as well as SNMP devices and cloud infrastructure, with NinjaOne. This ensures you have a one-stop solution for all your management needs.\nCheck out our feature on the best online cybersecurity course.\nRitoban Mukherjee is a tech and innovations journalist from West Bengal, India.

      "text": "Best website monitoring software of 2025\nKeep track of your website performace\nA business today is only as good as its website. Even with the best web hosting services, downtimes can occur due to various reasons, such as technical glitches, cyberattacks, or human error. This is where the best website monitoring software is crucial.\nRegardless of the cause, business owners must be the first ones to know about an outage. Besides losing out on revenue, website downtimes lead to loss of reputation. More than 9% of visitors do not return to a website if they find it is not working. Is that a risk you\u2019re willing to take?\nA website monitor keeps an eye on the availability of your web pages and sends you instant alerts if a downtime happens. You can also use Real User Monitoring to improve your SEO rankings as per customer feedback and experience and synthetic monitoring to test out various technical parts of your page.\nHowever, with so many options around, finding the right monitoring software can be quite a task. To help you out, we\u2019ve tested, reviewed, and compiled the best website monitoring solutions on the market right now.\nThe best website monitoring software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest website monitoring software overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUptime is one of the best website monitoring tools thanks to the sheer number of features it offers. For starters, there are more than 20 types of basic checks, including Ping, IMAP, Whois/Domain, TCP Port, and SSL/Certificate, available right from the starter plan.\nA lot of times, websites use APIs to integrate with other services, say payment pages. Advanced Uptime.com check options include API monitoring that lets you test various API integrations such as REST APIs, gRPC APIs, and GraphQL APIs.\nUptime also offers a very easy-to-use no-code transaction check that lets you monitor specific parts of your webpage. For instance, if yours is an e-commerce website, you might want to ensure that users are able to add products to the cart.\nYou can specifically test out this transaction without any coding. Simply load the page on Uptime and mimic the user journey you want to test. Once done, set up a monitor for the transaction, and you\u2019re done.\nIf these synthetic monitoring tools aren\u2019t enough, you can switch to Uptime\u2019s Real User Monitoring (RUM), which can scour through as many as 1.5M page views to fetch real user behavior data. This gives you detailed insights into user trends.\nWe liked the escalation hierarchy option offered by Uptime. Every time there\u2019s an incident, you can choose which team member gets the notification. If the issue remains unsolved for a specific period (say, 2 hours), Uptime will automatically send escalation alerts to the next higher authority and so on. This ensures that each outage is dealt with with immediate attention.\nIf there\u2019s an outage, you can use Uptime\u2019s customizable status pages to keep visitors informed about the incident. Plus, Uptime is one of the few website monitoring platforms offering private status pages for internal communication needs.\nThat said, all these features come at a cost. The basic paid plan starts at $20/month and can go all the way up to $285/month.\nRead our full Uptime.com review.\nBest website monitoring software for real user monitoring\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWe found Datadog really ideal for Real User Monitoring (RUM) thanks to its detailed session replays. You can watch video-like replays of actual user sessions and activities like clicks, scrolls, keystrokes, and so on. This helps a business understand the root cause of low engagement and conversion rates and improve UX/UI issues.\nThe platform also pulls out Core Web Vitals during these sessions, which allows website owners to understand SEO factors like loading performance, inactivity, and visual stability. Search engines like Google use these Core Web Vitals for ranking content. So, the more ideal your website\u2019s scores are, the better your online visibility becomes.\nMuch like Uptime, Datadog also offers API monitoring and transaction checks. You can access Datadog\u2019s API Catalog to check your overall HTTP test coverage. If you find any untested endpoints, you can build a new API check in just a few clicks.\nBesides this, Datadog has one of the largest collections of third-party integrations. You can connect to as many as 800+ apps to build a seamless workflow. The platform\u2019s pricing is also rather unique. It offers function-wise plans instead of pre-defined bundles like others.\nSo, for instance, if you only want RUM functions, you\u2019ll have to shell out only $1.80/month for 1,000 sessions. Similarly, API testing costs $5/month for 10K runs, and browser testing costs $12/month per thousand runs. This makes it an affordable option for small and mid-sized businesses.\nRead our full Datadog review.\nBest affordable website monitoring software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re looking for an affordable website monitor, UptimeRobot is a good option. Plans start from just $7/month and offer robust synthetic monitoring functions. You can run 8 different types of monitors, including HTTP, port & ping monitoring, with a check interval as low as 30 seconds.\nUptimeRobot does a good job at cron job monitoring, which allows you to automate pre-scheduled tasks at regular intervals. For instance, you can run cron jobs to check disk usage, ensure automated backups, or monitor log files.\nYou can also set up SSL and domain expiry alerts, and the platform will send you notification 30, 14, 7, and 1 day before the scheduled expiry.\nSometimes, your website may undergo scheduled maintenance. Running a monitor at that time may result in a lot of false positives and dent your uptime numbers. With UptimeRobot, however, you can set up a custom maintenance window to pause all monitoring activities.\nWhat we also like about UptimeRobot is that it doubles up as a content monitoring platform thanks to keyword alerts. You can set up a monitor on your competitors' websites with specific keywords like \u2018sale\u2019 so that you do not miss out on any trends. This way, you won\u2019t separately have to invest in a dedicated content monitor.\nRead our full UptimeRobot review.\nBest website monitoring software for large businesses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re a large business looking for higher-threshold monitoring plans, Pingdom can be an excellent choice. It only offers two plans \u2013 one for synthetic monitoring and one for RUM. However, it is the sheer number of options you get in each plan that makes it a go-to choice for businesses. Under each plan, you get 22 options, each with a different number of monitors and alerts.\nFor instance, the synthetic monitoring plan starts at $10/month and comes with 10 uptime monitors, 1 advanced monitor (page speed or transaction checks), and 50 SMS alerts. This can go all the way up to 30,000 uptime monitors, 2,500 advanced monitors, and 1,500 SMS alerts with the $18,300/month plan.\nEven on the RUM plan, you can choose up to 1 billion pageviews for $15,000/month. There are only a few website monitors that can support such huge requirements.\nWe like Pingdom\u2019s page speed tests, which aren\u2019t just limited to checking the load times. It performs an in-depth analysis into how various page elements such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript are performing in relation to each other.\nThis helps you zero in on the element that has been slowing your website. Pingdom doesn\u2019t stop there \u2013 it goes a step ahead and assigns grades to each test. This way, you don\u2019t have to go through all the tests, and you\u2019ll know at just a glance if there\u2019s an issue.\nIf Pingdom flags any outages, it runs a detailed root cause analysis and allows admins to run traceroute to find the exact cause of disruption.\nRead our full Pingdom review.\nBest website monitoring software for free tracking tools\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you cannot shell out money for monitoring right now, you can use Site24x7\u2019s 100 free tools to check various aspects of your website. For example, you can use the website availability tool to check if your website is live from various locations.\nSimilarly, you can ping your website to check if it's working. You\u2019ll also find a tool to monitor your SSL certificate. Besides this, you also get an SLA uptime calculator and a host of content and formatter tools. This can come in handy for small businesses and startups that aren\u2019t ready yet to invest in a full-fledged monitoring tool.\nWe also found Site24x7\u2019s paid plans pretty comprehensive, offering good value for money. For instance, its $35/month Pro plan offers 40 basic monitors with a check frequency of 1 minute, 3 advanced monitors, and 500k RUM pageviews. Add to this 3 basic status pages along with several third-party integrations, and you\u2019ll have a complete website monitoring solution.\nSite24x7 is also known for its defacement monitoring that uses a baseline document object model (DOM) mechanism during checks. Current DOMs are compared with previous ones to identify any unauthorized hacks or changes.\nJust like Uptime, you can use a no-code recorder to set up and run various transaction checks and use JSONPath or XPath assertions to monitor API integrations. However, unlike other monitoring platforms, Site24x7 also offers network monitoring on all its plans.\nRead our full Site24x7 review\nOther website monitoring software to consider\nAlthough the five website monitoring tools mentioned above are, quite frankly, the best in business, here are some other honorable mentions that are just as good.\nMonitoring software with feature-wise payment model\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUptrends is a good value-for-money website monitor, offering feature-wise plans. For instance, synthetic transaction monitoring costs $8.17/month, while real user monitoring costs $8.91/month. If you only want to check the uptime and availability of your webpage, you\u2019ll have to pay $5.10/month.\nThis approach makes it an affordable option for small businesses that do not need extensive monitoring functions. Another good thing about Uptrends is that it lets you monitor your pages from as many as 233 global checkpoints.\nThis is the largest pool of servers offered by a website monitor. Its dashboards are also very information-oriented and filled with a lot of charts and graphs, making it easy to spot any errors.\nRead our full Uptrends review.\nTop-notch monitoring software offering great value for money\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nHostTracker is another good website monitoring solution, starting at just $9.9/month for 10 website checks at an interval of 5 minutes. Adding additional websites to the plan costs just $0.70/site.\nUnlike other monitors, HostTracker does a good job when it comes to database monitoring. It checks your MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Servers for any speed and connection stability and ensures they remain available when you need them. Plus, you also get synthetic transaction monitoring and custom API checks.\nBesides this, HostTracker scours the DNSBL databases and Google's unsafe websites list to check if any of your websites have been blacklisted. If so, it will help you resolve the issue as soon as possible. That said, HostTracker lacks real user monitoring functions and status pages, which can be a deal breaker for some users.\nRead our full HostTracker review.\nWe've also listed the best website defacement monitoring service.\nBest website monitoring software FAQs\nWhat is website monitoring?\nWebsite monitoring is a comprehensive process of tracking various aspects of a website, such as uptime, performance, and security. It's, in fact, a wide term encompassing a lot of functions. For example, there are various availability monitoring solutions that keep an eye on your website\u2019s uptime and send alerts if they find any outages.\nSimilarly, there are solutions that allow you to better understand your users with real user monitoring. On the flip side, certain providers facilitate synthetic website testing to ensure all website elements are working as they should. Website monitoring is also used to traceroute website errors and helps in incident resolution.\nWhat is the difference between website monitoring and content monitoring?\nWebsite monitoring solutions focus on measuring aspects like a website\u2019s availability, performance, and security infrastructure to ensure that a website is visible and performing well. Some popular website monitors are Uptime, Datadog, and UptimeRobot.\nContent monitoring, on the other hand, focuses only on the content of a website and sends you alerts when it notices a content change. This can come in handy for purposes like competitor monitoring, SEO monitoring, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Some popular content monitors are Visualping, PageCrawl, and Distill.io.\nWhich is the best website monitoring tool?\nUptime is one of the best website monitoring tools, offering a bunch of features in a single place. Besides more than 20 types of basic checks, you get advanced monitoring options such as API checks, no-code transaction checks, and Real User Monitoring.\nYou can run these checks from various global locations at a frequency of as low as 1 minute (on the higher-end plan). Plus, you can customize your own status pages to keep your visitors informed during an outage. There are also private status pages for internal communications.\nHow to choose the best website monitoring tool?\nThere are quite a few things to consider while picking a website monitoring solution. Let\u2019s look at them one by one.\nFirstly, define what you exactly need from a website monitor. Do you only want to view uptime and availability or want to dig deeper with real user monitoring and run tests with synthetic monitoring?\nOnce your expectations are clear, you need to underline the features you\u2019re looking for. Some common functions include real-time downtime alerts, monitoring from multiple locations, detailed reporting dashboards and analytical data, and integration with pre-existing business tools.\nIf you have a business that's growing, you should also consider the scalability of the platform. The monitor should be able to accommodate your growing needs and not require you to make a provider switch.\nLastly, set a realistic budget depending on your purpose and feature needs. Then, find a solution that offers the best match between your budget and features, i.e., look for a solution offering most of the features you need within your budget.\nWhat is the difference between synthetic website monitoring and real user monitoring?\nSynthetic website monitoring takes place in a controlled environment where real user interaction paths are stimulated to check various aspects, such as page load speeds, clicks, or form submissions. This can help businesses identify key bottlenecks in their website design and APIs, which have been leading to lower customer clicks and interaction.\nReal user monitoring, on the other hand, uses data from real users to harness data like page load speeds, heatmaps, and customer interactions. This helps you to identify pain points based on real user data. You can then use synthetic monitoring to test and improve on those parts.\nHow we tested the best website monitoring software\nTo test the best website monitoring software, we first sign up and make an account so that we can access all of its features. Then, we run various tests such as page speed tests, uptime tests, and synthetic tests, such as API monitoring and RUM tests.\nWe evaluate how many websites the software checks, whether the alerting policies can be customized, and if the software offers testing from servers across the world. Apart from this, we set up regular monitors on various websites and take them down for a few minutes to check if the website monitor is able to detect and alert us of the downtime.\nWhat's more, we also test several third-party integrations to check if we\u2019re able to build seamless workflows. Lastly, we reach out to their customer support team with both basic and tricky queries. This helps us understand the promptness and accuracy of a provider\u2019s support wing.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

You can build and deploy different types of robots. The platform even comes with ready-made robots designed for various use cases, e.g., healthcare, finance, manufacturing, etc. A good example is using robots to process invoices and vendor payments and generate accounting reports.\nA good thing about UiPath is that you don\u2019t need deep coding experience to create robots on the platform. It offers a drag-and-drop interface to create robots by simply moving modules from one place to another. Your coding expertise still helps to create advanced robots, but it\u2019s not necessary, unlike with many rival RPA platforms.\nUiPath offers excellent customer support.

Microsoft System Center\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCloud computing is a major part of IT operations nowadays. Many enterprises are migrating from on-premise IT infrastructure to the cloud, and Microsoft Azure is one of the main cloud computing providers they choose.\nMicrosoft's System Center makes it easy to control and manage your IT infrastructure. You can manage all your Azure infrastructure from one place and automate a lot of tasks. For example, you can automatically monitor and troubleshoot your servers at specific periods to detect any issues before they morph into something more serious. You can allocate virtual machines depending on demand instead of renting unnecessary server space with hopes of future demand.\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t offer a free plan for System Center, which is a disadvantage. Pricing can also run up to thousands of dollars annually, which makes it suitable for large organizations with significant IT budgets.\nA good thing about System Center is that it also enables you to manage on-premise IT infrastructure (servers and PCs) and not just cloud-based ones only.\nBest IT automation tool FAQs\nHow to choose an IT automation platform\nCost\nCost is the first thing to consider when choosing any software. You need to choose something that you can afford in the long term. Pricing for automation tools usually depends on the number of tasks and how big your IT infrastructure is, so it should be easy to estimate how much you\u2019ll pay beforehand. Always read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs and check if there\u2019s a free trial to test the features before making your final decision.\nEase of use\nYour automation platform should be easy to use and navigate. It should have an intuitive interface that a layman can understand. Complex interfaces can frustrate users and cause costly mistakes.\nCustomer support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you\u2019ll need external help to solve your issues. Ensure you choose an IT automation platform with a solid reputation regarding customer service; check user reviews to confirm this. You should be able to contact a human support representative via email, telephone, or live chat when you need one. You should also have access to additional support resources such as user guides and video tutorials.\nEssential features of an IT automation tool\n1. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nRobotic process automation (RPA) entails building and deploying software robots to handle repetitive tasks. For example, you can build bots to scrape websites and extract contact information or create bots to process employee payroll based on the number of hours worked.\nYour IT automation platform should let you build RPA bots, preferably with a drag-and-drop interface.\n2. Incident management\nYou should be able to manage technical incidents with ease. Your tool should give automatic alerts whenever it detects an IT incident and contact the personnel assigned to that issue beforehand. This feature takes away a lot of stress during the inevitable IT incident.\n3. Endpoint management\nThe tool should enable IT staff to manage multiple devices connected to the enterprise network and automate many tasks. For example, you should be able to install software automatically on all connected devices. It could be a new software recommended by management or an update to an already installed software. You can also automatically check for viruses and security bugs and deploy fixes immediately.\nEndpoint management automation makes IT management much easier for everyone, especially in large organizations.\nHow we tested the best IT automation tools\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors.
