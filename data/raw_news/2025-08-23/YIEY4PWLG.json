  "title": "RoboForm: An Inexpensive and Reliable Way to Store Passwords and Passkeys",
  "description": "RoboForm is affordable, excels at core password management tasks, and includes lots of helpful tips, making it an excellent password manager for newbies.",
  "content": "RoboForm has browser extensions for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. It also offers desktop clients for Mac and Windows and apps for Android and iOS. To sign up, visit RoboForm's website or download one of the apps and create an account. Throughout the testing period, I was impressed with RoboForm's commitment to helping customers get the most out of the app. I kept noticing tips and hints for maintaining password hygiene sprinkled throughout. For example, if you tap or hover over a credential with a weak password, RoboForm offers instructions for changing the password in your vault and on the associated website, as well as video tutorials for all of the app's features to help people who are new to password managers. RoboForm can import credentials from Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera. The app can also import them from competing password managers, including 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane, Enpass, Kaspersky, Keeper, LastPass, Proton Pass, NordPass, True Key, and the now-defunct Myki app. Switching to RoboForm from your old password manager? You can also upload an unbranded CSV file saved from a different password management system.\n\nBefore I test a password manager, I send questions to the company about its privacy and security practices. I do this because I want you to have plenty of information about the companies handling your data. I included all the relevant information from RoboForm's responses to my questions below. Has your company ever had a security breach? What unencrypted information does the password manager store in user vaults? None. All user data inside the RoboForm account is encrypted, and we cannot access it. What is the company's policy regarding master passwords? Same as Personal/Premium by default, but admins can increase the complexity of their company's deployment. What is the company's policy regarding user data collection and data sales? We do not sell user data. How does your company respond to requests for user information from governments and law enforcement? Requests for user information must be for specific account(s) and be served to us through a court order. From there, we would review the request for validity and comply in accordance with US law. RoboForm's answers to my questions match the company's privacy policy. I encourage anyone looking for a new password manager to browse privacy policies to learn more about how companies collect, sell, or store user data.\n\nThough you need to designate a master password when you sign up, you don't have to enter it every time you log in. That's because RoboForm supports passwordless vault logins using either biometrics or a PIN on your mobile device. RoboForm can also generate a passkey that you keep on a hardware security key or other device and use to login instead of a password. After signing into your vault, click on Settings and then open the Login and Security menu to set up your multi-factor authentication (MFA) method. Activate the appropriate toggle in the MFA section, complete the provided instructions, and sign up. You can authenticate your identity using an authenticator app, email address (activated by default), a hardware security key, or SMS. I used Apple Passwords' built-in authenticator for my test account and logged in without any problems. Keep in mind that you can also use RoboForm as an authenticator app for your accounts. There's a form field for each vault credential for that account's MFA token. RoboForm provides password hygiene analysis in the Security Center, so you can tell if you're using the same one too often, or if your passwords are easily guessed or hacked. As I mentioned earlier in the review, I like that RoboForm provides actionable advice for improving your passwords within the Security Center and identifies duplicate or weak passwords in your vault. Since our last review, the app has added data breach monitoring, a welcome addition that's unfortunately limited to paid accounts. Many other password managers, like Dashlane, NordPass, and Proton Pass, also keep this vital online health checkup tool behind a paywall, so RoboForm isn't unusual. Bitwarden offers free data breach monitoring for all customers, which is ideal. RoboForm's data breach reports are from haveibeenpwned's database. I liked the amount of detail in each report. You can find out when a breach occurred, what types of data were taken, and some reports even mention the company's response.

Reports are divided into lists of critical or non-critical breaches. I recommend looking closely at both lists. Critical breaches involve a stolen password, while non-critical breaches can involve anything from your credit card data to your phone number and government ID information. You can reach this section by navigating to the Settings menu and opening Devices and Activity. Here, you'll find a list of all the devices authorized to access your RoboForm account, along with timestamped login activity. If you see a device you don't recognize or other suspicious activity, remove access and change your account password right away. Another feature new to RoboForm in 2025 is anti-phishing protection. This feature is enabled by default. Phishing scammers often buy commonly mistyped domains (like amaxon.com, for example) to trick people into giving them their credit card numbers or other personal information. When you're using the app or a browser extension, RoboForm will notify you if it appears that you're entering sensitive personal data or financial information on a website with a domain that doesn't match the one in your vault.\n\nI tested RoboForm using the web vault, the Chrome browser extension, the Android app, and the iOS app. The apps are easy to navigate. After I imported my test lists, buttons featuring icons for each login on the list appeared in the web vault, which is a nice touch. I've seen similar user interfaces in many mobile password manager apps, and RoboForm offers this highly accessible layout by default. If you prefer to use a file tree or you like the look of smaller icons, you can change the view by clicking on the view options on the right side of the window. You can switch to dark mode in the Account menu, which changes the background from light gray to black. I like that the traditional folder system view includes a column showing your password strength. If you hover your mouse over the password hygiene alert, RoboForm urges you to replace weak passwords with more complex credentials. Access to your logins, bookmarks, and any notes you create is via a menu on the left side of the screen. A menu at the bottom left lets you use a password generator, access RoboForm's authenticator, check your password hygiene via the Security Center, share passwords, and designate emergency access rules for your account. The RoboForm browser extension worked as expected in testing. I was able to access my imported passwords and log in to my test accounts with one click. Capturing existing credentials, generating new passwords, and saving new logins was also painless. You can choose how you want RoboForm to fill in your credentials. Navigate to the Settings menu in the browser extension or the web vault and visit the Autofill section. From there, you can decline to autofill the credentials, have RoboForm prompt you each time there's an opportunity to fill in a password, or choose for RoboForm to autofill without your input. Though it requires an extra step, I don't recommend auto-filling your credentials without notifications since criminals can deploy attacks that abuse the feature and steal your passwords, but it's nice to have options. Overall, I liked the browser extension's credential capture and replay system. Using the RoboForm password generator, users can set a password length of up to 512 characters and choose whether to include capital and lowercase letters, digits, hexadecimal characters, and symbols. The default password generation length with RoboForm is 22 characters. You can also create passphrases up to 8 words long that include capital letters and numbers. RoboForm recently added the ability to save passkeys in customer vaults, which is great. A passkey credential entry looks similar to a traditional username+password credential. As mentioned earlier in the review, you can also create a passkey and save it on a different device if you want to login to RoboForm without using your master password. RoboForm started as a form-filling utility, so it's not surprising that entering my information into RoboForm was easy. To store information that you'll frequently enter on web forms, like your address, banking details, business information, credit cards, car information, and passport number, click on your name within the vault dashboard to open the information type list. I had no trouble filling out forms around the web using the data stored in my vault. If you need to store other kinds of information in your vault, like a Wi-Fi password, your driver's license number, or your pet's birthday wish list, you can create small text documents in the SafeNotes section of the app. You can send and share SafeNotes to other RoboForm customers, but anyone else will need to sign up for a RoboForm account to view your SafeNotes. I'll dig into the differences between sending and sharing in the next section. Unlike many competing password managers, customers cannot store files in their RoboForm vault. For example, NordPass and Proton Pass upgraded the paid password management tiers to allow customers to upload files and keep them in vaults. File storage has been a long-running feature for Dashlane, and Keeper's Family plan includes 10 gigabytes of file storage. Paid account holders can share individual passwords, the aforementioned SafeNotes, and two folders of credentials. Sharing individual passwords with other RoboForm users is easy; just click on the three dots next to the vault entry, then choose Share. Enter the email address associated with the person's RoboForm account. If your intended recipient does not use RoboForm, enter their email address, and they will receive an email from RoboForm asking them to create a free account so that they can access the credentials. You can designate up to five recipients per login and remove access whenever you wish. Changing the password after you revoke access is probably wise so that other people can't continue to access the account. You cannot designate access levels when sharing individual credentials, which is not great. Shared Folders are handy if you have a friend or hobby group that shares credentials for some services, or if your family needs to share a few logins to pay bills or log into shared online accounts. You can choose to give people different levels of access to credentials within the folder. Your fellow RoboForm customer can either only use the credential to login, edit the credential, or get full access to the password. It's a clunky solution for password sharing. Other password managers make sharing credentials with family and friends a little easier. For example, in addition to in-app sharing, Keeper offers a One-Time Share option so customers can send passwords using Airdrop, QR codes, or SMS to other people who aren't using the same platform. If a stranger intercepts the link, it's useless; the password is only accessible from the device it was sent to. NordPass allows customers to designate expiration dates for shared passwords, so you don't have to worry about forgetting to revoke someone's access. You can also adjust individual permission levels for each credential, giving customers more power over who can access their logins.\n\nBusiness owners can sign up for a free trial to try out RoboForm's Business edition. After the trial ends, the service, though often discounted, costs $39.96 per year per user. The plan includes activity logs, dark web monitoring and alerts, password hygiene reports, password sharing, role-based access control, single sign-on (SSO) integration, customizable security policies, and other business-focused features. RoboForm also offers enterprise-level password management for large businesses. Both plans include a dedicated account manager and priority customer support. After logging into my admin account, I added a test account to my fake company to see the kind of access an admin has with RoboForm. I like that you can designate group-based credential access, and generating reports for specific users or groups of employees is very helpful. Admins can also restrict access to the corporate RoboForm account to certain IPs, so employees can only access certain credentials while they're in the office or at their home office. Admins can also protect company data by limiting employees' exporting and importing capabilities within the app and blocking RoboForm use on certain apps or websites. The Business features are very helpful; however, I have one little privacy quibble with the dark web monitoring feature\u2014there's invasive potential here. As an admin, I could see all of the details of my fake, hapless employees' data breach reports, which is fine if they're using a work email address, but if you have contractors on staff, or anyone else who is using an email address that they also use for personal accounts, well, you're liable to know more than you want to know about your employees' online habits over the years.",

The review highlights its strong privacy stance\u2014no unencrypted data stored, no data sales, and government requests handled via court orders\u2014while noting that some advanced features like breach monitoring and dark\u2011web alerts are paid only. Users can import credentials from many other managers, share passwords and SafeNotes with other RoboForm users, and use multi\u2011factor authentication via authenticator apps, email, hardware keys, or SMS. Business plans start at $39.96 per user per year and add role\u2011based access, SSO, activity logs, and admin controls, though the reviewer cautions about potential privacy concerns with dark\u2011web monitoring. Overall, RoboForm is praised for its usability, comprehensive security tools, and helpful onboarding resources, but some limitations include lack of file storage and a paywall for certain monitoring features.",
