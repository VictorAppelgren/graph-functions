  "content": "Aug. 11\u2014Update, 8:50 a.m. Monday: As of 7:30 a.m., the National Weather Service said that Suicide Basin is now full to capacity.\n\nMonitoring devices \"continue to show indications of over-topping the ice dam with icebergs being pulled towards the overflow channel and very little new water rise,\" the alert said. Those indications mean the basin is at full capacity; in the past it has taken up to six days for outburst flooding to begin, the agency said.\n\nUniversity of Alaska Southeast environmental science professor Eran Hood recalled that it was a sunny summer day in 2011 when an unexpected and potentially perilous situation began to unfold.\n\nThe Mendenhall River, which flows through one of Juneau's most populous residential areas, was rapidly and unexpectedly rising.\n\n\"No one knew what was going on, why the river was going up and up and up to one of the highest flows ever measured,\" he said.\n\nHood boarded a helicopter to investigate. Flying over the glaciers at the head of the Mendenhall River, he saw collapsed ice and stranded icebergs in a basin between the Mendenhall Glacier and one of its smaller tributaries, Suicide Glacier. That indicated water had just drained as a glacial dam released and caused the flood.\n\nBack then, the basin wasn't monitored and the outburst wasn't predicted, Hood said.\n\n\"Should've been, but it wasn't,\" he said. \"And we've been working to understand it ever since then.\"\n\nSuicide Glacier, located in a side valley above Mendenhall Glacier, left a growing void between them as it retreated over the years. The shrinking glacier left a meltwater-collecting tub of bedrock, dammed on the downhill side by the Mendenhall Glacier's wall of ice.\n\nIn 2011, the basin held enough water to generate the pressure needed to lift the Mendenhall Glacier's ice and release water into its icy channels toward Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River downstream.\n\nThe 2011 event caused little damage, but since then the basin has refilled and partially drained dozens of times. Two years ago, the situation became much more serious when the basin began emptying nearly completely. For the past two summers, properties in the Mendenhall Valley have experienced destructive flooding.\n\nThe phenomenon, known as a j\u00f6kulhlaup, is not rare. Glacier lake outbursts happen in dozens of other places around Alaska, Hood said. What is unique is the city-adjacent location of Suicide Basin.\n\n\"This is kind of like the one place in Alaska that there's a tremendous amount of infrastructure and a large basin going into a river,\" he said.\n\n[Previously: 'It happened so fast': Speed and scale of Juneau flooding caught residents by surprise]\n\nExperts from UAS, the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Weather Service and others have joined forces to study the situation since it first occurred. Greater public attention came in 2023, when homes were washed away on the banks of the Mendenhall River. A year ago, widespread damage followed Suicide Basin's biggest outburst yet.\n\nNow Juneau is bracing once more. This year, miles of HESCO flood barriers were installed to contain the next outburst, an \"interim\" solution devised by Juneau officials and the Army Corps of Engineers. Many agencies have collaborated to prepare to respond.\n\n\"This basin is probably the most closely monitored glacial lake in the world,\" said Ryan O'Shaughnessy, emergency manager for the City and Borough of Juneau. \"There's a lot of very high-tech monitoring and very capable and smart people watching that basin 24/7.\"\n\nStill, experts say much remains unpredictable. The Daily News spoke with experts in hydrology, glacier science and disaster planning to examine what's known \u2014 and not known \u2014 as the water level inches higher.\n\nEarly Monday, the National Weather Service said in an update that the basin is now full to capacity.\n\nAs of Saturday, the water level was 1,358 feet, just 10 feet shy of the point at which water will overtop the ice of the Mendenhall Glacier. The water level is rising about 4-5 feet a day, according to National Weather Service reports.\n\nExactly what will happen when the water reaches the 1,368-foot height of the basin is hard to say for certain, but recent history is the best guide. In recent years, the basin's release has begun within four to six days of the water level reaching the top of the ice, according to Aaron Jacobs, senior service hydrologist and a meteorologist for the National Weather Service.\n\nBut there's no guarantee the timing will play out that way. The buoyancy of the ice and hydrostatic pressure \u2014 pressure exerted by fluid at rest, such as water behind an ice dam \u2014 affect the release in ways that are hard to pinpoint because what's happening on the underside of the glacier can't be seen, Jacobs said.\n\n\"We don't quite understand that, the whole triggering aspect,\" he said. \"We're just using the past to understand what we can see in the future.\"\n\nIn years prior to 2023, the outburst began prior to water reaching the overtopping point, Hood said.\n\n\"It can release any day now,\" he said.\n\nWhat happens when an outburst begins?\n\nFlood forecasters like Jacobs factor how much water the basin holds, how much of it will be released, and how quickly it will drain downstream. More is known about the first variable than the others.\n\n\"If we match the water elevation with the known shape, we can calculate the volume quite accurately,\" Hood said.\n\nFor more than a decade, scientists have been armed with information from various USGS-installed sensors.\n\nUAS-led research, which is funded primarily by the USGS Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center, has included mapping the exposed area of the basin since 2018. A much fuller picture of the basin's volume wasn't revealed until 2023. That's when it first began to drain from top to bottom, allowing researchers to capture the shape of the bedrock with drones before it refilled with water.\n\nJacobs said Suicide Basin released 15 billion gallons in 2023 and 16 billion in 2024. The current estimates of its volume?\n\n\"It's very similar to last year's. It might be a little bit more,\" Jacobs said.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean this year's flooding will be just like last year's or even worse. All the water is not certain to reach the river below in one flush. If it does, it could drain slightly faster than in years prior, because friction from the moving water can enlarge the channels through the glacier ice, Hood said. It could drain slower, too.\n\n\"That changes every single year,\" Jacobs said. \"The glacier's always moving and these conduits open and close with that head pressure.\"\n\nPartial drainage remains a possible outcome as well.\n\n\"Because we can't see underneath the glacier to the plumbing, and we can't see the drain hole because there's so many icebergs that block over it, we don't know exactly why in the past it used to drain partway and stop,\" said Hood.\n\nJacobs said the current forecast involves expecting water to release from top to bottom at a rate similar to last year's flooding event. But he's poised for quick adjustments. Once the release begins, the rate of rise of Mendenhall Lake, which feeds the river, will provide information about how fast the water is emptying from the basin.\n\n\"After 24 hours of information, we will be able to really see that rate of rise and know if we need to pivot, if we have to go higher or go lower,\" he said.\n\nO'Shaughnessy, Juneau's emergency manager, said residents are understandably stressed as the release event nears. \"Last year we saw massive inundation of the neighborhoods along the Mendenhall River,\" he said.\n\nPreparedness has been enhanced in significant ways, he said. This year, flood barriers were installed along miles of the Mendenhall River. The structures, essentially large cage-reinforced sand blocks, line the east bank of the river and are intended to protect against flooding up to 18 feet, according to a City and Borough of Juneau webpage. Many residents who last year had river views in their backyard now see a stout wall of sand, steel and thick green fabric.\n\n\"We're very, very confident in the HESCO barriers, but they haven't been tested,\" O'Shaughnessy said. \"They're a man-made structure. We're talking about forces of nature and a lot of water moving really fast. We can't say with absolute certainty that they will work.\"\n\nOrganizational improvements are less visible but also vital, he said.\n\n\"We've been planning for months to activate a unified command,\" O'Shaughnessy said. The team includes representatives from the City and Borough of Juneau, Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, and the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. Several other agencies play a role in operations, logistics, finance and planning tasks.\n\n\"The reality is no single one of these agencies has the resources to adequately support a 24/7 incident command structure, but together we do,\" he said.\n\nO'Shaughnessy said alerts and information will reach the public in several ways. The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, or IPAWS, managed by FEMA, will push urgent messages to mobile phones in the region and interrupt broadcasts on television and radio. O'Shaughnessy said that will happen only at crucial stages such as when the water overtops the ice and when the basin begins to release.\n\nAdditionally, residents can sign up for a greater number of update messages about the flood situation through the city's website. Once the basin is full, the unified command will operate a hotline staffed by trained volunteers with the latest evacuation and flood preparedness and response information\n\nCentral to the preparation effort is the plan for evacuation of Mendenhall Valley residents. That eventuality is a near-certainty, O'Shaughnessy said.\n\n\"Because we have seen it repeatedly release rapidly and we have seen it repeatedly cause catastrophic damage, we are not going to take any chances,\" O'Shaughnessy said. \"When the basin begins to release, we will issue a notice to evacuate.\"\n\nEvery house in the evacuation area will receive a door-hanging card directing them to emergency resources and more information. He encourages residents to think in terms of \"ready, set, go.\"\n\n\"When the basin becomes full, that's when we will move into a 'set' phase,\" he said. \"That's when folks should have a go bag by the door, have their prescriptions and some clothes and dog food. And have a plan, right, for where the vehicle is going to go, where are we going to stay?\"\n\nThe \"set\" phase is expected to last up to six days, which typically has been the time between when the basin is full and when the release begins. When that release starts, it's \"go\" time. \"Though it takes one or two days before the river crests to its peak from an outburst flood, it's important that residents not wait for that,\" O'Shaughnessy said.\n\nAt a media briefing on Friday, city and state officials described the danger associated with driving through flood water, entering exclusion zones or climbing atop HESCO barriers. All could prove deadly and, in turn, expose rescuers to risk.\n\n\"Once the basin begins to release, please leave the neighborhood,\" O'Shaughnessy said. \"Our No. 1 priority is to protect life and safety. We're very confident in the HESCO barriers, but we're not willing to bet it with people's lives.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced a preemptive disaster declaration to \"position state resources and personnel in advance to support local and tribal governments in their efforts to protect lives, homes, and essential services.\"\n\nWhat does the future hold for the Mendenhall Valley?\n\nThe good news is that this pattern will end one day. \"The glacier will recede to the point that it no longer blocks off the basin. At that point, there's no more flood,\" Hood said.\n\nBut it will be a dynamic situation until then. Changing factors may include the shrinking height of the ice wall holding the basin's water back, melting icebergs in the basin that add water that reaches the river, and the expansion of the basin into the main glacier.\n\n\"We have all these competing processes, and if we can model them effectively, we can get to a reasonable understanding of what the upper limit might be,\" he said.\n\nHood said typically glacier outburst flooding is a phenomenon measured in decades.\n\n\"It's a good bet that this is going to keep happening for the next 20 to 30 years,\" he said.\n\nO'Shaughnessy said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is studying the situation to inform ways to mitigate the impact of outburst flooding in a more lasting way.\n\n\"It is possible that we're several years from a long-term solution,\" he said.\n\nIn the meantime, O'Shaughnessy urges area residents to sign up for emergency alerts and to heed them when they're issued.\n\nHere are a few other ways to learn more and monitor the status of Suicide Basin and the Mendenhall River:",

  "summary": "The National Weather Service has reported that Suicide Basin, a glacial outburst flooding basin in Juneau, is now full to capacity. This follows a similar incident in 2011 when the Mendenhall River suddenly began rising due to an unexpected and potentially perilous situation. The National Weather Services reported that monitoring devices indicate that the basin is now over-topping, with icebergs being pulled towards the overflow channel and little new water rising. This is not the first time this type of outburst flooding has occurred, with it taking up to six days for it to begin. Experts from the University of Alaska Southeast have been studying the situation since it first occurred and have been monitoring the basin for several years. The water level is now at 1,358 feet, just 10 feet shy of the point at which water will overtop the ice dam.",
