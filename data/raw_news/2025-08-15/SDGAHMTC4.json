  "content": "Trista and Ryan Sutter's kids are (almost) all grown up!\n\nThe mom of two, 52, shared an emotional video on Instagram on Thursday, Aug. 14 as she celebrated her daughter Blakeley's first day of junior year and her son Maxwell's first day of senior year. Trista included photos of her kids' first days of school throughout the year, starting in kindergarten and ending with a sweet clip of the two together.\n\n\"It just goes too fast. \ud83e\udd79,\" Trista wrote in her caption. \"Junior year for Blakesley Grace and the last, first day for our senior (what?!!! \ud83d\ude2d), Maxwell Alston.\" \"I love you both to the moon and back to the moon and back to the moon and back to infinity and beyond and I cannot wait to see what this year has in store for you both (but I\u2019m putting in a request for time to slow down. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc),\" she said.\n\n Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\nTrista and her husband Ryan got engaged in 2003 during the finale episode of Trista's Bachelorette season. They went on to welcome son Maxwell in 2007 and daughter Blakeley in 2009.\n\nLast August, the former star told her followers that some parents demonstrate her \"biggest pet peeve\" while supporting their kids at sporting events .\n\nAs she revealed that her son Max has hockey games scheduled all weekend, and she will spend the Labor Day holiday cheering him on from the bleachers, Trista took the opportunity to share something that bothers her about other parents at kids' sports events.\n\n\"One of my biggest pet peeves is each game there's a home team and an away team,\" Trista explained. \"I always sit on whichever team our team is on. So if they're the home team for that game I sit on the home side, if they're the away team then I sit on the away side.\"\n\n\"Seems easy, right?\" the mom-of-two said, before venting about how not every parent shares this logic.\n\n\"But there are parents that just don't feel the same and they sit on whatever side they want, and it drives me nuts,\" Trista continued. \"I'm like, 'Why can't you sit on your team's side?'\"\n\n\"Does this drive anyone else crazy, or am I just loopy and have nothing else better to do?\" she said with a laugh, adding a question box for her followers to respond.\n\nThat previous April, Trista shared a carousel of images on Easter Sunday , in which she posed alongside her family of four. In other images, the couple could be seen with extended family members at a church service, and in one, just Trista and Ryan posed for a selfie in the sun.\n\n\"Thankful for the gifts of life and love, family near and far, friends new and old, and moments of connection and joy,\" Trista captioned the images. \"Happy Easter!\"",

Fresh off of being dumped by the original Bachelor Alex Michel, Trista (then Trista Rehn) became the first Bachelorette in 2003. It was there that she met and fell in love with Ryan, a firefighter. The two got married in a televised ceremony in December 2003. Seventeen years later, they're still together and live in Colorado with their son Max, 12, and daughter Blakesley, 11. After Monday's episode of ABC's retrospective series, The Bachelor: The Greatest Seasons \u2014 Ever!, looked back on their journey, the couple made a virtual appearance on Good Morning America on Tuesday. Eugene Gologursky/Getty The Bachelor and Bachelorette Couples \u2014 Who Made Their Love Last? Trista, 47, said she remains \"very, very, very grateful\" that Michel didn't choose her. But despite their success story, Ryan, 45, admitted he still can't watch his wife's season of the show. \"Always been really uncomfortable for me,\" he said. \"First of all, I don't like watching myself on television. I also don't like watching my wife kiss other guys on TV, so.\" The couple also revealed that their kids are starting to get an inkling of who their parents are. \"I remember Blakesley, one time, she was like, 'Are we famous?'\" Ryan recalled. \"And you're trying to explain to her that people know who you are, but we're not really famous.\" As for the future of the franchise? Both are looking forward to Clare Crawley's upcoming season of The Bachelorette, followed by Matt James' debut as the first black Bachelor. \"I'm really excited,\" Trista said. \"It's about time. I am in full support of more diversity in The Bachelor and The Bachelorette \u2014 the whole franchise.\" And Crawley is the \"perfect lead,\" she added. \"There are still people out there who want to jump to judgment about why a woman would do this,\" she said. \"I think that Clare is the perfect lead because she's really strong an intelligent, and she's going to fight for what she deserves.\" The Bachelor: The Greatest Seasons \u2014 Ever! returns July 20 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
