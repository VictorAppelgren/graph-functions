  "title": "Court Ruling Against Tariffs Adds Fresh Dose Of Uncertainty To Economic Outlook",
  "description": "Last week, a judge ruled that most of President Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal, setting up a showdown in the Supreme Court. That leaves the future of Trump's trade wars once again up in the air.",
  "content": "\u2022 A court ruling against President Donald Trump's tariffs last week created new unanswered questions about the future of U.S. trade policy.\n\u2022 If the Supreme Court upholds last week's decision, about 75% of Trump's far-reaching import taxes would be invalidated, and the government could even have to pay back tariffs already charged.\n\u2022 Uncertainty about the tariffs has caused companies to delay major investments and hiring, dragging the economy to the brink of a recession, according to some economists.\n\n\n\nJust when you thought President Donald Trump's trade policy was becoming more predictable, a court ruling has created new uncertainty about the future of U.S. trade policy.\n\n\n\nThe latest twist came Friday when an appeals court ruled that Trump could not impose import taxes using emergency presidential powers under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. Since taking office for the second time, Trump has used that law to authorize most of the sweeping tariffs he has declared this year.\n\nThe ruling allowed the tariffs already in place to continue at least through Oct. 14, giving the White House time to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, as widely expected.\n\nWhat Does the Tariff Ruling Mean For The Economy?\n\nThe court battle affects 75% of the wide-ranging tariffs Trump has imposed over the last few months, according to an analysis by economists at UBS.\n\nShould the Supreme Court overturn the tariffs, it could deal a setback to Trump's controversial ratcheting of import taxes to their highest since the 1930s. And with such a large portion of the nation's trade policy at stake, uncertainty is once again in the air for businesses and individuals making decisions about how to invest or spend money.\n\nThe decision \"adds yet another layer of tariff uncertainty to kick off September,\" Shelly Kaushik, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a commentary.\n\n\n\nUncertainty about tariffs has been a major force in the economy over the last few months. Tariffs affect a multitude of business decisions with potential long-term consequences, including where manufacturers buy materials and parts; how many people employers hire; and where companies may choose to build factories. Economists have said uncertainty about Trump's often-unpredictable trade policy has led to a hiring slowdown that risks dragging the economy into a recession.\n\n\n\nThe uncertainty has also affected interest rates. Officials at the Federal Reserve have held the central bank's key fed funds rate steady this year while waiting to see how the tariff campaign will play out. The Fed's reluctance to cut rates has kept borrowing costs on all kinds of loans higher than they otherwise might be.\n\n\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said he believes uncertainty about tariffs and Trump's immigration policies has pushed the economy to the brink of a recession.\n\n\n\n\"Most of the damage so far is just the uncertainty that they've created and which has caused businesses, [and] the Federal Reserve, to kind of sit on their hands,\" he told Newsweek in an interview published Tuesday. \"And one reason why we have this hiring freeze is just businesses don't know how these policies are going to play out and what it means for them.\"\n\n\n\nStocks fell Tuesday amid the fresh uncertainty about tariffs.",

      "text": "Stocks lost ground Tuesday as trading in September got underway amid fresh uncertainty about tariffs.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.6%, while the S&P 500 (SPX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Each of the major indexes finished the session well off their lows for the day. Stocks were coming off a down session on Friday ahead of yesterday's Labor Day break, though major indexes managed to post gains in August for the fourth straight month.\nInvestors are preparing for several reports on the labor market, with the big event coming Friday, when the August jobs report is set to be released. The employment data will be closely monitored by the Federal Reserve as it considers whether to cut interest rates at its next policy meeting in two weeks. Market participants have been pricing in the likelihood that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate this month for the first time in 2025.\nMeanwhile, a federal appeals court late Friday ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority in imposing \"reciprocal\" tariffs on trading partners around the world. While the tariffs will remain in effect until mid-October as the Trump administration appeals the ruling to the Supreme Court, the news sparked uncertainty about trade policy after several weeks of relative calm on that front.\nShares of the world's largest technology companies, which led the downturn on Friday, were mostly lower today. Chip giant and AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) declined 2%, while Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were each down more than 1%. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta Platforms (META) retreated less than 1%, while chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), which is due to report earnings later this week, closed slightly higher after spending most of the day in negative territory.\nChip stocks were broadly under pressure. Arm Holdings (ARM) fell more than 4%, while Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA Corp. (KLAC) each gave up about 3%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) closed 1% lower after sliding 3% at the open.\nKraft Heinz (KHC) tumbled 7% to lead S&P 500 decliners after the company announced that it would split in two, undoing the merger of two consumer giants a decade ago.\nShares of PepsiCo (PEP) finished the day 1% higher after rising as much as 6% early in the session following news that activist investor Elliott Investment Management had taken a stake of about $4 billion in the beverages and snacks company.\nGold prices hit a record high today as some investors turned to the traditional safe haven amid the increased volatility in stocks and uncertainty about tariffs. Gold futures were up 2.4% at about $3,600 an ounce recently, giving shares of Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Mining (B) a boost today.\nWest Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, climbed 2.5% to $65.60 per barrel and were trading at their highest levels in a month.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of loans, notably mortgages, was at 4.27% in late-afternoon trading, up from 4.23% at Friday's close, amid the renewed uncertainty about tariffs.\nThe U.S. dollar index, which measures the performance of the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, rose 0.6% to 98.33.\nBitcoin was at $111,400, up from a low of around $107,500 this morning. The digital currency has been under pressure since surging to an all-time high above $124,000 less than three weeks ago.\nBiggest S&P 500 Movers on Tuesday\nDecliners\n- Shares of Kraft Heinz (KHC) tumbled 7%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock, after the packaged food giant announced a plan to separate its North American grocery business from its sauces and spreads unit. The grocery business includes Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables, while the larger sauce-focused company will remain the home of Heinz ketchup, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese. The announcement of the split-up, which the company expects to close in the second half of 2026, came a decade after the megamerger between Kraft and Heinz created one of the world's largest food companies.\n- Alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) cut its adjusted profit guidance, citing tariff impacts and slumping beer demand. The maker of the Modelo and Corona beer brands now anticipates a 2% to 4% decline in beer sales in fiscal 2026 as macroeconomic uncertainty weighs on consumer spending. Constellation Brands shares sank 6.6% on Tuesday.\n- Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium miner, lost 6.3%. Baird analysts raised their price target on Albemarle stock ahead of the holiday weekend, highlighting a recovery in lithium prices following capacity cuts by a major producer in China. However, Baird maintained its \"underperform\" rating on Albemarle stock, citing limited visibility into the dynamics of the lithium market and uncertainty surrounding Chinese government policy.\nDecliners\n- Shares of beauty products retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped 8.1%, notching the S&P 500's top daily performance to claw back the heavy losses posted Friday at the end of a volatile week of trading. Ahead of the holiday weekend, Barclays analysts raised their price target on Ulta shares, pointing to the cosmetic company's strong second-quarter results as well as positive strategic initiatives under CEO Kecia Steelman, who took the reins at Ulta at the beginning of 2025.\n- Biogen (BIIB) received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for an injectable version of Leqembi, a treatment for Alzheimer's disease produced by the biotech company in collaboration with Japanese pharmaceutical firm Esai. Whereas patients previously needed to travel to an infusion center for a time-consuming process twice per month, Leqembi can be taken at home via a weekly under-the-skin injection. Biogen shares jumped 5.6% on Tuesday.\n- Shares of fashion company Ralph Lauren (RL) advanced 4.8% to reach an all-time closing high. The company received a boost last week when a dress made by Ralph Lauren was featured in engagement photos released by the superstar recording artist Taylor Swift.\nHistory Says 'Sell in September,' Wall Street Says 'Keep Buying'\nSeptember is historically the worst month of the year for stocks, with the S&P 500\u2014and its precursor indexes before 1957\u2014falling more than 1% on average since 1928.\nThis September, investors are contending with trade uncertainty, elevated inflation, a weakening job market, and President Trump's threats to central bank independence.\nStill, experts point to strong earnings growth, impending interest rate cuts, and healthy AI demand as reasons to be bullish in the long term.\nRead the full article here.\nMusk Sees 80% of Tesla Revenue Coming From Robots\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has long touted humanoid robots as key to the electric vehicle maker's future. Now he's putting a number on its value.\nIn a post on his X social media platform Monday, Musk said \"~80% of Tesla's value will be Optimus\" humanoid robots. He didn't state when he expects that to happen in the post, made soon after the company published its latest \"Master Plan,\" which featured Optimus for the first time.\nOptimus \"is changing not only the perception of labor itself but its availability and capability,\" Tesla said in its \"Master Plan Part IV,\" though the robots have yet to be sold to customers.\nMusk has previously suggested the robots, which are expected to cost between $20,000 and $30,000, could be sold to other companies as soon as next year, with sales to consumers set to follow after that.\nThe robots are already performing some \"simple factory tasks\" for Tesla, according to the CEO, who has said he expects \"thousands\" of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of 2025, and that the company could produce 1 million robots a year by 2030. During the company's second-quarter earnings call in July, Musk said \"it'll probably be prototypes of Optimus 3 end of this year and then scale production next year,\" according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense.\nMeanwhile, Tesla's core EV business continues to struggle. Its second-quarter revenue dropped 12% year-over-year to $22.5 billion, worse than expected, and Musk warned the company could have a \"few rough quarters\" ahead, with the expiration of EV tax credits later this month likely to weigh on demand, after President Trump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" into law in July.\nTesla shares shed more than 1% on Tuesday amid a broader tech sell-off.\nGold Price Levels to Watch as Precious Metal Hits New Highs\nThe price of gold (XAUUSD) surged to an all-time high Tuesday, gaining ground for the sixth straight session, amid renewed tariff uncertainty and expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon.\nSpot gold was up 1.8% at $3,540 an ounce on Tuesday afternoon. The precious metal has gained about 35% since the start of the year, supported by global central bank buying, tensions in the Middle East, and economic uncertainty.\nGold\u2019s price consolidated within a five-month symmetrical triangle before breaking out from the pattern on Friday, potentially laying the groundwork for a continuation move higher.\nWhile the relative strength index moves toward overbought levels to signal strong price momentum, the indicator remains below 75, a reading that has coincided with minor retracements in the commodity after strong trending periods.\nImportantly, increasing trading volume has accompanied recent buying in the precious metal, indicating heightened investor interest.\nThe measured move technique projects a bullish price target of $3,930 per ounce. Investors should also watch key support levels on gold's chart around $3,430 and $3,150.\nRead the full technical analysis piece here.\nUBS Sees Chip Stock Slump as Buying Opportunity\nSemiconductor stocks are taking a bite out of U.S. indexes to start September, but for some bulls on Wall Street, that could mean it's time to buy.\n\"We recommend that investors who are underallocated to equities consider phasing in and using market dips to add exposure to preferred areas,\" UBS analysts said Tuesday, with tech and AI plays among their favorites, while chip stocks dragged on the sector to start the week.\nNvidia (NVDA) was one of the worst-performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Tuesday afternoon, with shares down nearly 3%. Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down nearly 2%.\nSome investors could be worried about September's reputation as a tough month for stocks\u2014but that shouldn't discourage them, according to UBS analysts. That's because October and November tend to be strong months for U.S. stocks, they said, with average S&P 500 returns over the past decade of 1.2% and 4%, respectively. Buying in September could help investors position themselves for better performance in the months that follow.\nUBS also pointed to strong earnings in the second quarter, a robust outlook for AI demand, and expectations of a rate cut later this month as reasons supporting their optimism in the tech sector.\n\"Alongside AI, power and resources, and longevity, we favor US technology, health care, utilities, and financials,\" the analysts said.\nKlarna Revives U.S. IPO With Plan to Raise $1.27B\nFintech firm Klarna and its backers are raising as much as $1.27 billion from an initial public offering, as the buy now, pay later (BNPL) company makes a renewed attempt to go public in New York.\nKlarna paused its planned IPO days after President Donald Trump's sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announcement disrupted markets in early April. It had the previous month filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, applying to list on the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol \"KLAR.\"\nThe Swedish fintech said on Tuesday it was aiming to price the sale of a total of 34.3 million shares at between $35 and $37 each.\nThe IPO is coming to a market that has been booming, with shares of design software platform Figma (FIG) more than tripling on its debut at the end of July and shares of Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) soaring on their debut last month. U.S. IPO volumes so far this year have reached $41.58 billion, according to Dealogic data, the highest since the same period in 2021, when it hit a record $229.51 billion.\nStill, Klarna's valuations have dropped in recent years. Klarna said it was valued at $6.7 billion in July 2022, down sharply from $45.6 billion barely a year earlier, and is now worth between $12.5 billion and $14 billion, according to the Financial Times. Klarna's major BNPL competitors include Affirm (AFRM), Block's (XYZ) Afterpay, and PayPal (PYPL).\nWhat Nvidia's Earnings Could Mean for Other Chipmakers\nAs one of the primary beneficiaries of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) stock has become a bellwether for industry, with its quarterly results last week offering some clues about what to expect from Broadcom (AVGO) later this week, and other chipmakers.\nNvidia's earnings came in just ahead of Wall Street's estimates last week, disappointing the lofty expectations of many investors. Analysts remain confident in demand for its AI hardware, though worries about China sales and geopolitical issues have weighed on the stock.\nShares of Nvidia were down more than 3% in recent trading, and Broadcom shares slipped 0.5%, as chip stocks extended last week's declines, weighing on the major indexes.\nAI chipmaker Broadcom, which Oppenheimer analysts have called the \"No. 2 AI franchise\" after Nvidia, is set to report its fiscal third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, and could face some similar challenges related to its large exposure to China\u2014as well as benefit from AI tailwinds.\nLike Nvidia, Broadcom derives a significant chunk of its sales from China, with the country accounting for roughly a fifth of Broadcom's revenue in its fiscal 2024, though that's declined from almost a third in 2023.\nBroadcom also claims some of the same Big Tech AI clients Nvidia does, including Meta Platforms (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), with their commitments to hefty AI spending expected to benefit the chipmaker. Citi analysts suggested last week Broadcom could also have plans with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Apple (AAPL) in its pipeline.\nThe Citi analysts have a \"buy\" rating and $315 price target for the stock, which finished Friday's session around $297. Despite recent losses, it has added more than one-quarter of its value since the start of the year. Oppenheimer expects Broadcom could have even further to climb, with a $325 target, still well below a Street high of $350, according to Visible Alpha.\nHeading into the results, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom's stock, anticipating rising sales and profits. All of the 10 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha give it a \"buy\" or equivalent rating.\nConstellation Brands Stock Drops on Weak Beer Demand\nConstellation Brands (STZ) shares fell Tuesday after the alcoholic beverage giant cut its outlook on falling demand for beer and the impact of tariffs.\nThe maker of Modelo Especial and Corona said it now sees fiscal 2026 comparable, or adjusted, earnings per share of $11.30 to $11.60, versus the earlier guidance of $12.60 to $12.90.\nThe company expects beer sales to fall 2% to 4%, and beer operating income to sink 7% to 9%. Its prior estimate for sales was flat to 3% growth, and operating income of flat to 2% higher. Constellation blames the change in sales on \"incremental macroeconomic headwinds affecting consumer demand,\" and operating income on \"lower volumes, operating deleveraging, and additional tariffs.\"\nCEO Bill Newlands said the company has been navigating a \"challenging macroeconomic environment that has dampened consumer demand and led to more volatile consumer purchasing behavior since our first quarter.\" Newlands noted that \"over the last several months, high-end beer buy rates decelerated sequentially, as both trip frequency and spend per trip declined,\" especially among Hispanic consumers.\nCFO Garth Hankinson added that in the current quarter, Constellation Brands anticipates \"inventory rebalancing at the distributor level to reflect softer consumer trends, and to occur earlier than is typical for our Beer Business.\"\nShares of Constellation Brands were down 7% recently, trading at their lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020.\nU.S.-listed shares of Budweiser parent Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and shares of Sam Adams maker The Boston Beer Company (SAM) were each down about 2%.\nKraft Heinz to Break Up a Decade After Merger\nKraft Heinz (KHC) is planning to break up into two companies, undoing a merger that is just a decade old by splitting its North American grocery business from its sauces and spreads operation, which includes Philadelphia cream cheese.\nThe grocery business, dubbed \u201cNorth American Grocery Co.\u201d for now, includes Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables and would be led by current company CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera. It had around $10.4 billion in 2024 net sales.\nThe bigger \u201cGlobal Taste Elevation Co.\u201d will house Heinz, Philadelphia, and Kraft Mac & Cheese. It chalked up $15.4 billion in 2024 net sales, approximately 75% of which came from spreads, seasonings, and sauces.\n\u201cKraft Heinz\u2019s brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\u201d Kraft Heinz Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said. \u201cBy separating into two companies, we can allocate the right level of attention and resources to unlock the potential of each brand to drive better performance and the creation of long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nThe companies' megamerger in 2015 created one of the world's leading food makers, known for brands like Philadelphia cream cheese, Cool Whip, Maxwell House coffee, and Stove Top stuffing. It said it expects the split to close in the second half of 2026.\nThe company said in May that it has been exploring potential transactions to unlock shareholder value and in July, The Wall Street Journal reported the company was planning a breakup.\nKraft Heinz shares were down about 5% in recent trading. The stock has lost nearly 14% since the start of 2025.\nPepsiCo Stock Rises as Elliott Takes Stake\nShares of PepsiCo (PEP) surged early Tuesday as activist investor Elliott Investment Management announced it has taken a large stake in the soft drink and snack giant, and is pushing for changes to lift the stock price.\nElliott said that it has acquired a $4 billion stake in Pepsi, and sent a presentation and letter to the board that set out a \"unique opportunity to re-accelerate growth and boost financial performance through greater focus, improved operations, strategic reinvestment and enhanced accountability.\"\nThe investor argued that the company's recent performance \"has been marked by a series of strategic and operational challenges,\" adding that those have led to \"poor financial results, sharp stock-price underperformance and a highly dislocated valuation.\"\nElliott said its proposals could boost the share price by \"more than 50%,\" and it wants to collaborate with management to \"return PepsiCo to its rightful place as a market-leading consumer packaged goods (CPG) powerhouse with superior results and impact.\"\nWith this morning's gain, PepsiCo shares have inched back into positive territory for 2025.\nMajor Index Futures Point to Sharply Lower Open\nFutures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.8%.\nS&P 500 futures fell 1%.\nNasdaq 100 futures dropped 1.3%."

      "text": "Key Takeaways\n- The latest string of tariff announcements from President Donald Trump has created more confusion about what the U.S. trade policy will be in the coming months and years.\n- A major question is whether his new Aug. 1 deadline for the U.S. to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs on multiple trading partners will hold firm.\n- One trade expert said that after two extensions, Trump can no longer afford to delay imposing the tariffs any longer without losing credibility.\nYou're in good company if you're confused about what import taxes the U.S. plans to charge its trading partners in the coming months. Experts and laypeople alike have been blindsided by the dizzying stream of tariff announcements from the White House in recent days.\nThe latest twist in President Donald Trump's trade war came this week when he announced that his July 9 deadline for higher tariffs on multiple countries would be delayed until Aug. 1. He originally said the new deadline was not firm, then posted the opposite on social media, declaring that \"No extensions will be granted.\"\nThe on-again, off-again tariff announcements have baffled even experts who are optimistic about the prospects for the outcome of the trade wars Trump launched when he took office.\nJames Mohs, a professor of accounting at the University of New Haven, told Investopedia he thought Trump's campaign of steeply raising import taxes had a good chance of accomplishing one of its objectives. Mohs, whose specialty is in global tax compliance, thinks the tariffs could get other countries to make deals, lowering their own trade barriers to U.S. exports, but that the process has been chaotic.\n\"It's very, very confusing, because even for us, we don't know what end is up, because it changes daily,\" he said. \"There's just so much confusion in the whole process with regards to his Aug. 1 deadline.\"\nThe business world is just as flummoxed. In recent surveys, business leaders have said they're uncertain about tariffs, and are in some cases delaying investment and hiring decisions until they have a better idea of where things are going.\n\u201cEconomic fundamentals appear solid at this juncture, but uncertainty is pervasive,\u201d Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist of the National Retail Federation, said in a commentary. \u201cThere are many crosscurrents surrounding tariffs, immigration and deregulation, and everyone is sorting through what the tariff rates are going to be, how they will impact inflation for retail products and, importantly, how long they will be in place.\u201d\nEconomists have said the uncertainty itself is a drag on the economy, and a major reason that forecasters have not completely ruled out the possibility of a recession in the coming months, despite reports showing the job market is still chugging along.\nWill The Tariffs Stick This Time?\nA major question is whether Trump will go through with the high tariffs on multiple trading partners he announced in April in an event he dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"\nTrump has said the steep tariffs on countries with whom the U.S. has a trade deficit are intended to rebalance trade, get other countries to stop unfair trade practices, and give an edge to U.S.-based manufacturing. So far, the U.S. has struck only one preliminary trade deal with a country targeted by \"reciprocal\" tariffs: Vietnam.\nTrump ordered a 90-day \"pause\" on the tariffs shortly after they went into effect in April to allow his negotiators time to reach agreements with their counterparts from other countries. The extension to Aug. 1 bought more time, but the two delays have raised questions about how serious the latest deadline actually is.\nMors said the extensions have threatened Trump's credibility among foreign leaders to the point where he can no longer afford to kick the can down the road again. If Aug. 1 arrives without progress on trade deals, he predicted Trump would actually start charging the tariffs this time.\n\"He's drawing a line in the sand again,\" Mors said. \"And I don't think he can survive drawing too many lines.\""

      "text": "Key Takeaways\n- The job market cooled in June as employers hired fewer people than at any time since the pandemic struck.\n- Despite the slowdown, fewer people were laid off, suggesting the labor market isn't crashing, at least for the moment.\n- The report could help encourage officials at the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September, as many financial market participants expect.\nYour company\u2019s human resources department might not be too busy these days: There hasn\u2019t been this little hiring and firing going on since the early days of the pandemic.\nEmployers hired 5.3 million people in June, the fewest since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, and before that, the fewest since 2016, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday. The number of layoffs fell to 1.5 million, down from May and the lowest since 2022.\nJob openings were still plentiful, with 8.2 million openings in June, the same as in May. That meant there were 1.2 open positions for every unemployed worker, similar to the pre-pandemic ratio. There were more openings than forecasters expected, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.\nDespite lots of openings, the number of people quitting jobs fell to the lowest since the pandemic, suggesting workers got less confident they could switch jobs for higher pay.\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey provided a more detailed snapshot of the job market\u2019s recent slowdown trend than the more widely watched nonfarm payrolls report, which tracks the overall change in the number of people employed and will be released Friday. Overall, it paints a mixed picture of a labor market cooling off from its feverish post-pandemic state, but not collapsing.\nCooler Job Market Clears The Way For Lower Interest Rates\nOfficials at the Federal Reserve have been closely watching job-market data for signs that the uptick in unemployment could snowball into widespread job losses.\nPolicymakers at the central bank have grown more concerned that its campaign of anti-inflation interest rate hikes meant to slow the economy and stifle inflation is starting to bite into the job market. Fed leaders are weighing when to lower the benchmark fed funds rate from its current 23-year high, and financial market participants widely expect that to happen in September.\nIn the wake of Tuesday's report, officials at the Fed will likely \u201csee no reason here to rush a rate cut, but no reason either not to signal that one is potentially coming in September,\u201d Conrad DeQuadros, chief economic adviser at Brean Capital, wrote in a commentary."

      "text": "Key Takeaways\n- President Donald Trump's tariff campaign has broken down some foreign barriers to U.S. trade.\n- The preliminary agreements could be especially significant if they open foreign markets to U.S. autos, one trade expert said.\n- The tariffs have also brought in billions in revenue to government coffers.\n- The trade war victories have come at a cost to the economy, potentially stoking inflation and slowing down economic growth, according to experts.\nSeven months into President Donald Trump's campaign to rebalance global trade in America's favor, the White House can point to several \"wins,\" but experts say the victories have come at a cost to the economy.\nSince his inauguration, Trump has worked to raise tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner. One of the major stated goals of the import taxes was to use them as leverage to bring foreign countries to the negotiating table.\n\"We will supercharge our domestic industrial base. We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers,\" Trump said in an April 2 speech announcing a swath of \"reciprocal\" tariffs. \"More production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices.\"\nSince then, Trump has announced preliminary agreements with most of America's largest trading partners, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Great Britain, and Vietnam.\nHere is what the U.S. has gained from Trump's trade wars so far:\nOpened Foreign Markets\nUnder the terms of the agreements, foreign countries will lower at least some of their own tariffs and trade barriers on U.S. products, potentially giving a boost to U.S. exporters.\nFor example, the agreement with Great Britain \"will include billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports, especially for beef, ethanol, and certain other American agricultural exports,\" the White House said in a statement. Britain will \"reduce or eliminate numerous non-tariff barriers that unfairly discriminate against American products,\" the statement said.\nAnthony Rapa, co-chair of the international trade practice group at law firm Blank Rome, said the reduction of foreign trade barriers could be significant, especially for the auto industry, which has historically had a hard time breaking into markets in Japan and Europe.\n\"In some countries, the U.S. auto industry has been entirely shut out,\" Rapa said. \"So if there actually is going to be market access for the U.S. auto industry, that would be a game changer.\"\nUndefined Investments\nMany of the trade deals have included promises by foreign countries to invest in the U.S. or buy products from U.S. companies. For instance, the E.U. agreed to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., while Japan will make $550 billion worth of investments in the U.S.\nDetails of those commitments are unclear, including how exactly countries will pay the money and who will get it. Past trade agreements have taken months or years to negotiate, Rapa said, so the exact nature of the investments may not be clear for some time.\n\"There are details that are to be fleshed out as time goes on,\" Rapa said. \"I think we'll need to see what is considered to be an investment by the other country. Are we talking equity investments? Are we talking about starting businesses here? Talking about buying assets, buying real estate, financing?\"\nTariff Revenue\nAnother notable feature of Trump's trade deals is that they have left historically high tariffs in place. Tariffs on imports range from 10% on British goods to 20% on those from Vietnam, although these rates are lower than the ones Trump had threatened earlier.\nOne undoubted economic benefit of the tariffs is the sheer amount of money they put in government coffers, helping offset the impact of Trump's other major economic policy, the massive tax and spending bill he signed into law earlier this year.\nThe Tax Foundation think tank estimated last week that the tariffs will generate $2.3 billion in revenue over the next 10 years.\nAt What Cost?\nThe trouble for the economy is that U.S. companies and consumers could be the ones paying all that money.\nMany economists and trade experts say importers will sooner or later pass most of the cost of tariffs along to the final customer. Trump and White House officials have disagreed, contending that foreign companies and governments will shoulder the burden.\nAccording to the Yale Budget Lab, the average tariff of 18.6% is the highest since 1933. Yale researchers estimate that the tariffs will cost a typical household $2,400 in 2025 alone.\nMany economists blame the tariffs for signs of an inflation flare-up in the past few months. The tariffs could also slow the economy by hurting consumer spending and discouraging investment.\nNumerous economists project that the economy will grow more slowly than if the tariffs had not been in place, even after accounting for the benefits of the trade deals. The Tax Foundation, for instance, estimates the economy, as measured by Gross Domestic Product, will be 0.9% smaller than it would have been without the trade wars."

Two members of the 12-person committee, Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, dissented and voted to cut rates by 0.25 percentage points. Financial market participants widely expected the rate decision.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and other Federal Open Market Committee members have resisted increasing pressure from Trump to cut rates. Trump has hurled insults, threats, and demands at Powell and accused him of mismanaging a renovation project at the Fed's Washington headquarters. Trump has said he wants lower interest rates to reduce the interest the federal government pays on the national debt.\nFed officials have said they're holding the rate steady at a higher-than-usual level to raise borrowing costs on all kinds of loans and bring inflation down to the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. They have also voiced concerns that Trump's tariffs will increase inflation as the costs of the import taxes are passed along to consumers.\n\"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\" the committee said in a statement. \"The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"\nFed officials are widely expected to cut borrowing costs later in the year, with financial markets pricing in a 58% chance of a September rate cut according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data.\nThe Fed faces a balancing act on its monetary policy: rates too low could stoke inflation, while high borrowing costs could slow the economy too much and cause mass layoffs.\nTrump's extensive campaign of raising import taxes has raised concerns on both sides of the Fed's \"dual mandate\" from Congress to keep inflation low and employment high. So far, the economy has avoided a severe uptick in prices and mass layoffs, though recent data show some tariff-related price hikes are taking hold and the economy is starting to slow down.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025\u2014This story has been updated after initial publication to add a quote from the Federal Open Market Committee."

The tariffs remain in effect until October 14 while the administration appeals to the Supreme Court. The uncertainty has weighed on markets, causing stock declines and prompting the Fed to keep rates high to curb inflation. The decision fuels debate over trade policy\u2019s inflationary impact and its broader economic consequences.",
