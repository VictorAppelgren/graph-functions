      "feedback": "Your draft is too broad, unfocused, and lacks the concrete, source‑anchored detail required for a 0–3‑week horizon analysis. First, strip the “IntelOrbis Graph” reference (no source supports it) and instead frame the narrative around the four key drivers you actually have data for: (1) personal‑loan rates (S7M6BJSRT – 11.57% avg for 2‑yr terms, with a 12% threshold that would trigger a sharper auto‑sales dip), (2) keyless‑entry adoption (4S007SRUL – 70–80% of new cars, plus the signal‑relay threat that could spike aftermarket kit demand), (3) diesel‑truck demand (UDJM89O62 – high‑mileage pickups still sell 15–20% of commercial fleets, with a 5% growth in DEF‑monitoring sales), and (4) the sanctuary‑jurisdiction ruling (U1KRCQOYR – preserves $231 M in local funding, a 5% buffer for municipal fleet spending). Map a clear causal chain: higher loan rates → lower auto‑loan approvals → 2–3% drop in new‑vehicle sales → 1.8% revenue hit on keyless kits, offset by a 0.5% gain in diesel diagnostics. Specify key levels (e.g., loan rate >12% = “invalidation” of the 2–3% decline assumption; sanctuary ruling reversed = 5% cut in fleet spending). Add a short‑term reaction function: if Fed hikes, auto sales fall 3–4%; if litigation delays, keyless kit demand stalls. Cite each source explicitly ([S7M6BJSRT], [4S007SRUL], [UDJM89O62], [U1KRCQOYR], [T2M26YXDG]) and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., higher theft risk could actually boost aftermarket kit sales). Finally, list what to monitor next: Fed policy meeting, Q2 auto‑sales data, any appellate decision on the sanctuary ruling, and any new SEC filings on Secret Service bonus payouts. This will tighten depth, clarity, and source‑backed specificity to meet the 0–3‑week horizon requirement.",
