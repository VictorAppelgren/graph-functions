  "content": "The 8th edition of the Senegal Mining Conference and Exhibition (SIM Senegal 2025) will take place from 4 \u2013 6 November 2025 in Dakar, Senegal.\n\nDAKAR , SENEGAL, September 4, 2025 / EINPresswire.com / -- The 8th edition of the Senegal Mining Conference and Exhibition ( SIM Senegal 2025) will take place from 4 \u2013 6 November 2025 in Dakar, Senegal. Held under the High Patronage of His Excellency Bassirou Diomaye Diakhar Faye, President of the Republic of Senegal and organised by the Ministry of Energy, Petroleum and Mines, Senegal in association with AME Trade. SIM Senegal 2025 will be the largest mining event to take place in West Africa this year.\n\nThis all-encompassing event will feature three days of high-level conference debates, interactive workshops and a co-located trade event where more than one hundred companies have already confirmed their participation emanating from over thirty countries.\n\nSponsors of the event include national stakeholders such as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Mines du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (SOMISEN S.A.), the Senegal Chamber of Mines, Service G\u00e9ologique National du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal ( SGNS Senegal); mining exploration and production giants such as Endeavour Mining, Resolute, Eramet, Managem, SOMIVA, Fortuna Mining and Thor Exploration and the country\u2019s most prolific cement producers notably SOCOCIM and Dangote.\n\nMajor mining service companies will also sponsor SIM looking to secure new business include: Total Energies, Vivo Energy, Carmeuse, Louda, Bernabe, IDC Drilling Company, AGL, Elton, MCI, Star Energy, CFAO Equipment, EPC Mineex, Mann Filter, PRD Rigs and SOJUFISC.\n\nSenegal is well positioned with a stable investment environment, geographic position and skilled position to be the ideal mining hub of the West African region. In a global context marked by the race for strategic raw materials, the control and development of mineral resources are of paramount importance for states. Mineral resources (gold, copper, cobalt, lithium, iron, bauxite, etc.) are the basis of numerous industries (technology, energy, armaments, automotive, etc.) and play a decisive role in global value chains.\n\nFor resource-rich countries, they represent a major asset in the quest for sustainable development, economic independence, and strategic sovereignty.\n\nHowever, the exploitation of these resources has often been marked by excessive dependence on foreign actors, limited local processing, negative environmental and social impacts, and a limited contribution to national economies. In this regard, the chosen theme of SIM Senegal 2025: \u201cMineral resources, a lever of economic sovereignty\u201d will be a great opportunity to demonstrate that mineral resources constitute a strategic heritage for Senegal and that their responsible exploitation, their local transformation and their integration into regional and global value chains are decisive factors.\n\nEIN Presswire provides this news content \u201cas is\u201d without warranty of any kind.

Maiden\n-\nMorocco\u2019s mining reform is making ESG more than a checklist, it\u2019s embedding sustainability into every stage of the value chain. A new rehabilitation fee system will replace the old \u201cenvironmental compliance guarantee,\u201d ensuring mining sites are: \u2714\ufe0f Secured and stabilized \u2714\ufe0f Restored with topsoil and vegetation \u2714\ufe0f Returned to safe, productive use for communities This shift is about more than compliance, it\u2019s about protecting ecosystems, meeting international sustainability standards, and building trust with investors and local communities alike. At IMC Morocco 2025, the ESG & Sustainability in Mining Operations session will explore how policies like this are redefining responsible mining in Africa. \ud83d\udc49 Register here: https://lnkd.in/gb9DHT2Q #MoroccoMining #CriticalMinerals #MiningReform #EnergyTransition #IMCMorocco2025\n-\nAccording to the Fraser Institute\u2019s 2024 Annual Survey of Mining Companies, Morocco now holds the title of Africa\u2019s most attractive mining sector \u2014 and ranks 18th in the world, ahead of major mining economies like Brazil, Ghana, and South Africa. With a score of 89.9/100 and a leap from 27th place in 2023, Morocco\u2019s rise reflects growing investor confidence, rich geological potential, and a dynamic policy environment. At IMC Morocco 2025, you\u2019ll connect with the leaders, investors, and policymakers behind this momentum \u2014 and explore the opportunities driving Morocco\u2019s mining future.
