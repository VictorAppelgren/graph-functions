      "feedback": "This draft can be upgraded to world-class by tightening the causal chain, foregrounding the 0–3 week timing, and grounding every claim in traceable numbers from the listed sources. Action steps: (1) Recenter the narrative on immediate policy moves with explicit timestamps and sectoral channels (India 50% tariffs taking effect around Aug 27; EU MFN 15% on most imports with a path to car-tariff relief once Brussels acts; de minimis duty exemption expires Aug 28; a 50‑day furniture tariff investigation with stock-price reactions). Tie each to a specific source ID: DGG6HXUFZ (India tariff timing), 9BA7355CV (furniture tariffs and equity impact), VCZKKPORO (de minimis expiry), 8 and 9 (EU framework terms and auto-relief timing). (2) Build a tight, testable causal chain: tariffs raise input costs and some consumer prices, shifting margins and prompting sectoral reallocation (cite 13 and 19 for tariff-pass-through and revenue implications); map how those flows show up in equities (Wayfair/ RH/ Williams-Sonoma declines; La-Z-Boy up) with explicit source anchors (9BA7355CV, CNBC/UPI synthesis in 9). (3) Quantify the tariff regime as a single metric range rather than disparate anecdotes: cite Yale Budget Lab’s 18.3% headline tariff level and Barcus/Ratings commentary that tariff revenue could offset deficits (sources 13 and 19); note 18.6% in another synthesis (source 19) and present a consolidated range (roughly 18–19%) to avoid cherry-picking. (4) Integrate cross-border demand shifts and energy/tech frictions only where supported: Korea’s early-August export lift driven by semiconductors (source 15) and China buying Russian crude as India slows (sources 6 and 25) to illustrate spillovers; also mention Nvidia/H20 supplier pauses as a near-term tech-supply signal (source 11) without overstating a macro-crisis. (5) Warn explicitly against non‑credible inputs: flag the Gateway Pundit piece (CWVWSACA7) as a low-credibility trigger and either drop it or label it as unverified and non-core for market timing. (6) State explicit “watch levels” and “invalidations” for the horizon: India tariff effective date (Aug 27) and EU MFN date (Sept 1); potential retroactivity on EU autos per Reuters/EC frameworks (sources 9 and 10); de minimis expiry date (Aug 28); tariff-revenue trajectory turning points (monthly receipts around $30B per July data in source 19; 13’s 18–19% range); and energy-flow signals from Druzhba (CWVWSACA7) as a geopolitical risk floor. (7) Restructure the write-up to a tight, linear 0–3 week brief: start with drivers, then catalysts, then transmission channels (goods, autos, electronics, energy), then price/reaction function (equities, spreads, inflation signals), then thresholds and what to monitor next; each claim should be anchored to a single or pair of IDs. (8) Improve coverage and reconciliation: explicitly acknowledge conflicts between sources (e.g., EU auto-relief timing vs. current MFN framework language) by citing both the framework document (8) and the Reuters/ CNBC summaries (9, 10) and note the conditions under which relief could occur; ensure every numeric fact has a source tag (e.g., 50% India tariff date, 15% EU MFN, 18–19% tariff-pass-through, Aug 28 de minimis expiry, $30B tariff revenue signal). (9) For tone and format, prune speculative language and replace with quantified ranges and conditional language (e.g., “base-case tariff pass-through ~18–19%., with upside risk if India/EU concessions shift timing.”). (10) Finally, insert a concise, one-sentence base-case and a short alternative scenario to bracket outcomes within the 0–3 week horizon, with explicit triggers and invalidation points drawn from the IDs above. This approach will dramatically raise clarity, causal coherence, and reliance on primary signals, while keeping strictly within the horizon and format constraints.",
