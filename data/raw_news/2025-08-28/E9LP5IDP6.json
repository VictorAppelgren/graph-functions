SNOW CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy pushed back against the growing narrative that artificial intelligence models are beginning to plateau, calling such predictions premature and something that has ended up not being true several times in the past.\nSNOW stock is at important technical levels. See the complete data here.\nStill \u2018Very, Very Early Innings\u2019\nDuring the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, Ramaswamy said, \u201cEvery prediction that we have made about various kinds of plateauing has not really turned out to be true some six odd months later,\u201d while citing \u201cremarkable transformation\u201d in model capabilities, particularly in code generation and agentic workflows, in recent months.\nAccording to Ramaswamy, enterprise use cases, unlike consumer-facing applications, are still unfolding. \u201cThese kinds of experiences become useful only when the data that matters to the enterprise\u201d actually becomes available to the models.\nSee Also: Snowflake Stock Is Moving Higher After Hours: Here\u2019s Why\n\u201cThink of all the work that happens in an enterprise,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cWhether it is insurance claims processing, or regulatory reporting, or anomaly detection,\u201d he says, adding that across all these areas, the application of data and AI \u201cis very much in its infancy.\u201d\nLooking ahead, he sees a long runway for value creation. \u201cThere is honestly years of work ahead in terms of the value that we can get from AI,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's still very, very early innings.\u201d\nStock Rallies On Beat-And-Raise Quarter\nSnowflake released its second-quarter results on Wednesday, reporting $1.14 billion in revenue, up 32% year-over-year, and beating consensus estimates of $1.09 billion.
