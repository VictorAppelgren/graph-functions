  "description": "OTTAWA, ON, Aug. 18, 2025 /CNW/ - Wildfire season is in full effect across much of Canada, and the Government of Canada is committed to supporting Canadians and ensuring our wildfire resilience, prevention, mitigation and recovery are best-in-call by strengthening our fire response capacity.",
  "content": "OTTAWA, ON, Aug. 18, 2025 /CNW/ - Wildfire season is in full effect across much of Canada, and the Government of Canada is committed to supporting Canadians and ensuring our wildfire resilience, prevention, mitigation and recovery are best-in-call by strengthening our fire response capacity.\n\nToday, Corey Hogan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, announced an investment of $540,300 for two projects through the Government of Canada\u2019s Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate Program (FMWCC) \u2013 Training Fund. The funding includes:\n\u2022 $335,000 to Yorkton Tribal Council in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, to support the training of 35 community members in wildland fire management, integrating traditional knowledge and cultural burning practices to address wildfire risk reduction and mitigation.\n\u2022 $204,800 to the Rural Municipality of Piney, Manitoba, to support the training of up to 60 individuals from the Rural Municipality of Piney and Buffalo Point First Nation in basic wildland firefighting training and to strengthen local capacity for wildfire response.\n\nThrough this investment, community members in Manitoba and Saskatchewan \u2014 two provinces that have faced severe wildfire conditions this year \u2014 will receive wildland firefighting training to enhance their communities\u2019 capacity to prepare and respond to wildfires. These investments will also equip people with the necessary skills and opportunities to pursue employment in wildland firefighting.\n\nThe addition of these 95 trainees has us on track to train over 2,800 wildland firefighters in Canada, greatly surpassing our original target of training over 1,000 community members.\n\nParliamentary Secretary Hogan also delivered the latest national wildfire forecast. Looking ahead, Environment and Climate Change Canada\u2019s weather forecasts point to above-average temperatures across much of Canada through August into September, with dry conditions continuing in the coming weeks, particularly in the west and north.\n\nBased on these weather forecasts, Natural Resources Canada\u2019s modelling predicts elevated wildfire danger for August across British Columbia, Yukon, the Northwest Territories and the Prairie provinces to Ontario, as well as parts of Atlantic Canada. In September, above normal activity is expected to continue across the west.\n\nAs Canadians continue to face the impacts of wildfires, which are becoming more frequent and more intense, the Government of Canada remains committed to strengthening wildfire resilience, supporting those on the front lines and equipping communities to stay safe.\n\n\u201cWildfires pose a serious threat to the safety, health and economic well-being of communities across Canada. Today\u2019s announcement reflects our government\u2019s continued commitment to train Canadians to fight fire in their communities. This investment helps protect Canadian families, homes and the environment \u2014 now and in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs wildfires continue to threaten communities across the country, we\u2019re focused on making sure people have the support they need to stay safe. That means investing in firefighter training and helping volunteers build the skills to respond quickly and effectively. It\u2019s one part of our plan to build stronger, more-resilient communities across Canada.\u201d\n\nMinister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada\n\n\u201cFirefighters across Canada are showing extraordinary courage as they work to protect lives, homes, businesses and communities from devastating wildfires. Their bravery is saving lives and supporting impacted communities across the country. These fires are a direct and growing consequence of climate change \u2014 becoming more frequent, more intense and more destructive every year. That\u2019s why strengthening local firefighting capacity is essential to protecting the places we call home. Projects like this are critical as we confront the escalating threat of climate change together.\u201d\n\n\u201cYorkton Tribal Council\u2019s participation in this training initiative marks an important step forward in wildfire planning, response and recovery. First Nation communities are among the most vulnerable to wildfires, especially as the threat of climate change grows stronger. First Nations are the only people who, with the combination of their traditional knowledge and access to specialized wildland firefighting training, will be able to secure and promote resilient communities across their territories.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanadians are currently on the front lines protecting their communities and neighbours from wildfires across the country. Through today\u2019s announcement, we\u2019re strengthening local firefighting capacity by investing in the training of new volunteers and community members. By investing in and delivering firefighting training, more people will be equipped to protect lives and respond to the growing threat of wildfires.\u201d\n\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources\n\n\u201cThe Rural Municipality of Piney thanks Natural Resources Canada for its generous support, which will greatly enhance our firefighting capabilities and empower our volunteer firefighters through vital training. This funding arrives at a critical time, as our region and province face increasing wildfire risks driven by a changing climate and more-frequent forest fires. In partnership with Buffalo Point First Nation, we are building a stronger, safer and more-resilient community prepared to meet these growing challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the Emergency Management Coordinator for Yorkton Tribal Council, I would like to express our extreme gratitude to Natural Resources Canada for the funding to move ahead with the project protecting our lands, especially now during one of the worst fire seasons in Saskatchewan. This funding will allow us to bring back our Indigenous cultures to preserve the landscapes and to mitigate wildfire risks and their impact within our communities.\u201d\n\u2022 Today\u2019s announcement is part of the federal government\u2019s FMWCC Training Fund, which is a $28-million investment to train more than 1,000 new, community-based wildland firefighters by 2028, focusing on Indigenous communities, to increase local fire management capacities and capabilities across Canada.\n\u2022 The FMWCC Training Fund included a two-year pilot phase from 2022\u20132024 that supported 10 training projects valued at $8.2 million and helped inform the design and launch of the full Training Fund in 2024, which offered over $16 million to new applicants. The pilot supported the training of 294 firefighters and 116 fire guardians.\n\u2022 The International Association of Fire Fighters Responding to the Interface program also upskilled 323 existing municipal structural firefighters.\n\u2022 The was also launched in 2022 to support provinces and territories to purchase specialized wildfire firefighting equipment including personal protective equipment, vehicles, mobile units, hoses, pumps and enhanced communications equipment, many of which were used to combat wildfires last season.\n\u2022 Through the FMWCC Equipment Fund, 12 agreements were signed with eligible jurisdictions, representing a total funding commitment of $254.3 million over five years.\n\u2022 Visit for a complete list of links to various federal supports for individuals impacted by wildfires.",

      "text": "Monthly and Seasonal Forecasts\nThe monthly and seasonal forecast maps present predictions of fire weather severity based on the monthly and seasonal severity rating. Predictions are based on Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction System (CanSIPS), information contained in the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS), and advice provided by provincial agencies.\nBefore and during the fire season, monthly forecast maps are generated at the beginning of each month (i.e., April to September). Forecasts are based on a 40-member ensemble of predicted monthly temperature and precipitation anomalies using two numeric weather prediction models.\nForecast maps are available for the following themes:\nThe Forecast Severity Rating map presents forecasted monthly or seasonal severity ratings. This map shows the predicted conditions unadjusted for climatology. For months based on the ensemble forecast, the map reflects the median station values of the 40-member ensemble.\nThe Average Severity Rating map presents 30-year average monthly or seasonal severity ratings. This map shows the regional climatology of severity conditions.\nThe Forecast Severity Anomaly map presents the ratio of the forecasted severity rating to the average monthly or seasonal severity rating. This map indicates which regions are predicted to be above or below the regional climatological average in a normalized form (where 1 = average conditions). Note: This map alone does not indicate which regions of Canada are predicted to have above-average fire seasons. Such conditions can be approximated by comparing this map with the Forecast Severity Rating map.\nThe Confidence Rating map presents the ratio of the standard deviation of the forecasted severity rating to the average monthly or seasonal severity rating. This map indicates the confidence in the forecast according to the variation of ensemble members around the predicted value.\nDisclaimer: These forecasts are experimental and have yet to be fully validated and calibrated. These forecasts should be viewed not for their accuracy, but for the general trends they present and are to be used as a long-range planning tool by fire resource managers.\nMore information about the calculations for monthly and seasonal severity forecasts is available in the Background Information."
