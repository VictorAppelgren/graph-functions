      "feedback": "The draft ambitiously ties a 3–6 month macro, policy, and private‑market map to Walmart/private‑label dynamics, private‑label retail, and pre‑IPO wealth platforms, but it underdelivers on a disciplined scenario map, explicit triggers, timing, and risk invalidations, and it overreads some sources while mixing in non‑critical items; it also needs tighter, consistent sourcing and a clean base/alt framework to satisfy the horizon’s “timing windows, path‑dependency, and invalidation” requirement. Concrete edits: (1) rebuild as a tightly scoped 3–6 month scenario map with a) base case, b) one inflation/debt shock alt, and c) one AI‑driven productivity/tech platform alt; for each, specify explicit timing windows (e.g., 0–2 weeks, 2–6 weeks, 6–12 weeks), quantify drivers, and lay out how each affects valuations, flows, and positioning. (2) codify catalysts/triggers and invalidations with numbers and sources: macro debt path from OB Big Beautiful Bill (≈$4T added debt over 10 years) and potential tariff/Medicaid changes; Pacaso Range/Mogul metrics (Pacaso: 21% YoY real estate volume growth, ~1.8T vacation‑home market, 2,000+ clients and >$6B AUM, 40% of Americans eyeing a vacation home) and Range’s AI‑driven advisory with 0% AUM and $6B assets; HeartSciences’ AI‑ECG FDA/Medicare dynamics (32B ECG market, Medicare reimbursement started 2025); Walmart private‑label/BetterGoods margin narrative; and the Douglas tires trade‑off (40k–60k miles, 50k warranty). (3) tighten the causal chain: policy/debt dynamics drive rate volatility; AI/private‑market inflows temper inflation and support growth; retailer private‑label momentum sustains margins; alternate narratives should hinge on concrete milestones (Pacaso international launches; Range adoption metrics; Medicaid work‑requirements rollout; HeartSciences FDA/clinical progress). (4) fix citations: keep IDs precise and consistent (YQOMV2HAJ, EPJYXB7DX, V8TEZOR8R, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, HeartSciences’ ID from UPV/ILY line), and attach them to each factual claim; avoid mismatched or stray sources. (5) explicitly reconcile conflicts, e.g., optimistic AI productivity vs debt‑driven rate risk, by assigning probabilities and showing how each scenario would shift sector weights. (6) end with a crisp, sourced base case, 1–2 clearly defined alts, explicit risks, watch‑list signals, and a quantified confidence level (e.g., base case 60–65%, alt1 25–30%, alt2 5–10%). This will elevate coherence, rigor, and actionable usefulness.",
