      "text": "In a long-percolating agreement, ESPN said that it has acquired the NFL Network and certain other media assets of the NFL in exchange for a 10% equity stake.\nThe agreement, announced Tuesday on the eve of Disney\u2019s quarterly earnings report and in the runup to the NFL season, will give ESPN important new programming for its forthcoming stand-alone streaming service. One of the marquee assets involved in the deal is a set of seven regular-season NFL games, which had been exclusive to the league-owned channel.\nDisney has been in business with sports leagues before, acquiring Major League Baseball\u2019s tech arm several years ago and using it as the foundation of its direct-to-consumer streaming push. But the notion of the most powerful sports entity of all, at least in the U.S., owning 10% of Disney\u2019s foundational sports division represents a major breakthrough.\nIn addition to the sale of NFL Network, the NFL and ESPN are also entering into a second non-binding agreement. Under that pact, the NFL will license to ESPN certain NFL content and other intellectual property to be used by NFL Network and other assets.\nWatch on Deadline\nThe deal also includes a provision in which ESPN will own broad rights to the RedZone brand and distribute the NFL RedZone channel to pay-TV operators. The NFL will continue to own, operate and produce the channel and keep digital rights, according to ESPN.\nThe launch date and pricing for the new ESPN streaming service are likely to be announced as soon as Wednesday morning, and the presence of the additional NFL content will be a sweetener for the service. NFL Fantasy is also included in the deal, which will help with ESPN\u2019s effort to leverage its appeal to fantasy sports players. ESPN\u2019s fantasy game will now be the official NFL fantasy product, enhancing its clout in the marketplace.\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement paves the way for the world\u2019s leading sports media brand and America\u2019s most popular sport to deliver an even more compelling experience for NFL fans, in a way that only ESPN and Disney can,\u201d Disney CEO Bob Iger said. \u201cCommissioner Goodell and the NFL have built outstanding media assets, and these transactions will add to consumer choice, provide viewers with even greater convenience and quality, and expand the breadth and value proposition of Disney\u2019s streaming ecosystem.\u201d\nIn the official announcement, Goodell praised the run of the NFL Network, which launched in 2003. It had initially been a headache for the league as a number of major pay-TV providers balked at paying steep fees in order to carry it, leaving gaps in its distribution footprint. Once it was fully distributed, the network enjoyed only a brief peak period before the pay-TV bundle started to fray due to cord-cutting and the streaming revolution, making traditional network assets less appealing to their owners.\n\u201cWhether it was debuting Thursday Night Football, televising the [NFL] Combine, or telling incredible football stories through original shows and breaking news, NFL Network has delivered,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThe network\u2019s sale to ESPN will build on this remarkable legacy, providing more NFL football for more fans in new and innovative ways.\u201d\nJimmy Pitaro, chairman of ESPN, called it \u201can exciting day for sports fans.\u201d Putting NFL media assets together with ESPN\u2019s capabilities, he said, is \u201ccreating a premier destination for football fans. Together, ESPN and the NFL are redefining how fans engage with the game \u2013 anytime, anywhere. This deal helps fuel ESPN\u2019s digital future, laying the foundation for an even more robust offering as we prepare to launch our new direct-to-consumer service.\u201d\nThe transactions are subject to the parties\u2019 negotiation of definitive agreements, various approvals including by the NFL team owners, and customary closing conditions, an announcement said.\nESPN is 80& owned by Disney\u2019s ABC Inc., with the Hearst Corp. controlling the remaining and 20%.\n\u201c\u2026in exchange for a 10% equity stake.\u201d\nOf course there is no cash involved, like I\u2019ve been saying since 2020, Disney is BROKE and heavily in debt. Layoffs are not enough; They\u2019re going to have to start selling off brands and assets like Warner Bros has been doing the last two years"

      "text": "Earlier this year, we told you about plans for a standalone streaming service from FOX with a former Apple TV+ veteran at the helm. As of today, FOX has announced pricing and the launch date for its direct to consumers subscription video service.\nFOX One will launch in two weeks on Thursday, August 21. The new standalone streaming video service will cost $19.99 per month or $199.99 per year.\nThat\u2019s a pretty hefty price compared to standalone streaming services from other networks. For example, Paramount+ from CBS starts at $7.99 per month and Peacock from NBC goes from $10.99 per month.\nHowever, the service lets cord-cutters pay directly for content from various FOX channels with content that includes live sports and more.\nHere\u2019s more from today\u2019s company announcement sharing the launch date and pricing details:\nThis month, FOX One will bring all of FOX\u2019s leading News, Sports and Entertainment branded content together in one dynamic streaming platform. For the first time, cord-cutters and cord-nevers will have live streaming and on-demand access to the real-time thrills, bold, trusted voices and defining stories being told across the full portfolio of FOX brands including FOX News Channel, FOX Business Network, FOX Weather, FOX Sports, FS1, FS2, FOX Deportes, B1G, FOX Local Stations and the FOX Network. FOX Nation and B1G+ will also be available in the FOX One platform. Users will be able to bundle FOX One and FOX Nation for $24.99 per month or the equivalent of $19.99 per month when purchasing the annual plan at launch.\nPete Distad, who previously worked on Apple TV+, is the CEO of Direct to Consumer at Fox Corporation.\nCheck out these great accessories\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
