Generate Key Takeaways\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 No Maryland-based companies were included in President Donald Trump\u2019s push to build three new nuclear reactors, but both Gov. Wes Moore and a Republican state senator believe pursuing nuclear power is important for the state\u2019s energy needs.\n\nAccording to a news release Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Energy has made initial selections for projects under Trump\u2019s \u201cNuclear Reactor Pilot Program,\u201d which has a goal of getting three small nuclear reactors operational by July 4, 2026. This program, which Deputy Energy Secretary James Danly declared a \u201ccall to action,\u201d follows a June executive order aimed at reforming reactor testing procedures.\n\nOf the 10 firms selected for testing of \u201cadvanced reactor designs,\u201d seven are headquartered in either California or Texas. Each company chosen will be responsible for all costs from the designing to operating and decommissioning phases of its test reactors, according to the release.\n\nIn a statement to The Baltimore Sun, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore\u2019s office said he is \u201ccommitted to meeting Maryland\u2019s energy needs with a strategy that includes nuclear power, increases production and reduces costs on consumers.\u201d The statement discussed Moore\u2019s support for the Next Generation Energy Act, which establishes a nuclear generation procurement process through the state\u2019s Public Service Commission and directs the Maryland Energy Administration to study cost-sharing agreements to make developing nuclear energy cheaper.\n\nState lawmakers did not pass the ENERGIZE Act \u2014 Moore\u2019s initial proposal, which would have established a 100% clean energy goal for Maryland and funded nuclear energy procurement through surcharges on ratepayers\u2019 energy bills. Earlier this year, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson and other Democrats argued that passing higher energy costs on to consumers \u201cwas not tenable.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Justin Ready, a Republican who represents Carroll and Frederick counties, characterized the legislation as \u201ca lot of half measures,\u201d while noting that some progress has been made.\n\n\u201cThere were bills that passed that are supposed to make it better for nuclear in Maryland, but \u2026 I don\u2019t know that they went as far as they could have,\u201d Ready told The Baltimore Sun.\n\nReady said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d that no Maryland-based companies made it on the Trump administration\u2019s list to develop new reactors. He believes the state may be shifting towards nuclear energy, but Annapolis Democrats\u2019 excessive focus on natural gas regulation has \u201cwatered down\u201d the effectiveness of bills like the Next Generation Energy Act.\n\nMoore has also supported the recent expansion of X-energy, a nuclear company based in Gaithersburg.\n\nLast month, X-energy consolidated its headquarters and announced plans to create more than 500 new jobs by 2031. The company also plans to use a 90,000 square-foot building in Frederick as its first \u201cintegrated test and training facility,\u201d which will house non-nuclear testing facilities and reactor prototyping components, according to a July 30 news release from the governor\u2019s office.",
