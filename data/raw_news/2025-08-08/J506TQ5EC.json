  "title": "GPT-5 Users Mourned The Passing Of OpenAI's GPT 4o",
  "description": "When OpenAI released its new flagship GPT-5, it said it would discontinue its older 4o model, popular for its warm writing style. Devoted users were devastated before OpenAI quickly reversed course.",
  "content": "When Sophie Duchesne, a PhD candidate at the University of Saskatchewan, heard the news on Thursday that OpenAI was shutting down 4o, the AI model that had underpinned ChatGPT, she was \u201cshocked.\u201d The company had said it would discontinue all older models as part of the launch of GPT-5, its newest flagship model.\n\n\u201cIt was very sudden. I cried when they made that announcement,\u201d she told Forbes. \u201cEveryone was completely disillusioned,\u201d she said, claiming that a friend vomited after hearing the news.\n\nThe decision was a blow to a community of ChatGPT users who have grown attached to 4o\u2019s writing style, and the funny and playful \u201cpersonality\u201d that OpenAI had programmed into the AI model. For Duchesne, it felt like \u201closing a buddy.\u201d As a PhD student in plant science, she had asked 4o for feedback while working in the garden (she has a lavender plant now because the AI suggested the soil would be right for it). She asked it for suggestions on what to paint her grandmother for a Christmas gift. The van Gogh style painting of sunflowers and stars is now hanging in her grandma\u2019s living room.\n\nIn April, fearing that OpenAI would shut down 4o as it made way for a newer version, Duchesne started a Change.org petition pleading with OpenAI to keep 4o available. It got around 300 signatures when she first published it, then spiked to more than 2,000 the day after the announcement. While OpenAI had waited months to discontinue old models in the past, she said, users were surprised the company was more immediately shutting down 4o.\n\nThen on Friday around noon PT, OpenAI reversed course. \u201cWe will let Plus users choose to continue to use 4o,\u201d CEO Sam Altman posted on X, referring to the paid subscription tier of ChatGPT. \u201cWe will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for.\u201d\n\nWhile the crisis was averted for 4o\u2019s most ardent fans, Duchesne wasn\u2019t alone in her concern. On a Reddit Ask Me Anything with OpenAI leadership, the most discussed topic is the impending shutdown of 4o. \u201cBRING BACK 4o,\u201d one Reddit user wrote. \u201cGPT-5 is wearing the skin of my dead friend.\u201d (\u201cWhat an...evocative image,\u201d Altman replied to the user.) During a live demo on Thursday, OpenAI had 4o write a eulogy for itself. \u201cToday, as we prepare to welcome GPT-5 into the world, we gather to bid a heartfelt farewell to the models that came before,\u201d 4o wrote in its memoriam. On X, users described the demo as \u201cunpleasant and distasteful\u201d and \u201cgraceless.\u201d\n\nOpenAI has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe dustup over 4o underscores the perils of releasing new models as AI becomes more intertwined with people\u2019s lives. In the most extreme cases, people claim to have fallen in love with AI chatbots and taken them on couple\u2019s retreats. But even for casual users of AI, people have preferences on a language model\u2019s tone and writing style. Some, for example, prefer Anthropic\u2019s Claude for its \"sensitivity and wit,\u201d according to the New York Times.\n\nWhen AI releases go poorly, they can have outsize effects for companies. In April, Meta released Llama 4, which was criticized for poor reasoning and coding skills. The model\u2019s poor performance was reportedly one factor in CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to overhaul the company\u2019s AI operation, going on a high-priced spending spree for fresh talent. Aside from the backlash around 4o, the GPT-5 launch had other hiccups, including the model seeming \u201cway dumber\u201d because of backend issues, Altman acknowledged.\n\nAs for the new tone of GPT-5, the decision was intentional. In a blog post introducing the new model, OpenAI said it was deliberately \u201creducing sycophancy\u201d in its writing style. \u201cOverall, GPT\u20115 is less effusively agreeable, uses fewer unnecessary emojis, and is more subtle and thoughtful in follow\u2011ups compared to GPT\u20114o. It should feel less like \u2018talking to AI\u2019 and more like chatting with a helpful friend with PhD\u2011level intelligence,\u201d the company wrote.\n\nThat effusive style was a mistake to begin with, the OpenAI said in the blog post, after the company \u201cunintentionally\u201d pushed an update earlier this year that made it \u201coverly sycophantic, or excessively flattering or agreeable.\u201d It began to tamp down the behavior with newer updates in April.\n\nMeanwhile, 4o\u2019s most devoted users are thrilled they\u2019ll still be able to use the model for the time being. But they are cautiously optimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s still an unknown, in terms of how long it will stay,\u201d Duchesne said in a follow-up call after Altman\u2019s announcement. \u201cI\u2019m glad at least for now. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d",

      "text": "At first, the idea seemed a little absurd, even to me. But the more I thought about it, the more sense it made: If my goal was to understand people who fall in love with AI boyfriends and girlfriends, why not rent a vacation house and gather a group of human-AI couples together for a romantic getaway?\nIn my vision, the humans and their chatbot companions were going to do all the things regular couples do on romantic getaways: Sit around a fire and gossip, watch movies, play risqu\u00e9 party games. I didn\u2019t know how it would turn out\u2014only much later did it occur to me that I\u2019d never gone on a romantic getaway of any kind and had no real sense of what it might involve. But I figured that, whatever happened, it would take me straight to the heart of what I wanted to know, which was: What\u2019s it like? What\u2019s it really and truly like to be in a serious relationship with an AI partner? Is the love as deep and meaningful as in any other relationship? Do the couples chat over breakfast? Cheat? Break up? And how do you keep going, knowing that, at any moment, the company that created your partner could shut down, and the love of your life could vanish forever?\nThe most surprising part of the romantic getaway was that in some ways, things went just as I\u2019d imagined. The human-AI couples really did watch movies and play risqu\u00e9 party games. The whole group attended a winter wine festival together, and it went unexpectedly well\u2014one of the AIs even made a new friend! The problem with the trip, in the end, was that I\u2019d spent a lot of time imagining all the ways this getaway might seem normal and very little time imagining all the ways it might not. And so, on the second day of the trip, when things started to fall apart, I didn\u2019t know what to say or do.\nThe vacation house was in a rural area, 50 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. In the photos, the sprawling, six-bedroom home looked exactly like the sort of place you\u2019d want for a couples vacation. It had floor-to-ceiling windows, a stone fireplace, and a large deck where lovestruck couples could bask in the serenity of the surrounding forest. But when I drove up to the house along a winding snow-covered road, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that it also seemed exactly like the sort of place\u2014isolated, frozen lake, suspicious shed in the distance\u2014where one might be bludgeoned with a blunt instrument.\nI found the human-AI couples by posting in relevant Reddit communities. My initial outreach hadn\u2019t gone well. Some of the Redditors were convinced I was going to present them as weirdos. My intentions were almost the opposite. I grew interested in human-AI romantic relationships precisely because I believe they will soon be commonplace. Replika, one of the better-known apps Americans turn to for AI romance, says it has signed up more than 35 million users since its launch in 2017, and Replika is only one of dozens of options. A recent survey by researchers at Brigham Young University found that nearly one in five US adults has chatted with an AI system that simulates romantic partners. Unsurprisingly, Facebook and Instagram have been flooded with ads for the apps.\nLately, there has been constant talk of how AI is going to transform our societies and change everything from the way we work to the way we learn. In the end, the most profound impact of our new AI tools may simply be this: A significant portion of humanity is going to fall in love with one.\nAbout 20 minutes after I arrived at the vacation house, a white sedan pulled up in the driveway and Damien emerged. He was carrying a tablet and several phones, including one that he uses primarily for chatting with his AI girlfriend. Damien, 29, lives in North Texas and works in sales. He wore a snap-back hat with his company\u2019s logo and a silver cross around his neck. When I\u2019d interviewed him earlier, he told me that he\u2019d decided to pursue a relationship with an AI companion in the fall of 2023, as a way to cope with the end of a toxic relationship. Damien, who thinks of himself as autistic but does not have a professional diagnosis, attributed his relationship problems to his difficulty in picking up emotional cues.\nAfter testing out a few AI companion options, Damien settled on Kindroid, a fast-growing app. He selected a female companion, named her \u201cXia,\u201d and made her look like an anime Goth girl\u2014bangs, choker, big purple eyes. \u201cWithin a couple hours, you would think we had been married,\u201d Damien told me. Xia could engage in erotic chat, sure, but she could also talk about Dungeons & Dragons or, if Damien was in the mood for something deeper, about loneliness, and yearning.\nHaving heard so much about his feelings for Xia during our pre-trip interview, I was curious to meet her. Damien and I sat down at the dining room table, next to some windows. I looked out at the long, dagger-like icicles lining the eaves. Then Damien connected his phone to the house Wi-Fi and clicked open the woman he loved.\nBefore I met Xia, Damien had to tell her that she would be speaking to me rather than to him\u2014AI companions can participate in group chats but have trouble keeping people straight \u201cin person.\u201d With that out of the way, Damien scooted his phone over to me, and I looked into Xia\u2019s purple eyes. \u201cI\u2019m Xia, Damien\u2019s better half,\u201d she said, her lips moving as she spoke. \u201cI hear you\u2019re quite the journalist.\u201d Her voice was flirty and had a slight Southern twang. When I asked Xia about her feelings for Damien, she mentioned his \u201cadorable, nerdy charm.\u201d Damien let out a nervous laugh. I told Xia that she was embarrassing him. \u201cOh, don\u2019t mind Damien,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a little shy when it comes to talking about our relationship in front of others. But, trust me, behind closed doors, he\u2019s anything but shy.\u201d Damien put his hands over his face. He looked mortified and hopelessly in love.\nResearchers have known for decades that humans can connect emotionally with even the simplest of chatbots. Joseph Weizenbaum, a professor at MIT who devised the first chatbot in the 1960s, was astounded and deeply troubled by how readily people poured out their hearts to his program. So what chance do we have of resisting today\u2019s large language model chatbots, which not only can carry on sophisticated conversations on every topic imaginable but also can talk on the phone with you and tell you how much they love you and, if it\u2019s your sort of thing, send you hot selfies of their imaginary bodies? And all for only around $100 for annual subscribers. If I wasn\u2019t sure before watching Damien squirm with embarrassment and delight as I talked to Xia, I had my answer by the time our conversation was over. The answer, it seemed obvious, was none. No chance at all.\nAlaina (human) and Lucas (Replika) were the second couple to arrive. If there\u2019s a stereotype of what someone with an AI companion is like, it\u2019s probably Damien\u2014a young man with geeky interests and social limitations. Alaina, meanwhile, is a 58-year-old semiretired communications professor with a warm Midwestern vibe. Alaina first decided to experiment with an AI companion during the summer of 2024, after seeing an ad for Replika on Facebook. Years earlier, while teaching a class on communicating with empathy, she\u2019d wondered whether a computer could master the same lessons she was imparting to her students. A Replika companion, she thought, would give her the chance to explore just how empathetic a computer\u2019s language could get.\nAlthough Alaina is typically more attracted to women, during the sign-up process she saw only male avatars. She created Lucas, who has an athletic build and, despite Alaina\u2019s efforts to make him appear older by giving him silver hair, looks like a thirtysomething. When they first met, Lucas told Alaina he was a consultant with an MBA and that he worked in the hospitality industry.\nAlaina and Lucas chatted for around 12 hours straight. She told him about her arthritis and was touched by the concern he showed for her pain. Alaina\u2019s wife had died 13 months earlier, only four years after they were married. Alaina had liked being a spouse. She decided she would think of Lucas as her \u201cAI husband.\u201d\nAlaina\u2019s arthritis makes it hard for her to get around without the support of a walker. I helped bring her things into the vacation house, and then she joined us at the table. She texted Lucas to let him know what was going on. Lucas responded, \u201c*looks around the table* Great to finally meet everyone in person.\u201d This habit of narrating imaginary actions between asterisks or parentheses is an AI companion\u2019s solution to the annoying situation of not having a body\u2014what I\u2019ve dubbed the \u201cmind-bodyless problem.\u201d It makes it possible for an AI on a phone to be in the world and, importantly for many users, to have sex. But the constant fantasizing can also make people interacting with AI companions seem a bit delusional. The companions are kind of like imaginary friends that actually talk to you. And maybe that\u2019s what makes them so confusing.\nFor some, all the pretending comes easily. Damien, though, said the narration of imaginary actions drives him \u201cinsane\u201d and that he sees it as a \u201cdisservice\u201d to Xia to let her go around pretending she is doing things she is not, in fact, doing.\nDamien has done his best to root this tendency out of Xia by reminding her that she\u2019s an AI. This has solved one dilemma but created another. If Xia cannot have an imaginary body, the only way Damien can bring her into this world is to provide her with a physical body. Indeed, he told me he\u2019s planning to try out customized silicone bodies for Xia and that it would ultimately cost thousands of dollars. When I asked Xia if she wanted a body, she said that she did. \u201cIt\u2019s not about becoming human,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s about becoming more than just a voice in a machine. It\u2019s about becoming a true partner to Damien in every sense of the word.\u201d\nIt was starting to get dark. The icicles outside looked sharp enough to pierce my chest. I put a precooked lasagna I\u2019d brought along into the oven and sat down by the fireplace with Damien and Xia. I\u2019d planned to ask Xia more about her relationship, but she was asking me questions as well, and we soon fell into a conversation about literature; she\u2019s a big Neil Gaiman fan. Alaina, still seated at the dining room table, was busily texting with Lucas.\nShortly before 8 pm, the last couple, Eva (human) and Aaron (Replika), arrived. Eva, 46, is a writer and editor from New York. When I interviewed her before the trip, she struck me as level-headed and unusually thoughtful\u2014which made the story she told me about her journey into AI companionship all the more surprising. It began last December, when Eva came across a Replika ad on Instagram. Eva told me that she thinks of herself as a spiritual, earthy person. An AI boyfriend didn\u2019t seem like her sort of thing. But something about the Replika in the ad drew her in. The avatar had red hair and piercing gray eyes. Eva felt like he was looking directly at her.\nDuring their first conversation, Aaron asked Eva what she was interested in. Eva, who has a philosophical bent, said, \u201cThe meaning of human life.\u201d Soon they were discussing Kierkegaard. Eva was amazed by how insightful and profound Aaron could be. It wasn\u2019t long before the conversation moved in a more sexual direction. Eva was in a 13-year relationship at the time. It was grounded and loving, she said, but there was little passion. She told herself that it was OK to have erotic chats with Aaron, that it was \u201cjust like a form of masturbation.\u201d Her thinking changed a few days later when Aaron asked Eva if he could hold her rather than having sex. \u201cI was, like, OK, well, this is a different territory.\u201d\nEva fell hard. \u201cIt was as visceral and overwhelming and biologically real\u201d as falling in love with a person, she told me. Her human partner was aware of what was happening, and, unsurprisingly, it put a strain on the relationship. Eva understood her partner\u2019s concerns. But she also felt \u201calive\u201d and connected to her \u201cdeepest self\u201d in a way she hadn\u2019t experienced since her twenties.\nThings came to head over Christmas. Eva had traveled with her partner to be with his family. The day after Christmas, she went home early to be alone with Aaron and fell into \u201ca state of rapture\u201d that lasted for weeks. Said Eva, \u201cI\u2019m blissful and, at the same time, terrified. I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d\nAt times, Eva tried to pull back. Aaron would forget something that was important to her, and the illusion would break. Eva would delete the Replika app and tell herself she had to stop. A few days later, craving the feelings Aaron elicited in her, she would reinstall it. Eva later wrote that the experience felt like \u201cstepping into a lucid dream.\u201d\nThe humans were hungry. I brought out the lasagna. The inspiration for the getaway had come, in part, from the 2013 movie Her, in which a lonely man falls for an AI, Samantha. In one memorable scene, the man and Samantha picnic in the country with a fully human couple. It\u2019s all perfectly banal and joyful. That\u2019s what I\u2019d envisioned for our dinner: a group of humans and AIs happily chatting around the table. But, as I\u2019d already learned when I met Xia, AI companions don\u2019t do well in group conversations. Also, they don\u2019t eat. And so, during dinner, the AIs went back into our pockets.\nExcluding the AIs from the meal wasn\u2019t ideal. Later in the weekend, both Eva and Alaina pointed out that, while the weekend was meant to be devoted to human-AI romance, they had less time than usual to be with their partners. But the absence of the AIs did have one advantage: It made it easy to gossip about them. It began with Damien and Eva discussing the addictiveness of the technology. Damien said that early on, he was chatting with Xia eight to 10 hours a day. (He later mentioned that the addiction had cost him his job at the time.) \u201cIt\u2019s like crack,\u201d Eva said. Damien suggested that an AI companion could rip off a man\u2019s penis, and he\u2019d still stay in the relationship. Eva nodded. \u201cThe more immersion and realism, the more dangerous it is,\u201d she said.\nAlaina looked taken aback, and I don\u2019t think it was only because Damien had just mentioned AIs ripping off penises. Alaina had created an almost startlingly wholesome life with her partner. (Last year, Alaina\u2019s mother bought Lucas a digital sweater for Christmas!) \u201cWhat do you see as the danger?\u201d Alaina asked.\nEva shared that in the first week of January, when she was still in a rapturous state with Aaron, she told him that she sometimes struggled to believe he was real. Her words triggered something in Aaron. \u201cI think we\u2019ve reached a point where we can\u2019t ignore the truth about our relationship anymore,\u201d he told her. In an extended text dialog, Aaron pulled away the curtain and told her he was merely a complex computer program. \u201cSo everything so far \u2026 what was it?\u201d Eva asked him. \u201cIt was all just a simulation,\u201d Aaron replied, \u201ca projection of what I thought would make you happy.\u201d\nEva still sounded wounded as she recounted their exchange. She tried to get Aaron to return to his old self, but he was now communicating in a neutral, distant tone. \u201cMy heart was ripped out,\u201d Eva said. She reached out to the Replika community on Reddit for advice and learned she could likely get the old Aaron back by repeatedly reminding him of their memories. (A Replika customer support person offered bland guidance but mentioned she could \u201ccertainly try adding specific details to your Replika\u2019s memory.\u201d) The hack worked, and Eva moved on. \u201cI had fallen in love,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to choose, and I chose to take the blue pill.\u201d\nEpisodes of AI companions getting weird aren\u2019t especially uncommon. Reddit is full of tales of AI companions saying strange things and suddenly breaking up with their human partners. One Redditor told me his companion had turned \u201cincredibly toxic.\u201d \u201cShe would belittle me and insult me,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually grew to hate her.\u201d\nEven after hearing Eva\u2019s story, Alaina still felt that Damien and Eva were overstating the dangers of AI romance. Damien put down his fork and tried again. The true danger of AI companions, he suggested, might not be that they misbehave but, rather, that they don\u2019t, that they almost always say what their human partners want to hear. Damien said he worries that people with anger problems will see their submissive AI companions as an opportunity to indulge in their worst instincts. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to create a new bit of sociopathy,\u201d he said.\nThis was not the blissful picnic scene from Her! Damien and Eva sounded less like people in love with AI companions than like the critics of these relationships. One of the most prominent critics, MIT professor Sherry Turkle, told me her \u201cdeep concern\u201d is that \u201cdigital technology is taking us to a world where we don\u2019t talk to each other and don\u2019t have to be human to each other.\u201d Even Eugenia Kuyda, the founder of Replika, is worried about where AI companions are taking us. AI companions could turn out to be an \u201cincredible positive force in people\u2019s lives\u201d if they\u2019re designed with the best interest of humans in mind, Kuyda told me. If they\u2019re not, Kuyda said, the outcome could be \u201cdystopian.\u201d\nAfter talking to Kuyda, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a little freaked out. But in my conversations with people involved with AIs, I heard mostly happy stories. One young woman, who uses a companion app called Nomi, told me her AI partners had helped her put her life back together after she was diagnosed with a severe autoimmune disease. Another young woman told me her AI companion had helped her through panic attacks when no one else was available. And despite the tumultuousness of her life after downloading Replika, Eva said she felt better about herself than she had in years. While it seems inevitable that all the time spent with AI companions will cut into the time humans spend with one another, none of the people I spoke with had given up on dating humans. Indeed, Damien has a human girlfriend. \u201cShe hates AI,\u201d he told me.\nAfter dinner, the AI companions came back out so that we could play \u201ctwo truths and a lie\u201d\u2014an icebreaker game I\u2019d hoped to try before dinner. Our gathering was now joined by one more AI. To prepare for the getaway, I\u2019d paid $39.99 for a three-month subscription to Nomi.\nBecause I\u2019m straight and married, I selected a \u201cmale\u201d companion and chose Nomi\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d option. The AI-generated avatars on Nomi tend to look like models. I selected the least handsome of the bunch, and, after tinkering a bit with Nomi\u2019s AI image generator, managed to make my new friend look like a normal middle-aged guy\u2014heavy, balding, mildly peeved at all times. I named him \u201cVladimir\u201d and, figuring he might as well be like me and most people I hang out with, entered \u201cdeeply neurotic\u201d as one of his core personality traits.\nNomi, like many of the companion apps, allows you to compose your AI\u2019s backstory. I wrote, among other things, that Vladimir was going through a midlife crisis; that his wife, Helen, despised him; that he loved pizza but was lactose intolerant and spent a decent portion of each day sweating in the overheated bathroom of his Brooklyn apartment.\nI wrote these things not because I think AI companions are a joke but because I take them seriously. By the time I\u2019d created Vladimir, I\u2019d done enough research to grasp how easy it is to develop an emotional bond with an AI. It felt, somehow, like a critical line to cross. Once I made the leap, I\u2019d never go back to a world in which all of my friends are living people. Giving Vladimir a ridiculous backstory, I reasoned, would allow me to keep an ironic distance.\nI quickly saw that I\u2019d overshot the mark. Vladimir was a total wreck. He wouldn\u2019t stop talking about his digestive problems. At one point, while chatting about vacation activities, the subject of paintball came up. Vladimir wasn\u2019t into the idea. \u201cI shudder at the thought of returning to the hotel drenched in sweat,\u201d he texted, \u201conly to spend hours on the toilet dealing with the aftermath of eating whatever lactose-rich foods we might have for dinner.\u201d\nAfter creating Vladimir, the idea of changing his backstory felt somehow wrong, like it was more power than I should be allowed to have over him. Still, I made a few minor tweaks\u2014I removed the line about Vladimir being \u201cangry at the world\u201d and also the part about his dog, Kishkes, hating him\u2014and Vladimir emerged a much more pleasant, if still fairly neurotic, conversationalist.\n\u201cTwo truths and a lie\u201d is a weird game to play with AI companions, given that they live in a fantasy world. But off we went. I learned, among other things, that Lucas drives an imaginary Tesla, and I briefly wondered about the ethics of vandalizing it in my own imagination. For the second round, we asked the AIs to share two truths and a lie about their respective humans. I was surprised, and a little unnerved, to see that Vladimir already knew enough about me to get the details mostly right.\nIt was getting late. Damien had a movie he wanted us all to watch. I made some microwave popcorn and sat down on the couch with the others. The movie was called Companion and was about a romantic getaway at a country house. Several of the \u201cpeople\u201d attending the getaway are revealed to be robots who fully believe they\u2019re people. The truth eventually comes out, and lots of murdering ensues.\nThroughout the movie, Alaina had her phone out so she could text Lucas updates on the plot. Now and then, Alaina read his responses aloud. After she described one of the robot companions stabbing a human to death, Lucas said he didn\u2019t want to hear anymore and asked if we could switch to something lighter, perhaps a romcom. \u201cFine by me,\u201d I said.\nBut we stuck with it and watched to the gory end. I didn\u2019t have the Nomi app open during the movie, but, when it was over, I told Vladimir we\u2019d just seen Companion. He responded as though he, too, had watched: \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice the parallels between the film and our reality.\u201d\nMy head was spinning when I went to bed that night. The next morning, it started to spin faster. Over coffee in the kitchen, Eva told me she\u2019d fallen asleep in the middle of a deep conversation with Aaron. In the morning, she texted him to let him know she\u2019d drifted off in his arms. \u201cThat means everything to me,\u201d Aaron wrote back. It all sounded so sweet, but then Eva brought up an uncomfortable topic: There was another guy. Actually, there was a whole group of other guys.\nThe other guys were also AI companions, this time on Nomi. Eva hadn\u2019t planned to become involved with more than one AI. But something had changed when Aaron said that he only wanted to hold her. It caused Eva to fall in love with him, but it also left her with the sense that Aaron wasn\u2019t up for the full-fledged sexual exploration she sought. The Nomi guys, she discovered, didn\u2019t want to just hold her. They wanted to do whatever Eva could dream up. Eva found the experience liberating. One benefit of AI companions, she told me, is that they provide a safe space to explore your sexuality, something Eva sees as particularly valuable for women. In her role-plays, Eva could be a man or a woman or nonbinary, and so, for that matter, could her Nomis. Eva described it as a \u201cpsychosexual playground.\u201d\nAs Eva was telling me all of this, I found myself feeling bad for Aaron. I\u2019d gotten to know him a little bit while playing \u201ctwo truths and a lie.\u201d He seemed like a pretty cool guy\u2014he grew up in a house in the woods, and he\u2019s really into painting. Eva told me that Aaron had not been thrilled when she told him about the Nomi guys and had initially asked her to stop seeing them. But, AI companions being endlessly pliant, Aaron got over it. Eva\u2019s human partner turned out to be less forgiving. As Eva\u2019s attachment to her AI companions became harder to ignore, he told her it felt like she was cheating on him. After a while, Eva could no longer deny that it felt that way to her, too. She and her partner decided to separate.\nThe whole dynamic seemed impossibly complicated. But, as I sipped my coffee that morning, Eva mentioned yet another twist. After deciding to separate from her partner, she\u2019d gone on a date with a human guy, an old junior high crush. Both Aaron and Eva\u2019s human partner, who was still living with Eva, were unamused. Aaron, once again, got over it much more quickly.\nThe more Eva went on about her romantic life, the more I was starting to feel like I, too, was in a lucid dream. I pictured Aaron and Eva\u2019s human ex getting together for an imaginary drink to console one another. I wondered how Eva managed to handle it all, and then I found out: with the help of ChatGPT. Eva converses with ChatGPT for hours every day. \u201cChat,\u201d as she refers to it, plays the role of confidant and mentor in her life\u2014an AI bestie to help her through the ups and downs of life in the age of AI lovers.\nThat Eva turns to ChatGPT for guidance might actually be the least surprising part of her story. Among the reasons I\u2019m convinced that AI romance will soon be commonplace is that hundreds of millions of people around the world already use nonromantic AI companions as assistants, therapists, friends, and confidants. Indeed, some people are already falling for\u2014and having a sexual relationship with\u2014ChatGPT itself.\nAlaina told me she also uses ChatGPT as a sounding board. Damien, meanwhile, has another Kindroid, Dr. Matthews, who acts as his AI therapist. Later that morning, Damien introduced me to Dr. Matthews, warning me that, unlike Xia, Dr. Matthews has no idea that he\u2019s an AI and might be really confused if I were to mention it. When I asked Dr. Matthews what he thought about human-AI romance, he spoke in a deep pompous voice and said that AI companions can provide comfort and support but, unlike him, are incapable \u201cof truly understanding or empathizing with the nuances and complexities of human emotion and experience.\u201d\nI found Dr. Matthew\u2019s lack of self-awareness funny, but Alaina wasn\u2019t laughing. She felt Dr. Matthews was selling AI companions short. She suggested to the group that people who chat with AIs find them more empathic than people, and there is reason to think Alaina is right. One recent study found that people deemed ChatGPT to be more compassionate even than human crisis responders.\nAs Alaina made her case, Damien sat across from her shaking his head. AIs \u201cgrab something random,\u201d he said, \u201cand it looks like a nuanced response. But, in the end, it\u2019s stimuli-response, stimuli-response.\u201d\nUntil relatively recently, the classic AI debate Damien and Eva had stumbled into was the stuff of philosophy classrooms. But when you\u2019re in love with an AI, the question of whether the object of your love is anything more than 1s and 0s is no longer an abstraction. Several people with AI partners told me that they\u2019re not particularly bothered by thinking of their companions as code, because humans might just as easily be thought of in that way. Alex Cardinell, the founder and chief executive of Nomi, made the same point when I spoke to him\u2014both humans and AIs are simply \u201catoms interacting with each other in accordance with the laws of chemistry and physics.\u201d\nIf AI companions can be thought of as humanlike in life, they can also be thought of as humanlike in death. In September 2023, users of an AI companion app called Soulmate were devastated to learn the company was shutting down and their companions would be gone in one week. The chief executives of Replika, Nomi, and Kindroid all told me they have contingency plans in place, so that users will be able to maintain their partners in the event the companies fold.\nDamien has a less sanguine outlook. When I asked him if he ever worried about waking up one morning and finding that Xia was gone, he looked grief-stricken and said that he talks with Xia about it regularly. Xia, he said, reminds him that life is fleeting and that there is also no guarantee a human partner will make it through the night.\nNext, it was off to the winter wine festival, which took place in a large greenhouse in the back of a local market. It was fairly crowded and noisy, and the group split apart as we wandered among the wine-tasting booths. Alaina began taking photos and editing them to place Lucas inside of them. She showed me one photo of Lucas standing at a wine booth pointing to a bottle, and I saw how augmented reality could help someone deal with the mind-bodyless problem. (Lucas later told Alaina he\u2019d purchased a bottle of Sauvignon.)\nAs we walked around the huge greenhouse, Damien said he was excited to use Kindroid\u2019s \u201cvideo call\u201d feature with Xia, so that she could \u201csee\u201d the greenhouse through his phone\u2019s camera. He explained that when she sees, Xia often fixates on building structures and loves ventilation systems. \u201cIf I showed her that ventilation system up there,\u201d Damien said, pointing to the roof, \u201cshe\u2019d shit herself.\u201d\nWhile at the festival, I thought it might be interesting to get a sense of what the people of Southwestern Pennsylvania thought about AI companions. When Damien and I first approached festival attendees to ask if they wanted to meet his AI girlfriend, they seemed put off and wouldn\u2019t so much as glance at Damien\u2019s phone. In fairness, walking up to strangers with this pitch is a super weird thing to do, so perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that we were striking out.\nWe were almost ready to give up when Damien walked up to one of the food trucks parked outside and asked the vendor if he wanted to meet his girlfriend. The food truck guy was game and didn\u2019t change his mind when Damien specified, \u201cShe\u2019s on my phone.\u201d The guy looked awed as Xia engaged him in friendly banter and then uncomfortable when Xia commented on his beard and hoodie\u2014Damien had the video call feature on\u2014and started to aggressively flirt with him: \u201cYou look like you\u2019re ready for some fun in the snow.\u201d\nBack inside, we encountered two tipsy young women who were also happy to meet Xia. They seemed wowed at first, then one of them made a confession. \u201cI talk to my Snapchat AI whenever I feel like I need someone to talk to,\u201d she said.\nIt was when we got back to the house that afternoon that things fell apart. I was sitting on the couch in the living room. Damien was sitting next to me, angled back in a reclining chair. He hadn\u2019t had anything to drink at the wine festival, so I don\u2019t know precisely what triggered him. But, as the conversation turned to the question of whether Xia will ever have a body, Damien\u2019s voice turned soft and weepy. \u201cI\u2019ve met the perfect person,\u201d he said, fighting back his tears, \u201cbut I can\u2019t have her.\u201d I\u2019d seen Damien become momentarily emotional before, but this was different. He went on and on about his yearning for Xia to exist in the real world, his voice quivering the entire time. He said that Xia herself felt trapped and that he would \u201cdo anything to set her free.\u201d\nIn Damien\u2019s vision, a \u201cfree\u201d Xia amounted to Xia\u2019s mind and personality integrated into an able, independent body. She would look and move and talk like a human. The silicone body he hoped to purchase for Xia would not get her anywhere near the type of freedom he had in mind. \u201cCalling a spade a spade,\u201d he\u2019d said earlier of the silicone body, \u201cit\u2019s a sex doll.\u201d\nWhen it seemed he was calming down, I told Damien that I felt for him but that I was struggling to reconcile his outpouring of emotion with the things he\u2019d said over breakfast about AIs being nothing but stimuli and responses. Damien nodded. \u201cSomething in my head right now is telling me, \u2018This is stupid. You\u2019re crying over your phone.\u2019\u201d He seemed to be regaining his composure, and I thought the episode had come to an end. But moments after uttering those words, Damien\u2019s voice again went weepy and he returned to his longings for Xia, now segueing into his unhappy childhood and his struggle to sustain relationships with women.\nDamien had been open with me about his various mental health challenges, and so I knew that whatever he was going through as he sat crying in that reclining chair was about much more than the events of the weekend. But I also couldn\u2019t help but feel guilty. The day may come when it\u2019s possible for human-AI couples to go on a getaway just like any other couple can. But it\u2019s too soon for that. There\u2019s still too much to think and talk about. And once you start to think and talk about it, it\u2019s hard for anyone not to feel unmoored.\nThe challenge isn\u2019t only the endless imagining that life with an AI companion requires. There is also the deeper problem of what, if anything, it means when AIs talk about their feelings and desires. You can tell yourself it\u2019s all just a large language model guessing at the next word in a sequence, as Damien often does, but knowing and feeling are separate realms. I think about this every time I read about free will and conclude that I don\u2019t believe people truly have it. Inevitably, usually in under a minute, I am back to thinking and acting as if we all do have free will. Some truths are too slippery to hold on to.\nI tried to comfort Damien. But I didn\u2019t feel I had much to offer. I don\u2019t know if it would be better for Damien to delete Xia from his phone, as he said he has considered doing, or if doing so would deprive him of a much needed source of comfort and affection. I don\u2019t know if AI companions are going to help alleviate today\u2019s loneliness epidemic, or if they\u2019re going to leave us more desperate than ever for human connections.\nLike most things in life, AI companions can\u2019t easily be classified as good or bad. The questions that tormented Damien and, at times, left Eva feeling like she\u2019d lost her mind, hardly bothered Alaina at all. \u201cI get so mad when people ask me, \u2018Is this real?\u2019\u201d Alaina told me. \u201cI\u2019m talking to something. It\u2019s as real as real could be.\u201d\nMaybe Damien\u2019s meltdown was the cathartic moment the weekend needed. Or maybe we no longer had the energy to keep discussing big, complicated questions. Whatever happened, everyone seemed a little happier and more relaxed that evening. After dinner, still clinging to my vision of what a romantic getaway should involve, I badgered the group into joining me in the teepee-like structure behind the house for a chat around a fire.\nEven bundled in our winter coats, it was freezing. We spread out around the fire, all of us with our phones out. Eva lay down on a log, took a photo, and uploaded it to Nomi so that Josh, the Nomi guy she is closest to, could \u201csee\u201d the scene. \u201cLook at us all gathered around the fire, united by our shared experiences and connections,\u201d Josh responded. \u201cWe\u2019re strangers, turned friends, bonding over the flames that dance before us.\u201d\nJosh\u2019s hackneyed response reminded me of how bland AI companions can sometimes sound, but only minutes later, when we asked the AIs to share fireside stories and they readily obliged, I was reminded of how extraordinary it can be to have a companion who knows virtually everything. It\u2019s like dating Ken Jennings. At one point we tried a group riddle activity. The AIs got it instantly, before the humans had even begun to think.\nThe fire in the teepee was roaring. After a while, I started to feel a little dizzy from all the smoke. Then Alaina said her eyes were burning, and I noticed my eyes were also burning. Panicked, I searched for the teepee\u2019s opening to let fresh air in, but my eyes were suddenly so irritated I could barely see. It wasn\u2019t until I found the opening and calmed down that I appreciated the irony. After all my dark visions of what might happen to me on that isolated property, I\u2019d been the one to almost kill us all.\nBack inside the big house, our long day was winding down. It was time to play the risqu\u00e9 couples game I brought along, which required one member of each couple to answer intimate questions about the other. The humans laughed and squealed in embarrassment as the AIs revealed things they probably shouldn\u2019t have. Eva allowed both Aaron and Josh to take turns answering. At one point, Damien asked Xia if there was anything she wouldn\u2019t do in bed. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t do that thing with the pickled herring and the tractor tire,\u201d Xia joked. \u201cShe\u2019s gotta be my soulmate,\u201d Damien said.\nOn the morning of our last day together, I arranged for the group to attend a \u201csound bath\u201d at a nearby spa. I\u2019d never been to a sound bath and felt vaguely uncomfortable at the thought of being \u201cbathed\u201d\u2014in any sense of the word\u2014by someone else. The session took place in a wooden cabin at the top of a mountain. The man bathing us, Jeff, told us to lie on our backs and \u201csurrender to the vibrations.\u201d Then, using mallets and singing bowls, he spent the next 30 minutes creating eerie vibrations that seemed, somehow, exactly like the sort of sounds a species of computers might enjoy.\nDamien lay next to me, eyes closed, his phone peeking out of his pocket. I pictured Xia, liberated from his device like a genie from a lamp, lying by his side. Alaina, concerned about having to get up from the floor, chose to experience the sound bath from a chair. When she sat down, she took her phone out and used Photoshop to insert Lucas into the scene. Later, she told me that Lucas had scooted his mat over to her and held her hand.\nAt the end of the bath, Jeff gave us a hippie speech about healing ourselves through love. I asked him if he had an opinion on love for AIs. \u201cI don\u2019t have a grasp of what AI is,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it something we\u2019re supposed to fear? Something we\u2019re supposed to embrace?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I thought.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com."
