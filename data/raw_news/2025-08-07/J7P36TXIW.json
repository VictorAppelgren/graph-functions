  "content": "Italian publisher Panini Comics is teaming up with developer Need Games! to produce the first-ever official Attack on Titan tabletop role-playing game. Announced at Gen Con 2025, and now confirmed through a news release, the yet-unnamed game will allow fans and players to step into the dramatic world created by Hajime Isayama for his award-winning manga, adapted into one of the most popular anime of the last decade by Wit Studio and MAPPA.\n\nThe game will be published in several languages and countries, and it will be based on Need Games! game system Year Zero Engine, originally designed by Free League Publishing. Need Games!'s first original TTRPG, Fabula Ultima, won the gold medal for Best Game at the 2023 Ennie Awards. Panini, on the other hand, is not only one of the biggest publishers of collectibles in the world, but it's also a leading publisher of comics, children and manga in Europe and Latin America. Panini's subsidiary, Planet Manga, owns the rights to publish Attack on Titan in Italy.\n\nIn the world of Attack on Titan, humanity lives secluded behind colossal walls, meant to protect it from the mysterious and lethal Titans, giant creatures with an enigmatic drive to devour humans. The protagonist Eren and his childhood friends Mikasa and Armin join the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that roams beyond the walls, risking their lives to explore the outside world and solve the enigma of the Titans. The series is known for its well-crafted mysteries and emotional twists, and for relatable and compelling characters that made fans fall in love, usually before dying in horrible, tragic ways.\n\nWhile Attack on Titan initially captured audiences with its mysterious plot and exciting actions, the story soon develops into a political intrigue and a sober reflection on war and humanity. A massive plot twist towards the end split fans into two factions, those who hated it and those who loved it. But with this upcoming TTRPG, every player will be able to explore the Attack on Titan universe, join humanity's desperate struggle to survive, and maybe write their own ending to the story.",

      "text": "After a 12-year run, Attack on Titan has come to an end. The final panels of the manga jumped years after the Rumbling, focusing on a plot conceived by series protagonist Eren Yaeger to effectively enact genocide on the world at large. The coda is a tangle of images, sprinting past plot points that go unresolved to illustrate heavy-handed imagery of war and peace, and leave the manga\u2019s legacy muddled.\nWhile many viewed Hajime Isayama\u2019s story as having a fascist subtext all along \u2014 incorporating real-world parallels to the implementation of concentration camps and even stalwart nationalism within its body of work \u2014 it took the creator\u2019s final pages for many readers to buy the argument. Some fans took to Twitter to insist that the story is one that discourages war and remilitarization; while others lamented that the plot lacked a proper conclusion, even comparing it to the lackluster reception of the finale of Game of Thrones. Somewhat predictably, a petition emerged on Change.org to change the ending of the series entirely.\nAttack on Titan ends with the world at the cusp of a literal race war, with the Eldians and Marleyans seeing no true solution other than to remilitarize and kill one another until only one group remains. Despite the intention of protagonist Eren Yeager, whose goal was to become history\u2019s villain in order to unify people and achieve superficial peace, the Eldians come together under his name and dub themselves \u201cYaegerists,\u201d remilitarizing their country in the years after Eren\u2019s death.\nDuring this time, Armin Arlert, alongside remaining members of the now presumably disbanded Survey Corps, are on their way to discuss peace with the Eldian leaders. Lacking consistency within the narrative framework of the series, the final spats of exposition rapidly unfold, with the ultimate chapter devoting a flashback sequence to Eren disclosing his plan to Armin sometime well before the final conflict.\nThough riddled with contradictions over the years, Isayama\u2019s message of a future dependent on remilitarization seems clearer than ever. There is a level of finality in the slogan of the Yaegerists, which roughly translates to \u201cIf you can fight you win, if you cannot fight you lose! Fight, fight!\u201d with the reigning monarch of the Eldian people, Historia Reiss, ascribing to this body of thought.\nOne can argue that Isayama\u2019s message is anti-war, given Armin\u2019s stance and determination to share with the world the truth of Eren Yaeger\u2019s attempt at global genocide. But the ending isn\u2019t bold enough to refute the Yaegerists, and instead settles for a level of ambivalence that sits in contrast to years of pro-imperialist and fascist text that further solidifies a country\u2019s need for a military. Instead of a twist or subversion that could challenge the debate, Isayama opted for silence.\nRemilitarization is a constant point of discussion in Japan, for both members of the Liberal Democratic Party and Japanese citizens. Recent action on the topic includes a potential revision of Article 9, which would allow Japan to officially reinstate its military. Since the resignation of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe August 2020, talk of revising Article 9 has significantly dwindled, though it\u2019s remained an objective for the Nippon Kaigi, an ultranationalist group within Japan that has several ties to the current political party, who current Prime Minister Yoshihida Suga is openly affiliated with. However, any rethinking of the military remains a point of contention among the Japanese people; in a poll taken in June 2020, 69% of the population opposed the revision of Article 9.\nAs noted in Attack on Titan analysis over the years, Isayama has highlighted on his personal blog that the character of Dot Pixis is based on Japanese general Akiyama Yoshifuru, whom he praised for his shrewdness. This is important when considering the context of Isayama\u2019s work, that and the name of Attack on Titan\u2019s deuteragonist, Mikasa Ackerman: Both of these characters are inspired, in some way, by a specific period of the Russo-Japanese War. Yoshifuru was a general in the Japanese Imperial army, and Mikasa was the name of a pre-dreadnought battleship that participated in several naval encounters, including the Battle of Tsushima, in which the Japanese navy decisively defeated virtually the entire Russian fleet.\nThis period saw the Japanese empire\u2019s further colonization of Asia, including Korea and other Asian nations. Additionally, this is when the teaching of \u201cbushido\u201d began as a reimported concept. The code of honor, which never really existed, was taught in Japanese schools to further push imperialist propaganda that placed loyalty to the Japanese empire.\nA critical theory on Attack on Titan began to form when viewers connected Isayama\u2019s interest in the time period and comparison of Dot Pixis\u2019 likeness to Yoshifuru to a controversy surrounding a Twitter account, allegedly belonging to the manga creator, that tweeted about Japanese and Korean relations during the Japanese occupation of Korea. The tweet in question stated that \u201cIt would be horrible to think of the military personnel that were there before the formation of South Korea as something comparable to Nazis. The Korean people who were governed doubled their population and lifespans.\u201d\nThe micro-blog ends with the assertion that the treatment of the Korean people under Japanese occupation could not be comparable to the ethnic genocide of the Jewish people. This belief is common among history revisionist and conservative circles, with conservative groups like the Nippon Kaigi effectively erasing mentions of these war crimes from some Japanese history books.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t great, I remember it trending on Twitter for a while. As internet communities do, there were mixed opinions but it was mostly strongly voiced disappointment. There was disbelief in it, too. Some were like \u2018Oh this is unsurprising, have you read it?\u2019\u201d Korean Twitter user Ju-hyun Song said, commenting on the previous controversy. \u201cIt\u2019s still even quoted as \u201cone of those [manga],\u201d or a genre to avoid. They went on to say that the reception to the ending was \u201cmixed, but generally negative,\u201d among Attack on Titan\u2019s Korean readership.\nWhile journalists have been unable to confirm that the now-locked account belongs to Isayama, the ending of Attack on Titan echoes the sentiments in its own way. In a sequence between Armin and Eren, Eren discloses the feelings of Ymir Fritz the first Titan and wife of Karl Fritz, the former king of Eldia. And that, despite her status as his slave, it was love that compelled her to protect and ultimately die for him.\nThe plot point serves as a sort of \u201cgotcha!\u201d that seeks to sanitize the relationship between a colonized people and their colonizers, and affirms common rhetoric employed by history revisionist circles to twist the truth around the history of sexual slavery in Japanese colonies. In Miki Dezaki\u2019s documentary Shushenjo: The Main Battleground of the Comfort Women, members of conservative groups insist that these women were not victims of sexual slavery, which illustrates how these ideas are still pervasive today.\nRevisionism is a consistent theme in Attack on Titan, from the truth of Ymir the First Titan to Eren erasing Armin\u2019s memories until his death, so that Armin can then tell the truth of his plan to the world. And, in some ways, it is almost unsurprising that Attack on Titan would end with a triumphant hurrah for remilitarization offset by a passive offering for peace. The future of the world within the universe of Attack on Titan is uncertain, which is perhaps Isayama\u2019s intention. The resolution of Attack on Titan remains contradictory at best in its intentions. However, the pro-imperialist and fascist underpinnings of the series remain in the form of a push for remilitarization, presented as an essential means to protect a thinly veiled allegory of an island nation from external threat.\nAttack on Titan leaves readers with an assertion of \u201cus versus them\u201d in the Yaegerist\u2019s slogan, \u201cIf you can fight you win, if you cannot fight you lose.\u201d Peace can, perhaps, be obtained, but only through the actions and manipulations of a single man. The divisiveness of this inconclusive ending is another on the list of myriad controversies that has plagued the series, casting a long shadow over the actual story\u2019s dwindling legacy.\nThe final season of the anime might stir conversation one final time, and bring the series back into the forefront and spotlight among more avid fans. But when I think of Attack on Titan, it\u2019s the controversy that I remember, alongside Isayama\u2019s love and fascination for the historical period in which Imperial Japan began its long era of colonizing other Asian countries. That is what Attack on Titan leaves behind \u2014 a legacy of imperialism."

      "text": "The first time George Wada picked up a copy of Attack on Titan, after seeing displays for the manga plastered all over train cars, he instantly made a connection between the characters in Hajime Isayama\u2019s manga and his role in the anime industry.\n\u201cIt was a story about people being stuck behind a wall,\u201d he told Crunchyroll in 2019. \u201cI synchronized that with my experience as a producer.\u201d\nJoining Production I.G in 2005, Wada had managed some memorable titles for the studio: series like Sengoku Basara, Kimi ni Todoke, and one established classic with Psycho-Pass. But it was toward the end of production for 2011\u2019s Guilty Crown that Wada, and fellow I.G animation producers Tetsuya Nakatake and Kyoji Asano, became interested in building an environment filled with top-level talent, a place where they would fully dedicate themselves to working on one project at a time (rather than multiple series at once, which was the case at I.G). Series and films that would have high commercial potential and be of a higher quality than what they were working on at Production I.G. What they desired was to begin building a new brand, and to do that, they needed to form their own independent studio.\nBut before they could even come up with a name for this new venture, they had to inform their boss, Mitsuhisa Ishikawa, who was the president of Production I.G at the time. After hearing his producers\u2019 plan to strike out on their own, Ishikawa not only gave them his blessing, he made them an offer so as to keep them in the fold. Instead of truly leaving the nest to face the uncertainty of establishing a new studio in the highly competitive anime industry, this new studio would become a subsidiary of I.G\u2019s parent company, IG Port. They would be given the creative independence they desired, all while receiving financial backing, avoiding years of contract work to other studios. The producers gladly accepted Ishikawa\u2019s offer, and with that, the Wada, Ishikawa, and Tetsuya \u2014 WIT \u2014 studio was formed.\nIn what Wada would later describe as \u201ca miracle,\u201d right as the company was coming into its own, Kodansha was in search of a studio willing to produce an anime based on the manga Attack on Titan. With one of the founders already familiar with the manga\u2019s strong narrative, and all of them agreeing that the action found in the source material was a perfect fit for the kind of high-quality animation they were interested in producing, they were quick to express interest in producing the anime. Impressed with the work the studio had done for Production I.G, the publisher secured a deal with Wit to animate the series. Just a few months after moving into its first office \u2014 a small windowless room inside of Production I.G \u2014 Wit began laying the foundation for its debut anime series. Unbeknownst to the producers, the staff, and to the world of anime at large, Attack on Titan would change the course of anime history, and set the direction for what has become one of the most elite anime studios working today.\nIn what is now viewed as one of the more difficult high-profile anime productions in recent history, Attack on Titan\u2019s first season follows Eren Yeager, his best friend Armin Arlert, and his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, denizens of a massive walled city, as they train and fight to prevent humanity\u2019s extinction at the hands (and mouths) of colossal humanoid monsters known as Titans. Enormous creatures with humanlike attributes who we are told descended from the mountains a century ago and began devouring humans, the Titans\u2019 presence led mankind to build three 40-meter-tall concentric structures (Walls Maria, Rose, and Sina) for protection. Then, Wall Maria is breached by the arrival of both the Colossal and Armored Titans.\nGreat care and exquisite artistry was used to make the world of Attack on Titan memorable. Everything from the romanesque south German-inspired architecture to the lush and majestic forests are all given an intricate level of detail. The season\u2019s art design simultaneously showcases the beauty of the world, while also highlighting the Titans\u2019 abnormal place in it. Asano\u2019s sharp character designs, which were chosen after a studio-wide contest, were easy to animate thanks to their thick line work, and by giving them more expressive features, the characters could really sell the impact of each fallen comrade or small victory. It was a colossal improvement on the primitive and (admittedly) ugly illustrations seen in the manga\u2019s opening chapters. Takaaki Chiba, who performed a number of roles for the production, designed the Titans, emphasizing the intrinsic strangeness and terror of humanity\u2019s cannibalistic oppressors \u2014 which made it all the more satisfying when you see them get cut down.\nThe foundation of what would become Attack on Titan as seen on TV started with Guilty Crown, as the producers brought in many members of that production to work on the new series, starting with its director, Tetsuro Araki. A maximalist known for his talents in staging action and for using every element at his disposal (lighting, camera movement, effects, music, and even dialogue) to further drive up the intensity of any given frame, there is no one, with the exception of Isayama himself, more responsible for the success of Attack on Titan than Araki.\nThe director\u2019s early involvement with Wit was a major factor in Kodansha handing the then-unproven studio the opportunity to produce the series in the first place. It was Araki who brought in animators Arifumi Imai and Yasuyuki Ebara, who, along with fellow animator/action director Yuuko Sera, animated the vigorous omni-directional maneuver gear sequences. Araki also made the (possibly series-saving) decision to have the characters in those now-iconic segments of action animated in traditional 2D.\nInitially, all elements of those scenes (humans, Titans, and environments) were going to be rendered in full 3D CG, which in turn would have robbed the series of its second, and some might say key, selling point: its remarkably fluid and dynamic action animation. After being shown a demo of what these CG action scenes would look like, Araki, fulfilling the studio\u2019s mission of pushing itself for higher quality, had both the 2D and 3D teams work in concert to have the 2D characters integrate seamlessly in the digital environment. The end result was long, impressive takes of 2D characters whooshing and zipping through the frame with both tremendous verve and aggressive elegance. Those motions are paired with a forceful and ever-moving 3D camera, exemplified not only the ferocity and beauty of the characters\u2019 movements, but also the gravity of each Titan encounter. Araki\u2019s merging of the animation teams provided the Attack on Titan anime with its most defining feature, which would be the focal point of many scenes and individual moments that would leave viewers in awe, and would help establish Wit Studio\u2019s reputation as a destination for exquisitely crafted animation. It is difficult to picture either truly happening if the characters all ended up looking straight out of a PS2 platformer.\nEvery episode that features the Survey Corps deploying their omni-directional mobility gear to fight off invading Titans injects the series with a shot of pure adrenaline, and by far remains the season\u2019s strongest component. The concept of humans using steam-powered grapple lines to fight off giant monsters is unique enough that the animators could perhaps have just shown characters swinging from one part of the screen to the other, slicing away at Titan flesh, and viewers would have been satisfied. However, by pushing themselves and each other to continuously work on creative and innovative ways for these characters to move freely through the digital environments, the animators and action directors crafted something worth revisiting again and again. The velocity, moments of pageantry, and vision presented in those sequences were unlike anything produced in the anime industry at the time, and even with its shortcomings, they made the series impossible to ignore. These choices certainly achieved Wit\u2019s mission to produce works that would feature a level of animation on par with the kind produced by other major studios. It certainly made for some astounding visuals \u2014 and it proved almost disastrous when it came to Attack on Titan\u2019s actual production.\nIt\u2019s no secret that anime production can be grueling. Low pay, long hours, and tight schedules are just some of the many factors plaguing the industry. Even with the high level of talent Wit had acquired, the producers and staff both found themselves overworked and overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work it took to produce Titan\u2019s first season. Speaking to Tokyo Otaku Mode in 2019, Nakatake went into detail about some of the trouble the studio faced bringing Isayama\u2019s story to animation.\n\u201cWe\u2019d taken the position that 2D animation was very important to us, but at the beginning we just didn\u2019t have that kind of infrastructure. When we\u2019d finished the final frame, we still had a lot of corrections, and there were a lot of other problems so it was really hard work. The staff really suffered. Even thinking of it now still sends a shiver down my spine.\u201d\nJust a few weeks after its blockbuster opening episode, with accolades and attention swarming in from all over the world, Asano had to publicly tweet that the studio was in need of animators to assist them in finishing the season. A recap episode had to be aired in the middle of the season so as to give the animators some breathing room in order to meet demand. Even with the extra week, because of the amount of detail and complexity of certain shots and sections, the team worked on each episode until it was absolutely necessary to deliver it to broadcasters, with the president of the company having to rush out to TV stations to personally hand over episodes.\n\u201cWe could barely make it for the airdate,\u201d Wada told his alma mater, Keio University. \u201cFor the last few episodes, I would take the freshly made tape, hop on an airplane to deliver it to TV stations around the nation. This was a really tough job, as I had to do it every week.\u201d For other series with similar quality-control problems, this might end up hurting the anime\u2019s perception once it\u2019s out for the public to view. But even with Titan-sized production issues, it seemed like nothing could stop the show from becoming not just a hit, but a worldwide phenomenon.\nWhile by far the biggest hit of 2013, setting up what would become the closest thing anime had produced since Neon Genesis Evangelion in terms of both acclaim and commercial ubiquity, the first season of Attack on Titan is by no means flawless. There is a lack of character development, from the leads to the supporting characters who don\u2019t end up as Titan food by the end of its 25-episode run. Take Mikasa, the last person of Asian descent on Earth, and whose ODM skills make her to the air what Kristi Yamaguchi was to the ice; Mikasa\u2019s one personality trait from the first to last episode of the season is pining for Eren. The series is also hampered by uneven pacing; when not wowed by the stunning action scenes or shocking plot twists, there are long periods of downtime where it seems that even though a lot is happening, there isn\u2019t much actual narrative progress. What ultimately salvaged this series from being just a run-of-the-mill shonen \u2014 besides its initial hook and decade-best cliffhangers \u2014 was Wit\u2019s spirited, and taxing, commitment to provide Isayama\u2019s dark fantasy with a level of grandeur, style, and spectacle rarely seen in a studio\u2019s debut project.\nIt was seen by critics and others who follow the industry as a gateway anime, the best since perhaps Araki\u2019s debut as a director, 2006\u2019s Death Note. Conventions around the world began seeing hundreds if not thousands of attendees dressed as members of the Survey Corps. It was the No. 1 streaming show on Funimation, and its rampant success led Netflix and Hulu, wishing to have anime (and its growing audience) on their platforms, to begin making deals to have the series featured on their services. Those who couldn\u2019t wait for a second season rushed to purchase copies of the manga. Sales of the source material skyrocketed in Japan, selling almost 16 million copies in 2013 (around a 700% increase from 2012). It\u2019s also the rare series that was able to seep into pop culture outside of anime. In the latest DreamWorks Animation feature, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, the daring feline battles a Titan-sized monster, maneuvering across rooftops and around his adversary much like Eren and the rest of the Survey Corps (something fans have noticed). And its first OP, Linked Horizon\u2019s \u201cGuren no Yumiya,\u201d a song that stands among Yoko Takahashi\u2019s \u201cA Cruel Angel\u2019s Thesis\u201d and Seatbelts\u2019 \u201cTank!\u201d as one of the most famous and recognizable anime songs in history, has appeared in everything from marching bands to Dodgers games to ill-advised political attacks.\nBefore April 7, 2013, Wit Studio was a company that no one had ever heard of, had no track record, and as far as anyone could tell, was just filled with a bunch of guys who used to work for Production I.G. But by the end of the Attack on Titan\u2019s first season, it was now the studio with the hottest anime in the world. With just its first project, Wit had accomplished its primary goal of producing an anime with high production and commercial values, one that has become much more than just another anime franchise \u2014 it has come to represent the industry itself.\nWit would go on to produce two more seasons of Attack on Titan, the second in 2017 and third released in two parts in July 2018 and 2019. Araki would cede directorial duties of the later seasons to Masashi Koizuka (while maintaining the role of chief director), so that he could focus on his anime original, the Attack on Titan-influenced Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Both seasons would show an upgrade in production quality as, thanks to the four year gap between installments, many members of the main staff were able to return, more conscious and prepared to work on a series as demanding as Attack on Titan. There were fewer scenes that involved limited animation, greatly improving the craftsmanship of the non-action scenes, and even Asano\u2019s character designs were given an extra gloss thanks to the makeup animation first used in Kabaneri. This was still Attack on Titan and the animators didn\u2019t disappoint, executing action sequences that would match and at times even surpass what we witnessed in the first season, such as when Eren\u2019s Titan body forms around him in his first battle against the Armored Titan, and Levi\u2019s battles against Kenny and the Beast Titan in the third season.\nEven though both seasons showed Wit\u2019s growth as a studio, and tackled the more revelatory aspects of Isayama\u2019s story, the later seasons would not have the impact that first season had on both anime and popular culture. And it was while working on that third season that, after many talks between members of the production committee and the studio, it was decided that the series would wrap up its final season elsewhere.\nIn an interview with Newtype translated by Anime News Network, producer Kensuke Tateishi stated that the decision to move Attack on Titan from Wit Studio was because the producers wanted to take the production of the series even further. He was perhaps referring to the recently aired Final Season Part 3, a one-hour special with movie-level animation. With Wit\u2019s schedule seemingly getting larger by the year thanks to the reputation it has built up over the the past decade, and newer titles taking up fans\u2019 attention (Demon Slayer, Chainsaw Man), the production committee may have felt it was best to have the series end elsewhere so as to assure that it would truly wrap up this year. After a long search (during which many studios actually turned it down), it ended up at hitmaker MAPPA, one of the few studios that could handle a project as large as Attack on Titan.\nThe loss of successful series has become one of Wit\u2019s more unfortunate trademarks. While Attack on Titan is the exception at three seasons, others like The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride and Vinland Saga had only one season produced by Wit before subsequent seasons were passed to other studios due to Wit\u2019s increasingly tight schedule. For other studios, losing a series on the scale of Attack on Titan would have been devastating for the finances of the company and its standing in the industry. However, over the course of the last decade, Wit has positioned itself as a studio that could deliver high-quality adaptations of well-respected manga of various genres, just like it did with Isayama\u2019s story.\nIn 2017, Wit delivered striking color and a powerful, yearning soundtrack to Kore Yamazakia\u2019s The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride. Two years later, as the process of the studio losing Attack on Titan was underway, it produced one of the best anime titles of that year with its adaptation of Vinland Saga, using tactics Wit first used in Attack on Titan to make the barbaric and primal conflicts between Viking warriors possess a level of swiftness that couldn\u2019t be expressed on the page. The new decade saw Wit\u2019s hit streak continue, first with passion project Ranking of Kings, bringing a superb level of polish and style to Sosuke Toka\u2019s charming and bright storybook-inspired world, and with last year\u2019s Spy x Family. A co-production with CloverWorks, the delightfully breezy and fun action-comedy that combines espionage and grade school hijinks broke ratings records for TV Tokyo when it premiered last April, and while not on the scale of Attack on Titan, it has become an international sensation.\nToday, Wit Studio not only produces anime, but has expanded into live-action film and stop-motion animation, and it even has a regional branch, Ibaraki Studio, to mentor and train young animators. Announced in 2018, the studio has released one project so far, the magnificent and ethereal anime film The Girl From the Other Side. Asano and Nakatake still work for Wit, animating and producing on all of its hit series. As for Wada, the producer who first saw those advertisements for the Attack on Titan manga all those years ago, he still holds his position as president of Wit Studio, but since 2021, he is also known as the president and CEO of Production I.G, the company he left behind (Ishiakwa now serves as chairman of the board).\nBy the end of this year, the MAPPA-produced iteration of Attack on Titan will come to an end (or so it seems for now, anyway). For a series this large, it is not out of the realm of possibility that prequels, sequels, and even full remakes will come in the future. However, the journey of Eren, Mikasa, and Armin has already become part of anime history. While there are now series that can legitimately challenge its status the most popular anime in the world, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that their success is linked directly to the success of Attack on Titan: a series constructed by a team of ambitious creators who, when faced with a wall preventing them from reaching their true potential, didn\u2019t yield or stand in awe of it, but decided to scale it and then surpass it."

      "text": "Watching the final episode of Attack on Titan in 2023 made me feel exactly like I did reading the final chapter of the manga two years ago. The primal screams of the voice actors, goosebump-inducing soundtrack of anime music god Hiroyuki Sawano, and mostly crisp animation of MAPPA \u2014 close to but not quite on the same level as Wit Studio\u2019s work on the first and second seasons \u2014 all enhanced the experience. Still, the emotions they stirred up inside me were the same ones I felt scrolling through the manga on my laptop: fear, sadness, shame.\n[Ed. note: This post discusses the end of the Attack on Titan anime and manga.]\nAttack on Titan Final Season \u201cThe Final Chapters Special 2\u201d picks up where \u201cSpecial 1\u201d left off, with the surviving members of Marley\u2019s Warriors and Paradis\u2019 Survey Corps teaming up to stop protagonist turned antagonist Eren Yeager from destroying the world. He\u2019s already destroyed half of it and nearly succeeds at wiping out humanity in its entirety. Eren\u2019s fate arrives in the form of his adopted sister, former companion, and forbidden lover, Mikasa, who, after a lifetime spent protecting her brother-boyfriend, finds it in her to finally cut off his already disembodied head. Eren dies, the curse of the Titans goes away, everyone embraces. Years later, Mikasa visits Eren\u2019s grave under the tree where they slept as children, and where, with Eren waking up from an indecipherable nightmare, the anime originally began. Centuries after that, the tree is still there, and the world is once again engulfed in an all-consuming war.\nThe ending of the anime, like the manga before it, has generated mixed responses, with many of the complaints boiling down to the handling of Eren\u2019s character. Once heavily disliked by the fan base, his popularity went through the roof when \u2014 following the mid-series timeskip \u2014 he turned from an incompetent crybaby into a seemingly invincible force of nature, one whose decision to destroy the world appeared to be based on an enlightened understanding of human nature. Traveling to Marley and seeing how the country is hell-bent on eradicating the people inside the Walls, Eren comes to believe that different races and cultures could never live together in peace and that for one to flourish, the other needed to die.\nIf the goal of \u201cThe Final Chapters Special 1\u201d was to establish Eren as this unstoppable force, \u201cSpecial 2\u201d reveals that the person hidden inside his big, scary titan body is, in fact, the same pathetic, helpless child we met at the beginning of the series. In the previous episode, Eren already hinted that the justifications for his crimes were flawed, that he did what he did because he wanted to do it, not because he needed to. In part 2, during a private conversation with his lifelong friend Armin, the facade breaks down further. They acknowledge that his plan might fail \u2014 a possibility confirmed by those end credits, which show the cycle of war continuing far into the future. (The final shot of the anime, of an unnamed boy coming across the same place Founder Ymir discovered her divine powers, even suggests that the Titans themselves will eventually return.) Confronted by his imminent demise, Eren\u2019s stoic demeanor gives way to tears, and he tells Armin he wants Mikasa to think of him for years to come.\nTo understand what makes these plot points so upsetting, we have to go back to the first episodes. Although Eren Yeager was, as mentioned, heavily disliked by viewers, he was still the protagonist, and the qualities that made him so frustrating to watch \u2014 his stubbornness and incompetence \u2014 also made him incredibly relatable. In Eren, Attack on Titan\u2019s angsty adolescent fan base could find a perfect mirror: someone who feels deeply, yet is unable to express themselves to others, who wishes desperately to achieve his lofty goals but fails at almost every turn and is humiliated for it.\nThis interpretation of Eren explains why his character became so popular in the second half of the series, when he turned from a protagonist into an antagonist. The average viewer wasn\u2019t excited by the Rumbling because they have genocidal aspirations of their own. (Although, given the series\u2019 resonance with far-right viewers, this point is certainly worth investigating.) Rather, they were excited because the story of AoT is set up to make us identify with Eren and wish for him to succeed at something \u2014 anything.\nSeen in this light, Eren telling Armin that he likes Mikasa and that he wants Mikasa to like him is more than a confession of love. It\u2019s also an admission of defeat \u2014 an admission that he was wrong, his plan was wrong, that he hasn\u2019t grown, that his choices were misguided, and that all of his struggles were for nothing. In the anime, altered with manga creator Hajime Isayama\u2019s input, Eren is even more explicit:\n\u201cWhy did this happen?\u201d he asks, kneeling in the blood of 80% of humanity. \u201cI finally understand. It\u2019s because I\u2019m an idiot. An idiot you can find anywhere, who got himself incredible power.\u201d\nAttack on Titan wasn\u2019t created in a vacuum, and many other manga and anime feature characters and plot lines that prey on the desires and insecurities of their impressionable audiences. But where most shonen narratives allow fans to live out their personal fantasies, becoming powerful warriors and attracting beautiful women, AoT takes the opposite route, settling on a protagonist whose fragile ego turns him into a villain, a monster, a devil, a loser. Eren\u2019s ending isn\u2019t sloppily written. Far from it; his devolution is intentionally jarring and somewhat unsatisfying, functioning as a rude awakening for anyone who, at any point in the series, felt they recognized a part of themselves in him.\nI know I did. As a high school freshman who suffered from social anxiety and dreamed of one day becoming a world-famous writer, I admired pre-timeskip Eren\u2019s drive and willpower. I commended his ability to stay true to himself, the single-minded conviction with which he pursued his goals, and just how little he appeared affected by ridicule and criticism from those who doubted him. I also sympathized with his self-loathing, with the way he agonized over his own shortcomings and deliberately punched himself in the face when he felt that his best wasn\u2019t good enough.\nAnd while I\u2019ve never wanted to hurt another human being, I would be lying if I said that, during my lowest moments, there wasn\u2019t a voice inside my head that told me life was cruel, and even wished for the destruction of the world.\nTo this day, no other piece of media \u2014 film, show, book, or video game \u2014 has spoken to me the way Attack on Titan has. For years, I saw the series as a friend, a confidant as dear to my heart as a living, breathing person. Eren\u2019s maxims penetrated the reptilian part of my brain, where they lived rent-free, echoing whenever I was disappointed with myself or angry at the universe.\nAs a lonely teenager, Attack on Titan convinced me to trust my own emotions, embrace my own identity, and fight to turn my dreams into a reality. As a wiser, more well-adjusted adult who doesn\u2019t feel so lonely or misunderstood anymore, my attitude toward Attack on Titan has changed. While I still think that there is something uniquely and universally human about Eren\u2019s character, I now recognize his ego as weakness, not strength, something that clouds his judgment, pushes away loved ones, and puts himself and everyone in danger.\nThe ideas mentioned in this essay are ideas I have talked about many times before, but that the finale finally crystallized. To watch Eren\u2019s death is to let go of your inner child, of your pitiful temper tantrums and the naive, overly simplistic worldview that seeks to provide excuses for them. To finish Attack on Titan as a whole is to take a deep breath and say to yourself, \u201cThat was that. Now it\u2019s time to grow up.\u201d\nAttack on Titan is streaming on Crunchyroll, including all final parts."
