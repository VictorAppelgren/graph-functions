  "description": "A MOTHER has candidly opened up on her \u201cdisgusting\u201d Mounjaro side effects. Not only has she dealt with bad breath that smells like sewage and \u201crotten\u201d burps, but she\u2019s also been farting non-stop to\u2026",
  "content": "A MOTHER has candidly opened up on her \u201cdisgusting\u201d Mounjaro side effects.\n\nNot only has she dealt with bad breath that smells like sewage and \u201crotten\u201d burps, but she\u2019s also been farting non-stop too.\n\nPosting on social media moments before a meeting at her child's school, Stacey, who is currently \u201con a mission to fight flab to fab,\u201d revealed all on her side effects.\n\nThe content creator filmed herself in her car as she said: \u201cMounjaro update from me - I'm on my fifth jab, really bad side effects on this one.\n\n\u201cI'm not even lying, my a** sounds like a lawn mower, I can't stop farting.\n\n\u201cMy breath smells like sewage and the rotten eggy burps are absolutely disgusting.\n\n\u201cAll I can taste is fermented eggs - I mean, I've never eaten f*****g fermented eggs in my life, but I can imagine what they taste like with these eggy burps.\u201d\n\nSulphur burps, also known as \u201ceggy burps\u201d are a rotten and embarrassing side effect of taking weight loss injections.\n\nMany fat jab users have complained about the foul-smelling \u201cgrim\u201d burps, which are caused by delayed gastric emptying.\n\nNot only this, but Stacey claimed that since taking her fifth Mounjaro injection, she has also been battling with constant wind, which many others on Mounjaro have also complained about.\n\nShe continued: \u201cTo top it off, I've got to go in and have a meeting with the teacher, and all I'm doing is farting.\n\n\u201cShe's gonna think it's a f*****g chainsaw coming up behind me or something.\n\n\u201cI just hope I can hold the fart in, I really am.\n\n\"At the moment, all I\u2019m doing is [farting]. It sounds like a mobile phone vibrating.\n\nEverything you need to know about fat jabs Weight loss jabs are all the rage as studies and patient stories reveal they help people shed flab at almost unbelievable rates, as well as appearing to reduce the risk of serious diseases. Wegovy \u2013 a modified version of type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic \u2013 and Mounjaro are the leading weight loss injections used in the UK. Wegovy, real name semaglutide, has been used on the NHS for years while Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is a newer and more powerful addition to the market. Mounjaro accounts for most private prescriptions for weight loss and is set to join Wegovy as an NHS staple this year. The jabs work by suppressing your appetite, making you eat less so your body burns fat for energy instead and you lose weight. They do this my mimicking a hormone called GLP-1, which signals to the brain when the stomach is full, so the drugs are officially called GLP-1 receptor agonists. They slow down digestion and increase insulin production, lowering blood sugar, which is why they were first developed to treat type 2 diabetes in which patients' sugar levels are too high. NHS prescriptions of weight loss drugs, mainly Wegovy and an older version called Saxenda (chemical name liraglutide), are controlled through specialist weight loss clinics. Typically a patient will have to have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, classifying them as medically obese, and also have a weight-related health condition such as high blood pressure. GPs generally do not prescribe the drugs for weight loss. Private prescribers offer the jabs, most commonly Mounjaro, to anyone who is obese (BMI of 30+) or overweight (BMI 25-30) with a weight-related health risk. Private pharmacies have been rapped for handing them out too easily and video calls or face-to-face appointments are now mandatory to check a patient is being truthful about their size and health. Yes \u2013 side effects are common but most are relatively mild. Around half of people taking the drug experience gut issues, including sickness, bloating, acid reflux, constipation and diarrhoea. Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and clinical consultant at patient.info, said: \u201cOne of the more uncommon side effects is severe acute pancreatitis, which is extremely painful and happens to one in 500 people.\u201d Evidence has so far been inconclusive about whether the injections are damaging to patients' mental health. Figures obtained by The Sun show that, up to January 2025, 85 patient deaths in the UK were suspected to be linked to the medicines.\n\n\u201cGod help me. Pray that I can keep my f*****g fart explosion in and my eggy burps.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to control her smelly breath, she added: \u201cI'm chomping Polos so my breath ain't that bad - send help, please.\u201d\n\nStacey\u2019s hilariously honest TikTok clip, which was posted under the username @19mummylove, has clearly left many totally stunned, as it has quickly racked up 39,200 views, 629 likes and 210 comments.\n\nAnd it appears that Stacey isn\u2019t the only one to have been dealing with the unfortunate side effects, as numerous other Mounjaro users eagerly raced to the comments to share all.\n\nOne person said: \u201cI have egg burps, I have to stay home [as] they are so bad.\u201d\n\nAnother added: \u201cI\u2019m the opposite, since Mounjaro I can\u2019t fart! Maybe once every couple of days!\u201d\n\nA third commented: \u201cMine are so bad, people at work keep asking who\u2019s farted.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, someone else admitted: \u201cI feel you, I have been the same.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, many were left in hysterics by Stacey\u2019s confession and laughed: \u201cThis made my day.\u201d\n\nA second chimed in: \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether to be shocked or laughing my head off.\u201d\n\nNot only have many battled gross side effects since using Mounjaro, but last year it was revealed that Scots nurse Susan McGowan, 58, died after taking low-dose injections of the fat jabs over a fortnight.\n\nA probe also found that nearly 400 people have gone to hospital after taking weight loss drugs.\n\nWhile common side effects include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, doctors say they have also seen \u201clife-threatening complications\u201d, including seizures, bowel obstruction and inflammation of the pancreas.\n\nThe makers of Mounjaro, Lilly UK, said patient safety is its \u201ctop priority\u201d.\n\nLilly UK stressed: \u201cRegulatory agencies conduct extensive independent assessments of the benefits and risks of every new medicine and Lilly is committed to continually monitoring, evaluating, and reporting safety data.\n\n\u201cIf anyone is experiencing side effects when taking any Lilly medicine, they should talk to their doctor or other healthcare professional.\u201d\n\nUnlock even more award-winning articles as The Sun launches brand new membership programme - Sun Club",

  "summary": "A mother, Stacey, has shared her side effects of Mounjaro, which include bad breath, and constant farts. She posted a video on social media showing herself complaining about the side effects on her fifth injection. She also stated that her breath stinks and her constant farting sounds like a lawn mower. The drug, which is also known as \"eggy burps\", is caused by delayed gastric emptying and is often blamed for delaying gastric discharge. The drugs, which suppress your appetite and reduce the risk of obesity, are now mandatory to face-to-face appointments due to their high profile and mild side effects. However, research has been inconclusive about whether the injections are damaging to patients' mental health.",
