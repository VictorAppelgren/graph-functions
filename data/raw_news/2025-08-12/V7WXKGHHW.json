  "title": "Ether Prices Blow Past $4,500 For First Time Since 2021",
  "description": "Ether prices continued to extend their gains on Tuesday, August 12, surpassing $4,500 for the first time in more than three years.",
  "content": "Ether prices continued to extend their gains on Tuesday, August 12, surpassing $4,500 for the first time in more than three years.\n\nThe world\u2019s second-most valuable digital currency by total market value reached as much as $4,638.00, according to Coinbase data from TradingView.\n\nAt this point, the cryptocurrency was up close to 40% this month, after falling to roughly $3,375.00 on August 2, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView reveal.\n\nWhen explaining the latest price gains, several analysts who offered input for this article pointed to a range of factors, including strong flows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offering exposure to the digital asset.\n\nJoe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, for example, commented on these developments via email, stating that \u201cETH\u2019s breakout is being driven by renewed inflows, a supportive macro backdrop, and optimism around potential spot ETF approvals.\u201d\n\nBrian Huang, cofounder of fintech firm Glider, also weighed in, highlighting several variables as causing ether\u2019s latest gains.\n\n\u201cInstitutional buyers are stepping in: digital asset treasury holdings of ETH have surged this summer, signaling increased long-term confidence from corporate treasuries,\u201d he stated via email, citing data from Blockworks.\n\n\u201cETH ETFs have also seen record inflows, suggesting traditional investors are positioning for further upside,\u201d added Huang.\n\n\u201cOn the adoption front, Stripe and Circle have both announced EVM-compatible L1s, reinforcing Ethereum\u2019s position as the universal settlement layer for Web3. Combined, these factors create a powerful narrative of institutional demand, mainstream integration, and network dominance that is helping drive ETH\u2019s latest rally above $4,500,\u201d he noted.\n\nSome analysts who offered input for this article emphasized the impact of momentum trading, referring to investors buying the cryptocurrency with the expectation that it will continue its current upward trend.\n\nDiPasquale spoke to this, stating that \u201cOnce it cleared major resistance, momentum traders piled in, amplifying the rally. With liquidity improving and sentiment turning bullish, buyers are positioning for further upside after a long period of consolidation.\u201d\n\nTim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, also commented on this development.\n\n\u201cRight now, ETH is a momentum trade, where it is trying to reestablish its parity with BTC. Nothing fundamentally shifted over the week that would justify a 50% increase \u2013 much less more than doubling over the past six!\u201d he stated via email.\n\n\u201cBut let\u2019s put the move into perspective: for ETH to simply regain its strength relative to BTC would still have to increase by almost $1k without BTC putting in a new ATH,\u201d Enneking added.\n\n\u201cAlmost exactly one year ago, BTC was at $49k; on the same day, ETH was at $2.1k,\u201d he noted. \u201cAt its new ATH, BTC has been up 2.5x from that level for a month; even with this current major move up, ETH is up just over 2x from that level. To equal BTC\u2019s performance, ETH would have to hit $5.3k \u2013 without BTC moving above $123k.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same analysis can be conducted with dominance, and we again see that ETH is simply recovering from deep recent lows,\u201d Enneking concluded.\n\nMore than one market observer described ether in relation to bitcoin, claiming that at least right now, investors are flocking to the altcoin instead of the world\u2019s most prominent digital currency.\n\nBitcoin has reached repeated highs during its current bull cycle, while ether has not managed to surpass the all-time high it reached in late 2021.\n\nJulio Moreno, head of research for CryptoQuant, commented on this situation, stating via Telegram that \u201cETH continues to be favored by investors and traders over Bitcoin, increasing the demand for ETH relative to Bitcoin. This has caused the price of ETH to rally and outperform Bitcoin\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, ETH holdings by ETFs have been growing faster than Bitcoin as seen in the ETH/BTC ETF Holdings Ratio increasing to 0.15 from 0.05 in early May,\" he said.\n\nThe chart below illustrates these developments:\n\n\u201cA similar situation can be seen in the spot trading volume of ETH outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s in the last five weeks,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nThe chart below helps visualize this situation:\n\nOne analyst attributed ether\u2019s recent price gains to a shift in the mindset of investors, stating that they had been overly bearish about ether at some points.\n\n\u201cI believe a lot of this was just generally an overly bearish sentiment,\u201d Daniel Polotsky, founder & chairman of CoinFlip, stated via email.\n\n\u201cIn June, I told Forbes that Ethereum had come under pressure due to concerns about scalability and transaction fees, but that these concerns were somewhat overblown,\u201d he said, elaborating on the situation.\n\n\u201cI had said at that time that Ethereum could be a compelling buy at those levels, because there tends to be a reversion to the mean,\" said Polotsky.\n\n\u201cIn April, ETH hit a very low point vs. Bitcoin, when it was trading at 0.019 ETH per BTC. That ratio between the two hadn\u2019t been seen since late 2019, meaning that the sentiment was probably way too bearish and not matching reality,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThe reversion seems to be playing out right now, as Ethereum has skyrocketed past $4,500,\" Polotsky concluded.",
