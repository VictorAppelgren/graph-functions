  "description": "Street expects a modest non GAAP loss on +145% YoY revenue as enterprise and restaurant deployments scale rapidly.",
  "content": "SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) reports Q2 2025 results after the market close on August 7. Analysts expect a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.05, steady with Q1's level, and revenue of around $32.9 million, up approximately 145% YoY. That follows Q1 revenue of $29.1 million (+151%), with the company reaffirming its 2025 guidance range of $157 million to $177 million. The stock has been highly volatile, with shares halving in 2025, but still up over 180% from a year ago.\n\nInvestors will closely monitor customer growth and bookings, specifically looking for a continuation of the company's expansion into key verticals, like restaurants, automotive, and healthcare. The pace of new deployments and revenue from its high-margin AI ordering and Smart Answering solutions will be closely watched. An update on the total value of signed contracts will also provide insight into future growth visibility.\n\nGross margin improvement is another focal area. Q1 non-GAAP gross margin slumped to 51%, weighed down by low-margin legacy contracts and acquisition integration, even as management targets a return toward 70% over time. Management has indicated that margins should improve throughout 2025, and a sign of that recovery in Q2 would be a significant positive catalyst. Investors will also look for updates on dilution and cash burn.\n\nManagement has reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance of $157 million to $177 million and its goal of achieving adjusted EBITDA profitability by the end of 2025. Management's commentary on the impact of strategic partnerships, such as recent deals with Acrelec and Allina Health, will be a key signal of the company's confidence in its execution.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",
