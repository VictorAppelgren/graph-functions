  "description": "Travis Baldree continues the adventures of Viv the orc and Fern the ratkin in Brigands & Breadknives, which hits bookstores in November.",
  "content": "Torchlight and Rebel Galaxy co-creator Travis Baldree published his first book, Legends & Lattes, in 2022, and quickly captured the hearts of fantasy fans. The cozy tale of Viv, an orc warrior who quits her adventuring career to start a coffee shop, was a New York Times bestseller and a finalist for both the 2023 Nebula and Hugo awards for best novel.\n\nBaldree provided a look back at Viv\u2019s first days at a sword for hire in a second book in the series: his 2023 prequel Bookshops & Bonedust. In that book, Viv she spends her time recovering from a devastating adventuring injury by helping improve a ramshackle bookshop in a sleepy seaside town. Fern, the foul-mouthed rattkin owner of that bookshop, becomes the protagonist of the third book in his series, Brigands & Breadknives.\n\nAhead of the book\u2019s release on Nov. 11, Tor Books offered Polygon an exclusive excerpt from Brigands & Breadknives.\n\nSupine as she was in the back of the wagon, and boxed in on all sides by, well, boxes, there was nowhere to escape to but up, directly toward that fierce and deadly smile. A direction no right-thinking rattkin would choose.\n\nThe hangover that battered Fern\u2019s skull confused the whole business to such a degree that up was exactly where she went, though, lurching to a sitting position, flailing with the satchel her arms were tangled in, and screaming her throat raw.\n\nThe sharp grin and red glare were suddenly three feet away, at the very back of the wagon. Through the sick thumping of blood behind her eyes, Fern saw that both belonged to a goblin with a mop of orange hair and bottlebrush pigtails, clad in some sort of enormous coat made entirely of pockets in a riot of mismatched colors.\n\nImprobably, the goblin\u2019s hands were bound before her, and as if that weren\u2019t sufficient, several loops of cord were wrapped around her body, from her wrists all the way to her shoulders, and secured to a ringbolt on the back of the buckboard.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 \u200bwhat in the faithless fuck?\u201d wailed Fern. With an ungainly leap, she tumbled sideways over the boxboards of the cart and landed hard on a rutted track, with her cloak flipped over her head and her tail pinned underneath her.\n\n\u201cHow long have you been in there?\u201d\n\nFern shoved her cloak out of her face and squinted upward, wishing not entirely hyperbolically that she were dead, for a variety of defensible reasons.\n\nAstryx One-Ear stared down at her from a great height, one hand on her hip, the other combing through her silver hair.\n\nAstryx narrowed her eyes in recognition. \u201cHang on, where do I know you from?\u201d\n\nWith a mighty effort to keep the contents of her stomach inside her, Fern scrambled to her feet. She was aware that her fur was caked with the dust of the road and probably something horse-related.\n\nShe shot a glance at the goblin in the back of the wagon, who hadn\u2019t moved an inch and still grinned benignly at the both of them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m, uh\u2026 \u200bso, a few weeks ago I was in a carriage in some marshlands, and, er\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. The pescadines. Mute couple in the wagon. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nShe sniffed the air and caught a whiff of Fern\u2019s regret, judging by the face she made. \u201cSo is this on purpose, or did you just pass out in the wrong wagon?\u201d\n\nStill hung up on the idea of herself and the coachman as a couple and her head aching too much to formulate a lie, Fern replied, \u201cBit of both?\u201d and winced.\n\nAstryx nodded, thought about that for a moment, and then seemed to dismiss her entirely, shifting her attention to the goblin in the wagon. She pointed. \u201cYou. Back up front.\u201d\n\nThe goblin obliged, leaping nimbly across the cargo in the cartbed and up onto the buckboard, where she dropped onto her butt.\n\n\u201cIs she\u2026 \u200bsome kind of prisoner?\u201d Despite the sharpness of her smile, she didn\u2019t seem particularly threatening.\n\nFern crept gingerly off the road and found a grassy swell. She sank to the ground, hissing as every muscle along her spine shrieked in protest. She had no idea how she\u2019d slept through the night, given that she felt like one enormous bruise.\n\n\u201cBounty,\u201d replied Astryx as she tied the tarpaulin back down.\n\n\u201cTrust me when I say it was not my first choice. You must\u2019ve come aboard in Thune. Yes?\u201d\n\nFern nodded mutely. Astryx couldn\u2019t see her, facing away as she was, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a day and a half out, and three days to the next town.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy cart.\u201d Astryx was unperturbed. \u201cThere\u2019s a village back that way that we passed in the night. You should be all right. Safe country. Warm spots to sleep.\u201d Astryx finished what she was doing and turned to look Fern over. \u201cAny food?\u201d\n\nIt dawned on Fern what was happening. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied in a very small voice.\n\nNot that food sounded like something she wanted again anytime soon. Her eyes squeezed with every heartbeat, and her guts didn\u2019t like the rhythm.\n\nThe elf rummaged under the buckboard and withdrew a hunk of thick-rinded cheese and a piece of bread that looked like it would clunk if dropped. Astryx held them out toward Fern without another word.\n\nShe didn\u2019t seem annoyed or angry. But she didn\u2019t seem interested, either.\n\nShe might as well have been waiting for her horse to finish relieving itself.\n\nWhich, yes, it was currently in the process of doing.\n\nFern performed some mental arithmetic. A day and a half by horse cart. On foot, that was\u2026\n\nWith her head in her hands, she whispered, \u201cQuestioning my existence from the comfort of a warm bed sounds pretty gods-damned wonderful right about now. Fern, you ninny.\u201d\n\nThe elf\u2019s hm was as precisely calibrated as Cal\u2019s.\n\nFern tried for an endearing but slightly pitiable smile. \u201cIs there any chance I can convince you to take me to the next town or crossroads or someplace I could book passage back . . .\u201d Fern trailed off, and her eyes widened. She patted at her waist with the sudden realization that she was wearing neither her belt, nor her purse. In a wild burst of optimism, she flipped open the satchel and rifled through it, hoping against hope that\u2014\n\nNope. Not so much as a lonely copper bit gathering dust at the bottom. Only parchment, pencils, and a book she\u2019d already read that was intended for somebody else.\n\nAstryx had no trouble guessing her thoughts. \u201cSeems like the walk might be the best bet.\u201d\n\nIt was very clear that the legendary Astryx One-Ear had no intention of retracing her steps to return a hungover rattkin to her shambles of a life. In a story, the heroine would have gallantly changed her plans to usher a naive villager back to the safety of their own home, no matter how inconvenient or obviously impractical that might be.\n\nThis clearly was not one of those stories.\n\nBoth Astryx and Fern switched their attention to the girl on the buckboard.\n\n\u201cYou know what she\u2019s saying?\u201d Astryx cocked a brow at her.\n\nSomething canny in Fern that wasn\u2019t entirely debilitated by alcoholic low tide said, \u201cOh, sure. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes she not speak Territories?\u201d Fern neatly avoided the question.\n\nAstryx frowned. \u201cNot so far as I can tell. What\u2019d she say?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Fern hedged. \u201cNothing polite.\u201d Not that politeness had ever governed Fern\u2019s speech before.\n\n\u201cNever really got on with the goblin tongue myself. They didn\u2019t even have one five hundred years ago. I understand it\u2019s mostly curses, so, that sounds about right.\u201d\n\nFern thought that if she had lived for a thousand years, she might have picked up a few more languages that were relevant to her line of business, but was wise enough not to say so.\n\nInstead, she said, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve got a proposal. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume you take me with you to the next real stop. I can listen to what she\u2019s got to say? That\u2019s bound to make things easier for you, and as a bonus, I don\u2019t expire by the side of the road on my way home.\u201d\n\nThe elf pursed her lips in speculation. \u201cYou still don\u2019t have any money. How are you planning to hire your way back?\u201d\n\nFern spread her paws. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that, right? I\u2019ll just have to find a way to scrape together the silver when I get there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what is it that you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bookseller,\u201d replied Fern, which didn\u2019t seem very useful at the moment.\n\nAstryx appeared skeptical. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t bode well for your prospects.\u201d\n\nFern privately agreed, but said, \u201cI\u2019m a very resourceful bookseller . . . ?\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence, during which the draft horse cropped several mouthfuls of grass from the verge and flicked away a few bothersome flies.\n\nAstryx glanced between the two of them and then raised both brows at Fern expectantly.",

      "text": "Travis Baldree and Erich Schaefer know what it takes to bring successful games to market. You might say that they\u2019ve become pretty good at it.\nSchaefer co-founded Blizzard North where he was a pivotal part of creating the Diablo series. Later, he co-founded Flagship Studios in order to make Hellgate: London. Baldree created Fate and, when he went to Flagship, had a hand in building Mythos. Later the pair teamed up to found Runic Games, where they gave birth to the successful Torchlight series.\nBut after those successes, Baldree and Schaefer say they also know what it\u2019s like to be in a rut. They\u2019ve each spent a long time making games \u2014 specifically action role-playing games. Cumulatively, they\u2019ve been at it for close to 30 years.\nPile on all the responsibilities of running a company, of being responsible for hundreds of people, and they say that after a while it all became too much of a grind. They needed to make a change, and the only way they found they could do so was by hitting the eject button.\nIn March they left Runic, launched themselves into the black of space and never looked back.\nTheir new company is called Double Damage Games, and the result of their work \u2014 now ready to show to the public for the first time \u2014 is called Rebel Galaxy.\nGo west\nFrom the opening twangs of the trailer\u2019s soundtrack you get the feeling that this space game will be exploring a different, grittier track in a genre that's seeing a surge in popularity. This is not a glossy, modern affair like Star Citizen or Elite: Dangerous. It\u2019s not the futuristic void of No Man\u2019s Sky, and it\u2019s certainly not an up-close dogfighter like Eve: Valkyrie or Enemy Starfighter. Rebel Galaxy is all about big, hulking capital ships. These are vessels that have been around the galaxy a time or two, seen a few scraps and held out long enough to keep their crews alive. Take the gritty, lived-in ambiance of the television series Firefly and liberally sprinkle in the large scale, multi-ship engagements from Return of the Jedi or Battlestar Galactica and you begin to get the idea. Every battle in Rebel Galaxy has the potential to be a taut, setpiece event. And yet, Baldree and Schaefer told Polygon, their goal was to give Rebel Galaxy a warmth and an intimacy that will pull at players' heartstrings. The men at Double Damage want players, in their roles as captains, to be free to roam across randomly generated galaxies, each filled with dozens of solar systems to explore and colorful factions to meet. They want players to develop relationships along the way, and to carve out a role in that galaxy that\u2019s all their own. \"It\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve had doing anything in a long, long time.\"\nBut instead of hiring on countless hands to help them, Baldree and Schaefer wanted to do it alone \u2014 with help from contractors on things like art and music \u2014 in an indie title made on a shoestring budget. To accomplish that they\u2019ve had to go outside their comfort zone. They say it\u2019s been liberating. \"It\u2019s a breath of fresh air,\" Schaefer said. \"It\u2019s just so much fun to work on something so different.\" Baldree agrees. \"It\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve had doing anything in a long, long time.\"\nFly casual\nAt first glance it\u2019s hard to get your head around the scale of Rebel Galaxy. Schaefer and Baldree assured me that these aren\u2019t little ships. The smallest are manned by hundreds, while the largest have crews that number in the thousands. The dreadnought class shown in the trailer is referred to as a \"city of destruction.\" To help with maneuvering in the third person perspective each one takes up quite a bit of real estate at the bottom of the screen. The controls are simple. Players use one stick to urge the gigantic beasts to turn left and right. The other stick controls the guns, of which there are two main types \u2014 broadsides and turrets. Broadside guns fire as they would be from a classical pirate ship, out the long sides of the craft. They have predictable firing arcs linked more or less to the orientation of the ship itself, shown as a ghostly overlay trailing out and away from the player. Pull the trigger to launch a volley and if the enemy ships are in the way they get blasted.\nBigger ships have more ports in which to place broadside weapons; the smaller frigates have four while the dreadnaught has 16. These weapons will do the majority of the damage to your foes, wearing away at them over time with any number of different energy or projectile-based weapons. On the front and the back of each ship are places to mount more mobile weapons. Just like the turret on a tank, they have the ability to traverse independent of the orientation of the ship itself. And again, the larger the ship the more turret mounts it will have. While the broadsides are powerful, they\u2019re not terribly accurate. Baldree and Schaefer say that turrets will give players the most precise control over what they hit. \"I can choose whether I want my forward flak cannons to target inbound enemy torpedoes,\" Baldree said. \"Or maybe I only want them to target incoming fighters. Perhaps I want my plasma cannons to only attack turrets on other ships. You kind of arrange the loadout on your ship for specific kinds of purposes, or for the way that you want to play.\"\nEach bank of turrets can be given standing orders, or players can take control of the turrets and fire them manually. \"You can just move the reticle around on the screen,\" Baldree said. \"It can auto-snap to targets as they pass. But you can also directly fire the turret. It\u2019s like iron sights; you hold the left trigger and the camera swoops down to the actual turret level and it\u2019s like being in the Millennium Falcon shooting one of the turrets.\" Because of the way equipment is randomly generated in the game, broadsides and turrets will let each player tune their ship to meet their individual play style. But there will be other systems to customize as well.\nSoftware banks will be places to upgrade fire control systems, enhance heat management and weapons recharge rates. Shield systems will also be upgradeable, as will engines. There\u2019s also something the team calls a \"deflector,\" a kind of protective cone you can throw up around yourself. \"The deflector is a 'whole-ship' shield which can be engaged at any time,\" Baldree said. \"While engaged you can't fire any weapons or turrets or countermeasures. It fully absorbs most damage, but all damage absorbed subtracts from the available deflector energy.\" Deflectors will be a last ditch way to protect yourself and your crew, to prepare for one good salvo before the enemy brings you down or to buy yourself enough time to dive headlong into an asteroid field to keep them off your tail. Or maybe, while that protective shield is up, you\u2019ll take the opportunity to hail the opposing captain and make them an offer they can\u2019t refuse.\nDiplomacy by other means\nBaldree and Schaefer insist that what makes Rebel Galaxy different from the games they\u2019ve made in the past is the way the story will unfold, and how players will have the opportunity to create and play a role. \"The funny thing is,\" Baldree said, \"we did all these action role-playing games in the past, but Rebel Galaxy is more of a role-playing game than any of them were. You can have conversations with people and the things you say have consequences that matter. \"In Diablo, unfortunately, your 'role' was really just to beat things up. And there were not a lot of story branches, or changes in the way that anybody reacted to you.\" The universe of Rebel Galaxy will be populated by a number of different factions. Military units will protect their systems and will fight against any piracy going on around them, and it appears there will be plenty. Multiple factions within the pirate ranks themselves will battle against each other for primacy. Players will be able to speak to individual units while in the battlespace, but they\u2019ll also come in contact at interstellar watering holes \u2014 cantinas, taverns and the like. The real joy of discovery, the team hopes, will come in meeting and interacting with the game\u2019s alien races either by entering their systems or buying them a drink. \"When we were outsourcing character art,\" Baldree said, \"Jim Henson puppets came up a lot. We asked artists to think about The Dark Crystal, to talk about how these characters were made. \"And that\u2019s also a throwback to Star Control 2, which had that kind of character to it. That\u2019s one of the things that I always liked about that game. It wasn\u2019t cold. There was a lot of warmth to it, and we wanted a lot of that.\" The pair is tight-lipped about exactly how many factions will be in the game, even about their personalities and goals. So much is in flux right now, they say. But the faction system will be a way to advance in the game world, and also in the tech tree. In fact, they hope that certain technologies, and even certain capital ships, will be accessible only to players who have a high enough standing with a given faction.\nDouble Damage looked to The Dark Crystal for inspiration for their aliens.\nFive year mission\nRebel Galaxy is a departure for Baldree and Schaefer, but it has many of the hallmarks of their action RPG roots. The random galaxy and loot generation, for instance, is something they carried over from previous titles. \"It has components from the games we\u2019ve made in the past,\" Baldree said. \"We really like random generation, for instance, because it means that we can play the games that we\u2019re making and we don\u2019t exactly know where everything is or even what everything is going to do.\" Also like their previous games, this one will have an end. There will be a final showdown, a climactic battle of some sort. But after that, they hope that players will be able to continue on in the universe they\u2019ve created in an endless sandbox mode.\nMany options are still on the table, but what the team at Double Damage hopes to maintain as they finish development is the sense of freedom to the quests that they create. \"The example that I like to give,\" Baldree said, \"is you go to a bar and you get a tip that there\u2019s a famine on a planet and that a series of ships is being sent with relief. At that point you can choose to go and get to the planet ahead of time and maybe sell some foodstuffs while the price is still really high. Or you could choose to go blow up the relief ships, take all the food, and then go sell it at an even more inflated price. Or you could go and protect the relief ships from pirates on the way. \"All of those options are in keeping with different kinds of roles, and conversation options that you have are tied into that.\" It\u2019s the kind of freedom that they themselves say they\u2019ve enjoyed professionally since going out on their own. There\u2019s no set of Kickstarter backers to entertain, no publishers to appease. Most importantly, there\u2019s no other creative minds to haggle over the gameplay with. Just them and a whole galaxy of play to create. Double Damage expects to have Rebel Galaxy out sometime in 2015 for PC and PS4."
