  "title": "Russia Wants to Dismantle NATO \u2013 'Hybrid Threats' are Next",
  "description": "While some officials believe in the possibility of a conventional attack against a NATO ally before 2029, a growing number point to the danger of hybrid threats. Russia has already begun testing NATO's resilience through sabotage operations against Europe\u2019s infrastructure.",
  "content": "With discussions around the end of war in Ukraine, NATO allies are left to ask a hard question: what comes next for the Alliance?\n\nThe consensus among the policy community is clear \u2014 Vladimir Putin's strategic objective is to dismantle NATO.\n\nWhile some officials believe in the possibility of a conventional attack against a NATO ally before 2029, a growing number point to the more immediate danger of hybrid threats.\n\nIn fact, Russia has already begun testing NATO's resilience through sabotage operations against Europe\u2019s critical infrastructure.\n\nFrom attacks on DHL's logistics hubs in Germany to arson in Poland and Lithuania, Moscow is exploiting the vulnerabilities created by decades of deferred maintenance and insufficient investment from both governments and private sector.\n\nIf NATO is to safeguard its future, the Alliance must not only re-arm but also reinvest in the physical backbone of its deterrence: critical infrastructure.\n\nThe Kremlin has proven adept at weaponizing modernization itself.\n\nRussia has used the gaps in the Western legal systems via its \"gig economy\" approach, enabling it to avoid attribution and responsibility.\n\nSince 2022, hundreds of intelligence officers were expelled from European capitals, allowing the Kremlin to engage in online recruitment of third-country nationals to circumvent European counterintelligence measures.\n\nThese tactics serve a dual purpose: generating immediate military advantage in Ukraine and waging a broader campaign against the West.\n\nIn the first five months of 2025, publicly available information suggests there have been 25 incidents of sabotage, espionage and vandalism against NATO military infrastructure.\n\nEurope\u2019s railways \u2014 some of the oldest and most overstretched critical infrastructure \u2014remain especially vulnerable.\n\nTheir centrality to NATO's military logistics makes them attractive targets: one disruption can halt movement for thousands of miles.\n\nThe Alliance needs to recognize that credible deterrence and defense relies on functioning logistics capability and invest in its improvement.\n\nThis is where NATO's Corridor 8 becomes indispensable.\n\nThe corridor runs east-west across the Balkans, connecting the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea, passing through North Macedonia.\n\nBy connecting Albania's Adriatic coastline to Bulgaria's Black Sea ports, Corridor 8 functions as a logistical backbone, enabling the rapid deployment of forces and resources from west to east in times of need.\n\nThis strategic link is indispensable for sustaining NATO's readiness and operational responsiveness along Europe\u2019s increasingly volatile Eastern Flank.\n\nAdditionally, being part of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), Corridor 8 enhances connectivity between Europe and Central Asia.\n\nIt helps to synchronize civilian infrastructure with NATO's Military Mobility initiative as same highways and railways used for trade can be upgraded to support the rapid deployment of heavy military equipment.\n\nUnder the leadership of Minister of Transport Aleksandar Nikoloski, North Macedonia has launched an ambitious upgrade of this corridor, supported by a landmark partnership with the United Kingdom.\n\nBacked by \u00a35 billion in UK Export Finance, this effort will strengthen NATO\u2019s resilience, fuel economic growth in the Balkans, and reduce opportunities for Russian and Chinese exploitation.\n\nGiven the U.S. Blackstone's renewed interest in investing $500 billion in Europe over the next decade, North Macedonia's investment leadership becomes a trend to follow.\n\nThe Balkan country will undertake major upgrades along Corridor 8, focusing on critical highway segments stretching from the Albanian to the Bulgarian border.\n\nThe country's strategic goal is to complete all highway infrastructure along Corridor 8 by the end of 2028.\n\nNorth Macedonia is also advancing upgrades, marked by construction of highways and expressways, on Corridor X, a north-south artery linking Central Europe to the Aegean Sea.\n\nPassing through Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, and North Macedonia, with branches to Turkey and Bulgaria, Corridor X is the most direct land route between Central Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nFor NATO, it functions as a strategic spine \u2014 an axis along which forces can be moved swiftly between Central Europe and Southeastern Europe.\n\nControl and monitoring of the Corridor reduces opportunities for adversaries such as Russia and China to exploit gaps in Balkan infrastructure and conduct hybrid attacks.\n\nAs North Macedonia embraces its role as a regional leader and accelerates investment in these vital corridors, NATO must match this momentum.\n\nInfrastructure resilience is not merely a Balkan issue \u2014 it's a matter of collective security.\n\nIf Russia\u2019s strategy is to dismantle NATO through hybrid means, then the Alliance must prove it cannot be fractured.\n\nFor the American policy makers who understand that peace comes through strength, the lesson is unmistakable: NATO's future credibility depends on hard power backed by reliable infrastructure.\n\nWashington should champion and support these infrastructure projects, not only to secure Europe\u2019s eastern flank but to demonstrate that American leadership remains the cornerstone of transatlantic security.\n\nThe next war can challenge the foundations of NATO \u2014\u200b be it a conventional attack against an ally or a hybrid attack on critical infrastructure \u2014\u200b roads, railways and ports will become the determining factor on whether NATO can survive.\n\nCol.

This Partnership supports the delivery of critical infrastructure projects across various sectors, including transport, health, energy, and technology. It will be able to draw on a wide range of support, including technical assistance programmes and up to \u00a35 billion in UK Export Finance support available for projects in North Macedonia.\nThe formal signing ceremony took place at the historic Old Admiralty Building in London on Thursday 22nd May 2025, with the UK Minister for Exports, Gareth Thomas MP, and the Deputy Prime Minister of North Macedonia, Aleksandar Nikoloski, in attendance.\nThis G2G underscores the commitment of both nations to collaborate on critical infrastructure projects that deliver social, economic, and environmental benefits. By leveraging the expertise and innovation of both countries, this Partnership will drive the development of resilient infrastructure that fosters growth and prosperity.\nThe exchange of knowledge and best practice between our two countries will be central to this G2G, drawing from the expertise of both nation\u2019s respective infrastructure fields. This means the UK Government and British businesses working in partnership with the government of North Macedonia and their local supply chain to deliver infrastructure projects across North Macedonia. This approach will generate mutual benefits for both nations through the sharing of innovation to deliver resilient infrastructure that drives growth.\nMinister of Exports, Gareth Thomas MP expressed his enthusiasm:\nThis partnership opens up a new chapter in our bilateral relationship with North Macedonia.\nThe UK has a wealth of experience in delivering high-quality infrastructure across the world and I am delighted to be kicking off this new partnership that will help more British businesses export to North Macedonia.\nThe UK Ambassador to North Macedonia, Matthew Lawson said:\nWe have achieved a significant milestone in the UK \u2013 North Macedonia relations with the signing of the Government-to-Government Partnership by UK Minister for Exports, Gareth Thomas MP, and the Deputy Prime Minister of North Macedonia, Aleksandar Nikoloski.\nThe G2G will further strengthen the already excellent trade ties between our countries and support the delivery of critical infrastructure projects in different sectors, including transport, health, energy, and technology in North Macedonia. As the British Ambassador I am proud that our governments have reached this landmark partnership that will benefit the citizens of both countries. We stand strong and united together.\nThis G2G builds on a strong existing bilateral relationship between the UK and North Macedonia. Recently, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski welcomed a new Strategic Partnership at the European Political Community Summit in Tirana on the 16th May 2025. This G2G represents the start of our enhanced trade and infrastructure collaboration.\nChris Barton, His Majesty\u2019s Trade Commissioner for Europe also expressed his support:\nI am delighted that this G2G will support stronger collaboration across our governments and businesses to deliver economic growth for both our nations and good-quality infrastructure for the citizens of North Macedonia.\nNotes to editors:\n-\ngovernment to government (G2G) partnerships are formal arrangements under which we agree to provide another government is provided with access to UK public and private expertise for specific projects or programmes that create commercial benefits\n-\ntotal trade in goods and services (exports plus imports) between the UK and North Macedonia was \u00a31.7 billion in the four quarters to the end of Q3 2024\n-\nthe UK is North Macedonia\u2019s second largest trading partner in the 4 quarters to the end of Q3 2024"

      "text": "Mystery fires were Russian 'test runs' to target cargo flights to US\n- Author, Paul Kirby\n- Role, Europe digital editor\n- Author, Frank Gardner\n- Role, BBC security correspondent\nA series of parcel fires targeting courier companies in Poland, Germany and the UK were dry runs aimed at sabotaging flights to the US and Canada, Polish prosecutors say.\nKatarzyna Calow-Jaszewska revealed late last month that four people had been arrested and authorities across Europe were investigating the incidents.\nWestern security officials have now told US media they believe the fires - which happened in July - were part of an orchestrated campaign by Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, the GRU.\nRussia denies being behind acts of sabotage. But it is suspected to have been behind other attacks on warehouses and railway networks in EU member states this year, including in Sweden and in the Czech Republic.\nMs Calow-Jaszewska said in a statement that a group of foreign intelligence saboteurs had been involved in sending parcels containing hidden explosives and dangerous materials via courier companies. The parcels then spontaneously burst into flames or blew up.\nWestern officials believe the fires originated in electric massage machines containing a \"magnesium-based\" substance.\nMagnesium-based fires are hard to put out, especially on board a plane.\n\u201cThe group\u2019s goal was also to test the transfer channel for such parcels, which were ultimately to be sent to the United States of America and Canada,\u201d Ms Calow-Jaszewska said.\nSome of the devices originated in Lithuania, and prosecutor general Nida Grunskiene said there had been arrests there too. A pre-trial investigation was under way and law enforcement agencies from other countries were taking part, she told reporters.\nOn three days in July, fires broke out in a container due to be loaded on to a DHL cargo plane in the German city of Leipzig, at a transport company near Warsaw, and at Minworth near Birmingham, UK, involving a package described as an incendiary device.\nThe incident at Jablonow near Warsaw took two hours to extinguish, according to Polish reports.\nUK officials have given few details about the fire at Midpoint Way in Minworth on 22 July. A Met Police spokesperson confirmed that a counter-terrorism investigation was under way after a package at a commercial premises caught alight, adding that \"it was dealt with by staff and the local fire brigade\".\nKen McCallum, head of the UK's domestic intelligence agency MI5, said last month that Russian secret agents had carried out \"arson, sabotage and more. Dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness\" after the UK had helped Ukraine in Russia's war. His allegations were flatly rejected by the Kremlin.\nA spokesperson for the US Transportation Security Administration said in recent months they have put in place additional security measures for certain US-bound cargo flown in by US and foreign airlines.\nA US government official also added that there is no current active threat targeting US-bound flights.\nIt is important to separate the known facts from the allegations being made and suspicions voiced by Western officials.\nWhat is beyond doubt is that this year has seen a succession of suspicious fires at cargo depots in the UK, Germany and Poland - suspicious enough to trigger investigations by counter-terrorism police.\nThere have been other incidents across Europe and last month a man was convicted at the Old Bailey under the new National Security Act for an arson attack on a Ukrainian-owned business in Leyton, east London in March.\nIn Germany, the head of the domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has said it was only by a stroke of fortune that the Leipzig device had not ignited in mid-air.\nBfV head Thomas Haldenwang has described the device that caught fire at DHL's logistics hub at Leipzig-Halle airport as suspected Russian sabotage.\nTaken together, these events are leading Western governments to conclude there is a strong possibility that Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency has embarked on a systematic campaign of anonymous, covert attacks on those countries helping Ukraine.\nThe package that burst into flames in Leipzig is thought to have arrived from Lithuania and its onward flight was delayed.\nThe device that caught fire in Minworth is also understood to have come from Lithuania, where the head of the parliament's national security and defence committee, Arvydas Pocius, said it was part of an ongoing campaign of hybrid attacks aimed at \"causing chaos, panic and mistrust\".\nDHL has increased security since the recent freight fires. \"DHL Express has taken measures in all European countries to protect its network, its employees and facilities, as well as its customers' shipments,\" a spokeswoman said a few weeks ago.\nPoland's government has already responded to alleged Russian sabotage, with Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski announcing the closure of a Russian consulate in Poznan and threatening to expel the Russian ambassador if it fails to bring an end to its attacks.\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned the move as \"a hostile step that will be met with a painful response\".\nTop Stories\nMore to explore\nPopular Reads\nContent is not available"

      "text": "Russia may attack Nato in next four years, German defence chief warns\n- Published\nMembers of the Western alliance Nato need to prepare for a possible attack from Russia within the next four years, according to Germany's chief of defence.\nGeneral Carsten Breuer told the BBC that Russia was producing hundreds of tanks a year, many of which could be used for an attack on Nato Baltic state members by 2029 or even earlier.\nHe also insisted Nato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, remains unified over the war in Ukraine, despite differences of opinion expressed recently by both Hungary and Slovakia.\nGen Breuer was speaking on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue, a defence summit in Singapore organised by the think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\nHis comments come weeks ahead of a summit of Nato nations at The Hague where they are expected to discuss defence budgets, among other topics.\nGen Breuer said that Nato was facing \"a very serious threat\" from Russia, one that he has never seen before in his 40 years in service.\nAt the moment, he said, Russia was building up its forces to an \"enormous extent\", producing approximately 1,500 main battle tanks every year.\n\"Not every single tank is going to [the war in] Ukraine, but it's also going in stocks and into new military structures always facing the West,\" he said.\nRussia also produced four million rounds of 152mm artillery munition in 2024, and not all of it was going to Ukraine either, added Gen Breuer.\nThe figures come from German and allied nations' analysts.\n\"There's an intent and there's a build up of the stocks\" for a possible future attack on Nato's Baltic state members, he said.\n\"This is what the analysts are assessing - in 2029. So we have to be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that's not earlier than 2029? I would say no, it's not. So we must be able to fight tonight,\" he said.\nMany have long feared an attack on a Nato state as it could trigger a larger war between Russia and the US, which is a key member of Nato. Under Article 5 of the Nato agreement, any attack on a member state would mean other members must come to its defence.\nGen Breuer singled out the so-called Suwalki Gap, an area that borders Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable.\n\"The Baltic States are really exposed to the Russians, right? And once you are there, you really feel this... in the talks we are having over there,\" he said.\nThe Estonians, he said, had given the analogy of being close to a wildfire where they \"feel the heat, see the flames and smell the smoke\", while in Germany \"you probably see a little bit of smoke over the horizon and not more\".\nGen Breuer said this showed the differing perspectives among European states of the threat of a possible Russian attack.\nRussia's view of the Ukraine war was different from the West's, he said, where Moscow sees the war as more of a \"continuum\" in a larger conflict with Nato and is therefore \"trying to find ways into our defence lines and it's testing it\".\nHe cited recent attacks on undersea cables in the Baltic Sea, cyber attacks on European public transport, and unidentified drones spotted over German power stations and other infrastructure.\nNato members should therefore build up their militaries again, Gen Breuer argued. \"What we have to do now is really to lean in and to tell everybody, hey, ramp up... get more into it because we need it. We need it to be able to defend ourselves and therefore also to build up deterrence.\"\nAsked by the BBC about Nato cohesion, given Hungary and Slovakia's closer relations with Moscow, Gen Breuer insisted the alliance was still healthy.\nHe pointed to Finland and Sweden's decisions to join Nato shortly after the Ukraine war began. \"I've never seen such a unity like it is now\" among nations and military leaders, he said.\n\"All of them understand the threat that is at the moment approaching Nato, all understand that we have to develop a direction of deterrence, into the direction of collective defence. This is clear to everyone. The urgency is seen.\"\nGen Breuer's remarks are yet another sign of a significant change in attitudes in Germany towards defence and Russia.\nLike many Western nations, including the UK, it has scaled down its investments in its military over many years.\nBut there has been a growing recognition of the need to reverse this, with even the Green Party coming onboard a recent vote to lift restrictions on Germany's defence spending.\nBut as Western military and political leaders say they are ready for the fight, questions remain on whether this is a case of ambition outpacing reality.\nIt will take years for Europe's military industrial base to crank up to speed to match anywhere near the scale of weaponry that Russia is churning out.\nThe US has also been drawing down, not building up, its defence commitments to Europe to focus on the Indo-Pacific."
