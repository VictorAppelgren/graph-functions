  "title": "Australians are finally taking up NBN Co's free full fibre upgrades \u2013 here\u2019s why now is the best time to join them",
  "description": "Don\u2019t get caught lagging",
  "content": "NBN Co has today released its end of year financial results. Alongside posting an increase in revenue, the results reveal a surge in upgrades to the fibre to the premises (FTTP) connection type, finally overtaking the previously most common \u2013 and inferior \u2013 fibre to the node (FTTN) connection technology.\n\nSpecifically, NBN Co says there are now 2.66 million active FTTP connections in Australia, compared to 2.17 million as at June 30, 2024. Conversely, FTTN connections have seen a steady decline over the same period, going from just over 2.78 million at the end of FY 2024 to approximately 2.5 million at the time of writing.\n\nWhy is that so interesting and important? It\u2019s because FTTP connections offer access to the fastest NBN plans and it\u2019s the only connection type available to customers who currently connect via copper-based technology and want to take advantage of the free NBN speed upgrades arriving in September.\n\nPremises that connect fibre hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) technology are also able to take advantage of the incoming speed boosts, but the technology is available as an upgrade option for those on copper-based infrastructure.\n\nWhy the need for a speed upgrade?\n\nIf this is the first time you\u2019re hearing of the proposed speed upgrades, then in short, homes that connect to the fixed-line NBN network via FTTP or HFC will be able to access brand new NBN 500, NBN 750 and NBN 2000 plans from September, which are joining the current NBN 1000 tier (which is seeing an increase to its minimum speed) to provide a suite of super fast wired internet options.\n\nAt a time where we\u2019re demanding more from our home internet connection \u2013 NBN Co says the average Australian household has 25 connected devices \u2013 the need for faster speeds and greater bandwidth is more prevalent than ever. The upgraded plans will be able to deliver on both counts.\n\nFor the past three years, NBN Co has been on a mission to make the older, copper-based fixed-line network footprint eligible for the upgrade to FTTP at no cost. The vast majority of homes should be eligible for the free upgrade by December this year, with the remaining 622,000 homes on copper-based connections all set to slowly become eligible by 2030.\n\nWhat are the best high-speed NBN plans to get today?\n\nIf the idea of faster download speeds sounds exciting, and you\u2019re yet to take advantage of the free fibre upgrade, you\u2019ll be pleased to know you\u2019re not short of fantastic options. We\u2019ve already seen some providers launching NBN 500 plans ahead of NBN Co\u2019s official rollout date, including Exetel, Spintel and Tangerine, and they all represent incredible value.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps no surprise the 500Mbps plans have seen an early launch, as even NBN Co CEO Ellie Sweeney has stated that, \u201cLooking to the future, it is [NBN Co\u2019s] aim that our 500 Mbps wholesale speed tier becomes Australia\u2019s most popular nbn plan.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to sign up for an NBN 750 plan early via Spintel, which presents itself as great value when comparing the price that, in some cases, is better than certain providers\u2019 NBN 25 plans that are 30x slower.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know how much the new \u2018hyperfast\u2019 NBN 2000 plans will cost, but we\u2019ll certainly be keeping our eyes peeled for the best deals when they officially arrive.\n\nIf your home is eligible for the free fibre upgrade, then you can sign up for a high-speed NBN plan with your chosen service provider who will then activate the upgrade on your behalf. You\u2019ll be given a date for a technician to come and install the necessary cabling and equipment at your premises, and you\u2019ll be able to revel in lightning-fast download speeds soon after.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Everything you need to know about NBN 2000 plans\n\u2022 View our latest picks for the best NBN plans\n\u2022 Tangerine just delivered an NBN 500 sucker punch \u2013 its new early-bird plan costs just AU$69p/m",

      "text": "NBN speed upgrades: launch date, new tiers, eligibility and everything else we know about the September 2025 changes\nGet high-speed ready with our in-depth guide to the changes coming to the NBN network\nYou may have seen our recent articles regarding the upcoming September 2025 NBN speed upgrades, which are set to affect fast NBN plans from 100Mbps up. If you haven\u2019t, and you\u2019re landing on this page for the first time, then here\u2019s a quick rundown.\nWhat are the NBN speed upgrades?\nIn short, NBN Co is introducing a new speed tier known as NBN 2000, which will offer up to 2Gbps download speeds \u2013 double that of the current fastest gigabit NBN 1000 tier.\nAlongside this new tier, NBN Co has also announced some speed upgrades to a selection of the current NBN tiers:\n- NBN 100 plans will see a 5x speed upgrade and become NBN 500, with a maximum download speed of 500Mbps\n- NBN 250 plans will get a 3x speed boost and become NBN 750, with a maximum download speed of 750Mbps\n- NBN 1000 plans will be upgraded to a minimum guaranteed speed of 750Mbps, but still max out at 1,000Mbps. They\u2019ll also receive a bump in upload speed, from 50Mbps to 100Mbps. We imagine they\u2019ll still be referred to as NBN 1000.\nWhen are the NBN speed upgrades happening?\nNBN Co has penned 14 September, 2025 as the date the upgrades will be made available to retail service providers (RSPs) at a wholesale level. We don\u2019t yet have confirmation as to when they\u2019ll be rolled out to customers, which is up to the RSPs to decide.\nSome providers will almost certainly throw the switches on (or shortly after) that 14 September date, however others may take longer. We\u2019d expect that, in most cases, there\u2019ll be a gradual rollout that occurs over September and October 2025.\nWho can access these NBN speed upgrades?\nBecause of the higher speeds involved, these speed upgrades will only be available to households and businesses that connect to the NBN via either a fibre to the premises (FTTP), or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) connection type.\nCurrently, NBN 250 and NBN 1000 plans already require these types of connection, however NBN 100 plans are available to virtually everyone who connects to the fixed-line NBN network. Therefore, only customers with an NBN 100 plan and who connect via FTTP or HFC will be eligible to receive the speed boost to 500Mbps.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nHow can I get the NBN speed upgrade?\nIf you already connect via FTTP or HFC and you\u2019re signed up to an NBN 100 plan or higher, then in theory, you may not need to do anything, as we expect many RSPs will automatically push the speed increases out to you once they\u2019ve done any required back end tinkering. You may also need a new modem-router to achieve the new maximum speeds of your plan, which we\u2019ve detailed a little more below.\nIf you want to upgrade to the brand new NBN 2000 tier, however, then you\u2019ll need to sign up for a plan via an NBN provider when these become available. Most customers signing up for NBN 2000 will also require a new network termination device (NTD), which requires a technician to visit your premises to install and will be arranged after ordering the plan from your selected RSP.\nIf you currently connect via a fibre to the node (FTTN) or fibre to the curb (FTTC) connection, then you will need to have the equipment upgraded to FTTP to access any of these upgraded speeds. Many FTTN and FTTC connections can access this upgrade for free thanks to NBN Co\u2019s free fibre upgrade program, as long as you live in an eligible suburb.\nThe majority of suburbs in Australia where a fixed-line NBN connection is available should now be eligible, and NBN Co has previously stated it intends to make the program available to 10 million households by the end of 2025.\nIf you don\u2019t know what connection type is at your address, you can use the NBN\u2019s free address checker to find out.\nIf you\u2019re already signed up for an NBN 100 plan, come 14 September you may be able to ask your provider to activate the upgrade for you. If you\u2019re signed up to a slower plan \u2013 NBN 50 or lower \u2013 then you\u2019ll need to switch tor at least an NBN 100 plan in order to receive the free FTTP upgrade.\nHow much will the upgraded NBN plans cost?\nIn theory, for those on NBN 100, 250 and 1000 plans, the improvements shouldn\u2019t increase your monthly fee, or if there is a price rise it should only be minimal.\nNBN Co has instituted new wholesale costs for its current plan line up as of 1 July 2025, which will likely see small increases across the board prior to the speed upgrade rollout. However, NBN Co has stated it won\u2019t be charging RSPs a higher wholesale cost when the upgraded speeds come into effect \u2013 so, for example, the wholesale cost of an NBN 500 plan will be the same as an NBN 100 plan.\nThere\u2019s one key unknown when it comes to costs, however, and that\u2019s to do with a part of accessing the internet that\u2019s out of NBN Co\u2019s hands \u2013 international bandwidth. Because the National Broadband Network infrastructure only operates within Australia, it\u2019s up to each provider to organise its own international connections.\nThese are required to reach any sites or services that do not have servers located in Australia. While many major brands and platforms (such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Microsoft and PlayStation) do have Australian servers, there are some notable exceptions \u2013 TikTok being a key one \u2013 and traffic to these does theoretically come at an additional cost to RSPs.\nSo, while we would love to say categorically that the faster plans won\u2019t cost more from September, RSPs do have costs beyond the wholesale fees NBN Co charges. In particular, if providers believe the increased speeds will strain their current capacity to serve international traffic \u2013 and they\u2019ll therefore need to purchase more bandwidth to cope \u2013 they may pass on a small increase to customers\u2019 monthly fees.\nWill my current modem-router still work with the new speeds?\nThe main recommendation we can make regarding the upcoming speed boosts is, if you do get them, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have a suitable Wi-Fi router at home that can support the faster speeds.\nMore specifically, we mean you should arm yourself with at least a Wi-Fi 6 modem, or to futureproof yourself even more, Wi-Fi 7. Both of these Wi-Fi technologies are able to support greater overall bandwidth compared to Wi-Fi 5 routers, and much faster download speeds than Wi-Fi 4 routers. It should be stressed that an older Wi-Fi 4 router will likely struggle to provide the full bandwidth of an NBN 500 plan, so if you\u2019re using an aging router on this plan, consider upgrading it.\nA Wi-Fi 5 router is theoretically fast enough for up to an NBN 1000 plan in a perfect environment, but few of us live in one. So, to compensate for potential interference (like walls or other nearby routers) and the natural drop in speed that happens as you get further away from your router, it\u2019s wise to upgrade to a model that will provide significantly more overall bandwidth than your NBN connection itself offers.\nConsidering more and more connected devices now integrate at least Wi-Fi 6, opting for a router that can match them is a good place to start.\nWhat NBN plan should I get before the upgrades?\nIf all this talk about NBN speed upgrades has you giddy with excitement, but you're not yet on an eligible plan to take advantage of them \u2013 or if you simply want to get faster internet today \u2013 we've got some excellent recommendations for you below, including some NBN 500 and NBN 750 plans that are already live.\nExetel One | 500Mbps | AU$80p/m\nExetel was one of the first to market with an NBN 500 plan and, on paper at least, it's a doozy. You're promised the full 500Mbps during the busier evening hours, along with some added perks such as boosting the speed and dropping the cost a little when you're away from home. It's also highly affordable, costing less than some plans that are 20x slower!\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$960 yearly cost\nSpintel | 750Mbps | AU$80p/m (first 6 months, then AU$90.95p/m)\nSpintel's NBN 750 plan used to be its gigabit plan, but considering the fact it maxes out at 750Mbps, we're now calling moving it down a category. It's remarkable value, costing the same as the slightly slower Exetel plan above for the first 6 months. The ongoing cost is still competitively priced, undercutting slightly faster NBN 1000 plans.\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,025.70 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,091.40 ongoing yearly cost\nSuperloop | 860Mbps TES | AU$85p/m (first 6 months, then AU$109p/m)\nPromising some of the fastest speeds right now in Australia, this Superloop NBN 1000 has been a favourite of ours for some time. And the good news is, a previous EOFY deal is still live, making it especially affordable, with AU$144 in total savings over the first half-year.

      "text": "NBN 2000 plans: all your questions about the upcoming Hyperfast internet tier answered\nThe what, when, why and how of the incoming speed tier\nRoughly a year since it was first teased and seven months since they were confirmed, we\u2019re now approximately three months away from the rollout of new NBN 2000 plans.\nSet to launch officially on September 14, the new NBN 2000 plans \u2013 appropriately dubbed \u2018Hyperfast\u2019 \u2013 will offer homes and businesses connected via fibre to the premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) the chance to double the maximum download speeds currently available.\nOn paper at least, they're going to be strong contenders for the top spot in our guide to the fastest NBN plans.\nBut how fast exactly will NBN 2000 plans be and, more importantly, how much will they cost? While specific details are relatively thin on the ground right now, we\u2019ve sifted through everything NBN Co has said so far to answer the key questions about the upcoming tier. Read on to find out all there is to know about NBN 2000 plans.\nWhen will NBN 2000 plans be available?\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nNBN Co has said NBN 2000 plans will be available from September 14, 2025. However, it adds that this is the date the new plans will be available for retail service providers (RSPs) to purchase, that are then sold to customers. With this in mind, it means that you may not be available to sign-up for an NBN 2000 plan until some time after, so we imagine they\u2019ll be more broadly available to consumers and businesses from around the beginning of October.\nWe will of course be keeping our eyes peeled for when the new plans become available and will update this page as soon as we know more.\nHow fast will NBN 2000 plans be?\nAs the name implies, NBN 2000 plans will offer theoretical maximum download speeds of 2,000Mbps (or 2Gbps) \u2013 double that of the current theoretical maximum of the best NBN 1000 plans.\nUpload speeds will also get a major speed increase to a maximum of 200Mbps (compared to the 50Mbps maximum on NBN 1000 plans) although this will only be available to customers connected via FTTP. Customers connected via HFC will only be able to achieve a maximum upload speed figure of 100Mbps, or half that of full fibre.\nAs with all of the best NBN plans, the 2,000Mbps figure is just the theoretical maximum available, which is often different to the typical evening speed figure achievable in the real world. For example, the maximum typical evening speed figure we\u2019ve seen for NBN 1000 plans is 900Mbps from Flip and Swoop.\nThis means customers are unlikely to achieve 2,000Mbps download speeds, although by how much is currently anyone\u2019s guess.\nHow much will NBN 2000 plans cost?\nThe quick answer is, we don\u2019t know. However, we do know that the wholesale cost NBN Co will charge service providers is AU$115 per month, so we can expect the final retail cost to customers to be higher. Of course, how much higher will depend on the provider, as we already see a great variance between providers on other speed tiers.\nAs an example, the cheapest regular monthly cost for an NBN 1000 plan is AU$90 from Spintel, while the most expensive is AU$150 per month from Telstra, a difference of AU$60 p/m. For greater context, the current wholesale cost of an NBN 1000 plan to ISPs is AU$72.22, so it\u2019s clear different providers choose to mark up their plans differently.\nTaking this into account, an NBN 2000 plan could therefore cost anywhere from AU$150 p/m to AU$200 p/m or more. We\u2019ll update this page with details of specific plans and prices as soon as we spot them.\nWhat equipment do I need for an NBN 2000 plan?\nWhether you already connect to the fixed-line NBN network via FTTP or you're on one of the inferior FTTN/C connection types, you'll need new equipment if you want to sign up for a new NBN 2000 plan.\nNBN Co has confirmed that a new connection box is coming and, interpreting its wording, will become the new default connection box for anyone upgrading to FTTP, regardless of the plan speed they opt for.\nNot only will the new connection box support the multi-gigabit NBN 2000 plans, but it also now features just a single port, as opposed to the four-port design of the current connection box. In the majority of cases, homes connected via FTTP will likely only use just one port, which is the reason for this design change.\nNew four-port connection boxes will also be available for homes that need them, but details regarding the logistics of how you go about obtaining one are thin on the ground right now.\nShould I get an NBN 2000 plan?\nThat all depends on the needs of your household and, as mentioned, NBN 2000 plans will only be available to customers who connect to the NBN via FTTP or HFC infrastructure. In 2025 that's less of a barrier than it was in previous years. If your premises don\u2019t currently use either of these technology types, and you instead connect via fibre to the node (FTTN) or fibre to the curb (FTTC), you'll likely be eligible to take advantage of NBN Co\u2019s free NBN fibre upgrade program.\nBut wait, there\u2019s some other good news to coincide with the launch of the new multi-gigabit plans. The current crop of higher speed NBN plans (so NBN 100 and faster) are set to receive a speed boost and should, in theory, remain free of any price increases since NBN Co\u2019s wholesale costs aren\u2019t expected to rise too much at the turn of the new financial year.\nWhile those speed increases won\u2019t be coming to the best NBN 25 plans or best NBN 50 plans, the best NBN 100 plans, best NBN 250 plans and best NBN 1000 plans should all be automatically upgraded. NBN 1000 plans will get a guaranteed minimum speed increase to 750Mbps, up from the current 500Mbps, while NBN 100 plans will see the maximum download speed increase to 500Mbps, and customers on an NBN 250 plan will get a speed bump to 750Mbps maximum.\nSo, by the time they're rolled out, the answer to the question \u201cdo I need an NBN 2000 plan?\u201d, might actually be no. The 5x speed increase on an NBN 100 plan could be all your household needs to ensure all your connected devices run smoothly. Do note, however, that you will still need a FTTP or HFC connection to receive these increases. To check what connection you have, you can head to NBN Co\u2019s website.\nWhat NBN plan is best to get now?\nIf you\u2019re keen to change your NBN plan today, the good news is that gigabit NBN plans have never been cheaper, with plans now starting at just AU$90 p/m. Alternatively, if you feel that 1,000Mbps speeds will be overkill for your home, there are a number of great-value 100Mbps plans also available.\nYou can view our expert picks for each speed tier below.\nSpintel | 100Mbps | AU$65p/m (first 6 months, then AU$81.95p/m)\nSpintel is currently our favourite provider for an NBN 100 plan thanks to its low introductory cost and the cheapest ongoing cost of any provider we monitor. In fact, it's the only provider to come in under AU$1,000 a year after the introductory discount ends.\n\u2022 AU$65 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$881.70 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$983.40 ongoing yearly cost\nSpintel is also our favourite when it comes to choosing an NBN 250 plan. Once again, cost is the key factor here, with the telco now charging a flat fee for the life of the plan. At AU$80 p/m, it's the outright cheapest of any provider by at least AU$15 each month. This plan doesn't quote maximum typical evening speeds, but in our opinion the 10Mbps drop is outweighed by the seriously cheap price.\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$960 yearly cost\nFinally, Spintel once again takes the crown for the NBN 1000 tier and again, it's largely because of price. As with the 250Mbps tier, Spintel isn't offering an introductory discount here and instead simply charges a flat fee of just AU$90 p/m, which is exceptional value. Not only does this make it almost AU$800 cheaper per year than Telstra's (slower) NBN 1000 plan, it's actually just AU$1 more per month that Telstra's NBN 25 plan. What\u2019s more, Spintel claims 750Mbps typical evening speeds, which while not the fastest, should be plenty fast enough for most customers.\n\u2022 AU$90 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,080 yearly cost\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

      "text": "Best NBN plans for August 2025: my expert picks for affordable, fast and reliable internet\nI've compared the best plans from NBN providers including Spintel, Aussie Broadband, Telstra and more\nThe NBN landscape is getting a major shake up in just over a month, and the changes could have a huge effect on the best NBN plans in Australia. While there have been a few changes to pricing due to increased wholesale costs, we're not far away from the planned NBN speed upgrades.\nThese speed upgrades encompass both a brand new speed tier, known as NBN 2000 plans, alongside a boost to some current tiers. Most notably, NBN 100 plans are going to change to NBN 500 plans and receive a 5x speed boost, while NBN 250 plans should eventually be known as NBN 750 plans, thanks to a 3x speed upgrade.\nSo, while you may be seeking out the best NBN plans right now, it could pay to switch providers or plans before these changes take effect so ensure you're in the best possible position to take advantage of them. That could mean downgrading from one of the fastest NBN plans, in order to receive the incoming speed boost, while also paying less each month.\nAlthough, while cost certainly does factor into my decision making, it's worth noting that the cheapest NBN plan isn't always the best NBN plan and it could pay to spend a little extra each month in return for a more reliable connection or better customer service.\nMax is TechRadar's NBN expert, constantly seeking out the best plans and deals from Australia's biggest providers. He especially loves to keep track of typical evening speed claims and which providers offer the greatest overall value.\nBest NBN plan overall\nDespite the NBN 50 tier continuing to be the most popular, based on the ACCC's latest Wholesale Market report, I've now selected an NBN 100 plan as the best option for most people.\nNot only is the fastest available tier for all connection types, but those who connect via a fibre to the premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) connection will receive the 5x speed boost in September for free.\nKogan Internet | 100Mbps | AU$65.90p/m (first 6 months, then AU$83.90p/m)\nKogan Internet is back to being my top pick for an NBN 100 plan, following Mate's decision to increase its plan prices by AU$6 across the board, allowing Kogan to swoop in to offer a greater value plan. With the majority of NBN providers claiming maximum plan speeds, my decision comes down to cost, and Kogan's offering is the cheapest.\n\u2022 AU$65.90 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$898.80 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,006.80 ongoing yearly cost\n- View more of the best NBN 100 plans\nNBN 25\nAn NBN 25 plan is ideal for light users or single person households. It should provide just enough speed to stream a 4K movie.\nFlip | 25Mbps | AU$39p/m (first 6 months, then AU$57.90p/m)\nThanks to an exclusive WhistleOut offer, Flip's NBN 25 plan becomes outrageously cheap and the perfect option if you're a single-person or small household. The same plan receives just a 4 month discount directly at Flip, making this exclusive offer one that's simply unrivalled in my opinion.\n\u2022 AU$39 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$581.40 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$694.80 ongoing yearly cost\n- View more of the best NBN 25 plans\nNBN 50\nAn NBN 50 plan is a great option for a majority of users because it will not only comfortably handle a 4K video stream or two, but in general it has enough bandwidth to allow a family household to connect at the same time. If you download large game files, however, then you may want to look for a faster alternative.\nBuddy | 49Mbps | AU$75(first month free)\nBuddy is still my current favourite pick for an NBN 50 plan, especially now you get the first month for free when you sign up before August 31 and use the code FIRSTMONTHFREE. Doing so makes this plan the most affordable NBN 50 plan, both in the first year and each ongoing year. Throw in the fact that it uses the well-reviewed Aussie Broadband network, and you've got yourself a winning NBN 50 plan.\n\u2022 AU$75 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$825 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$900 ongoing yearly cost\n- View more of the best NBN 50 plans\nNBN 250\nNBN 250 plans are best-suited to households with multiple people wanting to download, stream and connect at the same time, or even gamers, as the extra speed will benefit larger file downloads. Note that only households with FTTP or HFC connection types can get an NBN 250 plan. If you're not sure what you have, you can use the NBN address checker.\nSuperloop | 250Mbps | AU$85p/m (first 6 months, then AU$99p/m)\nSuperloop holds its spot as my top pick for an NBN 250 plan thanks to its low cost and fast upload speeds on the Superfast Plus plan I've selected here (a second, Superfast plan is also available, with slower upload speeds). The telco also advertises maximum download speeds during the busier evening hours and both the introductory cost and ongoing AU$99p/m charge are well below average.\n\u2022 AU$85 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,104 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,188 ongoing yearly cost\n- View more of the best NBN 250 plans\nNBN 1000\nGigabit internet is currently the fastest you can get in Australia, although I've yet to see a provider claim the absolute maximum 1,000Mbps download speeds. I've therefore picked my favourite option that come close to that magic figure.\nBuddy Telco | 875Mbps | AU$99p/m(first month free)\nBuddy Telco continues to be my top recommendation for an NBN 1000 plan due to its well-reviewed service and low cost. As with the NBN 50 plan (and all others Buddy offers) you get your first month free using a coupon code listed on the website. The discount makes Buddy's plan the most affordable of those I monitor. Other great options here include Superloop AU$85p/m and Flip offers a competitive option of a 900Mbps plan for AU$94p/m for the first 4 months. I've continued to select Buddy as it promises to deliver excellent speeds, which is the whole point of signing up for an NBN 1000 plan, right? Any option is great, but Buddy's ongoing offering is still my favourite.\n\u2022 AU$99 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,089 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,188 ongoing yearly cost\n- View more of the best NBN 1000 plans\nNBN 100/40\nMost NBN 100 plans are referred to as 100/20, with the second number indicating the maximum theoretical upload speeds. With a 100/40 NBN plan, that means your upload speeds will be faster \u2013 up to a maximum of 40Mbps. Upload speeds are important to people carrying out video calls at home, or uploading large files to web-based storage.\nSuperloop Power Home | 100/34Mbps | AU$85/m (first 6 months, then AU$99/m)\nIf you're needing faster upload speeds at home, Superloop's plan gets my vote. It advertises maximum download speeds for this tier and a competitive 34Mbps upload speed (the maximum possible is 40Mbps). This plan also comes with the added benefit of the My Speed Boost feature, which lets you increase the download speed to the next tier \u2013 NBN 250 \u2013 for free, five times a month.\n\u2022 AU$85 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,104 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,188 ongoing yearly cost\nWhich is the best NBN provider?\nBest NBN provider this month \u2013 Buddy Telco\nFor a long time, Spintel has been my favourite NBN provider, but due to some recent plan restructuring, Buddy now gets my vote. Spintel is still a great option, and it's now advertising 500Mbps and 750Mbps plans, but since those tiers are technically official yet, I've decided to hold back on awarding Spintel my seal of approval (watch this space over the next few months).\nBuddy is a great provider, offering cost-effective plans with excellent typical evening speed claims, particularly on the NBN 1000 tier. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, it uses the Aussie Broadband network, which is positively reviewed by customers, and it's also a great option for gamers.\n\u2022 Learn more: Best NBN provider\nBest NBN plans: major telcos\nWhen looking at NBN plans, you\u2019ll notice that the three major telcos tend to have the more expensive options out there \u2013 particularly Telstra and Optus. The benefits of going with Telstra, Optus or TPG for your NBN plan is that you can feel confident you\u2019ll get a reliable, high-performing service, as has been continuously shown in the ACCC\u2019s reporting.\n\u2022 Learn how to check your NBN speed\nAnother benefit to signing up with Telstra or Optus is that these providers often throw in perks and optional add-ons, such as a modem with 4G backup, free trials of streaming services or plans that are optimised for gaming. TPG doesn\u2019t have these optional extras, but it\u2019s the cheapest option of the big three with good value plans.\nIf you\u2019re looking for an NBN plan from Telstra, Optus or TPG these are my plan recommendations:\nOptus | NBN 100 | 100Mbps | AU$99p/m\nOptus is usually a more affordable alternative to Telstra, and it regularly performs well in official ACCC reporting across speed and outages (or lack thereof). While Optus' high-speed services edge into 'expensive' territory, it has been confirmed to receive the 5x speed boost in September for customers with FTTP or HFC connections, at no extra charge. Plus, if you bundle another service, you can save AU$15p/m for 12 months.\nJust note that you'll need to remain connected to Optus for 36 months in order to get the modem for free, otherwise you'll need to pay some high device repayment fees.\n\u2022 AU$405 minimum cost (incl. modem)\n\u2022 AU$1,188 yearly cost\nNeed a different speed? See our full comparison of all Optus NBN plans.\nTPG | NBN 1000 | 800Mbps | AU$89.99p/m (first 6 months, then AU$109.99p/m)\nDespite changing its pricing structure, TPG's NBN 1000 plan still remains competitive. The telco has dropped the cost to AU$89.99p/m for the first 6 months (from a flat rate AU$104.99) but the service then increases by AU$20 thereafter. Still, I think this is great value from one of the 'big three' providers and a plan you should consider if you're looking for a fast connection.\n\u2022 AU$89.99 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,199.88 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,319.88 ongoing yearly cost\nTelstra | NBN 100 | 100Mbps | AU$113p/m\nTelstra\u2019s NBN plans are often the most expensive in the market, and they've increased further following the recent price hikes across the NBN (its 250Mbps and 1,000Mbps plans have decreased slightly). This means it's still hard to justify Telstra plans when there are cheaper choices out there that offer a similar service. However, Telstra\u2019s NBN plans benefit from a modem with 4G backup and the ability to prioritise online traffic. I've chosen the 100Mbps plan for its (current) small premium over the 50Mbps plan.\n\u2022 AU$110 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,356 yearly cost\n- Telstra vs Optus NBN: who has better broadband?\n- Want to see other NBN plans? You can use our NBN plan finder to compare a huge range of Australian NBN plans\nHow I choose the best NBN plans\nTo select my picks for the best NBN plans, I consider and weigh up the following key aspects for fixed-line NBN plans:\nSpeed: Each speed tier indicates the maximum speed available, for example, an NBN 50 plan is able to reach download speeds of 50Mbps. However, not every provider will be able to reach the maximum speed available during the busiest evening hours, which fall between 7 to 11pm. NBN providers are required to report their typical evening speeds, so I look for plans that have a maxed-out typical evening speed. No provider reaches the theoretical maximum of 1,000Mbps in the NBN 1000 tier, so in this instance, I consider the total claimed megabytes per second (mbps) against price to weigh relative value.\nPrice: Price is an important factor in my decision making. I look for plans that are below, or at least on par with, the average monthly price in their respective speed tier. Price ultimately has to be weighed up against speed, as there\u2019s no use paying for a cheap NBN plan that offers slower-than-average speed. Most NBN providers also offer an initial discount period (typically 6 months) to encourage you to sign up, so I look for competitive offers when making my choices. The ongoing price must also remain reasonable to get my recommendation.\nData allowance: The majority of fixed-line NBN plans offer unlimited data, so in all but exceptional cases, I only recommend plans with an unlimited data allowance.\nPerformance: The ACCC monitors the performance of some of the top NBN providers in Australia, so I always take this data into account when making my recommendations. If the ACCC doesn\u2019t monitor a particular internet provider, I also look at feedback provided by real users on sites such as Whirlpool.\nPerks: I consider perks as nice to have, but they carry less weight compared to other factors in my decision making. Some examples of perks include Australian-based customer support, or the ability to include a home phone service. Other perks can enhance the performance of your service, such as the ability to bump your plan\u2019s regular speed up to the next available tier on five days of your choosing \u2013 a feature offered by Exetel and Superloop.\nNBN FAQ\nWhat is the NBN?\nThe National Broadband Network (NBN) is Australia\u2019s upgraded internet and phone infrastructure. It\u2019s a government initiative that was first announced more than 10 years ago, and after several changes to the rollout plan, it\u2019s officially been declared complete (though upgrades are still ongoing).\nThe NBN uses optical fibre and other technology types to get faster, stable internet into homes across Australia, taking the place of copper wires and cable broadband.\nUnderstanding NBN speeds: which is right for you?\nChoosing an NBN speed tier is arguably the most important decision you\u2019ll make when it comes to getting internet. To figure out which is right for you, factor in how many people will be using the internet in your household and what their usage is like. Here, we\u2019ve broken down each speed tier, and what they get you.\nYour connection type can also limit what speed tiers you can access \u2013 click here to learn more about NBN connection types, or head to the NBN Co\u2019s website to check what connection is available at your address.\nNBN 12 (Basic I): 12Mbps download | 1Mbps upload | Any connection type | 1 user | Suited for a one-person household for browsing the internet, sending emails and watching YouTube videos at 1080p \u2013 though this tier is not recommended for lots of streaming.\nNBN 25 (Basic II): 25Mbps download | 5Mbps upload | Any connection type | 1-2 users | For one or two people who want to browse the web at the same time, stream music and stream video in 1080p.\nNBN 50 (Standard): 50Mbps download | 20Mbps upload | Any connection type | 2-4 users | Allows multiple users to stream in high definition and play games online, and crucially for some, it\u2019s higher uploads are well-suited to working from home \u2013 particularly if you need to video chat.\nNBN 100 (Fast): 100Mbps download | 20Mbps upload | Any connection type | 5+ users | Suitable for streaming video in 4K, downloading large files and having multiple devices online at the same time. Receiving a speed increase to 500/50 in September.\nNBN 250 (Superfast): 250Mbps download | 25Mbps upload | FTTP, HFC connections | 5+ users | Gives you absurdly fast speeds that will let multiple people stream in 4K at the same time, and allow faster downloads of large files such as games and OS updates. Receiving a speed increase to 750/50 in September.\nNBN 1000 (Ultrafast): 1000Mbps download | 50Mbps upload | FTTP, HFC connections | 5+ users | Fastest speed tier you can get, and typical evening speed claims have continued to improve. The slowest was once around 245Mbps, but now sits around 700Mbps. The fastest quoted typical evening speed is 900Mbps by Flip.\nWhat does 'typical evening speed' mean?\nA typical evening speed is the realistic download speed you can expect on a plan during the peak busy hours of 7pm-11pm. Each telco will quote a typical evening speed on its plans, and this number can vary within the same speed tier, so be sure to check and compare.\nThe good news is that, while this figure serves as a rough guide, official data recorded by the ACCC has found the majority of providers actually overdeliver on the speeds they advertise.\nWith so many providers offering a fast service, factoring in typical evening speeds isn\u2019t as important as it used to be, but you should still keep an eye out for low numbers. Any NBN provider quoting close to the tier\u2019s top-rated speed is fine, but consider it a big red flag if it\u2019s significantly lower than the norm.\nWhat are NBN connection types?\nFirst, to figure out what connection type you have, check your address on the NBN Co website. Your connection type is good to know, as not every NBN plan is supported by every connection, so it\u2019s an easy first step in narrowing down your choices.\nWhile the NBN is made up of a multi-technology mix, it\u2019s important to know that you don\u2019t have a choice in what technology is available to you. Different connection types have been built in different areas, so it\u2019s entirely dependent on where you live. Below, we lay out the connection types across the network, and what they mean.\nFibre-to-the-premises (FTTP): FTTP is a fibre-optic line that runs directly to your home, and therefore is the best type of connection you can have. It requires a device to be installed in your home, and is what was originally intended for every household in Australia when the NBN was first announced. Customers with FTTN/C connections are now eligible to receive a free upgrade to FTTP.\nFibre-to-the-building (FTTB): An FTTB connection is most commonly used for connecting apartment blocks and similar buildings to the NBN. In this instance, a fibre-optic line runs to the building\u2019s communications room, and existing technology such as copper wiring is used to connect each apartment from there.\nHybrid fibre coaxial (HFC): An HFC connection uses existing pay TV (Foxtel) or cable network as the final connection to households. The HFC line will run from your home to the nearest available fibre node.\nFibre-to-the-curb (FTTC): FTTC is when the fibre-optic cable extends a little closer to your home by connecting to a distribution unit located outside on the street. From there, it uses the copper phone line to run the last leg into your home.\nFibre-to-the-node (FTTN): Once the most common connection in Australia (and it still is, but only now by a few hundred thousand), FTTN uses existing copper phone wire to make the final connection to the home from a central node in your neighbourhood. The distance of your home to the node will affect the average speeds you can reach, so if your home is more than 700m from the node, it\u2019s not advisable to choose an NBN 100 plan.\nFixed Wireless: Fixed Wireless connections are used to reach regional and remote areas. Homes in these areas will access the NBN from a transmission tower through an antenna installed on their roof.\nSky Muster satellite: The NBN\u2019s Sky Muster satellite technology is also used to reach regional and remote communities. It requires a satellite dish to be installed on the premises, to which the NBN is received through satellite.\nTL;DR: Check your address on the NBN Co website to find out what connection you have. It\u2019s important to know because not every NBN plan is supported by every connection type.\nHow much should my NBN plan cost?\nOnce you know what type of connection you have and what speed you want, you can find a plan that suits you at the right price.\nThere\u2019s good news for those who just want to surf the web casually \u2013 for that kind of use, it doesn\u2019t matter what ISP you go with. Recent research by the ACCC has shown that your choice of provider won\u2019t impact website browsing performance, so you can go with a cheap NBN plan if this is all you\u2019re after.\nBut if you need to do more with your internet, you might want to consider some of the fastest NBN plans. These will cost you more per month, but they\u2019ll allow you to download and upload large files faster, stream comfortably in 4K and game online with minimal lag.\nWhen looking at NBN plan prices, be sure to suss out what internet deals are available too. It\u2019s extremely common for ISPs to offer a discount for your first six months on their service, and it\u2019s usually about AU$15 off each month.\nThe telcos will also try and tempt you up to faster plans with bigger discounts \u2013 up to AU$40 off each month for six months in some cases \u2013 so consider taking advantage of these options too.\nThere\u2019s one last thing to mention when it comes to price, and that\u2019s contracts. The vast majority of NBN plans come with no lock-in contracts, so you\u2019re free to leave anytime (though some telcos will require you to pay out the remaining cost of your modem).\nNBN plans on a contract will typically last between six and 12 months, and the benefit here is usually in reducing upfront fee costs (such as waiving the set up fee or throwing in a free modem).\nWhile those benefits may seem tempting, weigh up those perks before committing to a contract. If you decide to leave early, you\u2019ll likely still need to pay for each month you have remaining.\nTL;DR: If you just want to browse the internet, a cheap NBN plan from a smaller NBN provider will do you just fine. For those that want to stream in 4K and game online, look for a fast NBN plan at a competitive price. Be sure to take advantage of six month discounts offered to new customers, and weigh up whether a contract or no-lock in term is best for you.\nWhat\u2019s the best NBN provider for Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and other cities?\nMany people wonder whether there\u2019s a 'best' NBN provider for their particular city. Over the last couple of years, we've seen rising interest in plans based on location, such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth \u2013 so does your locale really matter when selecting an ISP?\nThe answer is tricky. If you live on the east coast of Australia, the answer is generally no, your location won\u2019t matter when choosing a provider. If you live in South Australia, the Northern Territory or Western Australia, you may experience some benefit from choosing an ISP that\u2019s headquartered (or at least has a local presence) in your state.\nThis is because of the way traffic flows to and from the user to the wider internet. All providers effectively act as a middle man in between users and the internet, routing all transmitted and received data through their own infrastructure. Providers\u2019 direct physical connections to the internet are known as \u201cpoints of interconnect\u201d (POI), and all user internet traffic is routed through a POI. There are 121 POIs across Australia, but because connecting to a POI requires physical hardware, most service providers only use a smaller subset of these.\nBecause they\u2019re the critical link in the user-to-internet chain, the physical location of your provider\u2019s nearest PIO to you can play a large role in factors like latency and ping time. If your POI is thousands of kilometres away from your home, this is naturally going to result in a bigger delay in data flowing in both directions.\nLatency and ping time matter most when it comes to tasks that work in real time \u2013 so things such as video calling and online gaming. An ACCC report released in April 2023 revealed that online gamers living in NSW and the ACT experience much lower latency on average compared to the rest of the country, and that\u2019s because most game servers located in Australia are housed in Sydney.\nWhile your internet provider of choice won\u2019t be able to resolve all issues related to latency and ping time, signing up with a locally-based provider (or one that\u2019s at least connected to a local POI) can help reduce these factors. For example, Pentanet is an ISP based in Western Australia that\u2019s often spoken of highly by gamers living in the state.\nThere\u2019s no one-stop-shop for checking if an NBN provider is connected to your closest POI, but there\u2019s a few steps you can take. First, check if the provider has a POI lookup tool \u2013 Aussie Broadband and Superloop both offer this, for example. If the ISP you\u2019re looking at doesn\u2019t offer an official way to check, then you\u2019ll have to head to a website such as Whirlpool and do some digging yourself. Finally, if Whirlpool doesn\u2019t have what you\u2019re looking for, your best bet is to email the internet provider directly.\nHow does switching NBN providers work?\nSo you\u2019ve done your research and found the NBN provider you want to switch to, what\u2019s next?\nSwitching NBN providers is usually fairly seamless \u2013 your new ISP should take care of the whole process, including informing your current ISP of the change. If you\u2019ve requested a modem/router with your switch, your new ISP will usually wait until that arrives to connect you \u2013 your existing service will continue to work as usual in the meantime.\nIf you\u2019re keeping your current modem/router, then the switch can often happen within 24-48 hours, and will likely require you to change some of your router settings, such as username and password.\nThere\u2019s one important step to do before finally switching providers, and that is to check the fine print of your current ISP.\nIf you are currently on a contract with your internet provider, you\u2019ll likely face an exit fee or be required to payout the remaining months on your plan. If this is you, we\u2019d highly recommend reconsidering breaking the contract unless absolutely necessary.\nHowever, even if you\u2019re on a month-to-month plan instead of a contract, you could still face a cancellation fee. For example, TPG requires its users to give a 30-day notice before cancellation, and if this isn\u2019t done, you\u2019ll need to payout the remaining days of the month.\nIf you find that your current ISP requires you to give notice of cancellation, we\u2019d recommend scheduling the switch with your new NBN provider, so you can avoid any surprise exit fees.\nHow do I connect to the NBN?\nIf you\u2019re not sure whether you can connect to the NBN yet, check your address on the NBN Co website. Most Australians do have access to the NBN, and if you find your home is NBN-ready, all you need to do is select an NBN plan and sign up. Then you can either use a BYO modem or one provided by your telco of choice to connect to Wi-Fi.\nIf you find that your home isn\u2019t connected to the NBN, you\u2019ll need to contact NBN Co and organise installation.\nDo I need a new modem/router for the NBN?\nFor a modem/router to connect to the NBN, it needs to have a VDSL port, so you will need to upgrade if your current hardware is missing this port. While most plans will give you the option of bringing your own device for the connection, you\u2019ll also have the ability to buy one directly from your NBN provider.\nFor the everyday internet connection, these modem/routers will suffice for your connection, though you may want to consider buying better hardware if you\u2019ve signed up for a fast NBN plan \u2013 just ensure that it\u2019s compatible.\nWhat is a good data amount for my NBN plan?\nThe majority of NBN plans available today come with unlimited data, with prices starting from AU$39 a month for an unlimited data plan. With an unlimited data plan, you won\u2019t have to worry about monthly data caps, and we\u2019d argue that they\u2019re better value for money when factoring in price per gigabyte.\nWhich is the cheapest NBN provider?\nThe provider with the cheapest NBN plan overall is Flip, which offers an NBN 12 plan for AU$39 a month, although its NBN 25 plan is currently available for the same price for the first six months, making it great value. If you\u2019re looking for affordable internet, head over to our cheap NBN plans page, where we\u2019ve compared the cheapest plans from each speed tier.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

      "text": "NBN Co meets guidance targets, nation-wide network upgrades on track\nFY25 Results Snapshot and CEO commentary\nNBN Co has reported solid operational and financial results for the year ending 30 June 2025, delivering against the guidance targets set out in the NBN Co 2025 Statement of Corporate Intent and the company\u2019s purpose of \u2018Elevating Australia by connecting people and powering progress\u2019.\nThe results highlight the company\u2019s momentum as it delivers fibre further into the network, enhances operational performance, embeds emerging technologies, and maintains a disciplined focus on cost efficiency.\nThroughout FY25, Australians continued to embrace faster speeds and full fibre connections, upgrading from copper-based technologies in record numbers. This shift is driving increased demand for higher-speed tiers and lifting data usage across the country. Average monthly data downloads per premises rose more than 10 per cent \u2014 from 460 GB in June 2024 to 508 GB in June 2025.\nThe number of homes and businesses connected via Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) grew by 23 per cent \u2014 from 2.165 million to 2.665 million \u2014 making FTTP the dominant fixed-line technology on the nbn\u00ae network. FTTP services also recorded the largest usage growth among fixed-line technologies, with average monthly downloads rising 13 per cent to 606 GB, a trend expected to continue as more customers upgrade to full fibre and adopt higher speed tiers.\nFinancial Highlights\n- Total revenue grew 4% to $5.7 billion and EBITDA1 increased 8% to $4.2 billion, meeting guidance targets set out in the Statement of Corporate Intent 2025.\n- Residential ARPU rose by $3 to $50 per month, driven by increased adoption of higher-speed products and regulated wholesale price changes under the SAU Variation.\n- Business and enterprise revenue grew to $1.2 billion, up 6% year-on-year.\n- Operating expenses fell 5% to $1.6 billion, reflecting disciplined cost efficiency initiatives.\n- Capital expenditure reduced by 7% to $3.5 billion, reflecting completion of the majority of network infrastructure and capacity investments.\nCustomer Highlights\n- Connected premises \u2014 More than 8.63 million premises are now connected to the nbn\u00ae network, with 31% or 2.66 million on FTTP, up from 25% or 2.17 million in FY24.\n- Record fibre lead-ins and FTTP growth \u2014 More than 430,000 premises upgraded from legacy copper to FTTP in FY25 \u2014 more than double FY24 \u2014 taking the total to over 805,000.\n- Higher-speed adoption \u2014 2.77 million premises (32%) are connected on wholesale plans offering 100 Mbps or above, up from 2.08 million (24%) in FY24.\n- Data usage growth \u2014 Average monthly usage of 508 GB per premises, with FTTP services averaging 606 GB, up 13% year-on-year.\nNetwork Upgrades\n- Fibre Connect program \u2014 On track to complete the initial five-year program on time and on budget by December 2025, making more than 10 million premises \u2014 90% of the fixed-line network \u2014 eligible for near gigabit and multi-gigabit wholesale speeds2,3.\n- Local Fibre Network expansion \u2014 Upgrades completed to serve 4.6 million premises, a 21% increase on the 3.9 million served a year earlier.\n- Pathway off copper \u2014 Confirmed a pathway off legacy copper technology for the remaining 622,000 premises served by Fibre to the Node (FTTN).\n- Regional upgrades and demand \u2014 Fixed Wireless network upgrades expanded coverage from 220,000 to 345,000 square kilometres and delivered faster wholesale speeds to regional Australia. Expansion of Sky Muster Plus Premium uncapped plans7 has seen overall satellite network usage increase and average usage for Satellite customers increase 24% to 153GB/month. With a quarter of the satellite customers on the highest Sky Muster Plus Premium typically using on average a third of a Terabyte every month.\nOperational Highlights\n- Welcomed new Chief Executive Officer, Ellie Sweeney, and Chief Financial Officer, Simon Atkinson.\n- Recorded zero serious Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) incidents in FY25, supported by a technology-enabled injury reduction plan and consistently high compliance with critical risk controls.\n- Continued to operate a climate resilient and resource efficient network, that supports Australia\u2019s current and future social wellbeing and economic prosperity, and aims to achieve Net Zero emissions by FY45.\n- Achieved an employee engagement score in the top quartile globally.\nEllie Sweeney, Chief Executive Officer at NBN Co, said:\n\u201cThese results demonstrate that our strategy of upgrading our network to full fibre and other leading technologies is delivering for customers, businesses and the nation. We are on track to complete the initial five-year Fibre Connect program on time by December 2025, and on budget. Almost 9.8 million premises can now order our highest speed residential products, and by the end of December this year, that will grow to more than 10 million premises, or 90 per cent of our fixed line network.\n\u201cWith 7 out of 10 Australian homes and business connected to the nbn network, our focus is on lifting customer experience, delivering a resilient network that supports digitisation and AI workloads, while ensuring the benefits of connectivity are delivered across our communities, homes and businesses, now and into the future.\n\u201cWe take great pride in delivering a reliable, high-speed and high-capacity network to Australians and it is our investment in the network that is enabling us to \u2018Accelerate Great\u2019, as we say, which will lift our 100 Mbps wholesale speed tier to offer wholesale download speeds of 500 Mbps in September2. These investments are also enabling the launch of our first multi-gigabit wholesale residential products, via participating retailers, to eligible customers connected to the nbn\u00ae network via FTTP and HFC.\n\u201cNBN Co is a critical infrastructure provider, and the nbn\u00ae network is a platform for national progress that enables Australians to work remotely, start and grow businesses, access healthcare, connect with education, and remain close to the people who matter most in our lives.\n\u201cLooking to the future, it is nbn\u2019s aim that our 500 Mbps wholesale speed tier becomes Australia\u2019s most popular nbn plan. And thanks to our investments in the latest technologies and network upgrades, we expect to lift average fixed broadband speeds across the nation.\n\u201cThe nbn\u00ae network is delivering and Australians are responding. It is our responsibility and privilege to deliver the digital infrastructure today that will be critical to the way Australians work, learn, connect and grow in the future.\n\u201cOur goal is to turn investment into impact, innovation into inclusion, and infrastructure into opportunity for the economy, communities, and families in every home and business across Australia.\u201d\nDetailed Results\nNBN Co, today reported solid financial and operational results for FY25. Total revenue was $5.7 billion, a 4 per cent increase on FY24 and Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation1 (EBITDA) was $4.2 billion, up 8 per cent on FY24. Revenue and EBITDA were in line with guidance.\nTotal revenue growth was driven by a 6 per cent increase in telecommunications revenue compared to FY24 with Residential Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) up $3 to $50 per month. The higher Residential ARPU is directly attributed to growing customer demand for higher speed products and the application of regulated wholesale price changes, in accordance with the Special Access Undertaking (SAU) Variation that was accepted by the ACCC.\nThe availability and strong uptake of higher revenue, higher speed products was enabled and underpinned by the company\u2019s progress towards the completion of its initial five-year Fibre Connect upgrade program to make more than 10 million homes and businesses, or 90 per cent of the nbn fixed line network, eligible to access near gigabit wholesale download speeds by December 2025.\nRevenue from business and enterprise customers increased to $1.2 billion, up 6 per cent on the prior year, as the company continued to support the diverse and evolving broadband needs of small, medium and large businesses across all parts of Australia.\nCapital expenditure during FY25 was $3.5 billion, down 7 per cent compared to FY24. The reduction in capital expenditure reflects the company\u2019s successful completion of the majority of network infrastructure and capacity investments. The company has completed the majority of its local fibre network upgrades.\nThe company has continued to optimise its cost base with total operating expenses of $1.6 billion for FY25, down 5 per cent on FY24.\nAccenture economic research, commissioned by nbn, indicates that a faster, higher capacity nbn network could improve Australia\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by a cumulative total of around $400 billion by 2030.\nEvolving the nbn\u00ae network\nNBN Co made 9.76 million premises, or 85 per cent of premises on the nbn fixed line network, eligible to upgrade and access near gigabit wholesale download speeds5,6 by 30 June 2025.\nSince launching Fibre Connect, more than 805,000 premises have upgraded to nbn full fibre, giving these premises access to nbn\u2019s highest available wholesale residential speed tiers.\nNBN Co is on track to complete upgrades to the local fibre network that will enable 3.5 million premises served by FTTN and 1.5 million premises served by Fibre to the Curb (FTTC) to upgrade to nbn full fibre by the end of December 2025.\nIn January 2025, the Australian Government announced an equity investment of up to $3 billion, combined with an $800 million investment funded internally, to provide new upgrade paths for remaining premises on the FTTN network by the end of 2030. The investment is expected to benefit around 622,000 homes and businesses with more than half located in regional Australia.\nThrough Accelerate Great, set to launch in September 2025, NBN Co will be supporting Australian homes and businesses to meet the increasing data demands of a digital-first way of life. These products will be available at no additional cost to participating Retail Service Providers to sell to eligible residential and business customers connected to the nbn\u00ae network via full fibre or Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC).\nNBN Co delivered on commitments to expand the coverage and increase the speed and capacity of the nbn Fixed Wireless network by 31 December 2024. Additionally, eligible premises within the remaining nbn Sky Muster satellite footprint have access to uncapped internet data7 and faster speeds8.\nOn 5 August 2025, NBN Co and Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper announced a contractual agreement to deliver high-speed broadband to customers in parts of regional, rural and remote Australia via Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite technology. More than 300,000 premises within NBN Co\u2019s existing satellite footprint will be able to order the LEO broadband service when it becomes available.\nBuilding for 2030 and beyond, NBN Co is focused on delivering resilient, high-capacity digital infrastructure that supports Australia\u2019s economic growth, social inclusion, and climate goals.\nSafe and engaged workforce\nIn FY25, zero serious harm Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) incidents, including fatalities and permanent disabling injuries, were recorded.\nNBN Co has implemented several initiatives focused on keeping its field workforce safe. This includes an injury reduction plan which leverages technology to eliminate and minimise risks, helping to reduce the injury frequency rate, and enhance training and safety awareness.\nCompliance rates with NBN Co\u2019s Critical Risk Controls remained consistently high across Delivery Partners and the Company\u2019s internal workforce.\nDriving innovation through AI and automation\nThe company is embracing emerging technologies, including AI, to improve customer experience, optimise and simplify the business and help move the industry forward.\nNBN Co continues to embed innovation into the fabric of its operations, harnessing the power of AI and automation to deliver better outcomes for customers, partners and employees. From \u2018AskNBN\u2019, a generative AI tool that unlocks thousands of pages of technical documentation, to \u2018DesignAI\u2019, which accelerates network planning and build processes, the company is transforming how it operates at scale. AI-powered support engines are streamlining Retail Service Provider interactions, while tools like \u2018CustomerBrain\u2019 and \u2018RecapRocket\u2019 are enhancing marketing effectiveness and agent productivity. NBN Co is also leveraging third-party platforms to improve customer sentiment analysis and voice call centre performance.\nSustainable financing\nIn May 2025, NBN Co successfully raised EUR 700 million (A$1.2 billion equivalent) from its inaugural Sustainability Bond9. The issuance was the first on record EUR denominated use of proceeds Sustainability Bond issued by an Australian corporate.\nNBN Co also raised A$1.5 billion of Green Bonds in the Australian debt capital markets during FY25. Proceeds from the Green Bonds have been fully allocated to eligible green projects undertaken as part of the company\u2019s commitment to energy efficiency.\nNBN Co\u2019s total outstanding Green and Sustainability Bonds is the equivalent of over A$8.7 billion, cementing the company\u2019s position as the largest Australian corporate issuer in sustainable financing format in the domestic and international debt capital markets as at 30 June 2025.\nFootnotes\n1. EBITDA includes Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Other non-operating income, Depreciation and Amortisation and Gains/(Losses) on derivatives measured at fair value through profit/(loss).\n2. An end customer\u2019s experience, including the speeds actually achieved over the nbn\u00ae network, depends on some factors outside NBN Co\u2019s control (like equipment quality, software, and how a retail service provider designs its network) and the NBN Co technology used for the connection.\n3. Regardless of the retail service an end customer purchases, the actual wholesale speeds delivered by nbn\u00ae highest residential wholesale speed tier of 500 to close to 1000 Mbps will be less than 1 Gbps due to equipment and network limitations and the peak information rate may fall anywhere in this range. References to speeds are not customer speeds; they are wholesale layer 2 peak information rate bandwidth provided to retail providers. NBN Co provides wholesale services to phone and internet providers. nbn\u00ae wholesale speed tiers available to providers vary depending on the access technology in an end user's area.\n4. Research commissioned by nbn. \u2018The Economic and social impact of investment in the nbn network\u2019. The economic and social impact of investment in the nbn\u00ae network Methodology Report, January 2024. The analysis was specifically focused on broadband delivered to premises (both nbn and non-nbn broadband) and did not seek to measure or take into account the economic or social impact that may have come from mobile broadband. Although mobile networks account for only 13 per cent of downloads across retail nbn, non-nbn fixed and mobile networks in the June quarter of 2023 (ACCC Internet Activity Report for period ending 30 June 2023), the pattern of economic and social benefits set out in this report may change if mobile broadband was able to be explicitly included in the analysis.\n5. These are nbn\u00ae wholesale speed tiers, which NBN Co provides to retail phone and internet providers. Attainable wholesale speeds are subject to the rollout of network upgrades and some premises will require NBN Co to complete upgrades to the equipment at the premises.\n6. See footnote 2; and speeds may be impacted by the number of concurrent users on nbn's Fixed Wireless network (including during busy periods).\n7. Fair Use Policy and shaping apply. To proactively protect and ensure the fair access to the nbn\u00ae network for all users, NBN Co may from time to time, at its discretion, shape the following activities to maximum wholesale upload and download speeds of 256 kbps: uploads and downloads via peer to peer; uploads and downloads to cloud storage platforms; PC and smartphone operating system updates; software/application updates; gaming software updates; any other traffic related to applications which nbn cannot identify. Other activity that NBN Co considers may cause adverse network impacts may also be added to the above list to be shaped, including streaming video and VPN.\n8. Your experience, including the speeds actually achieved, depends on many factors, including whether you are using the internet during the busy periods (7pm - 11pm), the number of people in your household online at the same time, and some factors outside of nbn\u2019s control (like your equipment quality and set-up, chosen broadband plan, age of device(s) and/or how your provider designs its network).\n9.

      "text": "Fastest NBN plans: 100Mbps, 250Mbps, 500Mbps and 1,000Mbps internet plans compared\nIf you're looking to improve your download speeds at home, these are the plans we can't get enough of\nThe fastest NBN plans \u2013 those that deliver download speeds of 100Mbps of faster \u2013 are ideal for larger households, gamers who need to download large files or anyone who loves to stream 4K UHD movies from the best streaming services.\nFor a long time, there were just three speed tiers available to households classed as high-speed NBN plans. However, from September 14, 2025, NBN Co is introducing new speed tiers, comprising speed boosts to current plans and a new tier known as NBN 2000.\nThe speed boosts will affect NBN 100 plans and NBN 250 plans, which will get a 5x and 3x increase, respectively. While not officially confirmed, we're tentatively calling these NBN 500 plans and NBN 750 plans. Anyone currently signed up for an NBN 100 or NBN 250 plan and with an FTTP or HFC connection at home, should receive the speed upgrade at no extra cost.\nSome providers have already jumped the gun and launched these boosted plans, including Exetel, Spintel and Tangerine. They've been able to do so as a result of provisioning faster speeds or, in Exetel's case, scrapping all other plans entirely, leaving the telco with just the single, low-cost option.\nSo, if you're ready to upgrade your home internet and experience faster downloads, read on to discover our top recommendations.\nJump to:\n\u2022 Best NBN 100 plan \u2013 AU$75p/m from Superloop (first 6m, then AU$95p/m)\n\u2022 Best NBN 250 plan \u2013 AU$85p/m from Superloop (first 6m, then AU$99p/m)\n\u2022 Best NBN 500 plan \u2013 AU$80p/m from Exetel\n\u2022 Best NBN 1000 plan \u2013 AU$94p/m from Flip (first 4 months, then AU$104.90p/m)\nCan you get NBN 250, NBN 500 or NBN 1000?\nNot everybody will be able to sign up for a fast NBN plan. The high-speed tiers are only available on two types of NBN connection \u2013 fibre to the premises (FTTP) and hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC). If your household is serviced by an FTTP or HFC installation, you should be able to sign up to an NBN 250, NBN 500 or NBN 1000 plan.\nIt's this connection type that will also be required to service the incoming NBN 750 and NBN 2000 plans.\nAll NBN connection types should be able to support 100Mbps speeds, but if you want to be sure, then you'll want to see if you can get a free fibre upgrade and have FTTP technology installed at your premises.\nNoteworthy fast NBN deals\nBelow we\u2019ll run through our top plan picks, but first, check out these ace offers currently available on fast NBN plans:\n- TPG: lowest introductory cost on NBN 100 plan \u2013 AU$65.99p/m\n- Spintel: Great value NBN 500 plan from just AU$74p/m\n- Buddy Telco: NBN 1000 for just AU$99p/m\nBest fast NBN plans\nBest NBN 100 plan\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nOur choice for large households and those who want a little extra speed\n\u2022 NBN 100 plans are the most broadly available fast plans, with the telcos reporting a typical evening speed of 97Mbps on average.\nSuperloop Family | 100Mbps | AU$75p/m (first 6 months, then AU$95p/m)\nNow, this Superloop plan isn't the most affordable NBN 100 option, but we've selected it because it includes a Speed Boost feature, which lets you temporarily boost the download speed of your plan to the next tier up \u2013 NBN 250. It's for this reason we've selected it when discussing the fastest NBN plans, as it offers the potential to go faster than other providers. You will need an FTTP or HFC connection to activate the speed boost, however.\n\u2022 AU$75 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,020 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,140 ongoing yearly cost\n\u2022 See more: Best NBN 100 plans\nBest NBN 250 plan\nThe go-to for lightning-quick broadband\n\u2022 The availability of NBN 250 plans is now almost on par with that of NBN 100, with telcos reporting a typical evening speed of 237Mbps on average.\nSince we first created this guide to the fastest NBN plans, the number of internet service providers quoting close-to maximum typical evening speeds on the NBN 250 has increased considerably, creating greater competition in the process.\nTelstra and AGL plans are on the more expensive side, and Southern Phone has such bad reviews online that we feel we can't recommend it. We've therefore looked at the remaining NBN providers and taken into account other factors they offer to settle on an overall pick.\nSpintel is our top pick in the overall best NBN plans due to its insanely-low cost but if you want the absolute fastest speeds, Superloop is our pick.\nSuperloop Superfast Plus | 250Mbps | AU$85p/m (first 6 months, then AU$99p/m)\nSuperloop has been a firm favourite of ours for some time and now has two 250Mbps plan options available with a couple of key differences. The Superfast Plus plan we've selected gets you 250Mbps speeds and up to 100Mbps uploads (85Mbps typical evening speeds). Interestingly (and the reason why we've chosen it) is that it's cheaper than the Superfast plan. This second option drops the uploads to a maximum of 25Mbps but it's eligible for the Speed Boost feature, which lets you temporarily increase your speeds to the NBN 1000 tier, for free, five times a month. You can view both plans and weigh up your options via the same link.\n\u2022 AU$85 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,104 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,188 ongoing yearly cost\n\u2022 View more of the best NBN 250 plans\nBest NBN 500 plan\nThe NBN 500 tier is brand new and has been slated to effectively replace NBN 100 plans with a free 5x speed boost from September (only for customers via a FTTP or HFC connection).\nHowever, as of July 1, a couple of providers have flicked the switch early and dropped their own NBN 500 plans, with incredibly competitive pricing to boot.\nExetel One | 500Mbps | AU$80p/m\nExetel's NBN 500 plan is, on paper at least, exceptional value. For just AU$80p/m (AU$13p/m cheaper than Telstra's 25Mbps plan) you can revel in truly glorious speeds of up to 500Mbps download and 50Mbps uploads. It's the only plan the telco now offers, so if you've got the right connection type, it's undoubtedly one of the best fast NBN plans to get right now. There are other perks too, such as the ability to boost the speed to the next tier up and even save AU$1 a day to downgrade the speed to 12Mbps, ideal if you're away from home for a long time.\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$960 yearly cost\nSpintel Home Turbo | 500Mbps | AU$84p/m\nSpintel has also surprised us with a 500Mbps NBN plan of its own, advertising the same typical evening speeds as Exetel (500/42Mbps) and a similarly low cost of just AU$84p/m. There's no immediate sign of any extra perks, however, so ultimately the Exetel One plan is our top pick, but if you've been a Spintel customer previously, you may wish to stay loyal.\n\u2022 AU$84 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,008 yearly cost\nBest NBN 1000 plan\nThe fastest you can get, but only available in select locations\n\u2022 The once sparse NBN 1000 tier is growing in availability, with an average typical evening speed of 795Mbps reported by the telcos.\nFlip | 900Mbps | AU$94p/m (first 4 months, then AU$104.90p/m)\nFlip continues to be our pick for the best fast NBN 1000 plan overall, due to it currently advertising the fastest typical evening speeds of any provider we monitor at 900Mbps. While it's not the cheapest, it's by no means the most expensive, and in reality, it presents as great value. For a cheap NBN 1000 plan, we recommend Buddy.\n\u2022 AU$94 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,215.20 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,258.80 ongoing yearly cost\n\u2022 See more: Best NBN 1000 plans\nFast NBN plans: major telcos\nWhen it comes to the big three internet providers, these are the best fast plans available:\nOptus' best high-speed NBN plans\nOptus has recently removed the NBN 250 tier from its line up, and has also done away with introductory discounts. Instead, in order to make a saving on an NBN plan, you can add a second Optus service, such as a SIM plan, and save AU$15 a month for a full year.\nTPG's best high-speed NBN plans\n- NBN 100 (100Mbps): AU$64.99p/m (first 6 months, then AU$94.99p/m)\n- NBN 250 (250Mbps): AU$79.99p/m (first 6 months, then AU$99.99p/m)\n- NBN 1000 (800Mbps): AU$89.99p/m (first 6 months, then AU$109.99p/m)\nTelstra's best high-speed NBN plans\n- Telstra vs Optus NBN: who has better broadband?\nFast NBN FAQ\nWhat are NBN 1000 real world speeds?\nThe Australian Competition & Consumer Commission conducts quarterly reports focusing on the broadband performance in Australia. Its latest report, published in June 2025, found the average download speed ranged across the day from 870 Mbps to 885Mbps.\nThese are undeniably fast, but still a little way off the theoretical top speed available on these plans of 1,000Mbps. Outside of the peak busy period, we\u2019ve seen real-world speed test results that are much higher at 900Mbps, though still not reaching the maximum amount.\nWhat are NBN 250 real world speeds?\nThe second-fastest tier is NBN 250, which the NBN Co refers to as 'Superfast'. The amount of providers which offer an NBN 250 plan has grown significantly and it\u2019s now almost on par with the number which offer NBN 100 plans. Among the telcos we monitor, the average download speed on these plans is 235Mbps during the evening hours. Actual speed does vary among the internet providers with NBN 250 plans, so be sure to read the fine print.\nWhat are NBN 100 real world speeds?\nThe NBN 100 tier is the most affordable option from the fastest NBN category, and you can expect a typical evening speed of 98Mbps on average. While the tiers mentioned above are leaps and bounds ahead in terms of speed, they are also limited in their availability \u2013 only FTTP and HFC connections can sign up to NBN 1000 and NBN 250 in most cases.\nNBN 100 is referred to as 'Fast' by the NBN Co \u2013 it\u2019s available for most connection types, and is often the fastest option available for the millions of Australians using fibre-to-the-node (FTTN) technology.\nYou can read more about each connection type in our guide to the best NBN plans.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

      "text": "Tangerine just delivered an NBN 500 sucker punch \u2013 its new early-bird plan costs just AU$69p/m\nA third ISP has entered the 500Mbps fray, and it\u2019s offering the juiciest value to date\nWe'll forgive you if you\u2019ve not yet heard that there are major NBN speed upgrades just around the corner \u2013 in fact, we're only a month away from NBN Co officially flicking the switch on what are set to be the biggest speed increases to consumer plans we've ever seen. The best of these upgrades, in my opinion, is the official arrival of NBN 500 plans that will usher in a 5x speed boost to the best NBN 100 plans.\nHowever, despite the upgrades not having officially launched, you can already sign up for an NBN 500 plan early through a couple of our NBN favourite providers. If you\u2019re looking for the very cheapest NBN 500 plan (at least for the first year), Tangerine Telecom has landed with the standout option.\nComing in at under AU$70 a month for the first six months, followed by a highly competitive ongoing rate, Tangerine is a great provider if you\u2019re seeking faster speeds.\nTangerine | Speedy Max NBN plan (500/50) | AU$68.90p/m (first 6 months, then AU$88.90p/m)\nThe Tangerine Speedy Max plan costs less than many NBN 25 plans in the first six months, and even the ongoing rate undercuts the price of Telstra\u2019s 25Mbps plan. This fact alone represents sensational value. Just note that only those with an FTTP or HFC connection at home can sign up.\nNow there are a couple of things to be aware of before you sign up for this plan. The first is that Tangerine is giving early sign-ups a free speed boost to 700Mbps typical evening download speeds until the new NBN 500 tier officially rolls out. Because 500Mbps plans don't officially exist, Tangerine is temporarily putting new sign ups on its NBN 1000 tier until September 14th, 2025 \u2013 that's the date NBN Co has set for its upgrades to become available. Following this, the Speedy Max plan will become a normal NBN 500 plan (with theoretical download speeds of 500Mbps and uploads of 50Mbps) and anyone who has signed up early will be migrated over.\nAll that means is that until that date, you can effectively access Tangerine's gigabit NBN tier and its associated speeds at a much more affordable rate.\nAs mentioned above however, note that you will need to have either a fibre to the premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) connection at your premises to sign up for this plan. If you don\u2019t have one of these technologies, you can check if you\u2019re eligible for NBN Co's free fibre upgrade program.\nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure you have a modem-router that can support the faster speeds. Tangerine will sell you an Amazon Eero 6+ dual-band router for a very competitive AU$169.90 for a single unit. You can also opt for a two- or three-pack to create a mesh Wi-Fi network around your home.\nI should also point out that Tangerine\u2019s ongoing NBN 500 rate isn\u2019t quite as competitive as what you\u2019ll find from either Spintel or Exetel. The latter, especially, has a truly outstanding 500Mbps plan at just AU$80 a month; complete with some extra perks that make it very attractive.\nBut, if spending the least amount of money possible (initially at least) is most important to you, then Tangerine\u2019s Speedy Max plan is the current best pick.\nAlternatively, you can check out the most popular NBN plans with at least 500Mbps download speeds in the price comparison below.\nYou might also like\n- View my latest picks for the best NBN plans overall\n- Want to go faster?

      "text": "Free NBN fibre upgrade: everything you need to know to get faster, reliable internet\nMillions of Australians are now eligible for a free FTTP upgrade\nNBN Co\u2019s free fibre upgrade program continues to roll out, bringing faster, more reliable fibre optic cabling to more and more homes in Australia. As of November 2024, NBN Co says 80% of its fixed-line network now has access to the very fastest internet speeds, and promises 90% of its network can get connected by December 2025.\nWhat exactly is the free fibre upgrade program we hear you ask? Essentially it means customers who connect to the NBN fixed-line network via the inferior fibre-to-the-node (FTTN) and fibre-to-the-curb (FTTC) tech, can have the equipment at their property upgraded to FTTP. Once installed, customers can revel in the fastest NBN plans, which recently have been made much sweeter with reduced plan pricing.\nNBN Co hasn't provided updated figures in terms of how many homes with each connection type are now eligible for the upgrade, but it has provided the number of homes by state (New South Wales and Victoria currently lead the charge, with Queensland sitting in third).\nIn order to trigger the upgrade, those eligible are required to sign up to an NBN plan with download speeds of 100Mbps or higher \u2013 those are NBN 100 plans, NBN 250 plans and NBN 1000 plans. While these plans are usually more expensive than slower 25Mbps and 50Mbps plans, it's no longer always the case and there are some great internet deals to be found.\nCan I get a free NBN fibre upgrade?\nThe easiest way to find out if you're eligible for the free upgrade is to check your address on NBN Co\u2019s website.\nDo note that only customers that connected via FTTN/C are eligible. This means those who connect via fibre to the basement/building (FTTB) \u2013 usually those in apartment buildings \u2013 aren't eligible. However, faster internet may be available for people living in apartments via a number of NBN alternatives.\nIf you live in an eligible suburb, you can register for updates from NBN Co directly in order to stay in the loop \u2013 just note you\u2019ll need to enter your address in the eligibility checker first.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAlternatively, you can wait for your telco to get in touch regarding an upgrade since it\u2019ll be in their interest to let you know as soon as your home is eligible for an upgrade as this will encourage you to sign up for a faster NBN plan.\nHow much does it cost to upgrade my NBN?\nThe actual upgrading of the equipment at your home is free. The only cost you will incur if you use the free upgrade program is the cost of a new plan. At launch, NBN Co stipulated that customers with FTTC connections had to upgrade to at least an NBN 250 plan in order to enact the upgrade, while FTTN customers could make do with an NBN 100 plan as a minimum.\nThat has all changed now, however, with customers with either connection now able to get the free upgrade by simply signing up for a new NBN 100 plan. The average monthly cost of an NBN 100 plan, based on the telcos we monitor, is currently just over AU$92. Do note that this figure has been slowly increasing in the last couple of years, and you may now find faster plans can cost less.\nWhat suburbs can get FTTP for free?\nThe full list of suburbs in Australia that are eligible for NBN Co's free fibre upgrade program is too long to list here, so we recommend you check your address on the NBN Co website to see if yours is included. If it's not, there's a good chance it will become eligible by December 2025, given the commitment to ensuring 10 million homes (90% of the fixed-line NBN network) will have FTTP access.\nHow do I upgrade my NBN under the free fibre program?\nIt's relatively simple to upgrade your home NBN connection to FTTP. The majority, if not all, internet service providers (ISPs) support the program and should advertise it on their website.\nIf you want to take advantage of the upgrade, simply head to the website of your ISP of choice (we've recommended some of our favourites a little further down) and enter your address.\nIf your home is eligible, the ISP should indicate as much. You will then need to follow the steps to sign up for a new NBN plan with at least 100Mbps download speed.\nOnce ordered, your ISP will arrange for NBN technicians to come to your premises to install the necessary equipment. Once installed, your new plan will activate.\nWhat are the benefits of an NBN upgrade?\nA full fibre upgrade will open households and businesses to a wider range of NBN plans, including the ultrafast NBN 1000 tier (or 'gigabit internet') as well as NBN 250, both of which are only available on certain connection types \u2013 FTTP and hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) specifically. Not only is it faster, a full fibre connection is also more reliable.\nThe other benefit is due to arrive in September 2025, when NBN Co rolls out a new Hyperfast speed tier, with theoretical speeds of up to 2Gbps. This new speed tier will also require an FTTP connection. However, 100Mbps, 250Mbps and 1,000Mbps plans will also receive a speed boost at the same time, up to fives times faster in the case of 100Mbps plans.\nWhat are the best plans to upgrade to?\nYou can view our regularly updated guide to the fastest NBN plans, which has recommendations for plans starting at 100Mbps and increasing to the theoretical maximum 1,000Mbps speed. But we've also listed a few below that get our seal of approval.\nSpintel | 100Mbps | AU$65p/m (first 6 months, then AU$81.95p/m)\nSpintel is often our favourite pick when recommending an NBN 100 plan for most people. It recently received a price cut, making it even greater value and in doing so, it's become the outright cheapest over the first 12 months of service and by far the cheapest overall to advertise maximum download speeds.\n\u2022 AU$65 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$881.70 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$983.40 ongoing cost\nSuperloop | 250Mbps | AU$85p/m (first 6 months, then AU$99p/m)\nIf it's an NBN 250 plan you're after, the Superloop has been a firm favourite of ours for some time. Not only does this plan advertise maximum typical evening speeds, but it also comes with five free Speed Boost days each month, allowing customers to bump up the speed of their service to the NBN 1000 tier \u2013 right now, Superloop advertises 860Mbps typical evening speeds at this tier. Superloop's regular ongoing cost of AU$99p/m is also below the current average of just over AU$105.\n\u2022 AU$85 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,104 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,188 ongoing yearly cost\nBuddy Telco | 875Mbps | AU$99p/m\nFor those looking to sign up for the fastest speed tier currently available, we have to recommend Buddy Telco. For a long time, Buddy was the outright cheapest provider on this tier, but has now been beaten by Spintel. However, Buddy's plan still advertises some of the fastest download speeds at 875Mbps (Spintel only manages 750Mbps). It's for this reason Buddy still gets our pick, as it promises to make your upgrade to FTTP technology totally worth it.\n\u2022 AU$99 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,188 yearly cost\nNBN alternatives\nIf you\u2019re on an FTTN or FTTC connection and are holding out to see if you\u2019re eligible for an upgrade, or you\u2019ve found out you\u2019re ineligible, there are some NBN alternatives you should consider.\nBoth FTTN and FTTC connections are capable of supporting NBN 100 plans, with typical evening speeds ranging from 85-100Mbps from most providers (there are some exceptions). We\u2019d argue this is more than enough bandwidth for most power users and large households.\nHowever, if your current technology means that you\u2019re experiencing a poor connection even on a higher speed tier, 5G home internet plans are becoming increasingly common, and as the rollout continues, are available in more areas.\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

      "text": "NBN Co delivers free 600,000 fibre upgrades, with plenty more still to come \u2013 here's how to get yourself in the next batch\nAnd the best plans to get to make the upgrade worthwhile\n- NBN Co has announced its half-year results\n- 594,000 homes have accepted the free fibre upgrade\n- Final upgrades expected by 2030\nNBN Co has revealed its half-year results up to December 31, 2024, including data regarding the number of households that have so far taken up its offer of a free fibre upgrade.\nNBN Co\u2019s fibre upgrade program has only been in effect for two and a half years, and in that time some 594,000 homes have upgraded their home\u2019s technology to full-fat fibre to the premises (FTTP) \u2013 217,000 of which were completed in the second half of 2024 \u2013 that\u2019s currently capable of supporting the fastest NBN 1000 plans and the incoming 2Gbps tier expected in September.\nA vast majority of Australian homes connected to the fixed-line NBN network are already eligible to upgrade, or should be eligible by December 2025. NBN Co has said it is \u201con track to complete upgrades to the local fibre network that will enable 3.5 million homes and businesses served by Fibre to the Node (FTTN) and 1.5 million premises served by Fibre to the Curb (FTTC) to upgrade to FTTP\u201d.\nPlus, earlier this year, NBN Co announced it would be upgrading the last-remaining copper-based, FTTN-connected homes by 2030 thanks to a joint investment by NBN Co and the Australian Government. It\u2019s estimated that some 622,000 homes will benefit from this investment, with more than half located in regional Australia.\nAlongside these figures for its fixed-line network, NBN Co also revealed in its latest press releases that its upgraded fixed wireless network is now available to \u201capproximately 90 per cent of expanded footprint\u201d. Additionally, the network provider is exploring new satellite internet options to replace the aging Sky Muster network.\nAll aboard the upgrade train\nGiven the attractive combination of many more upgrade-eligible homes and the increasingly great value of the fastest NBN plans, there really has never been a better time to upgrade. Not only does a high-speed internet plan (those delivering 100Mbps download speeds or faster) naturally mean file downloads and streams can be completed more quickly, but full-fibre infrastructure is also more reliable and less susceptible to outages.\nYou can easily find out if your home is eligible for the free FTTP upgrade on the NBN website. If you are, all you need to do is find one of the best NBN providers and sign up for an NBN 100, NBN 250 or NBN 1000 plan. As mentioned earlier, 2Gbps \u2018Hyperfast\u2019 plans are expected in September this year. Not only will this introduce a higher speed tier among the best NBN plans, but it will also result in a speed increase of the current options. An NBN 100 plan, for example, will see its theoretical maximum speed increased to 500Mbps.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWe\u2019ve picked out three of our favourite plans below \u2013 one for each tier \u2013 to help get you started. You can also view a wider selection of plans in the price comparison widget further down this page.\nSpintel | 100Mbps | AU$65p/m (first 6 months, then AU$81.95p/m)\nSpintel is a fantastic option if you're just looking for an NBN 100 plan, with theoretical top speeds of 100Mbps. This speed is plenty fast enough for family homes who want to stream music and video content, or even who like to game. Spintel's plan is also one of the cheapest currently, with its ongoing yearly cost being the only one of the providers we monitor to come in under AU$1,000.\n\u2022 AU$65 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$881.70 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$983.40 ongoing cost\nSuperloop | 250Mbps | AU$85p/m (first 6 months, then AU$99p/m)\nIt's not quite the cheapest provider, but Superloop is our resolute favourite for anyone wanting an NBN 250 plan. The telco claims maximum plan speeds and it offers a Speed Boost days feature which lets you boost your download speed to the NBN 1000 tier for free, five times a month. Superloop's plan is also competitively priced, especially during each ongoing year.\n\u2022 AU$85 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,104 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,188 ongoing yearly cost\nBuddy Telco | 875Mbps | AU$99p/m\nIf you get the free fibre upgrade, why not take full advantage and get yourself an NBN 1000 plan? You'd be forgiven for thinking these 'Ultrafast' plans are expensive, but Buddy Telco complete quashes that idea. For a flat-fee of just AU$99 per month, you could achieve speeds will in excess of 800Mbps \u2013 Buddy currently advertises the second-fastest typical evening speeds in Australia. Best of all, this plan is cheaper than some much slower NBN 50 plans, only furthering its perceived value.\n\u2022 AU$99 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,188 each year\nYou might also like\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.
