  "content": "Rely on this gel lint roller so you don't show up to that business meeting with a black blazer covered in pet fur. Bonus points: this one is portable, so you can carry it in your purse. Promising review: \"I travel frequently for work and keep this in my suitcase. Works great; I no longer carry a lint roller.\" \u2014Liza Przekop Get it from Amazon for $6.98 (available in four colors).\n\nQuickly touch up your brows with a Schick dermaplaning razor , a tool sent from heaven for people who are done with the pains of plucking and the expense of waxing. This quickly rids you of stray brow hairs and unwanted peach fuzz (while ridding your complexion of dead skin to reveal a smoother and brighter complexion), so that you can begin the day with perfectly-groomed facial caterpillars that only took three seconds to tame.\n\nNip brassiness in the bud with a cult-favorite Fanola purple shampoo . The violet pigment in this formula works to wash away unwanted yellow in your 'do, meaning you can extend the time between salon visits \u2014 and the benefits of that are two-fold. You'll save a ton of money on appointments, plus you won't have to subject your hair to additional bleaches and dye that will (I'm sorry to tell you this) cause additional damage.\n\n\n\n Pair a plain tank with lightweight linen pants that won't have you stewing in your own sweat. These are available in neutral hues, so they're easy to pair with any top in your wardrobe. Promising review: \"Love the fabric, it\u2019s very lightweight. Exactly what I was looking for. Fits great, a little bit long on me, but I am very short. Great for Florida summers.\" \u2014Veronica G. Get it from Amazon for $18.90 (available in women's sizes XS\u20136X and 11 colors).\n\nTurn any bra into a no-show racerback with the help of these handy dandy adjustable clip holders . Long gone will be the days of \u2014> put on shirt \u2014> bra shows \u2014> take off shirt to change bra \u2014> put shirt back on again. Not to be dramatic, but these clips will change your life when you're in a rush (which is always), not to mention these will make any ensemble look 10x more crisp without straps peeking through.",
