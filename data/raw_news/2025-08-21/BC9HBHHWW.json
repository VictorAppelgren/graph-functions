  "description": "Local police in DeKalb County, just outside Atlanta, arrested Mario Guevara while he was covering a protest June 14, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement took custody of him a few days later.",
  "content": "Lawyers for a Spanish-language journalist who has been held in federal immigration detention since June argue in a court filing that the government is retaliating against him for his news coverage and is holding him in violation of his constitutional rights.\n\nLocal police in DeKalb County, just outside Atlanta, arrested Mario Guevara while he was covering a protest June 14, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement took custody of him a few days later. He is being held in an immigration detention center in Folkston, southeast Georgia, a five-hour drive from his family in suburban Atlanta.\n\nA petition filed in federal court late Wednesday says the government is violating Guevara\u2019s constitutional rights to free speech and due process. It argues that he is being punished for filming police, which is legal, and that he is being subjected to unlawful prior restraint because he\u2019s unable to report while in custody.\n\nThe filing asks the court to order his release \u201cso that he may rejoin his family and community and pursue his constitutionally protected journalistic activities.\u201d\n\nThe filing names Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi and top ICE officials.\n\n\u201cAccusations that Mario Guevara was arrested by ICE because he is a journalist are completely FALSE,\u201d Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement. The Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nGuevara, 47, fled his native El Salvador two decades ago because he had suffered violence and harassment there for his work as a journalist. He has continued to work as a journalist since arriving in the Atlanta area. He attracted a large following while working for years for Mundo Hispanico, a Spanish-language newspaper, before starting a digital news outlet called MG News a year ago.\n\nHe frequently arrives on the scene where ICE or other law enforcement agencies are active, often acting on tips from community members. He regularly livestreams what he\u2019s seeing on social media.\n\nMcLaughlin, the Homeland Security spokesperson, said Guevara was placed in deportation proceedings because he is in the country illegally.\n\nHis lawyers have said he is authorized to work and remain in the U.S. A previous immigration case against him was administratively closed more than a decade ago. He has a pending visa petition and is eligible for a green card, the court filing says.\n\nHe was livestreaming video on social media from a \u201cNo Kings\u201d rally protesting President Trump\u2019s administration when Doraville police arrested him.\n\nVideo from his arrest shows Guevara wearing a bright red shirt under a protective vest with \u201cPRESS\u201d printed across his chest. He could be heard telling a police officer, \u201cI\u2019m a member of the media, officer.\u201d He was standing on a sidewalk with other journalists, with no sign of big crowds or confrontations around him, moments before he was taken away.\n\nPolice charged Guevara with unlawful assembly, obstruction of police and being a pedestrian on or along the roadway. His lawyers worked to get him released and he was granted bond in DeKalb County, but ICE had put a hold on him and he was held until they came to pick him up.\n\nDeKalb County Solicitor-General Donna Coleman-Stribling on June 25 dismissed the charges, saying video showed Guevara was \u201cgenerally in compliance and does not demonstrate the intent to disregard law enforcement directives.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office in neighboring Gwinnett County announced June 20, once Guevara was already in ICE custody, that it had secured warrants against him on charges of distracted driving, failure to obey a traffic control device and reckless driving. Gwinnett County Solicitor-General Lisamarie Bristol announced July 10 that she would not pursue those charges.\n\nAn immigration judge last month set a $7,500 bond for Guevara, but that order has been put on hold while the government appeals it.\n\nHis arrest and continued detention have been decried by journalism and press freedom groups, as well as by some public officials in Georgia. His adult children have been vocal in calling for his release.\n\n\u201cMr. Guevara is a pillar of the Hispanic community in the Atlanta area, and his relationships with the Hispanic community, law enforcement, and civic and religious organizations allow him to serve as a bridge between various stakeholders in his community,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s court filing says.\n\nThe government\u2019s arguments during his bond hearing in immigration court and subsequent filings in that case have relied \u201calmost exclusively on Mr. Guevara\u2019s reporting as justification for his continued detention,\u201d the filing says.\n\nThe government\u2019s filings detailed several occasions when Guevara had recorded or livestreamed law enforcement activities and posted videos that included undercover agents and their vehicles online, arguing that he\u2019s a danger to the community.\n\nHis lawyers counter that livestreaming, recording and publishing videos of law enforcement activity in public \u2014 even if those videos identify officers and their vehicles \u2014 is protected by the 1st Amendment. They also note that all charges against Guevara had been dismissed and he hasn\u2019t been convicted of any crimes during his two decades in the U.S.\n\nThe petition was filed in Brunswick by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Georgia, the University of Georgia law school\u2019s First Amendment Clinic and Guevara\u2019s individual attorneys.\n\nBrumback writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "South Sudan ponders the road ahead after ethnic killings\nProsecuting the leaders responsible would destabilize the fledgling country. Granting the killers amnesty, however, risks future violence, rights groups warn.\n- Share via\nConcealed in the Nile River reeds, mothers and their children crouched underwater, holding their breath as long as possible, as South Sudanese militias on the bank argued whether to hunt down and kill dozens of people hiding there.\nOne elderly man was spotted by a fighter onshore and ordered out, said Mabior Nyuon Bior, a doctor who was among the terrified civilians.\nAs the man hobbled out of the Nile, the militiaman shot him.\n\"Why did you do that?\" Bior heard another fighter say.\n\"Because I can,\" came the response.\nTwo hours later, after the fighters had left, it was finally safe for Bior and other survivors to come out of the water. But by that time, he said, eight children had drowned in their mothers' arms.\nWhen the fighters with the Lou Nuer tribe attacked his city of Bor in December, \"friends were killing friends, just because it was another tribe,\" said Bior, a member of the Dinka tribe.\nAt first, he stayed at his post in Bor's hospital, operating on a badly wounded soldier and a woman facing complications in childbirth. But he had to flee into the bush when Lou Nuer fighters came, firing at him with machine guns as he ran. Some of the patients ran too, but he had to leave the woman and the soldier.\n\"I was fearing to die. The noise they made with their guns, boom-boom.\"\nIn the next five days, he repeatedly fled from Lou Nuer militias hunting down Dinkas in the bush. He saw four people shot down beside him as he ran. He said he saw the bodies of 10 civilians on a riverbank.\nWhen the town was retaken by government forces, he walked back into Bor, where he found the hospital mortuary crammed with the dead. The patients he had risked his life to save had died, including the woman and her baby, left without milk.\n\"I was feeling bad,\" Bior said. \"If not for this fighting, this woman would still be alive.\"\nIn the days after ethnic killings exploded in South Sudan in December, an estimated 10,000 people died in the fighting.\nThe atrocities were triggered by a political struggle in the governing Sudan People's Liberation Movement between President Salva Kiir and his rival and former deputy, Riek Machar, with both sides responsible for massacres, according to diplomats, witnesses and human rights organizations.\nNow the fledgling country must grapple with how to move beyond the violence. Some fear that prosecuting those responsible, especially political leaders, will destabilize this volatile, fragile country, which won independence less than three years ago, and make it impossible to reach a peace deal. But human rights groups argue that South Sudan can't afford to bury the truth and grant amnesty to the killers without risking future ethnic violence.\nPast peace deals in South Sudan have proved superficial and fragile, including one signed in May 2012 in Bor, the capital of Jonglei state. In some of those deals, ethnic militias were absorbed into the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the military wing of the ruling party, in effect papering over ethnic fissures.\nMoreover, fighting continues despite a cease-fire agreement in January, and an estimated 850,000 people have fled their homes.\nThose hiding in the river with Bior were Dinkas. In the capital, Juba, it was the Lou Nuers who fell under attack in December by members of South Sudan's security forces.\nIn Juba, a small city has sprung up at the United Nations peacekeeping base, with narrow alleys, makeshift shops, phone-charging businesses and women cooking over charcoal fires. It looks like any camp for displaced persons except for the neatly packed suitcases sitting outside some of the makeshift tents, and the suit carriers hanging inside, some belonging to members of parliament who fled to the camp.\nWilliam Mabany, a policeman who is a Lou Nuer, said he ran to the camp to avoid being killed by fellow officers in December. He shows a cellphone photograph of a mass grave full of twisted corpses of people who he says belonged to his tribe.\nIn one incident, government forces deliberately fired shots into a room full of Lou Nuer men being detained in a police building, killing more than 200 of them, according to a survivor, Mayang Yian.\nVictims were identified by initiation scars on their faces or were questioned in the Dinka language and detained or killed if they couldn't answer, survivors say.\nBol Ngot, a university student in Juba, was hiding in a house with seven other Lou Nuer men when government soldiers ordered them into the street. He said he was beaten with a rifle butt and two of the others were killed, including his cousin.\n\"I saw soldiers shooting people, and when I saw it I ran away,\" he said. \"My head was covered in blood. I thought they were going to kill me.\"\nPeople want the truth about the killings, but not everyone wants reconciliation.\n\"No, no, no,\" said Vito Mario, 35, an oil technician from the Shilluk tribe. He fled last month to a camp for the displaced in Malakal after Lou Nuer fighters killed the family next door.\n\"They destroyed our lives. We don't want these people to live with us in Upper Nile state.... To live together \u2014 ,\" Mario trailed off, shaking his head doubtfully.\nIt's incredible how fast it spun out of control.\u201d\u2014 Toby Lanzer\n\"They were saying they don't want us in this area. This is their land,\" said Okeng Robert, who lives in the same camp, describing a January attack by Lou Nuer militias.\nHorrendous violence has touched so many families that it is difficult to know how the country can begin to heal the wounds.\nIn his January visit to a church in Bor where at least 14 Dinkas had been killed, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby called for reconciliation and warned against impunity. Accompanying him was the archbishop of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan, Daniel Deng Bul, who had been appointed by Kiir in May to head a national committee on reconciliation. Deng earlier led a peace process in Jonglei state, where increasingly violent tit-for-tat massacres along tribal lines, usually over cattle theft, have been going on for years.\nA diplomat in Juba, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to speak, said that after the recent fighting, Deng, a Dinka, may not be acceptable to all South Sudanese to lead the reconciliation process.\nCritics say that although the U.N., donors and international humanitarian agencies provide about a billion dollars a year for aid, they overlook the ethnic rifts, poor governance and bitter infighting in the Sudan People's Liberation Movement.\n\"On so many fronts, things were ticking along in a positive way at the end of last year,\" U.N. humanitarian coordinator Toby Lanzer said. \"It's incredible how fast it spun out of control.\n\"I have asked myself, should we have been more focused on reconciliation?\"\nBior, the doctor, said his country needs doctors. Before the recent fighting, he said, people would often call out to him in the street: \"Thank you for what you do.\" So despite everything, he will return to Bor's hospital, because people need him.\nWhen he remembers the patients who died and the morgue piled with bodies, \"I blame politicians, all of them.\"\nHe's afraid that another superficial peace deal may leave the country vulnerable to violence. In Jonglei, where ethnic tension has long festered and different tribes will have to learn to live side by side, he worries that violence could explode again.\n\"The government should work hard on reconciliation. They have to go to the villages and talk to the people. If you want your people to have reconciliation, go there to the remote cattle camps and tell them this is how we should live.\"\nFollow Robyn Dixon (@latimesdixon) on Twitter"

      "text": "Appeals court throws out massive civil fraud penalty against President Trump\n- Share via\nNEW YORK \u2014 An appeals court has thrown out the massive civil fraud penalty against President Trump, ruling Thursday in New York state\u2019s lawsuit accusing him of exaggerating his wealth.\nThe decision came seven months after the Republican returned to the White House. A panel of five judges in New York\u2019s mid-level Appellate Division said the verdict, which stood to cost Trump more than $515 million and rock his real estate empire, was \u201cexcessive.\u201d\nAfter finding that Trump engaged in fraud by flagrantly padding financial statements that went to lenders and insurers, Judge Arthur Engoron ordered him last year to pay $355 million in penalties. With interest, the sum has topped $515 million.\nThe total \u2014 combined with penalties levied on some other Trump Organization executives, including Trump\u2019s sons Eric and Donald Jr. \u2014 now exceeds $527 million, with interest.\n\u201cWhile the injunctive relief ordered by the court is well crafted to curb defendants\u2019 business culture, the court\u2019s disgorgement order, which directs that defendants pay nearly half a billion dollars to the State of New York, is an excessive fine that violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution,\u201d Judges Dianne T. Renwick and Peter H. Moulton wrote in one of several opinions shaping the appeals court\u2019s ruling.\nEngoron also imposed other punishments, such as banning Trump and his two eldest sons from serving in corporate leadership for a few years. Those provisions have been on pause during Trump\u2019s appeal, and he was able to hold off collection of the money by posting a $175-million bond.\nThe court, which was split on the merits of the lawsuit and the lower court\u2019s fraud finding, dismissed the penalty Engoron imposed in its entirety while also leaving a pathway for further appeals to the state\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals.\nThe appeals court, the Appellate Division of the state\u2019s trial court, took an unusually long time to rule, weighing Trump\u2019s appeal for nearly 11 months after oral arguments last fall. Normally, appeals are decided in a matter of weeks or a few months.\nNew York Atty. Gen. Letitia James, who brought the suit on the state\u2019s behalf, has said the businessman-turned-politician engaged in \u201clying, cheating, and staggering fraud.\u201d Her office had no immediate comment after Thursday\u2019s decision.\nTrump and his co-defendants denied wrongdoing. In a six-minute summation of sorts after a monthslong trial, Trump proclaimed in January 2024 that he was \u201can innocent man\u201d and the case was a \u201cfraud on me.\u201d He has repeatedly maintained that the case and verdict were political moves by James and Engoron, who are both Democrats.\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department has subpoenaed James for records related to the lawsuit, among other documents, as part of an investigation into whether she violated the president\u2019s civil rights. James\u2019 personal attorney, Abbe D. Lowell, has said that investigating the fraud case is \u201cthe most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president\u2019s political retribution campaign.\u201d\nTrump and his lawyers said his financial statements weren\u2019t deceptive, since they came with disclaimers noting they weren\u2019t audited. The defense also noted that bankers and insurers independently evaluated the numbers, and the loans were repaid.\nDespite such discrepancies as tripling the size of his Trump Tower penthouse, he said the financial statements were, if anything, lowball estimates of his fortune.\nDuring an appellate court hearing in September, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that many of the case\u2019s allegations were too old, an assertion they made unsuccessfully before trial. The defense also contends that James misused a consumer-protection law to sue Trump and improperly policed private business transactions that were satisfactory to those involved.\nState attorneys said the law in question applies to fraudulent or illegal business conduct, whether it targets everyday consumers or big corporations. Though Trump insists no one was harmed by the financial statements, the state contends that the numbers led lenders to make riskier loans than they knew, and that honest borrowers lose out when others game their net-worth numbers.\nThe state has argued that the verdict rests on ample evidence and that the scale of the penalty comports with Trump\u2019s gains, including his profits on properties financed with the loans and the interest he saved by getting favorable terms offered to wealthy borrowers.\nThe civil fraud case was just one of several legal obstacles for Trump as he campaigned, won and segued to a second term as president.\nOn Jan. 10, he was sentenced in his criminal hush money case to what\u2019s known as an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction on the books but sparing him jail, probation, a fine or other punishment. He is appealing the conviction.\nAnd in December, a federal appeals court upheld a jury\u2019s finding that Trump sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and later defamed her, affirming a $5-million judgment against him. The appeals court declined in June to reconsider; he still can try to get the Supreme Court to hear his appeal.\nHe\u2019s also appealing a subsequent verdict that requires him to pay Carroll $83.3 million for additional defamation claims.\nPeltz and Sisak write for the Associated Press."

      "text": "- Share via\nCULIACAN, Mexico \u2014 Emilia is a 2-year-old spider monkey who wears jeans, crop tops and Armani perfume.\nA popular TikTok account documents her busy life: trips to the spa, gym and church, as well as elaborate birthday parties for other pet monkeys, where she might cavort with friends in an inflatable bounce house and smash her face into a carrot cake.\nIt is illegal in Mexico to own spider monkeys, which are critically endangered and trafficked from jungles in the country\u2019s south. That hasn\u2019t stopped people in the northern city of Culiacan, home to one of the world\u2019s most powerful drug cartels and known for ostentatious displays of wealth.\n\u201cSo many people here have them,\u201d said Zulma Ayala, a 34-year-old florist who was gifted Emilia two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s fashionable. It says: \u2018I have the money to have a monkey.\u2019\u201d\nPrimates aren\u2019t the only exotic animals popular here. At private homes and ranches in Culiacan and across the rest of rugged Sinaloa state, it is not uncommon for people to keep lions, tigers and, yes, even bears.\nThe practice began decades ago as local narcos sought to emulate Colombian drug lords like Pablo Escobar, who famously stocked private zoos with giraffes, elephants and hippos. Now, wealthy people of all stripes in Mexico own exotic animals.\nThey walk tigers on leashes down city streets and parade them in the backs of luxury cars. Socialites have formed private \u201cmonkey clubs,\u201d gathering for extravagant Christmas posadas and pool parties. The internet fuels the phenomenon, with influencers showing off their exotic pets and social media making it easier than ever to acquire the animals. A quick search of Facebook turns up local vendors selling lion cubs, lemurs and rare white tigers.\nOne of the few veterinarians in northern Mexico trained to treat exotic animals is Roy Quintero, whose patients include Emilia the spider monkey. His phone rings often with calls from anxious pet owners.\nOnce he was asked to treat a monkey that had accidentally consumed fentanyl. (He managed to save it.) Another time he helped an owner track down a tiger that had escaped into a canyon.\nThen there was the time Quintero found himself high in the sky in a propeller airplane alongside a sedated 300-pound tiger, which he was helping to transport.\n\u201cI was terrified he was going to wake up,\u201d Quintero said.\nQuintero, who makes a practice of never asking his clients what they do for work, said he has been threatened with death several times, including once when he was unable to save a monkey that died after consuming a toxin.\nHis job is risky and \u2014 he\u2019s the first to admit \u2014 ethically murky.\nHe fell in love with animals as a poor kid in nearby Sonora state, where he began tending goats at age 9. Decades spent working in zoos deepened his knowledge of how to heal uncommon animals, as well as his conviction that most people simply aren\u2019t equipped to care for creatures meant to thrive in the wild.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to acquire one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to feed them right, give them enough space and give them the care they need.\u201d\nBut when his phone buzzes and an owner asks for help, Quintero almost always gives in. A father of four, he has mouths to feed. And he can\u2019t stand the thought of an animal in need.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I don\u2019t treat them, who will?\u201d\nOn a recent afternoon, Quintero threw a medical bag into the back of his Isuzu pickup and headed out of town.\nHe had spent the morning at his Culiacan clinic checking up on several patients, including a 4-year-old spider monkey named Elisa who had been hit by a car after escaping from her owner\u2019s home. Quintero had performed a complicated reconstructive surgery on the monkey\u2019s hand, and she was slowly healing.\nIn Mexico stronghold of Sinaloa cartel, armed men burn vehicles, storm airport to try to prevent capture of drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s son.\nDressed in khaki pants and work boots, Quintero kept a wide-brimmed safari hat on the seat next to him \u2014 part of his security strategy.\nThe uneasy peace that held while Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n led the Sinaloa Cartel shattered several years ago when he was sentenced to life in a U.S. prison. Since then, other leaders of the cartel have battled for supremacy while being hunted by the Mexican government. Quintero hopes that if he is stopped by the military or drug traffickers, donning the hat will broadcast his identity: a harmless veterinarian just trying to get to work.\nHe passed a small Catholic chapel set against the scrubby landscape and an elaborate altar to Santa Muerte, a figure revered among drug traffickers here. He rolled through an army checkpoint, waving to fatigue-clad soldiers, and by a road sign riddled with bullet holes.\nFinally, he arrived at the ranch, tucked off a main highway, down a dirt road.\nAs crime engulfs many Mexican states, immigrants who\u2019ve saved to retire there are reevaluating ties to home \u2014 and whether returning is worth the risk.\nMore than 30 big cats paced inside cages, some of which were the size of a studio apartment. A bald eagle flapped around an enclosure. A wolf-dog hybrid scampered about. Cacophony filled the humid air: the mad squawking of parrots, the grunts of emus, the occasional roar of a lion.\nAgust\u00edn F\u00e9lix, a 26-year-old in tight jeans, expensive sneakers and a trucker hat, greeted Quintero with a slap on the back.\nF\u00e9lix is the son of a businessman who owns a transportation company and a cemetery. His father used to collect classic cars but several years ago started acquiring uncommon animals.\nThough owning spider monkeys is prohibited in Mexico, buying and selling many other exotic species is legal as long as they are not taken from the wild. That includes lions, tigers and jaguars.\nOwners must obtain approval from a government agency and show evidence that the animal was born in captivity. Laws stipulate that the animal must be safely confined and treated with respect, although a shortage of inspectors results in lax enforcement.\nOnce his father began acquiring large felines, F\u00e9lix said, friends started asking how they could get their own.\n\u201cHere, people see something new, and then everyone wants it.\u201d\nAs they toured the ranch, Quintero sought to put the animals at ease by imitating their sounds, emitting a low whistle to the jaguars and blowing air through his lips at the tigers. F\u00e9lix handed his phone to a friend and posed alongside the animals for pictures for social media.\nAfter he and Quintero inspected a pair of former circus bears that had recently been donated to the ranch, F\u00e9lix showed the vet his newest prize: a Bengal tiger cub born there a few months earlier.\nThe cub had an unusually narrow face, which Quintero said was likely the result of inbreeding, a common occurrence given the lack of genetic diversity among big cats in captivity. The cub also looked malnourished.\n\u201cYou have to supplement his diet,\u201d Quintero said, recommending omega-3s and taurine, an amino acid critical for tigers that is also a main ingredient in energy drinks.\n\u201cWill Red Bull work?\u201d F\u00e9lix joked. His friend laughed heartily. Quintero struggled to crack a smile.\nBack on the road, Quintero said he was feeling down \u2014 and ready for an after-work drink.\n\u201cI\u2019m depressed all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an animal that is under threat of extinction, and it\u2019s somebody\u2019s toy.\u201d\nWealthy rulers throughout history, from Carlos III of Spain to Moctezuma, the ruler of the Aztec Empire, have kept menageries.\nToday\u2019s narcos are likely to be influenced more by the zoos of Colombian traffickers or films like \u201cScarface,\u201d the gangster flick whose protagonist, Tony Montana, famously kept a tiger as a pet.\nAt a sprawling animal sanctuary on the outskirts of Culiacan on a recent afternoon, a regal tiger blinked in the sun. The animal had survived a gun fight, said Ernesto Zazueta, director of the Ostok Sanctuary, and had battle scars on its face and shoulder.\n\u201cThey shot him two or three times,\u201d Zazueta said.\nMany of the hundreds of animals at this sprawling reserve were confiscated after police raids on the homes of traffickers. Others were abandoned because their owners couldn\u2019t care for them or feared that they would bring unwanted attention from authorities. Zazueta pointed to a puma huddled near the back of its cage. It had been dumped, left chained to a post in the center of a nearby town.\nMexico is rife with stories about exotic narco pets. There was the recent U.S. federal indictment that accused the sons of \u201cEl Chapo\u201d of feeding their enemies to tigers. (Their lawyers denied it.) Or the spider monkey found dead in a cartel shootout in Mexico state, dressed in a tiny bulletproof vest. A corrido singer quickly penned a ballad about the fallen primate.\nJust as other trappings of narcoculture have proliferated throughout Mexican society \u2014 from norte\u00f1o fashion to the new generation of drug ballads that top national charts \u2014 so too has the ownership of exotic animals.\nFour banners appeared simultaneously in different parts of Tijuana this week warning the singer to cancel his planned concert on Oct. 14.\n\u201cFor rich people, it gives them a sense of power,\u201d said Zazueta. \u201cThe more powerful the animal, the more powerful it makes them feel.\u201d\nHis sanctuary is working to import from Colombia several descendants of Escobar\u2019s famous \u201ccocaine hippos,\u201d which were abandoned into the wild after his death in 1993 and have reproduced rapidly, posing environmental challenges.\nWhile Sinaloa\u2019s wealthy men gravitate toward tigers and lions, Zazueta said, their female counterparts tend to collect spider monkeys.\nLocal influencers and their pampered primates dominate TikTok. The social media stars include a monkey named Kira Sophia, who appeared in a music video and whose TikTok boasts nearly 25,000 followers. A clip of her lavish first birthday party, featuring a live band and a procession of horses, was viewed more than 2 million times.\nMany people here treat their monkeys like children, swaddling them in cribs at night and dressing them in diapers \u2014 cutting a hole for their long tails to peek through. Some monkeys wear name-brand clothing and sport gold chains around their thin, hairy necks.\nBut behind the scenes, having a monkey is a lot of work. Just ask Emilia\u2019s owner.\nAyala has retrofitted her elegant home with monkey bars and ropes to keep Emilia from swinging from the television or ceiling fans.\nShe isn\u2019t quite sure how to deal with Emilia\u2019s occasional outbursts of aggression \u2014 recently the monkey took a bite out of her teenage son\u2019s chest \u2014 and checks in frequently with Quintero, the vet, to make sure she\u2019s feeding her pet the right mix of fruits, minerals and protein.\nHer son sometimes jokes that Ayala spends more time caring for Emilia than for him. \u201cAnd he\u2019s right,\u201d she said.\nAyala changes Emilia\u2019s diapers eight times a day. She gives the monkey long baths \u2014 Emilia loves warm water \u2014 followed by a blow dry and a spritz of Armani perfume. She takes Emilia to the store and to meetings, graciously stopping to let strangers pose with her for photographs.\nSometimes it\u2019s so much work that Ayala doesn\u2019t have time for a shower. Sometimes, after a particularly hard day, she finds herself weeping.\n1. Zantiel Emilio Zuniga, 15, and his mother, Zulma Ayala, change Emilia\u2019s clothes. 2. Emilia is often dressed in jeans and crop tops. 3. Ayala takes the monkey on shopping trips and to business meetings.\n\u201cShe\u2019s like a child, but three times the work,\u201d Ayala said on a recent warm evening as Emilia scampered around, playing with a helium balloon and an empty plastic bottle.\nCuddling Emilia at night makes everything worth it, Ayala said. But sometimes it makes her sad knowing that Emilia will never grow up.\n\u201cI call her my little girl,\u201d said Ayala. \u201cBut she\u2019s never going to stop being a monkey.\u201d\nEach spring, hundreds of gay cowboys gather in Zacatecas for a convention that celebrates sexual freedom and romanticizes Mexico\u2019s rural past."
