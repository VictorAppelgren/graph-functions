  "title": "We're Not Very Worried About Edgewise Therapeutics' (NASDAQ:EWTX) Cash Burn Rate",
  "description": "NasdaqGS:EWTX 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Edgewise Therapeutics's Fair Values from the Community and...",
  "content": "Explore Edgewise Therapeutics's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nEven when a business is losing money, it's possible for shareholders to make money if they buy a good business at the right price. For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. Nonetheless, only a fool would ignore the risk that a loss making company burns through its cash too quickly.\n\nGiven this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Edgewise Therapeutics (NASDAQ:EWTX) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. In this article, we define cash burn as its annual (negative) free cash flow, which is the amount of money a company spends each year to fund its growth. We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nWhen Might Edgewise Therapeutics Run Out Of Money?\n\nYou can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash. When Edgewise Therapeutics last reported its June 2025 balance sheet in August 2025, it had zero debt and cash worth US$594m. Importantly, its cash burn was US$126m over the trailing twelve months. So it had a cash runway of about 4.7 years from June 2025. There's no doubt that this is a reassuringly long runway. The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Edgewise Therapeutics\n\nHow Is Edgewise Therapeutics' Cash Burn Changing Over Time?\n\nBecause Edgewise Therapeutics isn't currently generating revenue, we consider it an early-stage business. So while we can't look to sales to understand growth, we can look at how the cash burn is changing to understand how expenditure is trending over time. With the cash burn rate up 20% in the last year, it seems that the company is ratcheting up investment in the business over time. However, the company's true cash runway will therefore be shorter than suggested above, if spending continues to increase. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. So you might want to take a peek at how much the company is expected to grow in the next few years.\n\nWhile Edgewise Therapeutics does have a solid cash runway, its cash burn trajectory may have some shareholders thinking ahead to when the company may need to raise more cash. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash and drive growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.",

  "argos_summary": "Edgewise Therapeutics (NASDAQ:EWTX) has a solid cash position with $594 million and no debt, providing a cash runway of approximately 4.7 years despite a cash burn of $126 million over the past year. However, the company's cash burn rate has increased by 20%, raising concerns about future funding needs as it currently generates no revenue. Analysts forecast significant growth in revenue and earnings over the next few years, but the company remains unprofitable, which could lead to shareholder dilution if additional capital is required.",
