  "title": "Picking Manchester United\u2019s 2025-26 breakthrough player \u2013 Leny Yoro",
  "description": "Leny Yoro endured plenty of frustration during his first year at Manchester United but those who work with him have high expectations",
  "content": "Leny Yoro didn\u2019t have the easiest start at Manchester United.\n\nYet another Paris-born football talent, the defender progressed significantly to attract attention from Real Madrid but joined United last summer despite the uncertainty surrounding the future of manager Erik ten Hag. Then, he injured his ankle during pre-season in Los Angeles, keeping him out until December 2024.\n\nA year on, Yoro can be relieved that he is well-placed to continue his rise towards becoming one of United\u2019s most important players. Thanks to a tailored strength, conditioning and nutrition programme, the 19-year-old defender has bulked up. After the final game of his side\u2019s pre-season tour, a 1-1 draw against Fiorentina last week, Yoro told reporters: \u201cLast season was not easy to start with an injury. When you come back during the season, it\u2019s difficult for you. But today, I\u2019m good.\n\n\u201cI did a good pre-season. I\u2019m not injured. I will continue like this and try to play as many games as I can.\u201d\n\nWhat Yoro says is only part of the story. What others say about him is another, but he\u2019s doing all the right things at United, who had watched him for years at former club Lille.\n\nScouts and decision-makers liked his athletic profile and assured positioning, awareness and concentration when defending, especially as part of a high line or in wide spaces. They marvelled at his bravery and committed defending. Yoro came out with top marks in reports, a teenager who looked self-possessed.\n\nThey knew Yoro should play alongside an experienced defender as he developed, but his passing was seen as expansive and creative, exactly what United were working towards. When the club carried out background checks on him, there were no concerns about his off-pitch lifestyle and influences. He came out as a stable and grounded individual. Playing for Lille, he showed emotional stability as a starter against Paris Saint-Germain, Lyon and Marseille.\n\nIn United officials\u2019 first meetings with him, Yoro brought his agent and girlfriend and staff realised that not only was he a top talent, but they also couldn\u2019t fail to notice that he was mature, humble and level-headed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t frighten him, it inspires and motivates him,\u201d explained someone who works with him every day.\n\n\u201cThe bigger the game, the better he is. The more pressure, the better he is.\u201d Yoro is showing future leadership potential, but first, he must shoulder the significant responsibility of establishing himself as a top United defender.\n\nThe signs are promising. United had plenty of bad moments last season, but when the team went behind, Yoro wasn\u2019t one of the players whose head dropped. His reactions, his resilience, hunger, ambition and courage impressed amid the acrimony of defeat after defeat. And all the time, he was dealing with a new league, new country, new team-mates and two new ways of playing under three different managers at United. He dealt with it. United are delighted with Yoro.\n\nThere were, however, occasional moments of despair rather than delight.\n\n\u201cHe showed glimpses of being very, very good and you can see his potential,\u201d one coach who worked with him told The Athletic. \u201cHe needs to keep bringing the ball out and attacking. When he passes the ball across the back, he\u2019s more vulnerable. He needs to tidy up his defending. An example of that was against Southampton, who were bottom of the table, and Kamaldeen Sulemana kept getting the better of him.\n\n\u201cHe has the attributes to be a top player. He stepped in against Athletic Club at home (Europa League semi-final second leg) to create more chances and show that he\u2019s more than a defender.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s coaches and staff saw what the fans had seen against Southampton and Yoro\u2019s performance was reviewed \u2014 but he already knew where he had gone wrong. In the following games, he played against players with a similar profile and overcompensated, conceding fouls. Then, he began to improve again, showing how he reflects and adapts quickly.\n\nUnited\u2019s view is that you learn in any job and the club are happy to give players an opportunity to develop, with the potential payback being accelerated growth.\n\nAnd how many players are the complete package at 19? He has already improved since arriving last summer and is considered a starter in Ruben Amorim\u2019s best XI, but he will still occasionally mistime his headers and make mistakes. He is still physically developing and will make errors away from the pitch, too; young players do. The key is that they learn and don\u2019t make too many.\n\nUnited want to create an environment where players feel like they are part of a family and then perform as a team, with leaders among the players who view leadership like parenting. A close environment should be caring and demanding.\n\nYoro is someone who needs little guidance, but like all players, he thrives off support. United will demand more from Yoro because they want him to be the best he can be and because he responds to it.\n\n\u201cWhen you play for Manchester United, you need to have the mindset of being the best version of yourself,\u201d he said in Atlanta in excellent English \u2014 though he laughed when he realised he\u2019d used the word \u2018old\u2019 rather than \u2018experienced\u2019 to describe the team leaders.\n\nYoro is well respected in the dressing room. He is closer to Kobbie Mainoo and Amad and other younger players, but United\u2019s dressing-room dynamic is much improved since he arrived. He also knows what it means to play for United.\n\n\u201cYeah, of course, we are a big club,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who want us to fail, we know that. But there are also a lot of people who want us to do great things.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care about what they say outside, about the media, everyone said bull**** about us last year. I understand because we didn\u2019t do well. But this season will be different. We don\u2019t need to listen to this and just be focused on ourselves.\u201d",

      "text": "Amad spectacularly saved Manchester United\u2019s blushes with a 12-minute hat-trick to fire them to victory over Southampton at Old Trafford.\nHaving fallen behind courtesy of a Manuel Ugarte own goal, Ruben Amorim\u2019s side looked to be heading for a seventh loss in nine Premier League games \u2014 but their Ivorian rising star had other ideas.\nAdvertisement\nThe 22-year-old, who signed a new long-term contract seven days ago, bundled his way into the Southampton area before firing past Aaron Ramsdale with eight minutes of normal time remaining, stretched to fire home from Christian Eriksen\u2019s scooped pass with 90 minutes on the clock, and then seized upon a loose touch to net his third in added time.\nWith Sir Jim Ratcliffe watching from the stands for the first time since last month\u2019s Manchester derby triumph, in which Amad also starred, United were ultimately able to follow up on their draw with Liverpool on January 5 and subsequent FA Cup success at Arsenal last weekend.\nLaurie Whitwell breaks down the main talking points from a dramatic comeback victory.\nAmad saves the day in style\nFor the majority of this game, United looked to be heading for a fourth successive Premier League defeat at home and renewed scrutiny on what is going on at the club. Then Amad did his thing.\nFresh from signing a new contract, Amad struck a hat-trick \u2014 the first of his career \u2014 that sent Old Trafford rocking and gave Amorim a bounce in his step as he saluted the fans on his walk to the tunnel at the final whistle.\nA tight win over Southampton would not have been seen as a particularly good result in advance but the manner of the victory proved invigorating.\nSir Jim Ratcliffe, watching in the directors\u2019 box, had worn an ashen face, but celebrated the turnaround wildly.\nIt was a bizarre contest, with Southampton very much worth their 1-0 lead into the 82nd minute. But United kept their spirit \u2014 and Amad kept running.\nHe earned the good fortune of a ricochet off Kyle Walker-Peters to slot in his equaliser, then anticipated Eriksen\u2019s chip perfectly to put United in front in stoppage time. He then put the gloss on his display by pouncing on Taylor Harwood-Bellis as Southampton tried to pass out from the back, an example of the kind of intensity he puts into his performances.\nAdvertisement\nAmad has become a real cult hero this season, with those in the Stretford End singing his name as he left the pitch following his TV interview.\nIt is evidence that Amad should be a No 10 in this system. For all his commitment at wing-back, where he started this game, he is at his most dangerous when running into the box.\nUnited were indebted to Andre Onana for producing another brilliant double save in the first half \u2014 his third of the season \u2014 while the hug Antony gave Amad was perhaps reflective of the major miss by the Brazilian when teed up with an open net by Alejandro Garnacho with the score 1-0.\nYoro struggles as United\u2019s midfield flounders\nThis was Leny Yoro\u2019s fourth start of his United career and the troubling omen for supporters pre-match was that his previous three had all ended in defeat.\nYoro\u2019s full debut came in the 3-2 defeat to Nottingham Forest, with the 4-3 loss to Tottenham in the Carabao Cup following. He also started the 2-0 Boxing Day defeat at Wolves.\nClearly, he is not at fault for those results and his recent appearances have been very encouraging. He went on as a late substitute at Anfield earlier this month and put in a brilliant recovery tackle on Darwin Nunez. Then he seemed the coolest person at the Emirates Stadium when slotting in his penalty in the FA Cup shootout win over Arsenal last weekend.\nBut against Southampton, he had a torrid night. Kamaldeen Sulemana went past him at will and by the 58th minute, when it had happened for the fourth time, Yoro unleashed a howl of angst, whipping his head in annoyance.\nThat was when Sulemana had just decided to push the ball past him in midfield and chase after it. He caught it, then put his shot just wide, through the legs of Matthijs de Ligt. It was De Ligt minutes earlier who had blocked Sulemana\u2019s shot after he had beaten Yoro again.\nThe tone was set in the 12th minute when Sulemana glided past Yoro into the box for a shot that Onana got down well to save. Later in the half, Sulemana spun Yoro without touching the ball to set up another Southampton attack.\nYoro, 19, was not the only youngster enduring a tough game. Kobbie Mainoo, also 19, was taken off at the break after Southampton had cut through United\u2019s midfield with ease.\nUgarte, 23, was also culpable, having been turned by Joe Aribo for a move that ended in a shot saved by Onana. Ugarte was replaced eight minutes after the break.\nIs Hojlund\u2019s form becoming a problem?\nRasmus Hojlund wore a deflated expression as he made his way around the perimeter of the pitch having been substituted on 53 minutes. United were trailing 1-0 but Amorim felt a comeback was likelier with his No 9 replaced.\nThe crowd has voiced their frustrations with Hojlund shortly before the break when he allowed Jan Bednarek to steal in front of him in the centre circle to cut out a good pass by Onana. It had continued a theme of Hojlund not being responsive enough to balls from deep.\nAmorim had instructed Hojlund over his movement as early as the 13th minute. He was too distant as Yoro searched for a pass upfield from his right centre-back spot.\nHojlund gave a flick of his hand to explain he was going towards the left channel to find space but Amorim wanted him more central. Two minutes later, Bruno Fernandes was giving Hojlund pointers, asking him to drop deeper to help with build-up.\nThe pair combined nicely to create United\u2019s best chance of the first half on 20 minutes, though. Hojlund triggered a give-and-go with Fernandes by passing the ball and setting off down the left wing. He sped past Bednarek and waited until the right moment to cut the ball back to Garnacho in the box.\nAdvertisement\nBut Garnacho skewed his finish and Hojlund reacted by kicking the post in anger \u2014 a sign of the pressure he is perhaps feeling.\nHe is only 21 but is expected to shoulder the burden of United\u2019s scoring, yet has only two goals in 15 Premier League games this campaign.\nWhat did Ruben Amorim say?\nSpeaking to TNT Sports, Amorim said: \u201cIn the end it is good. A very difficult game, a game of two halves.\n\u201cThey did a very good job, Southampton; creating space in between the lines. No 20 (Sulemana) with a lot of space. We had a lot of difficulty to stop that player. When they lose their physicality, we find the space to use. The feeling is we have so much to do; the team is really tired.\u201d\nOn Amad: \u201cEven in the first half, every time Amad gets the ball, he can push the ball. He pushes the other team into the final third \u2014 that is really important.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a good game but, at this moment, winning is the most important thing.\u201d\nWhat next for Manchester United?\nSunday, January 19: Brighton (H), Premier League, 2pm GMT, 9am ET\nRecommended reading\n- What Ruben Amorim has changed at Manchester United \u2013 and what he\u2019s still working on\n- Manchester United Q&A: Our writer Mark Critchley answers your questions\n- Arsenal cameo suggests Toby Collyer has the energy and athleticism Amorim wants\n- Welcome to Carrington \u2013 the evolution of Manchester United\u2019s training ground\n- The Transfer DealSheet: Latest on United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Real Madrid and more\n(Top photo: Carl Recine/Getty Images)"

      "text": "When Flore Baugnies and her three sons visit Leny Yoro in Manchester, they do not fly. With Romeo, 15, Eden, 13, and Esteban, 11, bundled in the back of their van, they drive from Croix, on the outskirts of Lille, France, to Calais and cross the English channel by ferry. On a good run the journey takes around nine hours.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThey say a holiday starts the moment you slam the door,\u201d Baugnies tells The Athletic. \u201cAnd the journey is part of it.\n\u201cWe want our children to experience what we experienced as children. You must not lose those values and traditions. The children are still young, they don\u2019t realise it, but when they\u2019re older, they\u2019ll have these memories.\u201d\nBaugnies is conscious of keeping her children grounded. She tells them that their older brother has his story and it\u2019s up to them to write their own.\n\u201cWe try to stay humble and continue to live our little normal lives, it can quickly go to your head. Leny\u2019s life is very good, but it\u2019s Leny\u2019s life,\u201d she says.\nOn Wednesday, the Frenchman has a chance to write another chapter of his story as Manchester United face Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in Bilbao.\nDespite having spent over a decade watching her son play football, the nerves never go away.\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to get used to it, but at the beginning, you\u2019re always scared, scared he\u2019ll make a mistake,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want to go out there and tell him, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be fine\u2019. Every time I watch a match, I\u2019m pretty stressed.\u201d\nYet for all the nerves, there is great pride in Yoro\u2019s calm and composed performances, which have quickly taken him to the top.\nIt was two o\u2019clock in the morning in France. Baugnies, 5,500 miles (9,000km) away, was watching on TV as her son limped off in the 35th minute of United\u2019s opening pre-season tour game against Arsenal in late July in Los Angeles.\nSeeing him in pain hurt her. She was worried, praying it was nothing too serious. She sent him a few messages to check in but equally she didn\u2019t want to pester him, a difficult balance to strike as a parent.\nHaving joined from Lille just 10 days beforehand as United\u2019s most expensive summer signing, the deal worth an initial \u00a352million ($67.9m), scans later revealed the 18-year-old had fractured his fifth metatarsal in his left foot, putting him out for just over three months.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI would have liked to have been with him then,\u201d Baugnies says. Before leaving for Manchester last year, it was easier for her to gauge her son\u2019s mood. He was living at home with his three younger brothers in their apartment on the outskirts of Lille. The mother and son\u2019s connection is almost telepathic.\nBefore Yoro\u2019s younger brothers came along, it was just the two of them.\n\u201cLeny was with me all the time,\u201d says Baugnies, who named her first son after her love for American singer Lenny Kravitz. \u201cThe first steps, riding a bike, even kicking a ball.\n\u201cWe went to the park, we stuck to each other like glue. Everything I did, I did with him. We don\u2019t really need to say a lot. I just understand when he\u2019s OK or not OK. I can just sense it.\u201d\nAlthough they all get on well, Yoro grew up slightly apart from his three brothers, given the age gap; he is eight years older than the fourth child, Esteban.\n\u201cMy relationship with Leny is different from the one I have with his other brothers,\u201d his mother says. \u201cThey (the trio) are closer to each other.\nBaugnies, who comes from a large, tight-knit family herself, does not view raising her four boys as a sacrifice even though she quit her job working in sales in Paris and her social life ground to a halt.\n\u201cIt was difficult for me but they had a good childhood and I made sure they didn\u2019t see all the bad things that were going on around them,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t spoiled but they were never deprived of anything.\n\u201cIf I had to do it again, I would. Time passes so quickly.\u201d\nAlready at three years old, the centre-back who is now 6ft 3in (190cm), was tall for his age. At times, his school teachers mistook him for a pupil in the years above.\n\u201cHe never really got up to any mischief,\u201d says Baugnies. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say he\u2019s a model child, because they all have their little faults, but he was very calm and wise, a reserved child.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nYoro grew up playing football in a playground opposite his home in Saint-Maurice, a suburb of Paris, before playing for his first club Alfortville to the south-east of the French capital. It was his father, Alain Yoro, who had played for Lille\u2019s academy, who took him as Baugnies had just had their second child, Romeo.\nAfter the youngest, Esteban, was born in 2013, Yoro\u2019s parents split up. She took her children south to Bormes-les-Mimosas for six months to live with their aunt, before heading back north to Lille. It was then that Yoro, aged 12, joined Villeneuve d\u2019Ascq, known locally as VAM.\nWhen not playing football, the boys cycled, went to the swimming pool and every year went on holiday to their cousins in the south of France. As a family, they celebrated birthdays and had barbecues, Christmas was a big occasion, as was the Epiphany, celebrated on January 6, with the traditional Galette des Rois cake.\n\u201cThe only time he messes around is when he is with his brothers in a very small group,\u201d says his mother. \u201cThey played so much football in the house and often broke things. But even with the wider family, he was quite quiet.\u201d\nHis bedroom was very simple, there were no posters stuck to the wall. He used to play FIFA on his PlayStation all the time but Baugnies never bought any of the football magazines and says her son did not have an idol and did not support a team, save France, growing up.\n\u201cIf you went into his room, you wouldn\u2019t have even known he played football,\u201d she says.\nRobert Dervaux, his youth coach at VAM, had never seen such talent.\nOff the field, Yoro was shy. But on it, he was a leader and Dervaux made him captain of the under-13 team despite him being a year younger than his peers.\n\u201cAs soon as he stepped onto the field, he grew in stature,\u201d he says. \u201cI put him at right-back, up front, in every position, he was immense.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cOn the field, he was a winner, very important for communication and relationships with others. He was simple, respectful and grateful for all his mother did for him.\u201d\nDervaux contacted a Lille scout. \u201cCome and see this kid, he is exceptional. I can\u2019t keep him.\u201d\nYoro impressed at the Lille trial in 2017 but his mother never thought he would play professional football.\n\u201cAt 13, 14, 15, I didn\u2019t imagine he was going to become what he is today,\u201d she says. \u201cI could see he was enjoying himself. I was happy. Then we\u2019d go home. It was a hobby. It wasn\u2019t professional, not at all. I always said to him: the day you don\u2019t enjoy it, you stop.\n\u201cHe never said to me \u2018Mum, I\u2019m absolutely going to do this\u2019. I even wonder if he knew that one day it would happen to him. It\u2019s happened so quickly for Leny.\n\u201cI think it took him a long time to say to himself, \u2018This is it\u2019 because he\u2019s so humble. There are even times when he wonders, \u2018Why me?\u2019 Sometimes he doesn\u2019t realise all the qualities he has as a top player. Whereas his brother, Eden, is convinced he\u2019ll go pro. He even tells me that he\u2019s better than Leny!\u201d\n\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8f & \ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc98 \ud83d\ude0d\nLeny Yoro et nos dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s 2023 ont re\u00e7u leur BAC lundi au Domaine de Luchin \ud83c\udf93@leny_yoro \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/ZjaMixgnX4\n\u2014 LOSC (@losclive) April 24, 2024\nAlthough many coaches at Lille admired his personality, including Olivier Szkwarok, who was in charge of Lille under-16s, and Dervaux, who thought he was a future Raphael Varane, there were some who doubted his ability to play at the highest level.\nBaugnies remembers that time. When Yoro was playing for the under-16s, aged 15, the same year he had his braces removed, he grew 10 centimetres and got injured without even playing.\n\u201cPeople said that he was quite fragile,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have much faith in him but we\u2019re happy to say to all those people, this is where he is today.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Yoro\u2019s mother, using a nutritionist was a great help.\n\u201cThe big change came when we really started to pay attention to what he ate and how he recovered. We had to know how many calories he was consuming per day to see if it was too much or too little,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt was hard to do it regularly. He was still a child and you always had to remind him. At that age, it\u2019s very difficult for a teenager to think: I have to eat well, go to bed early and stretch.\u201d\nSuch discipline was required from a young age. Yoro, 15 at the time, was unexpectedly called upon in the 79th minute of Lille Under-19s\u2019 UEFA Youth League game against Sevilla in October 2021 after Baptiste Rolland was shown a red card.\n\u201cHe should never have played,\u201d says his mum. \u201cThat\u2019s why sometimes I think he\u2019s got a lucky star. You don\u2019t succeed just because you\u2019re good, there\u2019s hard work and a lot of luck in football. That match was the one that really set everything off.\u201d\nTo mark that turning point at the age of 15, Yoro wore that numbered shirt at Lille, the same number he wears at United.\nAged 16, Baugnies recalls him making his full professional Ligue 1 debut in September against Toulouse, which Lille won 2-1.\n\u201cHe made a big error and they conceded,\u201d she says. But being thrust into the limelight helped develop his mental resilience.\n\u201cIf he makes a mistake, he picks himself up straight away. If they lost a match, he came home and we didn\u2019t necessarily talk about the game, we left him alone. He\u2019d go up to his room and in the moment he\u2019s not good but the next day he goes again, he\u2019s already thinking about the next match. But he still questions himself, of course.\u201d\nWhen Yoro reaches out to his mother to ask if she\u2019s OK, that\u2019s when she knows something\u2019s not quite right.\n\u201cI think everyone needs to open up and talk sometimes,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to be like that; I always solved my problems on my own. Maybe, with experience, he\u2019ll come round to it. But for the moment when you want to get something out of Leny, it\u2019s like getting blood out of a stone!\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhen he had his injury, he said: \u201cListen, it\u2019s OK, they have to operate\u201d. He never complains.\n\u201cHe never tells us what\u2019s going on in the dressing room, he never has a bad word to say about one of his team-mates or the coach. He\u2019s very respectful about that and keeps himself to himself.\u201d\nThat attitude has been evident from a young age.\n\u201cIn all my years as a coach, I\u2019ve never seen such a young player with so much maturity,\u201d Paulo Fonseca, who took over as Lille manager in the summer of 2022, told The Athletic last year.\nBaugnies has never seen Yoro lose his temper and they rarely have big arguments. \u201cNot like I could sometimes have with his brothers!\u201d she says.\n\u201cHe asserts himself on the pitch, but he\u2019s not going to hurt for the sake of hurting. He\u2019s a really nice guy.\u201d\nBut that does not stop Yoro from being an ultimate competitor. She has seen her son become \u201cmore assertive\u201d on the pitch, given the Premier League\u2019s physicality and says he had to \u201ctoughen up\u201d and \u201cbuild his strength to go into battle\u201d.\nThat was shown when the centre-back put his body \u2014 actually his head \u2014 on the line to block Malick Fofana\u2019s shot in the Europa League quarter-final second leg against Lyon in April, which United won 5-4, (7-6 on aggregate).\n\u201cThat was a crazy game!\u201d Baugnies, who was watching at home with her sisters, brothers-in-law, nieces and nephews, says. \u201cI will remember that game forever.\u201d\nUnited had been monitoring Yoro for at least a year, submitting detailed reports about a player their scouting department believed had the highest potential of any centre-back his age across Europe. But many had expected Yoro to sign for Real Madrid that summer or in a year\u2019s time when his Lille contract was due to expire.\n\u201cHe always knew that at some point he\u2019d go abroad, he\u2019s always loved the English league, so for him it was logical,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big club, with an incredible history, I know he\u2019s always loved that club.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nYoro had the advice of his representative Jorge Mendes from Gestifute and spoke to his older cousin Charly too but \u201cwhen Leny wants to do something, he will do it\u201d, his mother says.\n\u201cWe discussed it a bit. I really let him make his own decision. We talked about it without really talking about it, and one day I think he just said quite simply: \u2018Well, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m going to Manchester\u2019.\n\u201cIt was up to him to forge his own path and become an adult.\n\u201cThey (United) really had a project for him, a project to make a team with young players, and he really liked that. He could be part of those who would \u2018rebuild\u2019 Manchester United\u2019s history.\u201d\nInterested clubs would meet with Mendes and Yoro\u2019s parents in neutral venues \u2014 either in Lille or just over the border in Belgium.\n\u201cWe were a little more secluded, calmer, because we did not want everyone talking, trying to find out where we were going every time we went somewhere,\u201d says Baugnies.\n\u201cThe clubs are all very respectful. It\u2019s strange to see how much they want your son. When they\u2019re there, they show you that they really want him to come. It makes you feel valued. It\u2019s really a world apart.\n\u201cWe\u2019re normal people and when I tell you that it happened to Leny just like that, the same thing happened to us too.\u201d\nJust like Yoro, Baugnies has had to adapt. When Yoro played professionally for Lille, she used to read everything written about him. \u201cAs soon as I saw something mean, it annoyed me,\u201d she says. But she soon learned that this wasn\u2019t serving her at all.\nWhen Thierry Henry criticised Yoro for his performance during United\u2019s 4-1 defeat at Newcastle United this season, it slightly irritated Baugnies, especially given France legend Henry had been Yoro\u2019s coach with the country\u2019s Under-21s.\n\u201cHe had the right to say what he wanted to say,\u201d she says. \u201cLeny hadn\u2019t played a great game but when people say things like that, it stings. It\u2019s my son.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 all that matters is that he realised he didn\u2019t play the match he needed to play and that he played a better match afterwards. We take a step back because if we\u2019re angry, we\u2019re going to pass it on to our children.\u201d\nSuch criticism is just another aspect of this new world the family is trying to navigate.\n\u201cEven though I\u2019m very happy for him, a mother always worries,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated world. There\u2019s a lot of money involved, there are people arriving all of a sudden who weren\u2019t there to begin with, and you have to be very careful with everyone. It\u2019s a very tiring life, even for us. Of course, there are more serious things in life but you do have to experience it to know.\n\u201cPeople think it\u2019s great. They make a lot of money because they kick a ball. I can tell you it\u2019s extremely complicated to be a professional footballer. They never stop, they never have a holiday. Mentally, it\u2019s extremely difficult. It\u2019s not an easy job.\u201d\nInitially, Baugnies was considering moving her and Yoro\u2019s brothers\u2019 lives to Manchester to live with the teenager who had only got his driving licence in February last year.\n\u201cHe was only 18, so he was very young,\u201d she says. \u201cAt home, I\u2019m a mum who does everything for this child. He didn\u2019t cook, he didn\u2019t do the dishes or tidy his bedroom.\u201d\nBut Yoro preferred for his brothers to stay. He didn\u2019t want everyone to move just for him in case things did not turn out well.\nBaugnies describes United\u2019s season as \u201csad\u201d and the Europa League has kept them going. Erik ten Hag\u2019s departure in late October did not affect Yoro too much and he has a good relationship with his successor Ruben Amorim, who handed him his debut against Arsenal on December 4.\n\u201cI\u2019m not just saying this for your article, but I\u2019ve never heard anything bad about the coach or the players,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a healthy relationship.\u201d\nShe describes her son, who lives with his girlfriend in Manchester, as a \u201chomebody\u201d and more of a \u201csolitary person\u201d.\n\u201cHe goes to training and then comes home,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s like all teenagers, he has his PlayStation, his dogs, he has a quiet, simple life.\u201d\nThat was how he was at Lille in his early teens too. Even when he was old enough to go out, he never did \u2014 parties were not his thing.\nAdvertisement\nOutside of football, food \u2014 one of his favourite meals is chicken and green beans \u2014 and fashion remain his passions. \u201cHe buys so many clothes, we don\u2019t know where to put them!\u201d she says. \u201cAnd he loves to eat, going out to restaurants.\u201d\nBut Yoro has got used to this more secluded life over time. At first, it was strange. In Lille, he used to go to the shopping centre with his mother but every two minutes they would be stopped by someone asking for a photo. Although Baugnies recognises this is part of their job, it put Yoro off venturing out.\n\u201cI remember thinking maybe the fact of becoming \u2018someone\u2019 might have turned his head, but not at all,\u201d she says.\nThat was one less worry to think about but naturally Baugines is protective of her son. \u201cI\u2019m wary of everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to make sure that no one takes advantage of him. It\u2019s hard because sometimes I feel like I\u2019m always fighting with everyone. Even if he is what he is today, he\u2019s still my son. For me, it\u2019s not Leny Yoro the footballer, it\u2019s always Leny.\u201d\nAs Baugnies watches on from the San Mames stadium in Bilbao on Wednesday alongside her sons, there will be no special rituals. She will say a little prayer for her eldest and let destiny take its course.\n(Top illustration: Will Tullos/The Athletic; photos Ash Donelon, Alex Livesey, James Gill/Getty Images)"
