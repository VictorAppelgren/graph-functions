  "content": "Less than 24 hours after screenshots referencing \u201csports gambling\u201d in his Venmo transaction history surfaced, Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn a statement he release on X Tuesday afternoon, Mateer confirmed that the Venmo transactions did in fact come from his account, but were merely a joke rather than a trail of any involvement in sports gambling.\n\n\u201cThe allegations that I once participated in sports gambling are false,\u201d his statement read. \u201cMy previous Venmo descriptions did not accurately portray the transactions in question but were instead inside jokes between me and my friends.\n\n\u201cI have never bet on sports. I understand the seriousness of the matter, but recognize that, taken out of context, those Venmo descriptions suggest otherwise. I can assure my teammates, coaches, and officials at the NCAA that I have not engaged in any sports gambling.\u201d\n\nScreenshots posted online Monday night showed Mateer including \u201csports gambling\u201d in two separate Venmo transactions to \u201cRichard Roaten\u201d on Nov. 20, 2022, while he was a freshman at Washington State.\n\nThe NCAA has a strict policy prohibiting athletes from betting on intercollegiate, amateur or professional athletics competition. Consequences for athletes caught sports betting include loss of eligibility.\n\nThe Division I Council did introduce a proposal in June that, if adopted in October, would change sports betting rules to permit student-athletes and staff members to bet on professional sports.\n\nBut that has not been approved yet, and one of the alleged Venmo transactions by Mateer referenced \u201cUCLA vs. USC,\u201d a college event.\n\nOklahoma athletics addressed the situation in a statement to The Dallas Morning News, saying, \"OU Athletics provides ongoing education to its student-athletes, coaches, and staff on matters related to sports gambling. The department utilizes ProhiBet, which is an industry-standard service offering comprehensive monitoring of sports gambling activities.\n\n\u201cOU takes any allegations of gambling seriously and works closely with the NCAA in any situations of concern. OU Athletics is unaware of any NCAA investigation and has no reason to believe there is one pending.\u201d\n\nMateer was one of the top transfer players this offseason, departing Washington State to join the Sooners. He passed for 3,139 yards and 29 touchdowns last season, which was his third with the Cougars.\n\nFind more college sports coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.",

      "text": "The AP released its annual preseason football poll Monday, giving a first glimpse into who its voters expect will be this year\u2019s top performers in college football.\nTexas (No. 1), SMU (No. 16), Oklahoma (No. 18), Texas A&M (No. 19) and Texas Tech (No. 23) earned spots in the top 25, while Baylor and TCU also received votes.\nThe first regular-season poll won\u2019t be released until Sept. 2. Here are five takeaways from the initial rankings this year:\nTexas ranked preseason No. 1 for first time\nFor the first time, Texas will open a college football season ranked No. 1 in the nation, according to the AP poll.\nThe Longhorns edged out Penn State by just five points, the closest preseason vote since 1998.\nExpectations are high for the Longhorns, who have returned to prominence in the last few seasons, winning 25 of their past 30 games and reaching two straight College Football Playoff semifinals.\nWith Arch Manning as the undisputed starter, many wonder if this may be the year Texas finally returns to \u2014 or even wins \u2014 the national championship.\nTexas will face a huge test early, facing defending national champion Ohio State in Week 1 in a rematch of last season\u2019s CFP semifinal where the Buckeyes beat the Longhorns 28-14 in the Cotton Bowl.\nWith Ohio State ranked No. 3 in the preseason poll, expect some shake up of the rankings in the first regular-season poll.\nSMU ends 40-year drought\nSMU had not appeared in an AP preseason poll since 1985 \u2014 until now.\nThe Mustangs earned the No. 16 ranking in the nation entering this season \u2014 the second-highest in Texas and third-highest in the ACC.\nComing off an unprecedented run to the CFPlayoff, SMU burst onto the national scene last year. While their underwhelming performance against Penn State in their CFP first-round game was quite the disappointment, the Mustangs maintained some respect after what they accomplished in 2024. SMU went undefeated in league play before reaching the ACC title game in their first year in the conference.\nSMU also brings back quarterback Kevin Jennings after a breakout season and star tight end RJ Maryland, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear in October of last year.\nWith nonconference matchups against Baylor and TCU \u2014 and regular-season matchups against Clemson, Miami and Louisville \u2014 SMU will be able to earn r\u00e9sum\u00e9-building wins.\nTexas Tech\u2019s big spend captures nation\u2019s attention\nIt\u2019s championship or bust for the Red Raiders this year, who reportedly spent $12 million to bring in 21 new transfers and $25 million to construct their roster.\nThat earned Texas Tech its first AP poll spot since 2018 and its highest ranking since 2013, as the Red Raiders slotted in at No. 23.\nTech hasn\u2019t been ranked in a preseason poll since 2008, and it hasn\u2019t been ranked for more than one week in a season since 2013.\nBut last year\u2019s CFP selection process showed the Big 12 is wide open, and Tech has certainly established itself as one of the contenders, even after an 8-5 finish last season.\nBig 12 remains an enigma\nThe Big 12 is arguably the most wide open conference in America, and the AP preseason poll reflected that.\nNo Big 12 team earned a spot in the top 10, but Arizona State (No. 11), Kansas State (No. 17), Iowa State (No. 22) and Texas Tech (No. 23) will begin the season ranked. BYU, Utah and Baylor were the first three teams out, while TCU and Colorado also received votes.\nThis AP poll reflects last season\u2019s final standings where seven teams were no more than a game out of reaching the Big 12 title game.\nBut parity in the conference wasn\u2019t enough to earn the Big 12 more than a single bid to the College Football Playoff. Could this year be different?\nOn X/Twitter: @Lassimak\nFind more college sports coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "With rising expectations in competitive conferences, money flowing directly to players and unforgiving fan bases, the pressure has never been higher across college football.\nHere are six coaches who could very well be on the hot seat \u2014 from warm to scorching \u2014 entering the 2025 season:\nBrent Venables, Oklahoma\nThe clock is ticking for Brent Venables, who heads into his fourth season in Norman yet to meet the expectations that come with this storied program. His sole winning season is sandwiched between 6-7 records in 2022 and 2024. He\u2019s yet to lead the program to a bowl win, going 0-3, and the Cheez-It, Alamo and Armed Forces bowls aren\u2019t where Sooners fans want to end the year.\nOklahoma finished with a 2-6 conference record in its inaugural season in the SEC a year ago while fellow newbie and rival Texas topped the conference. Entering year two in the SEC, Venables could use a standout year.\nHugh Freeze, Auburn\nHugh Freeze is feeling the heat after opening with two seven-loss seasons. Recruiting efforts have been admirable, but in-game decisions in high-pressure moments have raised concerns. Auburn hasn\u2019t hesitated to part ways with coaches in recent years, and Freeze could be next on the chopping block if he doesn\u2019t produce fast results. Getting Georgia and Alabama at home might help ... right?\nSam Pittman, Arkansas\nWhat to do with Sam Pittman? He is a folksy, charming guy and he has three winning seasons out of five for the Razorbacks that included bowl wins. But he is 30-31 overall and Arkansas has not emerged as any kind of a consistent threat in the SEC.\nExpectations were high for Pittman after a 9-4 season in 2021 but the Hogs look like a mostly middling program. The schedule this year includes visits to Ole Miss, Tennessee and, on back-to-back weekends, LSU and Texas.\nBilly Napier, Florida\nBilly Napier\u2019s tenure in Florida started with 6-7 and 5-7 records before last year\u2019s 8-5 finish that included a 4-4 mark in the SEC. Does gradual improvement meet the high standards of a historically dominant program?\nA dominant season by quarterback DJ Lagway and a few marquee wins could help Napier\u2019s job security. The Gators won\u2019t have to wait long to see how they stack up: A four-game stretch that starts in Week 3 features LSU, Miami, Texas and Texas A&M, with only the Longhorns visiting the Swamp of the group.\nLuke Fickell, Wisconsin\nAfter two full seasons at the helm, Luke Fickell could use a breakout season. Wisconsin went 5-7 last year after a 7-6 finish in his first full season, easily an afterthought in a Big Ten Conference that grabbed two national titles. Inconsistent quarterback play, injuries and a difficult schedule have troubled the Badgers.\nFickell\u2019s strong run at Cincinnati seems a long time ago now. Up next is a schedule that includes visits to Alabama, Michigan and Oregon. At least Ohio State is at Camp Randall Stadium.\nLincoln Riley, USC\nLincoln Riley\u2019s first year with the Trojans felt somewhat magical for a while, an 11-3 effort stymied by a pair of losses to Utah and one-point bowl loss to Tulane. What\u2019s followed has warmed things up for Riley: an 8-5 record in 2023 and a 7-6 mark last year. Much of Riley\u2019s fate could be in the hands of quarterback Jayden Maiava but the Trojans would love to see new assistant and former NFL veteran Rob Ryan field a shutdown defense.\nHonorable mention\n- Alabama\u2019s Kalen DeBoer saw his team put up a 9-4 mark in his first season in Tuscaloosa; the Crimson Tide will need to be better than that \u2014 as in, make the College Football Playoff.\n- Oklahoma State went 12-2 in 2021 but Mike Gundy\u2019s teams have been inconsistent for a while now and last year\u2019s 3-9 collapse raised questions about the veteran coach.\n- Mike Norvell has had two good seasons sandwiched by two bad ones, including last year\u2019s 2-10 mark. Surely everyone in Tallahassee heard former coach Jimbo Fisher tell a podcast last week he was ready to come back to the right situation in college football?\nFind more college sports coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."
