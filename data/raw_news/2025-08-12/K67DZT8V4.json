  "title": "Do We Have to Bring Johnny Depp Back to 'Pirates of the Caribbean', Actually?",
  "description": "Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has teased the star might return, but maybe it's time to just let that ship sail.",
  "content": "Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has teased the star might return, but maybe it's time to just let that ship sail.\n\nBack in 2003, when Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl first hit theaters, it was a pleasant surprise. A movie based on a Disney ride\u2014in a time when pirate movies weren\u2019t exactly riding high\u2014it was highly entertaining, made a zillion dollars, and earned Johnny Depp his first Oscar nomination. Four sequels of varying quality followed, but despite many rumblings since Dead Men Tell No Tales in 2017, Pirates has yet to relaunch. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is now saying there might be life left in the franchise with the now-controversial Depp back aboard\u2014but is that something we should really be encouraging?\n\nSpeaking to Entertainment Weekly, Bruckheimer said Depp is open to a Captain Jack Sparrow return. That\u2019s significant since Disney jettisoned the star in 2018 amid his legal drama with former wife Amber Heard; as EW notes, Depp said in court in 2022 that he would not be reprising the role because \u201cthere was a deep and distinct sense of feeling betrayed by the people that I\u2019ve worked hard for.\u201d\n\nHowever, now there\u2019s seemingly been a shift. \u201cIf he likes the way the part\u2019s written, I think he would do it,\u201d Bruckheimer told EW. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what\u2019s on the page, as we all know.\u201d\n\nBruckheimer has previously described a potential sixth Pirates movie as a reboot. In 2022, amid discussions of Margot Robbie\u2019s on-again, off-again take on the franchise\u2014which he still had hopes for at that time\u2014he sounded less optimistic about Depp making any sort of Pirates return someday. However, he did say, \u201cThe future has yet to be decided.\u201d\n\nThat future is apparently here now, and Bruckheimer, who is clearly aware that any time he talks about Pirates he makes headlines, is floating that possibility anew. But even if someone writes the best Pirates reboot script ever, topping even the seaworthy hijinks of The Curse of the Black Pearl, do we really need Depp and his character to be shoehorned into it? Captain Jack Sparrow had already overstayed his welcome even before Depp\u2019s personal troubles became headline fodder. Perhaps if there\u2019s no chance of getting a Pirates movie without him, we should consider letting the idea sink to the bottom of the ocean forever.",

      "text": "Trying to keep track of what\u2019s coming in the realm of Star Trek feels like trying to stop a tribble from procreating. Before even more new series are announced, here\u2019s our guide of when to expect all the new Star Trek shows, as well as returning familiar favorites, and what else is in the works right now. Engage!\nThis post was last updated 7/14/23.\nCurrently Airing: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 2\nThe Enterprise is back after a successful first season, and this time Captain Kirk will be along for the ride with another appearance by Paul Wesley after his surprise finale role in season one. Not much else is known about the season so far, other than one episode will see the show crossover with Star Trek: Lower Decks in a live-action/animated hybrid directed by The Next Generation\u2019s Jonathan Frakes. The show has also been renewed for a third season.\nSeason two recaps:\n\u201cTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\u201d\n\u201cCharades\u201d\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Lower Decks Season 4\nThe third season of the animated series following the misfit crew of the USS Cerritos\u2014and in particular its cadre of ensigns, Mariner (Tawny Newsome), Boimler (Jack Quaid), Tendi (No\u00ebl Wells), and Rutherford (Eugene Cordero)\u2014once again followed our heroic ensigns and the remaining bridge officers aboard the Cerritos. Season four will be arriving in late summer. The show has also been renewed for a fifth season.\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Discovery Season 5\nExpected in early 2024, Discovery\u2019s fifth season will be 10 episodes long, down from the 13 of prior seasons. In the wake of season four\u2018s climax earlier this year, Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) led her crew in a desperate attempt to save the galaxy from a mysterious anomaly created by an extra-galactic race, ensuring peace and stability for the Federation once more\u2026 for now. As her romantic partner Book (David Ajala) pays time for his own role in a campaign to surreptitiously destroy that anomaly, we\u2019re not sure what awaits Burnham and Discovery\u2019s crew just yet, but given this show, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll be very, very dramatic.\nIn Flux: Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2\nThe animated series aimed at younger Trek fans (and Janeway fans!) and kids at heart can be found on both Nickelodeon and Paramount+. The first season was divided into two parts, with part two wrapping up at the end of 2022; after Paramount+ announced it would not move forward with the show\u2019s already greenlit season two, it was removed from the service. (A home release of the complete first season is still possible; the first 10 episodes are still available for purchase.) Fans are still waiting to hear if Prodigy season two will surface on a different outlet.\nUpcoming: Starfleet Academy\nIt\u2019s really happening! After a long tease, filming on this series will begin in 2024. Here\u2019s the official announcement from co-showrunners and executive producers Alex Kurtzman and Noga Landau:\n\u201cAdmission is now open to Starfleet Academy! Explore the galaxy! Captain your destiny! For the first time in over a century, our campus will be re-opened to admit individuals a minimum of 16 Earth years (or species equivalent) who dream of exceeding their physical, mental and spiritual limits, who value friendship, camaraderie, honor and devotion to a cause greater than themselves. The coursework will be rigorous, the instructors among the brightest lights in their respective fields, and those accepted will live and study side-by-side with the most diverse population of students ever admitted. Today we encourage all who share our dreams, goals and values to join a new generation of visionary cadets as they take their first steps toward creating a bright future for us all. Apply today! Ex Astris, Scientia!\u201d\nUpcoming (movie): Star Trek: Section 31\nAnnounced as a TV series back in 2019 as a spinoff for fan-favorite Discovery guest star Michelle Yeoh, this plunge into the seediest side of Starfleet\u2014the shadowy spy organization Section 31 first introduced in Deep Space Nine\u2014is now planned as a Paramount+ film.\nNewly minted Oscar winner Yeoh will return as former emperor of the Mirror Universe\u2019s Terran Empire, Phillipa Georgiou, now turned into a kinder, but still kickass person by her time with Michael Burnham. \u201cI\u2019m beyond thrilled to return to my Star Trek family and to the role I\u2019ve loved for so long,\u201d Yeoh said in a statement. \u201cSection 31 has been near and dear to my heart since I began the journey of playing Philippa all the way back when this new golden age of Star Trek launched. To see her finally get her moment is a dream come true in a year that\u2019s shown me the incredible power of never giving up on your dreams. We can\u2019t wait to share what\u2019s in store for you, and until then: live long and prosper (unless Emperor Georgiou decrees otherwise)!\u201d\nWritten by Craig Sweeny and directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi, Star Trek: Section 31 will start production later this year, and eventually come to Paramount+.\nWhere Can I Stream Classic Star Trek Shows?\nThat\u2019s all the new bits of Star Trek coming. But what about the old Star Trek? In the U.S. at least, the vast majority of classic Star Trek shows are available exclusively to stream on Paramount+ (albeit not without issues), although some holdouts remain on other streaming services. Here\u2019s a full list of classic Star Trek shows and where to stream them, as well as links to our recommended episode guides for every series!\nStar Trek: The Original Series (Paramount+)\nStar Trek: The Animated Series (Paramount+)\nStar Trek: The Next Generation (Paramount+, Netflix)\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine (Paramount+, Netflix)\nStar Trek: Voyager (Paramount+)\nStar Trek: Enterprise (Paramount+)\nWant more io9 news?

EW's editorial guidelines Published on August 12, 2025 09:00AM EDT 1 Comment Credit: Andrew Eccles/Disney Johnny Depp might be open to returning to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise after all, savvy?The rum-chasing pirate is part of producer Jerry Bruckheimer's plans for a sixth film, which would otherwise be a reboot.Bruckheimer believes Depp will return if he likes the script, which the producer says is nearing completion. Johnny Depp is interested in returning to the high seas. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, producer Jerry Bruckheimer reveals that he has had conversations with Depp about reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean film. Bruckheimer previously told EW that he was eager for Depp to return to the role, despite Disney cutting ties with Depp, which the actor claimed happened as a result of the publication of a 2018 op-ed in which his ex-wife, Amber Heard, wrote that she had been a victim of domestic abuse but did not mention Depp by name. Johnny Depp and Jerry Bruckheimer on the set of 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides'. Peter Mountain/Disney Now, the producer tells EW that Depp is open to the possibility of reprising his iconic role. \"If he likes the way the part's written, I think he would do it,\" Bruckheimer says. \"It's all about what's on the page, as we all know.\" The last Pirates film was all the way back in 2017 with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, which Depp was a part of along with other returning cast members Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley. Discussions of a sixth film have been in play since at least 2019. Bruckheimer has previously clarified that a new Pirates film would be a reboot of the franchise, but that he would still like to see Jack Sparrow make an appearance. Sharon Osbourne reveals husband Ozzy was asked to audition for 'Pirates of the Caribbean' but she didn't let him Orlando Bloom reacts to Keira Knightley's struggle with 'Pirates' films \"It's a reboot, but if it was up to me, he would be in it,\" Bruckheimer said previously. \"I love him. He's a good friend. He's an amazing artist, and he's a unique look. He created Captain Jack. That was not on the page; that was him doing a little Pep\u00e9 Le Pew and Keith Richards. That was his interpretation of Jack Sparrow.\" Bruckheimer says it's still a matter of locking in a script that everyone is happy with. \"We are still working on a screenplay,\" he says. \"We want to make it. We just got to get the right screenplay. We haven't quite gotten there yet, but we're close.\" Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow in 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides'. Peter Mountain/Disney Craig Mazin (The Last of Us) was working with the franchise's original scribe, Ted Elliot, on the new film. But everything was put on hold during the 2023 dual Hollywood strikes. Bruckheimer said last year that Jeff Nathanson, who wrote Dead Men Tell No Tales, was working on a sixth film. \"I think he's cracked it,\" he said in May 2024 of Nathanson's script. \"He's got an amazing third act. We just gotta clean up the first and second, and then we'll get there. But he wrote a great, great third act.\" Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow in 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'. Peter Mountain/Disney Still, Depp's return would reflect a major change on both the part of Disney and the actor himself. Disney cut ties with him in 2018. During the highly publicized defamation trial between Depp and Heard in 2022, the actor said in court that he wouldn't come back, even if he was offered \"$300 million and a million alpacas,\" as Heard's lawyer put it. \"That is true,\" Depp responded. \"There was a deep and distinct sense of feeling betrayed by the people that I've worked hard for. People that I delivered a character to that they initially despised, but I stuck to my guns with the character, and it seemed to work.\" Since 2022, Depp has largely worked on independent projects outside of Hollywood.

      "text": "At a Glance:\nDoctor Who ended the eras of both Chris Chibnall as series showrunner and Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor in 2022 with \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d bringing to a close a three-season, three-special run.\nWhittaker\u2019s replacement is returning star David Tennant. He will play the official 14th incarnation of the Doctor under returning showrunner Russell T. Davies, who revived Doctor Who in 2005 and managed the series until 2009.\nTennant will appear in three specials in November 2023 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who on November 23.\nHe\u2019ll be joined by returning characters Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, who were played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins in season four of Doctor Who. Neil Patrick Harris will play a new villain, while Heartstopper\u2019s Yasmin Finney will play a character named Rose.\nTennant will be succeeded by Sex Education\u2019s Ncuti Gatwa as the 15th Doctor. His announcement in May 2022 makes him the first Black male actor to play the character on-screen.\nGatwa will star in Doctor Who\u2019s 14th season, set to air some time in 2024.\nMillie Gibson will co-star as the 15th Doctor\u2019s companion.\nGame of Thrones star Indira Varma will play a mysterious character known as \u201cthe Duchess.\u201d\nDoctor Who\u2019s beloved tradition of doing a Christmas Special\u2014no more New Year\u2019s Day Specials, in other words\u2014will return in 2023, with another confirmed for 2024.\nComedian Sooz Kempner will star in Doom\u2019s Day, a new transmedia Doctor Who campaign tied into the anniversary. She\u2019ll play Doom, the titular intergalactic assassin, who has found herself hunted by Death itself\u2014and must use a purloined vortex manipulator with a day\u2019s worth of time-jumping charge to find the Doctor and save herself.\nThis post was last updated 5/30/23.\nWhat\u2019s Been Going on in Doctor Who?\nThree Doctor Who specials aired out the last days of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s time as the Doctor in 2022. \u201cEve of the Daleks\u201d saw the Doctor and her companions Dan (introduced in the prior 13th season, known as Doctor Who: Flux) and Yaz facing the titular iconic monsters in a time loop paradox. \u201cLegend of the Sea Devils\u201d revived the classic \u201870s monsters for a new adventure, while \u201cPower of the Doctor\u201d saw the 13th Doctor face off against the Master in an adventure that ultimately saw her mortally wounded, returning her companions to contemporary Earth while she regenerated into a new body.\nWhy Is David Tennant the Doctor Again? Is David Tennant Playing the 10th Doctor?\nWhittaker regenerated not into previously announced new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but David Tennant, who played the official 10th incarnation of the Time Lord from Christmas 2005 to New Year\u2019s Day 2010, before reprising the role for Doctor Who\u2019s 50th anniversary special, \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d in 2013.\nWhile this marks his first return on-screen in the series since then, Tennant will not be playing the 10th Doctor, but the official 14th incarnation\u2014and the character will be aware that they are both using a familiar form and are a new entity. Aside from the fact that Tennant is arguably the most popular actor to take on the role, so bringing him back for the 60th anniversary makes sense, there\u2019s plenty of reasons Doctor Who can come up with as to why the Doctor\u2019s regenerative process decided to re-use an old identity, more of which you can read about here.\nWhen Will Doctor Who Return in 2023?\nDoctor Who will return for three special episodes in November 2023, set to air in celebration of the series\u2019 60th anniversary.\nWhat Is Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary Special About?\nAside from Tennant returning as the Doctor, he\u2019ll be joined by former companions Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins (the actor\u2019s last role prior to his passing in July 2022) in Doctor Who\u2019s fourth season. Donna exited the series as a regular character after an adventure lead to her needing to have her memory wiped by the 10th Doctor, forgetting her time alongside him lest her mind face grievous harm, so just how Donna will play into the the story remains to be seen.\nThe Doctor and Donna will face a mysterious new adversary, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and will be joined in the specials by Yasmin Finney as a new character named Rose. How Finney\u2019s Rose might connect to the other famous Rose of Doctor Who, Billie Piper\u2019s Rose Tyler, also remains to be seen.\nIs There a Trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary?\nThe first premiered at the end of \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d and you can watch it above. The second premiered in December and you can watch it here:\nWhen Will Ncuti Gatwa Become the Doctor?\nGatwa is briefly seen in the trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th anniversary, so will presumably follow the long tradition of new Doctors appearing in the final moments of their predecessor\u2019s last episodes to become the 15th Doctor. The BBC has announced that Gatwa will appear as the Doctor first \u201cover the festive season\u201d in 2023, before he takes over full-time in a new season of the show after that.\nIs There a Doctor Who Season 14 Release Date?\nThere\u2019s no current release date for season 14 of Doctor Who, but it is expected to be broadcast some time in 2024.\nWhere Is Doctor Who Streaming in the U.S. and UK?\nCurrently, the first 13 seasons of the revived Doctor Who are streaming on the BBC iPlayer in the UK; in the U.S., the revived series streams exclusively on HBO Max. In both countries, episodes from the classic era of the show are available through Britbox.\nThis will change in 2023, at least in the U.S. The BBC and Disney have announced that as part of a new deal, Doctor Who will stream exclusively worldwide on Disney+, except for in the UK and Ireland, where it will still stream on the BBC iPlayer and BBC One. It\u2019s currently unknown if this will affect Doctor Who\u2019s place on BBC America, where it currently airs in the U.S..\nDoes Disney Co-Own Doctor Who Now?\nA report in the wake of the BBC/Disney announcement from British paper the Telegraph alleged that the deal will also see Disney contribute finances to help create the show, and while the series\u2019 creative team will still hold control of the series primarily, the deal will allow Disney some level of say in the creative decisions for the series\u2014as well as allowing access to talent or \u201ccinematic production moments\u201d previously inaccessible due to the BBC\u2019s budget for the show.\nNone of this has been confirmed by the BBC, however. The announcement strictly focused on Disney\u2019s acquisition of Doctor Who\u2019s streaming rights, and did not mention any co-owning. The new era of the series will be made for the BBC by Bad Wolf Studios, created by former Doctor Who producer Julie Gardner and former BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter\u2014which is now owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the studio took a majority stake in Bad Wolf in December 2021. The series was previously made by BBC Studios directly.\nIn January, Davies did say that Doctor Who is now working with a bigger budget, telling GQ that Disney\u2019s involvement came about as part of \u201cthe BBC\u2019s notion to go for a streamer to invest in the show worldwide \u2026 We\u2019re not on the budget level with Star Wars and the Marvel shows, [but] it\u2019s better than it was \u2026 We\u2019re not allowed to talk about budget\u2026 but it\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever had to work with.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "After six weeks of tabloid headlines, the seven-person jury in the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard defamation case reached a verdict on Wednesday. They ruled in favor of Depp, stating they believed that Heard should be held liable for her statements about his alleged abuse. The jury took almost 13 hours to come to the decision and awarded Depp $15 million total ($10 million compensatory, $5 million punitive). Heard received $2 million in her countersuit.\nOriginally, the case began as Depp, best known for roles in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, suing his ex-wife, Heard (best-known currently for her role in the DC Cinematic universe as Aquaman\u2019s Mera, the co-ruler of Atlantis) for $50 million over an op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post. In the post, Heard claimed to be \u201ca public figure representing domestic abuse,\u201d which Depp believed defamed him as an abuser. Heard then counter-sued for $100 million, claiming Depp\u2019s denial of her abuse charges defamed her back.\nOver the course of six weeks, the actors, their lawyers, and a roster of Hollywood talent have been battling back and forth about the charges and allegations. And, we\u2019re covering it here now because the case brought to light allegations and rumors that Depp believes he lost franchise roles in Fantastic Beasts and impacted the future of the Pirates of the Caribbean films due to the situation, while Heard claims it impacted her role in the upcoming sequel, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Fans of Depp have engaged in long-running campaigns to target Heard\u2019s role in the upcoming sequel\u2014leading to Aquaman co-star Jason Momoa to defend keeping Heard\u2019s presence in the sequel, according to statements given under testimony during the trial.\nThere\u2019s also a huge throughline of toxic fandom with the case. Fans of both Depp and Heard have been hugely vocal online in support of the actors, turning the trial proceedings into a playground for a bizarre subgenre of culture reaction videos, memes, and swaths of abuse from fans, particularly directed towards Heard. It comes at a time when these kinds of vociferous fandom reactions are once again having a distressing reactionary moment, with the Depp/Heard trial concluding just as racist fans attacking Obi-Wan Kenobi star Moses Ingram have been met with defiant reaction from her co-workers and Lucasfilm in defense.\nOne has to wonder though, now that the court has ruled in favor of Depp, will the chaos end? Will both sides be okay with the court\u2019s decision or will things be escalated again? Can, or should, either actor get back to their previous fame or is it now more infamy? Either way, it\u2019s rare that the public gets to see such a sad, terrible situation play out in the public eye and now it\u2019s come to a conclusion.\nUpdate, June 1 at 4 p.m.: Heard posted the following statement on Twitter. Depp then followed; his statement is below.\nhttps://twitter.com/embed/status/1532083776741842945\nAs reported by Variety, here is Depp\u2019s statement:\n\u201cSix years ago, my life, the life of my children, the lives of those closest to me, and also, the lives of the people who for many, many years have supported and believed in me were forever changed.\nAll in the blink of an eye.\nFalse, very serious and criminal allegations were levied at me via the media, which triggered an endless barrage of hateful content, although no charges were ever brought against me. It had already traveled around the world twice within a nanosecond and it had a seismic impact on my life and my career.\nAnd six years later, the jury gave me my life back. I am truly humbled.\nMy decision to pursue this case, knowing very well the height of the legal hurdles that I would be facing and the inevitable, worldwide spectacle into my life, was only made after considerable thought.\nFrom the very beginning, the goal of bringing this case was to reveal the truth, regardless of the outcome. Speaking the truth was something that I owed to my children and to all those who have remained steadfast in their support of me. I feel at peace knowing I have finally accomplished that.\nI am, and have been, overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and the colossal support and kindness from around the world. I hope that my quest to have the truth be told will have helped others, men or women, who have found themselves in my situation, and that those supporting them never give up. I also hope that the position will now return to innocent until proven guilty, both within the courts and in the media.\nI wish to acknowledge the noble work of the Judge, the jurors, the court staff and the Sheriffs who have sacrificed their own time to get to this point, and to my diligent and unwavering legal team who did an extraordinary job in helping me to share the truth.\nThe best is yet to come and a new chapter has finally begun.\nVeritas numquam perit.\nTruth never perishes.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?

In December, we got a very, very brief tease of season two.\nEcho\nRelease date: November 29, 2023 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from the Hawkeye series will follow Echo, a deaf martial artist, as played by actress Alaqua Cox. Devery Jacobs (Reservation Dogs) co-stars. Echo officially began filming on May 24, according to a tweet by series creator Marion Dayre.

X-Men \u201897 is a revival of the classic \u201890s animated show, bringing back the same style, stories and yes, theme song, of the iconic series. (See more: X-Men \u201897 Looks Like a Nostalgic Blast From the Past)\nIronheart\nRelease date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nWith Tony Stark gone, the MCU needs a new super-genius inventor. Enter teenage prodigy Riri Williams (played by Dominique Thorne), who creates a brand new, ultra-advanced armored suit. Other cast members include Anthony Ramos (In the Heights) as the villain the Hood and Lyric Ross (This Is Us). Chinaka Hodge (TNT\u2019s Snowpiercer) is attached as the head writer, and Black Panther director Ryan Coogler is an executive producer alongside Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige and others. Manny Montana (Good Girls) has joined the cast of Marvel\u2019s Ironheart in an undisclosed role as well as Han Solo himself, Alden Ehrenreich.\nAgatha: Coven of Chaos\nRelease date: Winter 2024 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from WandaVision will star Kathryn Hahn as her fan-favorite character Agatha Harkness. Joe Locke (Heartstopper) and Aubrey Plaza (Hahn\u2019s Parks and Recreation co-star, among her other many credits) are also in the cast, as is Patti LuPone. (A second WandaVision spin-off, this one focusing on Paul Bettany\u2019s Vision, is also reportedly in the works.)\nCaptain America: Brave New World\nRelease date: August 26, 2024 (in Theaters)\nWe\u2019ve got a new Captain America, so it was inevitable that we\u2019d be getting a new Cap movie. Anthony Mackie will appear in the title role. Harrison Ford was announced to take over the role of General Thaddeus Ross and will make his debut in this release.\nDaredevil: Born Again\nRelease date: Spring 2024 (On Disney+)\nCharlie Cox and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio will return as Daredevil and Kingpin for an 18-episode Disney+ series. Jon Bernthal has signed on to reprise his role as the Punisher. Things remain uncertain for Foggy and Karen.\nThunderbolts\nRelease date: December 20, 2024 (In theaters)\nMarvel Studios is readying a movie based on the comic Thunderbolts and director Jake Schreier has been tapped to bring it to life. This film marks the end of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Steven Yeun (Nope) signed on for an undisclosed role\nBlade\nRelease date: February 14, 2025 (In theaters)\nDisney hasn\u2019t revealed much about this reboot of the franchise that features a badass vampire-hunter who is also a vampire, but we know that it stars two-time Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali, who also played Cornell \u201cCottonmouth\u201d Stokes in Netflix Marvel series Luke Cage. We also know Blade appeared (or at least his voice did) in the end credits of The Eternals. After losing director Bassam Tariq, who would have been the first U.S.-Pakistani person to helm a Marvel Studios film, Blade was put on pause, and its release date was shifted. But now it has a new director in place: Lovecraft Country\u2019s Yann Demange, as well as a writer in Michael Starrbury, so the September 2024 date looks ever more likely.\nDeadpool 3\nRelease date: May 3, 2024 (In Theaters)\nRyan Reynolds\u2019 \u201cmerc with the mouth\u201d is set to appear in Disney\u2019s first R-rated film following the company\u2019s completed acquisition of Fox assets. Oh, and did you happen to hear that Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine is also appearing in this one? Unless you are cut off from all social media, you no doubt caught that announcement.\nDeadpool 3 writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wenick spoke with Den of Geek about how Deadpool\u2019s move to the MCU will not affect the feel of the movie. Or, in Wernick\u2019s words: \u201cDeadpool\u2019s gonna be Deadpool.\u201d Reese also said that Disney has been more than willing to ensuring the franchise keeps its core identity. Shawn Levy (Free Guy) is directing.\nFantastic Four\nRelease date: May 2, 2025 (In theaters)\nPhase Six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, kicks off with the MCU debut of Marvel\u2019s most famous family. Jon Watts was scheduled to directbut he is no longer doing that\u2014Matt Shakaman of WandaVision is now in the chair\u2014and though we saw John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, there\u2019s no guarantee he returns.\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty\nRelease date: May 1, 2026 (In theaters)\nSince neither Phase Four or Phase Five ended with Avengers movies, Phase Six will end with two, back to back. The first is The Kang Dynasty, a title which heavily suggests that Kang (Jonathan Majors) will play a major role. Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi) will direct.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease date: May 7, 2027 (In theaters)\nIt all comes down to this. Phase Six, and the whole Phase 4-6 arc of the Multiverse Saga, ends with Secret Wars. We don\u2019t know anything about the plot other than the comics that the title is based on; Marvel veteran Michael Waldron (Loki, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) is writing the script.\nArmor Wars\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nThis project\u2014originally slated for a Disney+ series, but now getting the feature film treatment\u2014will follow James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as he tracks down stolen tech that allows criminals to replicate Iron Man technology.\nAlso: Marvel slotted several other projects for Phase Six that take place alongside Fantastic Four and the Avengers films. There are two in fall 2024, two in winter 2024, one in winter 2025, two in spring 2025 and two in summer 2025. Some of those are probably\u2026\nUnscheduled But Probably Still Happening Shows & Movies\nMoon Knight Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMoon Knight himself, Oscar Isaac, was recently spotted in Egypt and teased that a second season of his show could be on the way. Marvel and Disney have yet to confirm.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThis new animated show is loosely spun out from a breakout episode of What If? that saw MCU heroes battling a zombie apocalypse.\nSpider-Man: Freshman Year\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nDisney says this new animated series follows Peter Parker \u201con his way to becoming Spider-Man in the MCU, with a journey unlike we\u2019ve ever seen and a style that celebrates the character\u2019s early comic book roots.\u201d\nWhat if\u2026? Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThe speculative animated series and its omnipresent narrator the Watcher will return with an all-new season. The show\u2019s creators say next season will focus on new stories, new heroes, and \u201clots of fun.\u201d Though the trailer still hasn\u2019t been released, the Marvel Animation Panel at San Diego Comic Con revealed some Phase 4 characters that will be in the show.\nUntitled Wakanda Series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nNot much is known yet about this show set in Black Panther\u2019s home country.\nUntitled Shang-Chi sequel\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nShang-Chi\u2019s debut movie was compelling, exciting and fun. It also made a ton of money, so a sequel is inevitable. That the film\u2019s director is making Avengers: The Kang Dynasty does throw it into limbo a bit.\nUntitled Wonder Man series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMarvel Studios has announced that it\u2019s moving ahead with a Wonder Man series. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton is attached to helm and Brooklyn 99 writer Andrew Guest (who also produced Hawkeye) is on board to showrun the series. On October 31, the title star was announced: genre favorite Yayha Abdul-Mateen II.\nUntitled mutants movie\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nNow that Disney owns the old Fox assets that included all the \u201cmutant\u201d Marvel superheroes, you can very likely count on characters like the X-Men making an MCU debut.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "The DC Extended Universe is finally giving Marvel a run for its money\u2014something that\u2019s bound to increase now that James Gunn is running the show. The DCEU\u2019s myriad projects stretch far beyond superhero mainstays Batman, Superman, and the Justice League, promising to include new and interesting takes on DC Comics\u2019 enormous stable of characters.\nWhat follows is an up-to-date list of everything DCEU-related that\u2019s on the way: DC movies heading to theaters, as well as DC streaming movies and shows coming to Max.\nLast updated 8/23/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next DC Movie?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\nRelease date: December 20 (in theaters)\nDirector James Wan returns for the next adventure following Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as the newly crowned King of Atlantis. Now in his new role, Arthur will explore more of the world under the sea while also dealing with new threats from Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and others. Like Shazam 2, Aquaman 2 has endured its share of release-date changes, with its new Christmas 2023 date designed to give Wan and company ample time to complete all the necessary special effects.\nUpcoming DC Movie Release Dates\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\nRelease date: October 4, 2024 (in theaters)\nTodd Phillips never saw his Joker movie as anything but a singular film. But over a billion dollars at the box office and an Oscar for Best Actor (for star Joaquin Phoenix) obviously changed things. We have a few nuggets of info so far: the title is Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux(French for \u201cshared madness\u201d), Phoenix is returning and will co-star with Lady Gaga (who\u2019s playing Harley Quinn), Zazie Beetz is probably returning as Arthur Fleck\u2019s neighbor, and\u2026 it\u2019s likely going to be a musical? Filming wrapped in early April 2023.\nThe Batman 2\nRelease date: 2025 (in theaters)\nHot off the success of Matt Reeves\u2019 long-awaitedThe Batman, everyone involved made it clear that wasn\u2019t a one-and-done. Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman will be back. Will he face off with the Joker? It\u2019s possible but not definitive. You\u2019d imagine the Penguin and Catwoman could be back too. We don\u2019t know much yet about this one, but we do know it won\u2019t be arriving until 2025.\nCurrent DC Shows\nDoom Patrol Season 4, Part 2\nRelease date: TBD 2023 (on Max)\nThe fourth and final season of Doom Patrol\u2014starring Brendan Fraser, Matt Bomer, Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Joivan Wade, Timothy Dalton, Skye Roberts, and Michelle Gomez\u2014already aired its first batch of episodes; the remaining six will return later this year.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows Without Release Dates\nThe Penguin\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nYou saw him in The Batman and now, Colin Farrell\u2019s Penguin is getting his own Max series. As of April 2023, the show is in production, with a cast that also includes Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Michael Kelly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Deirdre O\u2019Connell, with Clancy Brown and Michael Zegen recurring.\nPeacemaker Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nFrom the instant that opening credits scene rolled for the first time, DC fans and non-fans alike fell in love with Peacemaker. Well, he\u2019s coming back, still played by John Cena and still from the twisted mind of James Gunn. There\u2019s no word on when it\u2019ll happen but we\u2019re guessing 2024.\nSuperman: Legacy\nRelease date: July 11, 2025\nJames Gunn will write and direct this Superman movie, which is touted as not being an origin story. Casting announcements started with Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, who\u2019ll be played by David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan. We also know Isabela Merced will play Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi is Mister Terrific, and Nathan Fillion is a Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), as well as Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho.\nMore Upcoming DC Movies and Shows Announced for the Gunn/Safran Era\nThe shake-up at DC Studios got a huge zap of energy at the end of January, when James Gunn and Peter Safran announced their massive slate of planned projects. Little is known about most of these projects so far in terms of cast and crew and even release dates\u2014but we do have a few tidbits for each.\nCreature Commandos (An animated Max show) \u2013 A seven-episode animated series written by James Gunn himself. It stars Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Game of Thrones) as the Bride, who\u2019s the lead character, and Marvel veteran Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr.\u2014father of Rick Flagg, played by Joel Kinnaman in The Suicide Squad. The rest of the cast includes David Harbour (Stranger Things) as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as G.I. Robot, Zoe Chao (The Afterparty) as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk (Star Wars: Rogue One) as Dr. Phosphorus, Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as new character Princess Ilana Rostovic, and Peacemaker\u2019s Steve Agee and Sean Gunn returning as John Economos and Weasel, respectively.\nWaller (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Viola Davis will reprise her Suicide Squad character; the story will bring back characters from the Peacemaker show and tell a story with events set between Peacemaker seasons one and two.\nLanterns (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Set on Earth, this mystery series will follow Hal Jordan and John Stewart doing their thing as DC\u2019s \u201csuper cops.\u201d\nThe Authority (Theatrical film) \u2013 The Wildstorm superhero characters will make their big-screen debut in a film co-written by Gunn.\nParadise Lost (A live-action Max show) \u2013 How did Wonder Woman\u2019s world, Themyscira, come to be? Find out in this Game of Thrones-ish tale set before her birth.\nThe Brave and the Bold (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on the acclaimed Grant Morrison comic run, this will explore the story of Batman\u2019s son, Damien Wayne, and will feature \u201cother members of the extended Bat-family.\u201d\nBooster Gold (A live-action Max show) \u2013 The \u201closer from the future\u201d superhero character gets his own series.\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on Tom King\u2019s comics run, this movie will explore how Supergirl is different from Superman. It\u2019s not yet certain if Sasha Calle, who plays Supergirl in The Flash, will reprise the role here.\nSwamp Thing (Theatrical film) \u2013 The character\u2019s \u201cdark origins\u201d will be the focus of this one. DC does horror! Rumored but not yet confirmed to be directing, James Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) told Collider that he\u2019s slated to write the script.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows That Were Once in Development, But Whose Fate Is Unclear in the Gunn/Safran Era\nTa-Nehisi Coates and J.J. Abrams\u2019 Superman movie\nRelease date: Unknown (in theaters)\nThe news of Superman: Legacy cast uncertainty on this project from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and producer J.J. Abrams. There hadn\u2019t been an update on this one in a while, but in late April, James Gunn himself told io9 that the two films don\u2019t necessarily cancel each other out: \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting movie \u2026 if it comes in and it\u2019s great \u2026 and if the timing is right, that could absolutely happen. That\u2019s totally unrelated. It would be an Elseworlds tale like Joker.\u201d\nMichael B. Jordan Superman Series\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nMichael B. Jordan was once developing a Superman take for Max as a limited series that would feature Val-Zod as opposed to Clark Kent. Again, there hasn\u2019t been an update in a while.\nStatic Shock\nRelease date: Unknown\nPart of the relaunch of the Milestone comic brand is this adaptation produced by, once again, Michael B. Jordan. A writer was hired back in 2021 to come up with a script and we haven\u2019t heard much since.\nJustice League Dark\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nJ.J. Abrams was among the people involved with bringing this evil super-team to life and while there hasn\u2019t been a ton of movement on the project of late, it\u2019s been around long enough that we\u2019d imagine it happens eventually.\nMetal Men\nRelease date: Unknown\nOne of the more recent pre-Gunn/Safran DC films to go into development, this is this tale of six beings based on various powerful metals. It\u2019s from directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Moana), so if it happens, it\u2019ll have an incredible pedigree.\nZatanna\nRelease date: Unknown\nLast year, Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for writing Promising Young Woman. She followed that up landing the job to write this DC superhero flick about the young magician. Like most of the films in this section, there hasn\u2019t been movement in a while.\nHourman\nRelease date: Unknown\nYes, the hero who takes a drug that makes him a hero for an hour was, back in 2021, rumored to be in development. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case is unknown but we figured it was worth noting.\nUntitled Arkham Show\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nIn addition to The Penguin, Matt Reeves has said he plans to expand the world of The Batman into Max shows. At one point, a series about Gotham PD was in the works, but now he says it might be more about the inner workings at Arkham Asylum. On October 25, The Staircase\u2019s Antonio Campos came aboard as a writer\u2014the third to hold that position on the potential series so far\u2014and may direct and serve as showrunner if the show happens, according to a report in Variety.\nWant more io9 news?

Robbie was set to star and Hodson was taking up the pen for the female-led installment. While the Hollywood Reporter said that Jerry Bruckheimer, the longtime Pirates producer, was attached to the project, it now seems like the feature film has been set adrift.\nIn a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Robbie admitted that she didn\u2019t know what happened with that film. \u201cWe had an idea and we were developing it for a while, ages ago, to have more of a female-led\u2014not totally female-led, but just a different kind of story\u2014which we thought would\u2019ve been really cool, but I guess [Disney didn\u2019t] want to do it.\u201d\nDamn Disney, what the hell? You think you\u2019re too good for Margot Robbie and Christina Hodson?? Despicable behavior, frankly. After all the kerfuffle around Keira Knightley\u2019s character reigning as King of the Pirates, the absolute destruction she caused during the entire series (which was a sexual awakening for many a wee queer WLW), you would deny the queer community another badass lady pirate?\nYou know what, Disney, you don\u2019t deserve a Margot Robbie-led Pirates of the Caribbean film.

We\u2019ve got you covered on all things in a galaxy far, far away.\nThis post was last updated on 9/13/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next Star Wars movie?\nSharmeen Obaid-Chioy\u2019s New Jedi Order Film Film\nRelease Date: TBD, but May 26, 2026, December 18, 2026 or December 17, 2027 (In Theaters)\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023 in London, Lucasfilm announced that three Star Wars movies are now in the works.\nJames Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) will direct a film 25,000 years before any known Star Wars timeline about the first Jedi to use the Force.\nDave Filoni will direct a film that\u2019s kind of the Star Wars Disney+ Avengers, telling the story of a climactic event meeting the stories of The Book of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian, Ahsoka and more in the time between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.\nAnd Sharmeen Obaid-Chioy will direct a film set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker following Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she creates a New Jedi Order.\nThis last one, we think, is the film that Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers, Watchmen) was co-writingwith Justin Britt-Gibson before departing the project. Steven Knight is now reportedly writing.\nA week after the news of these films first broke, it began to seem like the Rey project by Obaid-Chioy could be the first one out of the gate. However, in June, Disney shuffled its release schedule and moved its December 2025 Star Wars movie to May 2026, and added a third Star Wars movie to the schedule in December 2026. So maybe these three movies are on those dates. We\u2019ll see.\nUpcoming Star Wars release dates\nThese shows and movies have all been officially announced and are in various stages of production, even if we don\u2019t know when they will definitely come out.\nStar Wars: Ahsoka\nRelease Date: Now Playing (On Disney+)\nThe first full live-action Ahsoka Tano show from co-creator Dave Filoni is finally here. Rosario Dawson is, of course, returning. And our first look at footage confirmed that actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo has been cast as Sabine Wren; more recently, Eman Esfandi was confirmed as Ezra Bridger. At Star Wars Celebration this year we learned Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing Hera Syndulla, Lars Mikkelsenis playing Grand Admiral Thrawn and Wes Chatham is his right-hand man.\nWhat does that all mean? Well, in the first teaser trailer, you can see she\u2019ll make good onthe Star Wars Rebels finale and go after Thrawn. And what about the fact she knows Luke Skywalker now? And how does Ray Stevenson\u2019s lightsaber-wielding character fit in?\nThe show is now airing on Disney+ and here you can read our weekly recaps:\nEpisode 1, \u201cMaster and Apprentice: and Episode 2, \u201cToil and Trouble\u201d\nEpisode 6, premiering September 19\nEpisode 7, premiering September 26\nEpisode 7, premiering October 3\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\nRelease Date: 2023 (On Disney+)\nCreated by Spider-Man Homecoming/Far From Home/No Way Home director Jon Watts along with writer Chris Ford, this mystery Star Wars show is now currently in development. The title for the show was released during the Star Wars Celebration, and was previously internally referred as \u201cGrammar Radio.\u201d Celebration also revealed its headlining star, Jude Law.\nSet after the events of Return of the Jedi, Skeleton Crew is described as an adventure in the mold of Amblin adventures of the 1980s. The show will be about seeing the galaxy through the eyes of children (but it is not a kids show), and will follow a group of children who get lost in the galaxy and try to find their way home. Jon Watts explained that the series will take place during the same time period as the upcoming Ahsoka series and The Mandalorian.\nFilming on the series began in 2022 and ended in early 2023. And though not much is know about what happens on the show,it has been revealed that The Daniels, the Oscar-winning directors of Everything Everywhere All At Once, directed an episode. Ditto David Lowery, who did the film The Green Knight. Read more about the show here.\nio9 saw the first footage at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and you can read about it here. Three of the main stars of the show are played by Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, and Robert Timothy Smit. Rumors suggest it could debut in November or December 2023.\nStar Wars: The Acolyte\nRelease Date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nRussian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland will be the first person to bring the excellent High Republic timeline into live-action with this show, long rumored to star Amandla Stenberg before an actual confirmation finally arrived at San Diego Comic-Con 2022\u2014one of few Star Wars bits of news to emerge from the convention.\nIn an interview in 2022, Headland revealed the show would be about 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. \u201cA lot of those characters haven\u2019t even been born yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at the political and personal and spiritual things that came up in a time period that we don\u2019t know much about. My question when watching The Phantom Menace was always like, \u2018Well, how did things get to this point?\u2019 How did we get to a point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it? Like, what went wrong? What are the scenarios that led us to this moment?\u201d\nIn an interview released later, Headland spoke about her goals for the series. For Headland, above all else The Acolyte is a mystery, and that mystery is figuring out what is going on in this peak period. It was also suggested that The Acolyte will bring more elements from the Expanded Universe to canon, but what parts that will be incorporated will remain to be seen.\nIn September 2022, both Jodie Turner-Smith and Squid Game\u2019s Emmy-winning Lee Jung-Jae joined the cast, with an official announcement in November adding Carrie-Anne Moss, Manny Jacinto, and others to the roster. The first image, which you see above, was released in November and you can read about the first footage here, which was shown at Star Wars Celebration 2023.\nAnd no, despite what bullcrap rumors you may have been reading online, the show has not been canceled.\nAndor: Season 2\nRelease Date: August 2024 (On Disney+)\nSeason one of Tony Gilroy\u2019s Rogue One prequel starring Diego Luna showed an excitingly different side of Star Wars. Season two will reportedly be spread across the four years leading up to Rogue One, with four episodes covering each year in Cassian Andor\u2019s life until that fateful point. Filming began in late 2022.\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023, Gilroy announced the show should be out in August 2024 and showed fans the first footage from the season. Read about it here. Plus, the final episodes of the season/series will take place just days before Rogue One, leading right into that story.\nOne minor hiccup though, due to the Writer\u2019s Guild strike, showrunner and head writer Tony Gilroy left his duties show in May 2023. He\u2019s unlikely to return until the Writer\u2019s Strike is over, which could cause a delay.\nStar Wars: A Droid Story\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nLucasfilm Animation is teaming up with Industrial Light and Magic for this streaming show that will \u201cintroduce us to a new hero, guided by legendary duo R2-D2 and C-3PO.\u201d We don\u2019t know anything beyond that and there hasn\u2019t been a significant update in years, which could be a good thing or bad thing.\nStar Wars: Lando\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nWay back in December 2020, Disney announced a bunch of Star Wars TV shows. Among them was a Lando show which, at the time, was going to be made by Dear White People creator Justin Simien. After that, things went quiet for about three years. Then,in an April 2023 article, Donald Glover hinted that he\u2019s still interested and it\u2019s still possible in the works. A May 2023 interview with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed it\u2019s still in the works.\nThe first significant update in almost three years came in July when news broke that Simien has been off the project since he started working on Haunted Mansion, and not only is Donald Glover going to star in the series, he\u2019s co-writing it with his brother Stephen.\nUntitled Taika Waititi Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nIn May 2020, news broke that Oscar-winning director of Thor: Ragnarok would be helming and co-writing along with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \u201cTaika\u2019s approach to Star Wars will be fresh, unexpected, and \u2026 unique,\u201d Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said. \u201cHis enormous talent and sense of humor will ensure that audiences are in for an unforgettable ride.\u201d\nThere was a time when this was likely to be the next Star Wars film but, after Star Wars Celebration 2023, it seems like it\u2019s now on the back burner. That was confirmed by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy who said the Oscar-winner is still working on the film, it\u2019s just going slowly.\nIn the past, Waititi has discussed some broad ideas of what he wants to do with his upcoming film. Read those below.\nTaika Waititi Doesn\u2019t Want Star Wars to Rely on Legacies\nAre You as Confused About Taika Waititi\u2019s Star WarsMovie as We Are?\nUntitled Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nWe mentioned this one above but, at some point, Dave Filoni will be directing a film that is meant to be a climactic event wrapping up stories that have begun on shows he\u2019s involved with such as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew and others.\nUntitled James Mangold Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nThis was one of the three films announced at Star Wars Celebration but, like Filoni\u2019s, isn\u2019t likely to be next. This one is set 25,000 years before the original trilogy and tells the story of the first person to use the Force.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about, I want to be part of the saga, but I also don\u2019t want to be holding so much lore in the air that you can hardly tell a story,\u201d Mangold told io9 when asked about this film. \u201cAnd what I really wanted to do\u2026was just can we make a kind of the Ten Commandments of the Force, you know? A kind of origin story of how the Force came to be known, understood, wielded, and harnessed.\u201d We love this idea so much we even wrote about it.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Haven\u2019t Been Officially Announced, But We Think Are Still Happening\nThe Mandalorian Season 4\nRelease Date: TBD\nWith The Mandalorian Season 3 now in the books, all eyes look ahead to season 4. However, the season has not yet been officially announced. Unofficially though, series creator Jon Favreau said he\u2019s already written a fourth season which he probably wouldn\u2019t have done just for fun. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s just a matter of when, especially with writers and actors on strike.\nThe Book of Boba Fett Season 2\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nThe Book of Boba Fett season one ended with the implication that we\u2019d see more of these character in the future. But alas, there has been no official announcement\u2026 yet. Dive into the making-of season one while we wait and ponder the words of executive producer Robert Rodriguez who said he knows when the character is coming back, but he can\u2019t say when.\nUntitled Shawn Levy Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nShawn Levy, the prolific director and producer behind Stranger Things, Night at the Museum, and Free Guy is gearing up to develop a film in a galaxy far far away. He\u2019ll focus on that after completing Deadpool 3, which stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Probably NOT Going To Happen\nStar Wars: Rangers of the New Republic\nOriginally announced alongside shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka, and Andor, Rangers of the New Republic was rumored to be Cara Dune\u2019s show which would tie into The Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. However, with actress Gina Carano no longer a part of Star Wars, word on the street is this will no longer be happening. Nothing is official though.\nUntitled Rian Johnson Trilogy\nLet\u2019s be honest. Do we think this is happening anymore? Probably not. Rian Johnson has moved on to other things. But, until we hear otherwise (and no one is officially saying), we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention that before the divisive release of The Last Jedi, Lucasfilm officially said Johnson would make his very own trilogy. It hasn\u2019t officially been canceled yet but, in a new interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy suggested that it\u2019s been placed on the back burner as Johnson does other things. With Johnson\u2019s next film, Glass Onion, set for release in late 2022 though, he\u2019s been quoted saying he still hopes these movies happen. So do we.\nStar Wars: Rogue Squadron\nFor several years, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins\u2019 film about pilots in the Star Wars universe has been earmarked as the next film. Well, that\u2019s no longer the case. After months of rumors suggesting it might move off its 2023 release date, Disney officially took it off the schedule. On December 13 2022, Jenkins said the movie is still in \u201cactive development\u201d but recent news suggests it\u2019s dead. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy disagrees, saying in May 2023 it\u2019s still on the books.\nUntitled Kevin Feige Movie\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige is best known for helping create the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as much as he loves Marvel, he loves Star Wars even more. And so it was exciting to hear that he was producing a Star Wars movie and even recruited Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron to help him. Feige doesn\u2019t like to even acknowledge this project though and in a 2022 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy also tiptoed around the project\u2019s existence. Then, a few weeks before Star Wars Celebration 2023, we learned the project is likely dead.\nFor more, check out io9\u2019s list of every canceled (or re-worked) Disney Star Wars project.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Say \u201cpirate movie\u201d today and the immediate association is the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Some of those films are terrible, but they all made tons of money. Not so long ago, though, a pirate movie went down in history as one of the biggest flops of all time: Cutthroat Island. How bad is it really, though?\nFirst, a bit of context. Even before its release in December 1995, Cutthroat Island was surfing a huge wave of bad publicity. After multiple script rewrites left him unhappy with his character, male lead Michael Douglas dropped out and\u2014after a wide and frantic search failed to snag another A-lister\u2014was replaced by the much lesser-known Matthew Modine. This 1995 Los Angeles Times article gives way more detail on how and why that happened; it features an unapologetic interview with Cutthroat Island director Renny Harlin, who was married to the movie\u2019s other star, Geena Davis, at the time.\nThe massive production, which spanned multiple countries and required elaborate sets (like giant water tanks), ran way over budget\u2014and the studio that bankrolled it, Carolco Pictures, realized too late that Cutthroat Island wouldn\u2019t save the once-thriving but now debt-ridden company. Instead, it would hasten its demise. This is all useful background when considering Cutthroat Island\u2019s designation as one of the biggest bombs in Hollywood history; in 1995, it made around $10 million, just a tiny fraction of its $98 million budget. (Want even more dirt on the financial factors and other snafus, including literal gallons of raw sewage, that conspired against the film? Read this 1996 New York Times tell-all, delightfully headlined \u201cDebacle on the High Seas.\u201d)\nTwenty-three years later, it\u2019s a little easier to shove all that baggage aside and consider the movie on its own. You\u2019re flipping through titles, looking for something to watch to pass the time, and Cutthroat Island pops up. Geena Davis as a lusty, rum-chugging, sword-swinging pirate captain? Sounds promising, doesn\u2019t it? All it wants is to be an old-fashioned swashbuckler with a little comedy and romance thrown in, with the added novelty of having a tough female pirate\u2014Morgan Adams, played by Davis\u2014at the center of its adventure. And, honestly, despite some rough edges here and there, it mostly succeeds.\nThough the story and screenplay have six credited writers, Cutthroat Island doesn\u2019t break too much new ground. (That committee of scribes did manage to come up with some very corny dialogue, however.) The main plot is a race to capture buried treasure, with revenge and assorted double-crosses folded in along the way. There\u2019s also a budding flirtation between Morgan and a con man named Shaw (Modine, whose take on the role is a bit goofier than Douglas\u2019 probably would have been), as well as twin villains in Dawg Brown (Frank Langella), a pirate so cartoonishly evil his ship is named the Reaper, and the corrupt, bewigged British governor of Jamaica (Patrick Malahide, who went on to play Game of Thrones\u2019 Balon Greyjoy). Also, there\u2019s a teeny trained monkey named King Charles.\nIn that Los Angeles Times article mentioned above, the head of marketing for MGM\u2014which distributed the film, even though Carolco made it\u2014optimistically points out that \u201cevery penny spent is up there\u201d on the screen. And he\u2019s not wrong. Cutthroat Island runs just over two hours, and a huge chunk of that time is given over to elaborate action sequences that go on and on, as when wanted criminal Morgan is spotted in Jamaica (not a shocker, considering her \u201cposh gentlewoman\u201d disguise is hilariously conspicuous) and escapes only after an epic horse-and-carriage chase that ends with cannons obliterating the town\u2019s waterfront.\nIn her 1995 review of the film, New York Times critic Janet Maslin opined that \u201cThe only serious incentive for seeing this spectacle is a fascination with extravagance, since Cutthroat Island is indeed scenic, hectic, and big.\u201d Maslin wasn\u2019t a fan of the movie, but that extravagance she mentions is actually even more fascinating in 2018\u2014because the film was made without the benefit of today\u2019s sophisticated digital effects. Those explosions that Harlin is so fond of? Presumably, that\u2019s real fire up there on the screen; whatever it is, it\u2019s definitely more scorching than the blah chemistry between Davis and Modine.\nFor my money, that\u2019s the weakest part of the film; Davis is badass as Morgan, and Modine is adequately rakish as Shaw. But there are zero sparks between them, and you have to wonder why the writers didn\u2019t just reshape the Shaw character entirely once Douglas quit and took the movie\u2019s original aspirations of being a pirate-themed spin on Romancing the Stone with him. Why not just let Morgan, backed by her small gang of loyal men, go about her treasure-hunting without any romantic entanglements? Why not go even further and add a few more substantial roles for other women into the story?\nObviously, in 1995 that would be crazy talk, so that\u2019s not what happened. (It goes without saying that all of the movie\u2019s credited writers were men.) One of the kindest contemporary reviews of the film came from Roger Ebert, who praised Cutthroat Island\u2019s technical accomplishments but was otherwise somewhere between neutral and dismissive: \u201cThis is, in short, a satisfactory movie\u2014but it doesn\u2019t transcend its genre, and it\u2019s not surprising or astonishing.\u201d\nThat may be so, but Cutthroat Island still manages to be entertaining in spite of everything, and that includes its overlong running time. It\u2019s about pirates! There are sword fights! And cannons! And treasure chests full of gold doubloons! A swaggering Geena Davis is delightful, and Frank Langella\u2014the only person in the cast who seems to be winking at the camera\u2014is clearly having a good time with his oversized character, despite whatever chaos was going on behind the scenes. And did I mention the trained monkey? If you didn\u2019t know the whole backstory, you\u2019d never, ever guess that this bombastic, eager-to-please pirate adventure was a financial disaster that became a show-biz punch line. It\u2019s definitely worth a re-watch, matey."

      "text": "Like the ocean it takes place on, the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has had plenty of ups and downs. These metaphorical seas have been so rough, in fact, that some people don\u2019t even remember there was a fourth film in 2011, On Stranger Tides, even though it grossed a billion dollars worldwide. I\u2019m happy to say the fifth film, Dead Men Tell No Tales, is probably the best film in the franchise since the very first movie\u2026 even though that\u2019s not a particularly high bar.\nThe main reason things work is that directors Joachim R\u00f8nning and Espen Sandberg take the franchise back to basics. It recaptures much of what we all loved about this franchise way back in 2003: the swashbuckling action, humor, romance, and that amazing orchestral theme. It also helps that while some of the previous films have pushed three hours in length, Dead Men Tell No Tales is barely over two. It tells a much simpler story with a strong emotional core, complete with a dastardly, scary villain. The biggest problem is, despite Dead Men Tell No Tales being so streamlined, it often ends up feeling like it\u2019s still padding its story out.\nThings start well enough. A young boy named Henry is hellbent on saving his father Will Turner, Orlando Bloom\u2019s character, who was dammed to the sea a few films back. Henry swears he\u2019ll do whatever it takes to save his father from his curse. Later we\u2019ll meet Carina (Kaya Scodelario), who has similar desires. The child-questing-for-his/her-parents is a standard fantasy story, but it\u2019s an emotionally solid one, which is why it\u2019s so ubiquitous. It makes it easy to invest in both Henry and Carina, despite being all-new characters.\nNine years later after the prologue, Henry is grown up (played by Brenton Thwaites) and still on his quest. He believes the only thing that can break his father\u2019s curse is the mythic Trident of Poseidon and the one person who can help him find it is dad\u2019s old friend, Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp returns to what\u2019s come to be his signature character, and though he\u2019s still entertaining to watch, he never quite feels like he fits into Henry\u2019s story. He\u2019s still dumb old Jack, chasing money and women, with little to no sense of empathy.\nHenry is also driven toward Jack when he meets the evil ghost pirate Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), who\u2019s looking for Jack. Henry meets Carina, who is also after the Trident. There\u2019s even the reappearance of Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush), who also inserts himself into the story. All of these story beats work to keep the film moving, but also push the focus away from the emotional core of the film. More grievously, a lot of it feels much too coincidental.\nWhile all this may sound like there\u2019s a lot going on in Dead Men, there really isn\u2019t. The actual story remains simple: Everyone wants the Trident, and the bad guys also want Jack Sparrow. At times it feels like all of these characters and storylines are force-fed together to pad the runtime of the movie. So despite the abundance of characters, old and new, it feels like much of the film is just trying to kill some time.\nThat\u2019s the bad of the film, but there\u2019s still some good. Even though the story can feel muddled at times, the action, music, and elaborate filmmaking never cease, and they\u2019re worth their weight in pirate\u2019s gold.\nJack\u2019s introduction, for example, is one of the best set pieces in the entire series, period. I mean, it\u2019s a literal set piece, but I won\u2019t say more than that. There\u2019s an execution scene that is laugh-out-loud funny (seriously), super cool ghost sharks, the marvel that is Salazar\u2019s ship, and the fight scenes peppered throughout get increasingly more elaborate, leading into an eye-popping finale. And every time you need it, Hans Zimmer\u2019s iconic theme sweeps up on the soundtrack. (Zimmer didn\u2019t write the score for this one, Geoff Zanelli did, but Zimmer\u2019s theme is still there.)\nThere\u2019s an engaging flashback with a young Jack Sparrow, which explains both Salazar\u2019s hate for him and Jack\u2019s origin. Carina\u2019s passion for science sets up some telling exchanges. Plus, you can\u2019t have Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, and Geoffrey Rush on the screen in these crazy elaborate settings and not marvel at their talent. Bardem, in particular, is a very fun villain, and a worthy antagonist for the film.\nAs the film nears its conclusion, it manages to bring back its emotional core in ways that are both expected and not. There are some massive revelations that give a real weight to the proceedings and all of those extraneous plot threads weave back together for a very satisfying climax and conclusion.\nPut all of this together, the good and the bad, and you have the fifth PotC movie. I believe you\u2019ll leave the theater feeling more satisfied than not about Dead Men Tell No Tales. No, it isn\u2019t always smooth sailing, but the waters are a hell of a lot less choppy than in On Stranger Tides.\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales opens May 26."

Although Robbie said in an interview a few weeks ago that Disney \u201cwasn\u2019t interested\u201d in the script, Jerry Bruckheimer, the executive producer of all five Pirates of the Caribbean films, has told Collider that the film, which would be penned by Birds of Prey writer, Christina Hodson, is still on the manifest.\nBruckheimer said that he thinks that Hodson\u2019s script \u201cwill come forward at a certain point.

      "text": "Tidal waves of controversy are once again rising in the world of Aquaman 2 and it\u2019s not because of a war in Atlantis. A new report is filled with claims regarding Amber Heard\u2019s treatment on the set of the film, and it involves people such as star Jason Momoa, director James Wan, and Heard\u2019s former flame Elon Musk, though DC Films disputes many of the allegations.\nYou can read the whole article over on Variety, and you should, as it\u2019s both upsetting and fascinating. Most of the biggest claims come from the notes of Heard\u2019s therapist, Dr. Dawn Hughes. Notes from her sessions with Heard were part of the highly scrutinized Heard/Johnny Depp trial and (this is a sign of how weird this all is) were released to the public after Depp\u2019s fans paid for them.\nOne of the therapist\u2019s notes suggests that Momoa pushed for Heard to be fired, showed up on set drunk, and dressed as Depp to antagonize the actress. DC refuted that claim to the trade (\u201cJason Momoa conducted himself in a professional manner at all times on the set of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\u201d) while another source said \u201cHe isn\u2019t dressing like Johnny Depp. He has always dressed in that bohemian style.\u201d\nAnother note suggests that director James Wan yelled at Heard over his inability to post on social media about the film, presumably because it would create a firestorm from fans of both her and Depp. DC, again, refutes these claims. \u201cJames is known for treating members of his cast and crew with the utmost respect and for fostering a positive, collaborative environment on set\u2014the Aquaman films were no exception,\u201d a spokesperson told the trade.\nDuring the trial, then-DC head Walter Hamada actually testified and confirmed that there were talks of Heard being cut from the film. So that is actually real. However, in these new claims, it\u2019s suggested part of why that didn\u2019t happen is because Elon Musk threatened the studio with legal action if Heard wasn\u2019t asked back for the sequel, which she eventually was.\nAnd yet, in recent interviews, Wan said that while Heard\u2019s role as Mera is dialed back in the film, it was more a story choice than anything else. \u201cMera obviously is a massive character in the Aquaman world so we obviously want to be respectful to the character,\u201d Wan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the bottom line. I want to be respectful to all the characters and do everyone justice. But at the end of the day, I have this story to tell, but I [also] have so many other characters to serve, and I felt like I told the Arthur and Mera story in the first one so I can sort of focus on Arthur and Orm in this one. And so basically it\u2019s a journey movie really with those two and then the other characters sort of like pepper their world.\u201d\nFinally, the Variety article also claims none of the original Zack Snyder Justice League\u2014such as Momoa\u2019s Aquaman, Ezra Miller\u2019s Flash or Gal Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman\u2014will reprise those roles in future DC projects. And while that was confirmed for Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill, an io9 source questioned the accuracy of that statement.\nYup. It\u2019s a lot. And the controversy will only continue to bubble until the December 20 release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Read much more on Variety.\nWant more io9 news?
