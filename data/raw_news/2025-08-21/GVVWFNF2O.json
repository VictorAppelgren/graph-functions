  "title": "MIT Report Spooks AI Investors, Claims 95% of Businesses Don't See Boosted Profits",
  "description": "Using AI might lead to some improvements, but it hasn't led to a profit revolution.",
  "content": "AI might be the big buzzword that's driving hundreds of billions in global datacenter and chip fabrication development, but no one has quite figured out how to make it profitable yet. Questions are now arising about whether they'll ever manage it, too, as a new study out of MIT sends investors into a tizzy. It found that 95% of businesses that implemented AI in their day-to-day operations did not end up with a big uplift in profits.\n\nOver the past few months, more and more calls have started to come in that the AI industry is looking like bubbles of the tech industry's past. The Dotcom boom (and bust) is perhaps the best example, but similar hype trains like blockchain technology, Web 3.0, and NFTs have all been cited as potential comparisons. Although major tech leaders like Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg might claim we're on the cusp of AI changing the world, it may not do much for real businesses.\n\nThe MIT study, The GenAI Divide (you can request access to it here), examined 300 public AI implementations and interviewed hundreds of employees and business leaders. It found that just 5% of the companies investigated saw a large revenue growth. In comparison, the rest demonstrated little to no benefit of using AI when it came to increasing business income and profit.\n\nAlthough many reporters and analysts have called the AI boom a bubble (even Altman has suggested it may be overinflated), this report seemed to strike a nerve where others haven't. Tech stock investors responded immediately, with notable drops in global prices for big names like Nvidia, ARM, Oracle, AMD, and Palantir.\n\nThe glass-half-full response to this study is that some companies have seen tremendous revenue growth when adopting AI. Report lead author, Aditya Challapally, told Fortune that where many companies try to build their own AI, companies that purchased or subscribed to an existing model were far more successful.\n\n\"Almost everywhere we went, enterprises were trying to build their own tool,\" he said, but by the data, buying a pre-built solution was often far more effective.\n\nOther commonalities with successful companies included letting staff and low-level managers have more choice in the AI they used and in how it was implemented. Companies and start-ups led by younger people in their late teens and early 20s tended to perform better, too, with some going from \"$0 to $20 million in a year,\" though that was far from the norm in studied businesses.\n\nTech stocks have largely recovered since the news, and the AI hype train continues to chug along, but the foundations of what makes the AI revolution actually worthwhile have been shaken. If AI continues to remain impressive but with limited avenues towards profitability, the massive boom of AI investment may turn towards a bust before too long.",

      "text": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble, according to a report from The Verge published Friday.\n\"When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\" Altman told a small group of reporters last week.\n\"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,\" he was quoted as saying.\nAltman appeared to compare this dynamic to the infamous dot-com bubble, a stock market crash centered on internet-based companies that led to massive investor enthusiasm during the late 1990s. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the Nasdaq lost nearly 80% of its value after many of these companies failed to generate revenue or profits.\nHis comments add to growing concern among experts and analysts that investment in AI is moving too fast. Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai, Bridgewater Associates' Ray Dalio and Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok have all raised similar warnings.\nLast month, Slok stated in a report that he believed the AI bubble of today was, in fact, bigger than the internet bubble, with the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 more overvalued than they were in the 1990s.\nIn a Monday email to CNBC, Ray Wang, research director for semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at Futurum Group, said that he thought Altman's comments carry some validity, but that the risks are company-dependent.\n\"From the perspective of broader investment in AI and semiconductors... I don't see it as a bubble. The fundamentals across the supply chain remain strong, and the long-term trajectory of the AI trend supports continued investment,\" he said.\nHowever, he added that there is an increasing amount of speculative capital chasing companies with weaker fundamentals and only perceived potential, which could create pockets of overvaluation.\nMany Fears of an AI bubble had hit a fever pitch at the start of this year when Chinese start-up DeepSeek released a competitive reasoning model. The company claimed one version of its advanced large language models had been trained for under $6 million, a fraction of the billions being spent by U.S. AI market leaders like OpenAI, though these claims were also been met with some skepticism.\nEarlier this month, Altman told CNBC that OpenAI's annual recurring revenue is on track to pass $20 billion this year, but that despite that, it remains unprofitable.\nThe release of OpenAI's latest GPT-5 AI model earlier this month had also been rocky, with some critics complaining that it had a less intuitive feel. This resulted in the company restoring access to legacy GPT-4 models for paying customers.\nFollowing the release of the model, Altman has also signaled more caution about some of the AI industry's more bullish predictions.\nSpeaking to CNBC, he said that he thought the term artificial general intelligence, or \"AGI,\" is losing relevance, when asked whether the GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI.\nAGI refers to the concept of a form of artificial intelligence that can perform any intellectual task that a human can \u2014 something that OpenAI has been working towards for years and that Altman previously said could be achieved in the \"reasonably close-ish future.\"\nRegardless, faith in OpenAI from investors has remained strong this year. CNBC confirmed Friday that the company was preparing to sell around $6 billion in stock as part of a secondary sale that would value it at roughly $500 billion.\nIn March, it had announced a $40 billion funding round at a $300 billion valuation, by far the largest amount ever raised by a private tech company.\nIn The Verge article on Friday, the OpenAI CEO also discussed OpenAI's expansion into consumer hardware, brain-computer interfaces and social media.\nAltman also said that he expects OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on its data center buildout in the \"not very distant future,\" and signaled that the company would be interested in buying Chrome if the U.S. government were to force Google to sell it.\nAsked if he would be CEO of OpenAI in a few years, he was quoted as saying, \"I mean, maybe an AI is in three years. That's a long time.\"\nCorrection: This article has been updated to faithfully reflect Ray Wang's role and affiliation as research director for semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at Futurum Group."

      "text": "Good morning. Companies are betting on AI\u2014yet nearly all enterprise pilots are stuck at the starting line.\nThe GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, a new report published by MIT\u2019s NANDA initiative, reveals that while generative AI holds promise for enterprises, most initiatives to drive rapid revenue growth are falling flat.\nDespite the rush to integrate powerful new models, about 5% of AI pilot programs achieve rapid revenue acceleration; the vast majority stall, delivering little to no measurable impact on P&L. The research\u2014based on 150 interviews with leaders, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments\u2014paints a clear divide between success stories and stalled projects.\nTo unpack these findings, I spoke with Aditya Challapally, the lead author of the report, and a research contributor to project NANDA at MIT.\n\u201cSome large companies\u2019 pilots and younger startups are really excelling with generative AI,\u201d Challapally said. Startups led by 19- or 20-year-olds, for example, \u201chave seen revenues jump from zero to $20 million in a year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because they pick one pain point, execute well, and partner smartly with companies who use their tools,\u201d he added.\nBut for 95% of companies in the dataset, generative AI implementation is falling short. The core issue? Not the quality of the AI models, but the \u201clearning gap\u201d for both tools and organizations. While executives often blame regulation or model performance, MIT\u2019s research points to flawed enterprise integration. Generic tools like ChatGPT excel for individuals because of their flexibility, but they stall in enterprise use since they don\u2019t learn from or adapt to workflows, Challapally explained.\nThe data also reveals a misalignment in resource allocation. More than half of generative AI budgets are devoted to sales and marketing tools, yet MIT found the biggest ROI in back-office automation\u2014eliminating business process outsourcing, cutting external agency costs, and streamlining operations.\nWhat\u2019s behind successful AI deployments?\nHow companies adopt AI is crucial. Purchasing AI tools from specialized vendors and building partnerships succeed about 67% of the time, while internal builds succeed only one-third as often.\nThis finding is particularly relevant in financial services and other highly regulated sectors, where many firms are building their own proprietary generative AI systems in 2025. Yet, MIT\u2019s research suggests companies see far more failures when going solo.\nCompanies surveyed were often hesitant to share failure rates, Challapally noted. \u201cAlmost everywhere we went, enterprises were trying to build their own tool,\u201d he said, but the data showed purchased solutions delivered more reliable results.\nOther key factors for success include empowering line managers\u2014not just central AI labs\u2014to drive adoption, and selecting tools that can integrate deeply and adapt over time.\nWorkforce disruption is already underway, especially in customer support and administrative roles. Rather than mass layoffs, companies are increasingly not backfilling positions as they become vacant. Most changes are concentrated in jobs previously outsourced due to their perceived low value.\nThe report also highlights the widespread use of \u201cshadow AI\u201d\u2014unsanctioned tools like ChatGPT\u2014and the ongoing challenge of measuring AI\u2019s impact on productivity and profit.\nLooking ahead, the most advanced organizations are already experimenting with agentic AI systems that can learn, remember, and act independently within set boundaries\u2014offering a glimpse at how the next phase of enterprise AI might unfold.\nSheryl Estrada\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nLeaderboard\nMichael A. Discenza was appointed VP and CFO of The Timken Company (NYSE: TKR), effective immediately. Discenza has 25 years of experience at Timken in roles of increasing responsibility, including the last 10 as VP of finance, and group controller.\nJohn Cole was appointed CFO of ELB Learning, a provider of immersive learning solutions. He brings more than 25 years of experience leading finance and operations for Fortune 100 and 500 companies, according to ELB. Cole aims to strengthen the financial infrastructure to support the company\u2019s next phase of growth.\nBig Deal\nThe report\u2019s findings are based on a survey of more than 1,500 manufacturing leaders across 17 major manufacturing countries. Cybersecurity now ranks among the top external risks, second only to inflation and economic growth. One-third of respondents hold responsibilities spanning both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) cybersecurity.\nNearly half (48%) of cybersecurity professionals identified securing converged architectures as key to positive outcomes over the next five years, compared to just 37% of all respondents.\nHowever, a shortage of skilled talent, training challenges, and rising labor costs remain major hurdles. As manufacturers recruit the next generation, cybersecurity and analytical skills are becoming hiring priorities\u2014reinforcing the need to align technical innovation with human development, according to the report.\nGoing deeper\nOverheard\n\u201cEvery single Monday was called 'AI Monday.' You couldn\u2019t have customer calls, you couldn\u2019t work on budgets, you had to only work on AI projects.\u201d\n\u2014Eric Vaughan, CEO of enterprise software company IgniteTech, told Fortune in an interview that he established a mandate: on Mondays, staff could only work on AI. In early 2023, convinced generative AI was an \u201cexistential\u201d transformation, Vaughan saw that his team was not fully on board. His ultimate response? He replaced nearly 80% of the staff within a year, according to headcount figures reviewed by Fortune."
