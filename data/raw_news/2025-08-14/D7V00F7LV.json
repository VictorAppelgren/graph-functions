  "title": "Why Ulta Beauty is closing hundreds of store-in-stores in 2026: Is your location on the doomed list?",
  "description": "The closures come as the beauty giant ends its partnership with a major nationwide retailer.",
  "content": "Until then, Ulta Beauty products will continue to be sold in Target stores and online at Target.com. Ulta Beauty has an estimated 600 in-store, or \u201cshop-in-shop\u201d locations at Target, at nearly a third of Target\u2019s 1,981 U.S. stores, according to CNBC. Fast Company has reached out to both companies for additional information about the timeline and locations of the closures. Shares in both stocks fell on the news, with Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) down about 1% and Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) down nearly 2% in early and midday trading on Thursday.\n\nSince launching four years ago in 2021, Target\u2019s partnership with the beauty retailer, which sells everything from cosmetics to skin and hair care products, was a way to increase foot traffic in Target\u2019s stores, while giving Ulta a way to expand its customer base. Target, like many big box retailers, is seeing slower growth and softer sales fueled by high prices, inflation, and changing consumer habits\u2014which have prompted fewer Americans to shop in stores as they gravitate online. The retailer also faced consumer boycotts over its rollback of DEI policies earlier this year. \u201cFor 35 years, Ulta Beauty has revolutionized how people experience beauty\u2014bringing together an unmatched assortment from mass to luxury\u2014and our partnership with Target was one of many unique ways we have brought the power of beauty to guests nationwide,\u201d Amiee Bayer-Thomas, chief retail officer at Ulta Beauty said in a press release. \u201cAs we continue to execute our Ulta Beauty Unleashed plans, we\u2019re confident our wide-ranging assortment, expert services and inspiring in-store experiences will reinforce our leadership in beauty and define the next chapter of our brand.\u201d\n\nThat release said customers with Ulta Beauty rewards and Target Circle-linked accounts will continue to earn Ulta Beauty rewards on eligible Ulta Beauty at Target until August 2026. Target and Ulta Beauty by the numbers In its latest earnings results for the first quarter of 2025, ending on May 3, Ulta Beauty reported net sales increased 4.5% to $2.8 billion compared to $2.7 billion the year prior, primarily due to increased comparable sales and new store contribution, and partially offset by a decrease in other revenue. The company has a market capitalization of $23.77 billion. Target, which reports second quarter earnings next week, missed first quarter revenue expectations for the period ending May 3, with revenue coming in at $23.85 billion, falling short of $24.27 billion estimates. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30 adjusted, missing analyst estimates of $1.61. At the time, the retailer cut its full-year sales outlook, with sales down 3% compared with the same period a year ago. Target has a market capitalization of $47.14 billon.",

      "text": "Foot traffic at Target fell year over year for the sixth consecutive month in July, and while the slump began the week after the retailer backtracked on its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, some analysts say the real culprit is that Target is slipping on retail basics.\nIn July, foot traffic at Target fell 3.8%, according to Placer.ai. Since announcing it was curtailing DEI on January 24, foot traffic has been down YoY for 25 of the last 27 weeks.\nWhile media outlets (including this one) have linked Target\u2019s traffic losses to it eliminating some DEI initiatives (and the ensuing backlash and a boycott led by Black clergy), Walter Holbrook, an industry veteran whose resume includes 28 years as an executive at Kmart, believes that a bigger issue is Target struggling with the basics.\nHolbrook makes regular visits to a Target store in Jacksonville, Florida, and said that twice while shopping there on Sundays after church in the last two months, the store\u2019s shopping cart corral was completely empty, something he documented once in a LinkedIn post. For the average consumer, the not-OK corral might have been just an inconvenience, but for Holbrook, a retail standard-bearer, \u201cI could have exploded,\u201d he told Retail Brew.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the fundamentals,\u201d Holbrook said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get that right, you can\u2019t get anything right. If you don\u2019t know that carts need to be kept filled on a Sunday afternoon, you\u2019re in the wrong business.\u201d\nOver the Fourth of July weekend, Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData, visited a Target and posted 15 photos on LinkedIn that documented shelves that were understocked (or completely empty), soiled, and in disarray.\nTarget is \u201cstill not getting the basics right,\u201d Saunders wrote in the post. \u201cFixture after fixture, including lucrative endcaps, are devoid of product. Essentials like kitchen paper are completely out of stock.\u201d\nWhile there were \u201csome nice ideas,\u201d including a display with sundae toppings, \u201cthese things fall flat if you can\u2019t get the basics right,\u201d Saunders wrote. \u201cTarget is still training customers to ask: Why bother coming to the store?\u201d\nTarget did not respond to Retail Brew\u2019s requests for comment about the foot traffic data and reports of issues like poorly stocked shelves.\nOn August 10, the Wall Street Journal reported that about 40% of 260,000 Target employees who completed an internal company survey said they were not confident in the company\u2019s future, a reported decline from a year ago.\n\u201cWhile we recognize the hard work and progress under way, we\u2019re not where we want to be,\u201d Target CEO Brian Cornell told the WSJ.\nMiddle ground: Ethan Chernofsky, CMO of Placer.ai, told Retail Brew that one of Target\u2019s strengths is how it has found footing in what he calls the \u201cbifurcation of retail\u201d between luxury and value. Locating mini-stores within Target stores from retailers including Disney, Apple, and Casper creates a shopping environment that serves shoppers who don\u2019t fit neatly in the luxury or value category but rather in the \u201cmiddle\u201d of both, Chernofsky said.\n\u201cThe \u2018middle\u2019 is, \u2018I will spend more on the Disney toy for my kid, I will spend more on my iPhone, but I want to save money on socks,\u201d Chernofsky said. \u201c[Target] nailed that for so long, and that was what set them apart and made their growth so unique and special.\u201d\nBut in doing so, Chernofsky added, Target has raised expectations among consumers that they\u2019ll have a more elevated experience than in a typical discount store, and he said his own experience is that the service at Target in the last year has not been as high as before, which he partly attributed to labor shortages faced by all retailers.\n\u201cLabor shortages are more significant for someone who\u2019s trying to nail that middle area,\u201d Chernofsky said. \u201cFor someone who\u2019s super value-oriented\u201d\u2014as opposed to being in that value-luxury middle\u2014\u201cif you\u2019re not getting great service at Five Below, you\u2019re not like, \u2018Oh my God, nobody said hi to me.\u2019\u201d\nIronically, perhaps, since his company\u2019s data has been widely cited in documenting Target\u2019s foot traffic declines over the last six months, Chernofsky believes the company\u2019s ability to straddle discount and luxury is why it will rebound.\n\u201cI\u2019m weirdly more bullish about [Target] than I\u2019ve ever been because I think the issues are very fixable,\u201d Chernofsky said. \u201cThey live in this place where no one else is existing today, and that\u2019s a really good place to be.\u201d\nThe cart of the deal: Cornell is expected to retire after his contract ends later this year and its board to choose a successor.\n\u201cThis decision by the board for new leadership is the most important decision in years for Target,\u201d Holbrook said, adding that he also admires the retailer even as he\u2019s found the shopping experience there wanting over the last couple years.\n\u201cThe retail industry is better off if we have a strong Target,\u201d Holbrook said. \u201cWe need them to counterbalance everything else that\u2019s going on, whether it\u2019s Walmart or Amazon. We need that Target influence of fashion and style in the middle class that they can bring and capturing that aspirational shopper.\u201d\nA few days ago, on Saturday, August 9, Holbrook sent us a photo he\u2019d snapped at about 11 am at his local Target. The photo was of the store\u2019s shopping cart corral.\nIt contained a single cart.\nThis report was originally published by Retail Brew."

      "text": "Target on Wednesday cut its full-year sales outlook, as executives said weaker discretionary spending, consumer uncertainty about tariffs, and backlash to the company's rollback of key diversity, equity and inclusion efforts hurt its business.\nFirst-quarter earnings and revenue missed Wall Street's expectations as sales fell nearly 3% compared with the year-ago period. Transactions across Target's stores and website dipped by 2.4%. And the average amount customers spent during their online and in-store visits decreased by 1.4%.\nTarget's weak performance in the quarter reflected the company's broader struggles to return to growth and recapture the cheap chic reputation and fan following that gave it the name ''Tarzhay.\" The company is trying to win back the loyalty and trust of shoppers and investors as its sales slump continues and after its shares plunged more than 37% in the last year, as of Tuesday's close.\nOn a call with reporters, CEO Brian Cornell pinned many of the retailer's problems on the economy. Yet he said Target is committed to doing better.\nHe referred to a statistic that Target shared on the call: Of the 35 merchandise categories that Target tracks internally, the company gained or held market share in only 15 \u2013 a reflection of sales that it is losing to retail competitors.\n\"We're not happy with that,\" Cornell said. \"We've got to be growing [market] share in 60, 70, 80% of those categories. That's our focus over the balance of the year, and we're going to do that by making sure we provide a great shopping environment.\"\nTarget said it now expects a low-single-digit decline in sales this fiscal year, compared with a previous forecast of net sales growth of about 1%. It said it expects adjusted earnings per share, excluding gains from litigation settlements, to be about $7 to $9, compared with the range of $8.80 to $9.80 that it had previously anticipated.\nTarget also announced some leadership shake-ups and the creation of a new office intended to turn around its results. Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke will oversee the new effort, called the Enterprise Acceleration Office, which will look for methods to simplify company operations, use technology in new ways and speed up Target's growth.\nTarget said in a news release that Amy Tu, chief legal and compliance officer, and Christina Henningon, chief strategy and growth officer, were leaving the company. Hennington, who was a key presenter on some of the company's earnings calls, had been widely considered in industry circles to be a candidate to succeed Cornell as CEO.\nHere's what the Minneapolis-based retailer reported for the fiscal first quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: $1.30 adjusted vs. $1.61 expected\n- Revenue: $23.85 billion vs. $24.27 billion expected\nIn the three-month period that ended May 3, Target's net income rose to $1.04 billion or $2.27 per share, from $942 million, or $2.03 per share, in the year-ago period.\nRevenue fell from $24.53 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nComparable sales declined by 3.8% in the quarter compared with the year-ago period, as comparable store sales fell 5.7% and digital sales grew 4.7%.\nTarget shares fell more than 5% in trading Wednesday.\nTariffs have only added to a challenging set of problems for Target. The discounter's annual revenue has been roughly flat for four years in a row. Sales have been weaker in many of the discretionary categories that the retailer is known for, such as home decor, as consumers are selective and cautious about spending. And the company has faced backlash from shoppers \u2014 and pressure from activists including the Rev. Al Sharpton \u2014 for rolling back major parts of its diversity, equity and inclusion program.\nCornell told reporters that Target fell short of where it hoped to be in the fiscal first quarter because of \"ongoing pressure in our discretionary business, plus five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence, tariff uncertainty and the reaction to the updates we shared on belonging in January.\"\nHe said all of those weighed on the company's quarterly results, but it \"can't reliably estimate the impact of each one separately.\"\nYet Cornell pointed to some bright spots, including a 36% jump in same-day deliveries through its membership program, Target Circle 360, and the popularity of a clothing and accessories collection with Tapestry-owned brand Kate Spade. He said sales for the limited-time designer partnership were the strongest that Target has had in a decade.\nDuring the first quarter, Target gained market share in some categories, Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez told reporters on the call. Those included beverages, floral and produce. It also saw stronger sales of women's swimsuits and toddler clothing and surges of traffic around seasonal events, including Valentine's Day and Easter.\nPricing plans\nTarget's earnings follow updates from other retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot. Both of the big-box retailers reaffirmed their full-year outlooks when they reported quarterly earnings. Yet the two companies diverged with how they will manage higher costs from tariffs. Walmart warned that it will have to raise prices for customers as soon as later this month because of the duties. Home Depot, on the other hand, said it doesn't plan to hike prices.\nTarget will increase prices on some items to help cover tariff-related costs, Gomez said. He said the company is also trying to minimize the impact of the duties by negotiating with vendors, reevaluating the merchandise it sells, changing the country that produces items and adjusting the timing of orders.\nOn the company's earnings call, Cornell said the big-box retailer will use its scale to help it stay price competitive with other retailers, too.\n\"We have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs and price is the very last resort,\" he said.\nAs the long-term level of tariffs remains unclear, he said the company is \"contemplating a wide range of potential scenarios\" and \"building our plans to preserve maximum flexibility while protecting our business in the face of massive potential costs.\"\nDespite being repeatedly pressed by reporters on a call, Cornell did not provide specifics about the company's plans for tariff-related price increases or answer whether the retailer had raised prices since early March because of the duties.\n\"We're constantly adjusting pricing,\" he said. \"Some are going up, some will be reduced, but that's an ongoing effort that takes place each and every day.\"\nIn an interview in early March, Cornell had said he expected customers to see higher prices for strawberries, avocados and bananas in the coming days because of an expected 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada. Since then, the U.S. has exempted many of those countries' goods from levies, but imports from China \u2013 a major production hub for Target \u2013 now have a 30% duty.\nAbout half of what Target currently sells is from the U.S., Gomez said. Over the past few years, he said the retailer has tried to move production of its private-label brands to different countries outside of China.\nWith private-label brands, Target has gone from about 60% coming from China in 2017 to about 30% today, and the company plans to bring that down to 25% by the end of next year, he said.\nCost pressures will continue in the second quarter, but Target expects greater relief in the back half of the year, Chief Financial Officer Jim Lee said on a call with reporters. He said Target had some higher first-quarter costs related to reducing inventory, such as through markdowns, because of slower demand.\nDespite tariff costs, offering lower-priced items has remained a priority for Target, Gomez said. In the front of the company's stores, it has an area where it sells inexpensive seasonal items for $1, $3 and $5. Gomez said Target is committed to keeping the same prices in that part of the store and plans to add mini beauty products and trendy food and beverage items."

That's above the 2.4% consensus and a rebound from the 0.5% decline in the fourth quarter. Our forecast was for an increase of 1.8%. Imports decreased 30.3% as trade normalized after the first quarter's 51.6% jump in goods purchases (in advance of the expected imposition of tariffs). Net exports of goods and services, aka the trade balance, raised 2Q GDP by 4.99 percentage points, reversing a 4.61-point drag in 1Q. Companies appear to be using the stockpiles built in 1Q. Inventories cut 3.17 points from GDP after adding 2.59 points in 1Q. Spending by consumers rose 1.4%, an improvement from the 0.5% increase in 1Q. Private investment declined 15.6%, led by a 10.3% decline in nonresidential structures. Consumer spending on goods rose 2.2%. Within goods, durables were up 3.7%, after a 3.7% decline in 1Q. Nondurables were up 1.3%. The huge services category was up 1.1% after an increase of just 0.6% in 1Q. That is a little softer than we would like. This steady category added 0.53 points of growth. Government consumption and investment rose 0.4%. The federal government was down 3.7%, with national defense up 2.2%. Nondefense was down a big 11.3%, State and local government was up 3.0%. Growth in real final sales to private domestic purchasers, which exclude net exports, inventory investment, and government spending, rose 1.2 % -- slower than 1.9% in 1Q. The GDP report also contains data on inflation, which slowed in 2Q. The PCE Price Index increased 2.1% in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.7 in the first quarter. Excluding food and energy, the index increased 2.5%, compared with an increase of 3.5% in the previous quarter. After the report, futures on the S&P 500 were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was up two basis points to 4.36%. Based on futures trading, the probability that the Fed will keep policy steady this afternoon remained at 98%. Expectations for a September cut declined slightly, to 62% from 64%.\nThe Argus Min Vol Model Portfolio\nUncertainty over President Trump's new tariff policies almost knocked stocks into a bear market earlier this year. While growth stocks suffered the most, value stocks also declined. Even bond prices were lower amid the confusion. Stocks have since recovered and the bull market that began in 2022 remains intact.

While growth stocks suffered the most, value stocks also declined. Even bond prices were lower amid the confusion. Stocks have since recovered and the bull market that began in 2022 remains intact.

It differentiates itself by selling stylish products at reasonable prices. The company has partnerships with an evolving group of designers. Based in Minneapolis, Target ended FY25 with 1,978 stores in the U.S., with a total of 248 million square feet. Target sold its in-store pharmacies to CVS in December 2015. For the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, the company had total revenues of $106.6 billion, including $31 billion from Target's own brands. Sales on Target.com represented about 19.6% of the total in FY25, up from 18.3% a year earlier and 8.8% in pre-pandemic FY20. The company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Approximately 31% of merchandise sales came from beauty and household essentials, 13% from hardlines, 16% from apparel and accessories, 14% from home products, and 25% from food. Target was moved to the Consumer Staples sector from Consumer Discretionary in 2023.\nRatingPrice Target"

      "text": "Ulta Beauty and Target said Thursday that they have decided to end a deal that opened makeup and beauty shops in hundreds of Target's stores.\nShares of Target and Ulta closed the day down about 1%.\nIn a news release, the companies said the partnership \u2014 which also added some of Ulta's merchandise to Target's website \u2014 will end in August 2026. Target had added more than 600 Ulta Beauty shops to its stores since 2021, according to a company spokesperson. That's nearly a third of Target's 1,981 U.S. stores.\nUlta Beauty at Target shops carried a smaller and rotating assortment of the merchandise at the beauty retailer's own stores. They were staffed by Target's employees.\nThe loss of the popular beauty retailer's products could be another blow to Target as it tries to woo back both shoppers and investors. Target's annual sales have been roughly flat for four years and it expects sales to decline this fiscal year. Shares of the company are worth less than half of what the were back in 2021, when they hit an all-time closing high of $266.39. It also has faced backlash over both its Pride collection and its rollback of key diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nStore traffic for Target has declined year over year nearly every week from the week of Jan. 27, days after the company's DEI announcement, through the week of Aug. 4, according to Placer.ai, an analytics firm that uses anonymized data from mobile devices to estimate overall visits to locations. Target traffic had been up weekly year over year in the four weeks before Jan. 27.\nThe only exceptions to that trend were the two weeks on either side of Easter, when traffic rose less than 1% year over year, the firm's data showed.\nOn earnings calls and in investor presentations, leaders of the Minneapolis-based company had touted Ulta's shops and its trendy beauty brands as a way to drive store traffic.\nAt a investor presentation in New York City in March, CEO Brian Cornell highlighted beauty as a growth category for Target and cited it as reason for confidence in Target's long-term business. He said the company had gained market share in beauty and its sales in the category rose by nearly 7% in the fiscal year that ended in early February.\nTarget's CEO Brian Cornell, 66, is expected to depart the company soon. The longtime Target leader renewed his contract for approximately three years in September 2022 after the board scrapped its retirement age of 65.\nDavid Bellinger, an analyst for Mizuho Securities who covers retailers, said in an equity research note on Thursday that Target's \"messy in-store operations\" as well as issues with retail theft and insufficient staffing at stores likely contributed to the companies ending their partnership.\n\"Overall, we see losing the Ulta shop-in-shop relationship as a negative development and something else Target's next CEO will have to grapple with,\" he wrote.\nIn a statement on Thursday, Target Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said the discounter is \"proud of our shared success with Ulta Beauty and the experience we've delivered together.\"\n\"We look forward to what's ahead and remain committed to offering the beauty experience consumers have come to expect from Target \u2013 one centered on an exciting mix of beauty brands with continuous newness, all at an unbeatable value,\" he said.\nIn a statement, Ulta's Chief Retail Officer Amiee Bayer-Thomas described the Target deal as \"one of many unique ways we have brought the power of beauty to guests nationwide.\"\n\"As we continue to execute our Ulta Beauty Unleashed plans, we're confident our wide-ranging assortment, expert services and inspiring in-store experiences will reinforce our leadership in beauty and define the next chapter of our brand,\" she said."

Still, investors and traders, as usual, will listen carefully to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell when he speaks at the follow-on press conference. The meeting follows a mild CPI report and labor numbers that show a jobs market that is holding steady despite the great shift in U.S. macroeconomic policy. Turning to stocks, escalating tension in the Middle East rattled the markets on Friday. For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.3%, the S&P 500 dropped 0.4%, and the Nasdaq fell 0. 3%. So far this year, the indices have been flipping back and forth over the flat line. Currently, the Dow is off 1%, the S&P has gained 2%, and the Nasdaq is higher by 0.5%. On the economic calendar, Retail Sales, Industrial Production, and Capacity Utilization are reported on Tuesday; Housing Starts on Wednesday; and Leading Economic Indicators on Friday. The Economic Call of the Week from Argus' Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, suggests that investors look at three numbers that are not headliners but have important implications for the economy over the rest of the summer. Here is his list. 'First, within the report on retail sales for May, we expect sales at nonstore retailers, a category that is dominated by e-commerce, to rise by more than headline retail sales, which we expect to be up 4.4% year over year. E-commerce is big (17% of retail and food services) and has been a stalwart. It may also offer a glimpse at spending by wealthier customers who have been driving the economy. The category was up 5.9% over the last three reports. Second, we look for sales at food services and drinking places (restaurants) to come in a little better than our overall retail sales forecast. It is an important number because it should shed light on one of the more-sensitive components within the important services category (which represents 47% of GDP). Food services and accommodations was the only services component that declined in the 1Q GDP report. Third, we are a little more cautious about traffic of prospective home buyers at new home communities, which appears within The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. We look at traffic as an indicator of buyer optimism and a leading indicator of new home sales. The traffic index declined to 23 in May from 32 in January. With 30-year mortgage rates stuck near 7%, we don't expect much improvement.' Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure forecasts 3.8% for 2Q. That follows a decline of 0.3% for 1Q. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.6% rate for CPI in June. Mortgage rates inched a hair lower last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.84%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices ticked down two cents to an average of $3.11 per gallon for regular gas. After this week, the Fed's next rate meeting is on July 30, with odds at 23% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the Fed meets on September 17, when odds jump to 70% for a cut. Argus continues to forecast two 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2025, both in the back part of the year.\nUlta Beauty Counters Increasing Competition With Advantages in Selection, Stores, and Loyalty\nWith more than 1,400 freestanding stores and 600 Target shop-in-shops, Ulta Beauty is the largest specialized beauty retailer in the US.
