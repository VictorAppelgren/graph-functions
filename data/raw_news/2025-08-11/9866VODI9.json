  "description": "Trump vowed to force a bill through Congress despite slim Republican majorities in the House and Senate, where 60 votes generally is needed to approve legislation.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump pledged Monday to push through federal legislation outlawing so-called \u201cno cash bail\u201d policies in states and cities across the country \u2014 with upstate Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) quickly telling The Post she will be writing the bill.\n\n\u201cEvery place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster,\u201d Trump said at a White House press conference where he announced that he was taking temporary control of DC\u2019s police department.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what started the problem in New York, and they don\u2019t change it. They don\u2019t want to change it. That\u2019s what started in Chicago.\u201d\n\nNew York state in 2019 barred judges from requiring bail for most crimes, including burglary and simple assault, leading to many high-profile instances of offenders quickly finding new victims upon their release \u2014 prompting Albany to make some changes to expand judges\u2019 authority to hold suspects.\n\n\u201cI will be leading legislation to end [Gov.] Kathy Hochul and New York\u2019s failed bail reform once and for all to save New York and save America,\u201d Stefanik told The Post soon after Trump spoke.\n\n\u201cThe radical, dangerous and insane criminals and illegals-first policies must end now. We need law and order that puts America first.\u201d\n\nTrump floated potential additional measures against New York at his press conference, without going into details.\n\n\u201cBad politicians started it, bad leadership started it, but that\u2019s one thing that\u2019s central, no cash bail,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSomebody murders somebody and they\u2019re out on no cash bail before the day is out.\u201d\n\nTrump vowed to force a bill through Congress, despite slim Republican majorities in the House and Senate, where 60 votes generally is needed to approve legislation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to get the Republicans to vote. Because the Democrats are weak on crime \u2014 totally weak on crime. They don\u2019t know why. They want it to stop because they get mugged too,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll count on the Republicans in Congress and the Senate to vote. We have the majority, so we\u2019ll vote. We don\u2019t have a big majority but we\u2019ve gotten everything, including the great big beautiful bill.\u201d\n\nDC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro praised the concept, but added Monday that she wanted to heap pressure on the District\u2019s Council to change other laws, including the city\u2019s Youth Rehabilitation Act, which allows judges to set aside the sentences of offenders 24 and younger.\n\nPirro, whose office uniquely prosecutes both federal and local crime, noted that gunman Javarry Peaks, 19, was sentenced to probation last month by DC Superior Court Judge Rainey Branch \u2014 despite being filmed shooting a fellow bus passenger in the chest.\n\n\u201cI convict someone of shooting another person with an illegal gun on a public bus in the chest [with] intent to kill,\u201d Pirro said. \u201cI convict him and you know what? The judge gives him probation, says you should go to college. We need to go after the DC Council and their absurd laws.\u201d",

Her loss is deeply felt by the entire Rockingham County Public Schools (RCPS) family,\u201d a tribute on Facebook read."

      "text": "Stefanik fires back at \u2018worst governor in America\u2019 after Hochul jabs on Medicaid cuts\nRep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., a key Trump ally who is rumored to be planning a gubernatorial run in 2026, hit back hard against New York Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, calling her the \u201cworst governor in America\u201d after the Democrat dinged her over Medicaid cuts.\nIn a Friday post on social media, Hochul accused Stefanik of voting \u201cto put five hospitals in her district on the chopping block, endangering her own constituents\u2019 lives, health, and jobs\u2014all to serve Donald Trump.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t stand for it. I\u2019m fighting like hell to save New Yorkers\u2019 health care,\u201d said Hochul.\nIn response, Stefanik posted on X, \u201cHi @KathyHochul! Welcome to the fight.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t get exposed enough during our last round when you testified and were totally exposed for your dangerous and failed sanctuary state policies ?? Let\u2019s do Medicaid now,\u201d she wrote.\nStefanik slammed Hochul for giving Medicaid benefits to illegal immigrants, \u201cputting New Yorkers most vulnerable LAST.\u201d\n\u201cNY\u2019s Medicaid program is rampant with tens of billions of waste, fraud, and abuse under Kathy\u2019s watch,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cKathy Hochul, the Worst Governor in America oversees the worst run Medicaid program in the country harming NYers. Medicaid is an incredibly important program that I have worked to strengthen for New Yorkers.\u201d\nThe New York congresswoman then added, \u201cOh and Kathy, your numbers in rural NY are plummeting\u201d and \u201cI have been nationally recognized as the TOP advocate to deliver results for rural hospitals due to my work for hospitals in my district.\u201d\nIn another post, Stefanik said, \u201cOh Kathy. I\u2019m glad I set your schedule these days \u2013 from setting your Tweet schedule by forcing you to tweet on the Communist Mayor who just won in your Democrat Party in NYC. To you now scrambling to go to Saranac Lake because of news articles. When I have an announcement to make, believe me you\u2019ll know.\u201d\nThis comes after Stefanik pressured Hochul to say whether she supported the new Democratic nominee for New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani, who has made controversial statements criticizing Israel and promoting Palestine and who identifies as a Democratic Socialist.\nHochul has since said she plans to meet with Mamdani to discuss his ideas for the city but has not yet issued a full endorsement.\nStefanik has said that as the leader of the New York Democratic Party, Hochul \u201cfully embraced the antisemitic, Communist nominee,\u201d adding, \u201cshe owns this catastrophe.\u201d\nEarlier this month, Stefanik told a Republican crowd in Staten Island she was \u201cstrongly considering\u201d entering the race for governor.\nShe unveiled a new state political action committee, Save New York, which appears aimed at further cementing her status as a heavyweight in Empire State GOP politics.\nFox News Digital\u2019s Elizabeth Elkind contributed to this report."

      "text": "Remember back when politicians were touting the success of bail reform? Remember the meaningless and deceptive numbers they threw around?\nNYC Comptroller Brad Lander claimed in a report that only 1% of people released on bail under bail reform are rearrested for a violent felony while their case is pending.\nState Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said the number was 2%.\nRemember how the news media and progressive politicians repeated those numbers and claimed that bail reform was a success and had no impact on crime, even as crime rose 30-40% after bail reform took effect?\nWell, a new study of bail reform outside New York City \u2014 suburbs and upstate \u2014 prepared by John Jay College of Criminal Justice\u2019s Data Collaborative for Justice shows that 66% of the people released under bail reform who had a recent prior arrest were re-arrested within two years of their release.\nThe DCJ study also showed that 67% of defendants who had a recent prior violent felony arrest in the past year who were released under bail reform were re-arrested within two years of their arraignment.\nAlmost half \u2014 49% \u2014 were rearrested for a felony.\nThe fact that a study shows that people who have committed crimes tend to continue to commit more crimes is not really surprising.\nMy analysis of bail reform published by the Manhattan Institute in August of 2022 showed NYC re-arrest rates of close to 70% for people with prior records charged with larceny, burglary, robbery, and criminal contempt while their case was pending.\nBut DCJ is no conservative think tank. On the contrary, they have been vocal supporters of, and cheerleaders for, New York\u2019s disastrous bail reform laws from the beginning.\nThis particular DCJ study was supported by the Arnold Ventures Philanthropic Trust, a pro bail reform philanthropic group.\nThat\u2019s why the numbers that DCJ calculated are so interesting. DCJ won\u2019t say it outright, but their numbers show that bail reform has been a failure \u2014 as if the rising crime rate after bail reform was not enough proof.\nIn fact, the DCJ tries to suggest bail reform is a success because, \u201cAcross all of New York State, bail reform tended to reduce recidivism for people facing less serious charges and with limited or no recent criminal history.\u201d\nBut is that really who we should be worried about? Opponents of no-bail are worried about repeat, chronic offenders rather than one-time criminals.\nAnd, in fact, DCJ study found that bail reform \u201ctended to increase recidivism for people facing more serious charges\u201d (violent crimes) \u201cand with recent criminal histories.\u201d\nIn other words, bad people and repeat offenders committed crimes at a higher rate under bail reform than a similar group who had bail set or were remanded under the old bail law.\nA previous DCJ study on NYC also found that the 2020 amendments to the original bail reform law, which slightly toughened the bail laws to allow judges to set bail on certain repeat offenders, actually reduced recidivism.\nAnd yet even these sky-high re-arrest rates actually undercount the damage these released defendants cause, since they only count the number of defendants who get re-arrested, not the number of times they get re-arrested. Nor does every crime result in an arrest.\nArrests outside NYC decreased from 184,000 in 2019 to 154,000 in 2022, even as crimes increased. In fact, while there were 17,000 more crimes in 2022 than in 2019, there were 30,000 fewer arrests.\nMore people are getting away with crime without being arrested, lowering re-arrest rates..\nRecidivism is the problem. Last year the NYPD released a study that showed that just 327 people were responsible for 30% of all shoplifting arrests in NYC in 2022.\nThey were arrested an average of 20 times each that year.\nThere is no telling how many times they got away with shoplifting and didn\u2019t get arrested.\nBut can you imagine the decline in shoplifting that would have occurred had just those 327 individuals been held in jail after say, their FIFTH shoplifting arrest that year?\nAllowing judges to consider the defendant\u2019s danger to public safety and risk of recidivism when setting bail (as the overwhelming majority of states and the federal government do) would go a long way to protecting the public.\nThis is not rocket science. Anyone involved in the criminal justice system could tell you with a pretty high degree of accuracy that people with long criminal records, especially recent criminal records, tend to continue their criminal activity.\n- 66% of the people arrested in the first six months of 2023 in New York State for a felony had a prior conviction or a pending case when they were arrested.\n- 20% had a pending non-violent felony\n- 10% had a pending violent felony.\nThat is why bail reform was so harmful. In addition to releasing 2,000 career criminals from NYC jails and thousands more from suburban and upstate jails, bail reform prevented judges from setting bail on many of these same individuals when they got arrested and so they were set free to re-offend.\nThe problem with this study is that the authors are desperately trying to find ways to declare bail reform a success. They claim victory because \u201coverall\u201d recidivism is down from a control group before the law passed.\nBut that\u2019s a poor comparison, because so many more criminals are being set free that even if the \u201crate\u201d of recidivism is going up by a small percentage, the overall number of crimes increases by a lot.\nAnd again, comparing the recidivism of people arrested for their first crime misrepresents what the major opposition to no-bail laws are: In short, that judges don\u2019t have the discretion to take criminal history into account.\nThe study\u2019s authors at one point concede that statistics \u201cindicate that the mandatory release of people with recent justice involvement, even if relatively minor, can be detrimental to recidivism.\u201d\nThat is the lesson that New York politicians refuse to take to heart.\nJim Quinn was executive district attorney in the Queens DA\u2019s Office, where he served for 42 years."

      "text": "Trump takes control of DC police, deploying National Guard in historic capital crime crackdown\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced a sweeping crime crackdown in DC on Monday, placing the city\u2019s police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the streets \u2014 and warning New York City could be next.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\nTrump vowed to \u201cclean it up real quick,\u201d \u201clike we did on the southern border\u201d with illegal immigration.\nThe Home Rule Act, which granted DC self-governance in 1973, allows the president to assert emergency control of the Metropolitian Police Department (MPD) for 30 days. Congress can pass a joint resolution extending the authority.\nDocuments formalizing the takeover were transmitted to Congress Monday afternoon and DC police officials set up a meeting later in the day with White House officials to discuss the new arrangement.\nTerry Cole, administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will temporarily lead the 3,400-officer MPD under the supervision of Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nIt was not immediately clear how the National Guard deployment will proceed \u2014 including numbers and neighborhoods where they will be sent \u2014 but members of that force historically assist law enforcement in a supporting role and do not have the ability to make arrests.\nJustifying his action Monday morning, the president displayed a chart showing that DC has more murders per capita than the capital cities of cocaine-exporting Columbia, cartel-plagued Mexico, and terrorist hub Iraq.\n\u201cWe doubled up on Baghdad,\u201d Trump commented.\n\u201cYou people are victims of it too. You are reporters and I understand a lot of you tend to be on the liberal side. But you don\u2019t want to get mugged and raped and shot and killed.
