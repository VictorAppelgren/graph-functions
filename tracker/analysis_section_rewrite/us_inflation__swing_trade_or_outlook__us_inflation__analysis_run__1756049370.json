      "feedback": "The draft has strong domain coverage and credible data anchors, but it fails the SECTION FOCUS on format and actionable structure. Actionable edits to upgrade to world-class quality:\n\n- Reformat Movers & Scenarios to exactly four lines, two Up and two Down, in the precise fields: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %. Keep 0–3 weeks and 3–6 months as the two windows, and ensure each line uses only five fields (no extra prose). Current Mix (Up 0–3w and Up 3–6m; Down 0–3w and 3–6m) is fine, but prune the “driver/mechanism” to a concise trigger and move all evaluative commentary into “What to watch” with a single, crisp trigger. Example: Up | 0–3 weeks | Tariff/policy rollback optimism | Watch policy confirmation in autos price pass-through; rollback would widen risk-on | 40% (S15934PBQ). Up | 3–6 months | AI-driven productivity and private-market expansions | Watch legislative progress, debt trajectory, and private-market funding signals; acceleration in AI capex | 45% (EPJYXB7DX)(UPV3X2MQ6)(FOM34PUWA)(ILYC1M41F). Down | 0–3 weeks | Tariff uncertainty and autos pass-through risk | Watch policy announcements; unresolved stance reinforces near-term risk-off | 30% (S15934PBQ). Down | 3–6 months | Debt/yield shocks tightening financial conditions | Watch debt trajectory and term premia; rate-path implications | 25% (EPJYXB7DX).\n- Convert the “Outlook | 12–18 months” into a Swing Trade plan since the asset set is tradable. Output a single Swing Trade line (not a separate Outlook) using the required fields: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100. For example: Long | 0–6 weeks | Entry on tariff-rollback confirmation or 90-day extension | Stop below prior swing low | Target +4–8% in risk-on names (e.g., Ford/UNH/LULU) | 2:1 | Invalidation if no policy progress by Week 3 | Trigger: explicit policy confirmation; Probability 50% | Confidence 65%. If you prefer a specific asset, name Ford (F) or UNH and tailor the Entry/Stop/Target to observable price levels; back-test against the 12–18 month base-case but keep the line event-driven.\n- Align first-principles chain and scenario structure: keep a single crisp causal chain per horizon (AI/TFP-driven capex → margins and wage dynamics → inflation expectations → asset pricing) and cite the exact anchors (NL5YYTLF2; 22PL3Q360; W2622L6WW; IGP1Q4ZEJ; EPJYXB7DX; GX057ADL7) only where you assert a fact or number. Consolidate the long paragraph into a compact map: (i) A drives capex and durable demand; (ii) B emerges when automation exposure and slack deteriorate; (iii) C cushions growth with policy space; (iv) regime transitions triggered by explicit thresholds (e.g., Brookings 25% automation exposure). This will reduce narrative drift and improve traceability.\n- Tighten numbers and avoid generic phrasing: weave exact data points (Ford EV losses ~$1.3B; forward P/E ~10.3; 25% automation exposure; 2.5 mb/d 2025 supply growth; 60% Outlook probability) only where you are asserting them; otherwise keep qualitative risk signals. Ensure every numeric claim has a source tag (IDs) immediately after it.\n- Reconcile conflicts and ensure coverage of critical sources: if you cite 25% automation (NL5YYTLF2) as a regime switch reference, keep it explicit in Movers and the Swing Trade rationale; if you mention tariff pass-through or debt dynamics, consistently tie each assertion to its ID and resolve any apparent tension between a constructive base-case and a risk-off alternative.\n- Remove extraneous sections and ensure a clean deliverable: four Movers lines (two Up, two Down) plus one Swing Trade line; drop the separate long Outlook narrative and any non-compliant base-case paragraphs. The result will be tight, testable, and decision-ready with explicit triggers, invalidations, and probability grounding.",
