  "title": "How Wall Street is responding to Trump's new tariffs on dozens of countries",
  "description": "U.S. tariffs went into effect Thursday morning for over 60 countries, but stocks are rising on Wall Street.",
  "content": "Stocks are rising on Wall Street Thursday, even as President Donald Trump\u2019s latest tariffs take effect on dozens of countries.\n\n\n\nThe S&P 500 added 0.6% and is flirting with its record, which was set late last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 182 points, or 0.4%, after a half hour of trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.1% higher.\n\n\n\nWorries are still high that Trump\u2019s tariffs are damaging the economy, particularly after last week\u2019s worse-than-expected report on the job market. But hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and a torrent of stronger-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies are helping to overshadow the concerns, at least for now. Lower interest rates can give the economy and investment prices a boost, though the downside is that they can also push inflation higher.\n\n\n\nThe Bank of England cut its main interest rate on Thursday in hopes of bolstering the sluggish U.K. economy.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. tariffs that took effect Thursday morning were also already well known, as well as lower than what Trump had initially threatened. Some countries are still trying to negotiate down the tax rates on their exports, and continued uncertainty seems to be the only certainty on Wall Street. All the while, the U.S. stock market faces criticism that it\u2019s climbed too far, too fast since hitting a bottom in April and left prices looking too expensive.\n\n\n\nThe latest reports on the U.S. economy came in mixed, meanwhile, which left Treasury yields relatively stable in the bond market.\n\n\n\nOne said that slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That could be an indication of rising layoffs, but the number remains within its recent range.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to see here!\u201d according to Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cThese are not nearly recession readings.\u201d\n\n\n\nA separate report said that productivity for U.S. workers improved by more during the spring than economists expected. That could help the U.S. economy grow without adding more pressure on inflation. And that\u2019s particularly important when Trump\u2019s tariffs look set to increase prices for all kinds of things that U.S. households and businesses buy.\n\n\n\nOn Wall Street, Apple helped lead the market amid hopes that its massive size can help it navigate Trump\u2019s economy. Its stock rose 3.1% after its CEO, Tim Cook, joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday to say it\u2019s increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years.\n\n\n\nTrump also announced a 100% tariff on imported computer chips, but he added \u201cif you\u2019re building in the United States of America, there\u2019s no charge.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLarge, cash-rich companies that can afford to build in America will be the ones to benefit the most,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \u201cIt\u2019s survival of the biggest.\u201d\n\n\n\nDoorDash climbed 3% after the food delivery app topped Wall Street\u2019s profit expectations for the latest quarter. It attracted new customers and saw the total number of orders increase.\n\n\n\nDuolingo, the language-learning app, soared 31.8% after it crushed Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The company said its subscription revenue grew 46% over the same period last year.\n\n\n\nThey helped offset a drop for Eli Lilly, which fell 13.9% even though the drugmaker reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Analysts said some investors were disappointed with results that Lilly provided for a late-stage study of its potential pill version of the popular weight-loss drug Zepbound.\n\n\n\nIntel slipped 1.7% after Trump called for its CEO to resign, while accusing him of being \u201chighly CONFLICTED,\u201d though he gave no evidence.\n\n\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia.\n\nStocks climbed 0.2% in Shanghai and 0.7% in Hong Kong after China reported that its exports picked up in July, helped by a flurry of shipments as businesses took advantage of a pause in Trump\u2019s tariff war with Beijing.\n\n\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 0.6%. Toyota Motor\u2019s stock fell after it cut its full-year earnings forecasts largely because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, but Sony rose after the entertainment and electronics company indicated it\u2019s taking less damage from the tariffs than it had expected.\n\n\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.22%, where it was late Wednesday.",
