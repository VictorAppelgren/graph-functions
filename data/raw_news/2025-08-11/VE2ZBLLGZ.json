  "description": "UFC's CEO reveals why he wanted David Ellison's muscle behind his MMA giant, why pay-per-view events no longer work, and what a potential UFC fight at the White House would look like on CBS.",
  "content": "The lord of the Octagon reveals why he wanted David Ellison's muscle behind his MMA giant, why pay-per-view events no longer work, and what a potential UFC fight at the White House would look like on CBS.\n\nhen David Ellison sat in the front row at a pair of UFC events in April and June, just a few seats away from Donald Trump, media analysts wondered whether the 42-year-old CEO of Skydance Media\u2014and son of the world\u2019s second richest man, Larry Ellison\u2014was using the opportunity to smooth over any political concerns about his $8 billion acquisition of Paramount. The deal, which was held up by Trump\u2019s FCC for months, officially closed last week, but it appears the merger wasn\u2019t the only multibillion-dollar deal Ellison was working on in those ringside seats.\n\nOn Monday, the Las Vegas-based UFC announced a seven-year, $7.7 billion media rights deal with Paramount to stream all of its fights on Paramount+ in the United States, with select events to be simulcast on CBS.\n\nUFC CEO Dana White tells Forbes he had a preexisting relationship with Larry Ellison and spoke with David at each of those events, one of many network executives looking to land the MMA behemoth. But it was Ellison who swooped in and knocked out the competition just days after the merger between his Skydance and Paramount was approved.\n\n\u201cThese guys came in aggressive with an all-or-nothing approach and said, We want the whole thing,\u201d White says. \u201cThe Ellisons are brilliant businessmen and have a whole game plan behind this thing. I can\u2019t wait to be in business with them.\u201d\n\nAt $1.1 billion per year in average annual value, the UFC will now earn nearly as much in media rights fees as MLB ($1.8 billion), the Olympics ($1.3 billion), March Madness ($1.1 billion) and Nascar ($1.1 billion), dwarfing the likes of the NHL ($635 million) and the PGA Tour ($700 million). And that figure only covers the United States. The UFC will continue to sell its international rights territory by territory through IMG, a category worth an estimated $250 million per year.\n\nUnlike other sports leagues, however, the UFC funds its own broadcast productions to maintain control over the look and feel of its events. Any talk of offloading those costs to a partner, and thus ceding control, was a non-starter. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like that until I leave,\u201d says the 56-year-old White.\n\nParamount\u2019s annual payouts nearly double the UFC\u2019s current media rights revenue from ESPN, the promotion\u2019s partner since 2019. The existing deal will continue through the end of 2025, and pays the UFC an estimated $350 million per year to distribute 30 UFC Fight Nights per year on ESPN+. Additionally, under the most recent extension signed in 2023, ESPN pays an estimated $250 million per year up front for the UFC\u2019s 13 \u201cnumbered\u201d events, which the network then offers to ESPN+ subscribers for an additional pay-per-view fee, keeping all of the PPV sales revenue.\n\nThe major change in this new deal is the elimination of the pay-per-view model that has been a bedrock of UFC programming since its inception in 1993.\n\nMark Shapiro, president and chief operating officer of UFC-parent company TKO Holdings, says UFC has wanted to ditch the PPV model since the beginning of negotiations with potential partners in February. At nearly $100 per month for fans to access both tiers of UFC events, he says the model had gotten too expensive for many fans, leading to a massive spike in pirated streams during the biggest events.\n\n\u201cThat's when we really knew the price point or the double paywall had gotten out of control,\u201d says Shapiro, who was previously head of programming and production at ESPN. \u201cWe were seeing piracy number up tenfold, which is what you see for big boxing pay-per-views.\u201d\n\nAs negotiations continued this summer, White and Shapiro assumed the UFC would need to divide its media rights package among several partners. At one point, they considered using as many as five different distributors, with Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery reportedly included among the suitors.\n\nOver time, Paramount emerged as the likely partner for Fight Nights, but conversations with multiple networks and streamers continued for the premium event rights until last Thursday when Ellison\u2019s Skydance officially took over Paramount and hammered out a deal for the entire package within 48 hours.\n\n\u201cEvery time we do a media rights deal it\u2019s monumental\u2014one, because obviously the money goes up,\u201d White says. \u201cAnd two, because you start looking at all the different things we can do with leveraging the assets they have and what their plan is for their business over the next five years.\u201d\n\nParamount stock was down slightly on Monday following news of the new streaming deal while TKO\u2019s stock was up more than 10 percent.\n\nWhite and Shapiro are confident that UFC fans will move en masse to the Paramount+ platform next year, showing the same loyalty to the brand as they did in 2012 when the UFC moved from Spike to Fox, and then again in 2019 with the move to ESPN.\n\nThe incoming Paramount leadership is no doubt counting on the bump. As of July 31, the company reported 77.7 million subscribers for its Paramount+ streaming service, trailing major competitors including Netflix (300 million), Amazon Prive Video (200 million), Disney+ (150 million) and HBO Max (125 million). According to Nielsen, Paramount+ accounts for just two percent of all TV viewing on a monthly basis.\n\nIn an effort to boost those figures, Ellison has already signed a $1.5 billion agreement to bring South Park to Paramount+, a deal that made the show\u2019s creators, Matt Parker and Trey Stone, billionaires. But the UFC deal is a far bigger bet that a year-round global sport can drive new viewers to the platform, slow subscriber churn, and increase engagement.\n\nNow as the exclusive home of the UFC, Ellison has made the MMA promotion a pillar of the new Paramount. The political implications of such an association\u2014given Trump\u2019s affinity for combat sports and personal friendship with White\u2014cannot be ignored.\n\nWhite confirms plans to host a UFC event at the White House around July 4, 2026, a \u201cone of one\u201d experience similar to the UFC\u2019s event at the Sphere in Las Vegas last fall, which he says would almost certainly be broadcast on CBS. White, who has long had the president on speed dial, says he had yet to hear from Trump regarding the new deal.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d White says with a laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure he will. He always does.\u201d",

      "text": "With billions at stake for its upcoming media rights deal, the Las Vegas-based fight promotion is creating its biggest spectacle yet. An exclusive look at the knockout production.\nBy Matt Craig, Forbes Staff\nFor all the grandeur of the Sphere, with its state-of-the-art, $2.3 billion dome and its 160,000-square-foot screen, Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White\u2019s plan to bring the first sporting event to the entertainment venue came together some seven miles away, on the dusty outskirts of Las Vegas\u2014in a storage closet.\nThe 55-year-old White says he sets up specialized rooms for all his ventures so he can visualize the information. He wanted to rent an external space and build a replica of the Sphere he could walk through, but his team advised him that spare space inside UFC headquarters would be more budget conscious. Within a week, a closet was cleared out and filled with schematics, renderings and storyboards that would lay out the most extravagant event in UFC history.\n\u201cThis is a completely different animal than anything we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d says White, who granted Forbes exclusive access to the closet and detailed his ambitious plan for UFC 306 on September 14. \u201cI knew this wasn\u2019t going to be cheap, but I literally said I don\u2019t [care] what this costs. This is, on Mexican Independence Day, my love letter to the Mexican people.\u201d\nInitially, no one at the company, including White, had any idea how expensive it would be to stage a promotion at the 18,600-seat venue. When the CFO at TKO Group Holdings, UFC\u2019s New York City-based parent company, asked what the budget might be for the event, UFC executive vice present and chief content officer Craig Borsari estimated $8 million. \u201cI guessed high,\u201d Borsari says, and considering the most expensive UFC pay-per-view to date had cost a little over $2 million to produce, \u201cI thought it would easily be covered.\u201d\nIn the end, it cost White and Borsari more than $20 million to realize their vision for UFC 306 (each UFC pay-per-view event is numbered, going back to UFC 1 in November 1993). Saturday\u2019s spectacle will include six short film segments before each fight tracking Mexican history from the dawn of man through to hundreds of years in the future, each with its own animated graphics, practical effects and elaborately costumed octagon girls.\nAll told, it\u2019s the work of more than 300 creatives, and another 150 on fight night\u2014including multiple Emmy winners, Golden Globe winners and Oscar nominees\u2014all hoping to prove that live sports in the Sphere is viable, and perhaps even spectacular, both for attendees and viewers around the globe.\n\u201cObviously this whole plan was conceived with a path to profitability, but having said that, that\u2019s secondary when it comes to this one-and-done event,\u201d says TKO\u2019s president and chief operating officer, Mark Shapiro. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll make an investment that financially doesn\u2019t pencil out, but long term it ends up delivering all kinds of upside, and that\u2019s really the logic and rationale behind our strategy with the Sphere event.\u201d\nFor TKO, a company founded last September when Ari Emanuel\u2019s Endeavor merged UFC and WWE into one $20 billion publicly traded entity, the real money is made from media rights. Nearly two-thirds of TKO\u2019s $851 million in revenue last quarter came from the category, including UFC\u2019s current pact with ESPN, which expires at the end of 2025. Negotiations are expected to begin early next year. In other words, now is the perfect time for a noisy, attention-grabbing event.\n\u201cIt is an important step for them to show how big UFC can be,\u201d says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cTo the degree that they are going all-in and spending the resources that the company has, it seems to be trying to take UFC to a different level.\u201d\nIn a stock report dating from early August, MoffettNathanson projects UFC\u2019s next media rights deal could fetch roughly $450 million per year, up from $300 million on the current deal. The rights to pay-per-view events, which ESPN currently pays UFC an additional $260 million per year for, according to the report\u2019s estimates, could be worth another $450 million in the next cycle (ESPN pays UFC upfront and collects all money from the individual PPV buys, a new wrinkle in their two-year extension of the original five-year deal from 2018). The primary questions, Fishman says, are whether media companies think of UFC as a \u201cmust have\u201d sport or a \u201cnice to have\u201d sport, and whether Disney (the parent company of ESPN) will be willing to spend that much, especially after recently agreeing to an 11-year deal to broadcast NBA games\u2014and the Finals\u2014for $2.6 billion a year, nearly double what it pays now.\nIf UFC 306 proves to be the \u201cbrand-builder\u201d that Shapiro believes it will be, then it could serve as a strong signal to media partners, sponsors and other venues across the world. Recently, UFC has found more sites willing to pay to bring an event to their city, including an estimated $25 million to host a pay-per-view in Abu Dhabi, $20 million for a fight night in Saudi Arabia, and mid-seven figures for events in New Jersey and Australia in the past year. Shapiro says he hopes to expand the category in the future. In the case of the Sphere, it\u2019s UFC that is paying to rent the venue.\nWhite brushes aside the notion that UFC\u2019s Sphere event serves as a commercial for potential suitors, or that the resources of TKO played any role in it coming together. \u201cI\u2019d have done this no matter what,\u201d he says.\nThe Sphere has been White\u2019s obsession since he attended a U2 concert there last September, thanks to a surprise invitation from NFL legend Tom Brady. Watching from his seat in Sphere owner James Dolan\u2019s box, White was not only dazzled; he was inspired. He called Borsari the next day.\n\u201cWhatever your plans are next weekend, cancel them,\u201d White remembers saying. \u201cYou\u2019re coming to the Sphere. I have an idea.\u201d\nImmediately, Borsari saw challenges for staging a sporting event in the arena. The lighting rig that normally hangs above the center of the UFC octagon would block the Sphere\u2019s screen, so the production crew needed to devise a never-before-tested system of trusses mounted behind the Sphere\u2019s LED panels, from which they could hang cameras and lights that shine through preexisting holes in the panels, all without melting them. The fan experience was also an issue because, despite its shape, the Sphere does not feature 360-degree seating, and the normally coveted ringside chairs have the worst view of the giant screen.\nThen there was the broadcast to consider. To capture the magnitude of the Sphere screen, UFC hired a team to shoot it using specialty cameras and ultra-wide lenses, in addition to the regular in-venue and broadcast crews. UFC 306 will require 45 cameras, compared with 20 at a regular event, and four production trucks, instead of the usual two, to translate the Sphere experience to a TV audience. \u201cCan that be done?\u201d White says. \u201cWho knows?\u201d\nAs the plans came together, the Sphere itself continued to host nightly shows\u2014including a Dead & Co. residency\u2014leaving very little availability to test the setup. UFC\u2019s first run-through, in late July, was staged from 2 a.m. to 7 a.m. White remembers it well. He says he was up all night, physically ill from the stress. Then, after watching just one of the short films, even in a 50% rendered form, he was so relieved he told Borsari he might as well go home.\nLess than two weeks from the event, nobody had seen fully rendered versions of the films. Because of the size and resolution of the Sphere\u2019s screen, an astounding 16,000 x 16,000 pixels, even the smallest change takes 10 days to render. UFC built a server farm on location to minimize variables during the rendering process, and in late August, Borsari said it was \u201cpencils down\u201d on creative changes. That is, until White, ever the perfectionist, ordered a reshoot on one of the ring walk videos over Labor Day weekend so the fighters\u2019 teams would appear behind them, just as they will on fight night.\nThese are details that both men admit most viewers won\u2019t even notice. Or worse, a TV viewer could get up and go to the bathroom between fights and completely miss one of the 90-second films, nullifying some $3 million in expenditure. \u201cThat kills me,\u201d White says.\nStill, UFC 306 has the potential to recoup its investment. The company expects the highest gate revenue in UFC history\u2014a record currently held by UFC 205, a 2016 card with Conor McGregor in Madison Square Garden that had gate receipts north of $17 million.\nAnd being the first to figure out the logistics of sports at the Sphere comes with more creative ways to monetize a production. When White and Borsari toured the TKO board of directors through the storage closet-turned-war room in mid-August, board member Jonathan Kraft told them they ought to seek out a patent for the company\u2019s setup, cashing in when any other live sports want to host an event at the Sphere.\nWhite says he doubts any other sports promotions will be crazy enough to spend so much on one event, but he has allowed himself to dream equally big with his post-event plans. His goal is to be nominated for an Emmy, a Grammy and an Oscar, and then cut a deal to sell an edited version of UFC 306 back to the Sphere as a more permanent attraction.\nBut he\u2019s the first to admit that the event\u2019s success isn\u2019t entirely in his control. \u201cAll the bells and whistles and all the $20 million I spent means [nothing] if the fights aren\u2019t amazing that night,\u201d White says. \u201cWe won't know until the end of the last fight that night whether the whole concept even works.\u201d"

      "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s genius marketing instincts forged a political movement. Now his pugnacious style has inspired a more tribal business model. And nobody embodies that better than UFC\u2019s combative chairman.\nBy Matt Craig, Forbes Staff\nWalking out of the tunnel at T-Mobile Arena for UFC 310 in Las Vegas, Dana White is greeted like a mixed martial arts champion, rather than the suit who pays them. Fans shout his name, initiate high fives and lean in for selfies. \u201cYou\u2019re the greatest man in the world,\u201d one tells him after snapping a photo.\nThe 55-year-old CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship takes it all in stride. \u201cThank you so much for helping our president,\u201d says another. \u201cRight?\u201d White responds. \u201cThank God we won.\u201d\nOver the past two decades, White has turned mixed martial arts, or MMA, into a global phenomenon and, in turn, made his UFC into a behemoth, generating an estimated $1.3 billion in revenue last year\u2014with staggering margins (Ebitda) of almost 60%. Along the way he\u2019s become more famous than any of the fighters who step into his Octagon and amassed a net worth that Forbes estimates to be more than $600 million. \u201cPeople ask me all the time, \u2018Did you ever envision this? Did you ever think it would be this big?\u2019 \u201d White tells Forbes. \u201cAnd the answer is always yes.\u201d\nWhite leveraged that fame, fortuitously concentrated among a large swath of young, politically apathetic males, to support Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 election triumph. First, he provided Trump with pop-culture cover when few others would. They were often seen side by side for UFC ring walks after he left office amid the stench of the January 6 insurrection, again after his federal indictment for election interference in 2023 and continuing through last year\u2019s presidential campaign. He also coordinated Trump\u2019s appearances on numerous bro-heavy podcasts\u2014most notably with longtime UFC announcer Joe Rogan. That combination served as a backbone for turning out a demographic famously resistant to voter turnout efforts, swamping the impact of more traditional Hollywood celebrities who came out in support of Kamala Harris.\n\u201cIf we took all of that out\u2014the walkouts at the UFC, all the stuff he did with all the influencers,\u201d White says, \u201cand he\u2019s only on Fox for the last however many years, there\u2019s no way we win this election.\u201d\nThere\u2019s something even bigger at play here. Trump\u2019s genius marketing instincts\u2014his ability to dominate narratives and news cycles, to speak simply and consistently, pesky facts and nuances be damned\u2014translated even better to politics than business. White has also proven how that works in reverse\u2014that the Trump-era anti-establishment norms that reward pugnaciousness and tribalism, revel in taboos and ignore personal scandals, represent an ascendant business model. You can see it in Elon Musk\u2019s much-aped transformation, the logic-defying meme stocks and digital tokens, the embrace of social media influencers, podcasters and other direct ways to speak to an enormous audience.\nCall it populist capitalism. And no one embodies it better than White, a self-described moderate who professes to lean slightly left, whose clannishness proved ahead of this curve. \u201cWe are all viciously loyal to each other,\u201d White says of his inner circle.\n\u201cIf I was in a fight, I\u2019d want that dude in a foxhole with me,\u201d Ari Emanuel, executive chair and CEO of UFC parent company TKO Group Holdings, says of White. \u201cAnd I know he\u2019d be there.\u201d\nThis us-against-the-world business formula has proven potent before, particularly in outlaw industries from porn to gambling to weed. White, however, has taken it mainstream. UFC is now bigger in America than golf or hockey, whether measured by television money or cultural resonance. In January, Mark Zuckerberg, in full MAGA pivot mode, added White to Meta\u2019s board. Sure, for his media chops\u2014and perhaps any grappling tips he might share with the Facebook cofounder and jiu-jitsu blue belt\u2014but also because of his access to the pinnacles of power and the perceived loyalty those running the country have toward him. White was, after all, seated directly behind George W. Bush and Barack Obama\u2014and in front of several heads of state\u2014at Trump\u2019s second inauguration.\nWhite isn\u2019t shy about flexing his connection. Settling into his front-row seat in Las Vegas for the night\u2019s pay-per-view card, a de facto command center with three TV monitors, a phone with a direct line to the production truck, a printout of the night\u2019s matchups he himself set and a seating chart of the VIP section that he personally curated, White looks at his vibrating phone and beams. He then reads the text aloud, withholding the name of the sender until the end for dramatic effect.\n\u201cI\u2019m on a brand new Gulf Stream 650 flying at 9.2 over the Atlantic from France, where I got the UFC treatment at the reopening of the beautiful Notre-Dame cathedral,\u201d the text reads. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is this plane doesn\u2019t have a television. So I won\u2019t be able to watch your great fights tonight and I am not happy about it. I\u2019ve become very spoiled and I assume that all planes come with high-grade televisions, but actually when you think about it there are many bigger problems in the world right now that need to be fixed. I\u2019ll catch the next fight. Tell Joe Rogan I said hi. Donald J. Trump.\u201d\nTo\nget a clear view of White\u2019s business style, look no further than the high-roller room at Las Vegas\u2019 Fontainebleau hotel on the night before UFC 310. White takes a seat at a baccarat table and asks for $1 million in chips. A crowd packs in shoulder-to-shoulder and three separate camera crews jockey for position to watch White play, his chiseled frame and bald head unmistakable between the young YouTube creators who sit on either side of him.\nWhite has long been a regular at the local casinos. After splitting time in his childhood between Massachusetts and Las Vegas, raised primarily by his mother, a nurse, due to his father\u2019s alcoholism, he moved permanently to Sin City at age 25. But rather than chase the quick, ephemeral buck, he built his fortune the old-fashioned way: building and selling. His stake in the UFC turned into a nine-figure payday when the company sold in 2016, and he maintains ownership shares in current UFC parent company TKO Group Holdings while growing a pair of new ventures.\nStill, he wagers seven figures at the tables nearly every night he\u2019s in town. Formerly a voracious blackjack player, White now claims that he has learned how to spot patterns on a baccarat board. This is magical thinking, of course. Like roulette, baccarat is basically a game of luck\u2014albeit with the lowest house advantage in the casino\u2014with each hand providing its own independent outcome. Spotting patterns makes as much sense as believing a coin will come up heads just because it\u2019s been tails five straight times.\nBut in a world of meme stocks and meme coins, conviction trumps logic. And so White places the maximum $300,000 they\u2019ll allow on six straight bets\u2014and wins five of them. \u201cThat\u2019s $1.1 million for me,\u201d he says, casually standing up. \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d\nWhite is too smart to know this night is anything but luck\u2014but he\u2019s also smart enough to know such fearless risk-taking buttresses his no-holds-barred image. When it comes time to leave, White takes the haul in actual cash and puts it into a trash bag, a perfect everyman touch. \u201cIt becomes almost addicting,\u201d he says of risk, though that could just as easily be true of the publicity, which\u2014as Trump has demonstrated\u2014offers much better odds.\nThat high-low showmanship explains why the UFC survived and thrives. Founded in 1993 by Art Davie, Rorion Gracie and Bob Meyrowitz, its early contests were bloodthirsty brawls with no judges, weight classes or time limits. At UFC 1, five of the eight competitors ended up in the hospital, with one leaving his teeth in the crowd. Senator John McCain famously called the sport \u201chuman cockfighting\u201d in 1996, leading a campaign that saw dozens of states and multiple pay-per-view providers ban UFC, sending the company to the edge of bankruptcy.\nBut White, a college dropout who was operating boxing gyms around Las Vegas and managing a few UFC fighters, saw opportunity. He suggested an investment to two former high school classmates, Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, billionaire heirs to the Station Casino fortune, with whom he practiced jiu-jitsu. In January 2001 the brothers closed a deal to acquire UFC for $2 million, giving White a 10% stake and installing him as president.\n\u201cAt the time, I think it was a pretty controversial pick, because Dana had never run a business,\u201d says Lorenzo Fertitta, who is worth $3.1 billion according to Forbes estimates. \u201cBut he had this incredible drive\u2014like, he\u2019s so competitive, he would literally run through a wall to make it work.\u201d\n\u201cLooking back,\u201d he adds, \u201cif me and my brother had said, \u2018We\u2019re going to go out and hire a Harvard MBA,\u2019 we would\u2019ve been toast.\u201d\nWith the Fertittas, White began to execute a playbook that feels familiar today: Take something popular but unsavory and use alternative channels to promote it and take it mainstream. His goal was to create something never done in combat sports: a brand, similar to the NBA or NFL, that fans could trust regardless of the individual fighters competing.\nThe reborn company found an early ally in Trump, who hosted the new team\u2019s first two UFC events at his Taj Mahal hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. (As for Trump\u2019s failed attempt to launch a competing MMA venture in 2008, White laughs and replies, \u201cI\u2019ll never say anything bad about Donald Trump.\u201d)\nYet broadcasters continued to be turned off by MMA\u2019s brutal violence. \u201cPorn was on pay-per-view,\u201d White says incredulously, \u201cbut UFC was not allowed.\u201d He began working with veteran TV producer Craig Piligian to develop a reality show that could serve as a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d to get MMA on the air. After numerous rejections, Spike TV agreed to air the program, but only if UFC paid its production costs, around $10 million for the season. The Fertittas, who had already sunk more than $30 million into the company with little return (at one point even asking White to explore a sale), agreed to make one final gamble.\nThe Ultimate Fighter debuted in 2005 and became an immediate ratings hit for Spike. And because UFC retained 100% ownership of its rights, when Spike renewed the show for additional seasons and eventually broadcast UFC\u2019s live events, it cashed in.\nThe show was also a turning point for White, who gave what Piligian has called \u201cthe single greatest speech delivered on a reality television show,\u201d a profanity-laced tirade asking the contestants, \u201cDo you want to be a fighter?\u201d\nLike other reality TV stars of the era, including Trump on The Apprentice, White embraced the attention gained by saying outrageous things on camera. An early adopter of Twitter, he was also known to mix it up with fans online.\nBy 2010, UFC was valued at $2 billion when it sold a 10% stake to Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, son of one of the richest men in Abu Dhabi. The following year, UFC landed a lucrative new broadcast deal with Fox, and the Fertittas soon began receiving offers that were too big to ignore. In 2016, the brothers sold UFC to WME-IMG (now Endeavor) for more than $4 billion. White\u2019s take: $360 million before taxes.\nEmanuel, both Endeavor\u2019s CEO and White\u2019s former agent, wanted White to stay on after the sale and promised he would be able to continue operating the business as he saw fit. He was rewarded for that decision in 2020, when the pandemic shut down the sports world.\nComfortable with risk and skeptical of Covid restrictions, White saw no reason why he couldn\u2019t stage fight nights just a few weeks after the start of the pandemic at a UFC-owned facility in Las Vegas, with no crowds and social distancing in place. Nevada\u2019s Democratic governor, Steve Sisolak, squashed the plan.\nWhite never forgot. \u201cIf you cross him,\u201d says former UFC champion Forrest Griffin, who now works for the company as VP of athlete development, \u201cit\u2019s scorched-earth. He\u2019s going to burn you out.\u201d During the next election cycle, he endorsed and gave money to Sisolak\u2019s opponent, Republican Joe Lombardo, who won a narrow victory.\nIn the meantime, White found venues in Florida and Abu Dhabi that allowed him to put on UFC events beginning in May 2020. As the first sport to return to live events, the UFC increased its visibility and became a champion among conservatives. \u201cI\u2019m not a go-and-hide-in-my-house kind of guy,\u201d White says. \u201cWe ran our business through Covid. Everybody got paid, we honored every contract. And our business grew something crazy, like 77%.\u201d\nBy the time Endeavor merged World Wrestling Entertainment with the UFC to form the publicly traded TKO Group Holdings in 2023, UFC was valued at $12.1 billion. (White maintains ownership shares in the combined company.)\nNow, TV networks and streamers will wage their own fight to broadcast the UFC. A deal with ESPN signed in 2019 pays the company $300 million a year for programming and another estimated $260 million in pay-per-view rights. Analysts predict its next deal, which has reportedly drawn competing interest from Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix, might fetch $900 million annually combined, more than the NHL and PGA Tour earn each year. Additionally, UFC makes more than $400 million a year from its sponsorships, live events and licensing. It\u2019s also astonishingly profitable, with $755 million in Ebitda on $1.3 billion in sales in 2023.\nMeanwhile, White continues to shape the UFC in his pugnacious image. Without him, it\u2019s hard to imagine the company would have spent 10 times its normal event budget to host the first sporting event inside Las Vegas\u2019 state-of-the-art Sphere, or publicly criticize a major sponsor that asked him to take down a social media post supporting Trump. White, like an Octagon veteran, knows no mode other than to attack. \u201cI\u2019m at a point in my life and my career where I want to be aligned with my sponsors,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I found out through Covid who I was aligned with and who I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nWith populist capitalism, it should be noted, ideology comes second to loyalty. In late 2023, White signed Bud Light to a sponsorship deal reportedly worth more than $100 million over six years. Despite boycotts from conservatives over a social media collaboration with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, White defended the beer publicly\u2014and petitioned Trump to do the same. Before Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024, Trump suggested on Truth Social that Bud Light deserved a second chance, parroting many of White\u2019s talking points.\nWhite also maintains a chokehold over his athletes\u2019 pay. Fighters are locked into long-term, incentive-heavy contracts that pay out only when they fight, which is to say when White, the head matchmaker, decides they will. The system is being challenged by a pair of antitrust class-action suits, the first of which was settled in October for $375 million.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a situation where the UFC essentially owns the sport,\u201d says Eric Cramer, lead attorney for the fighters. \u201cSo if you want to fight for the championship, or the only championship that matters, you basically have to please Dana White.\u201d\nFour floors above the casino at the Fontainebleau, a ballroom hosts White\u2019s newest combat spectacle. Hoping to execute the same blueprint that built UFC, White, the Fertittas and Piligian each invested around $1 million in late 2022 to found Power Slap, a league in which contestants take turns open-hand slapping each other into oblivion. White can explain the nuances of slap fighting technique in detail, but for those in attendance, the snapping sound of each blow draws feral outbursts.\nVideos of the brutal knockouts have drawn millions of views on social media\u2014and plenty of critics. The Brain Injury Association of America wrote an open letter to Nevada\u2019s athletic commission calling the nascent sport \u201cnothing short of watching traumatic brain injury happen to its participants in real time.\u201d\nWhite relishes the criticism\u2014at this stage, all publicity, he seems to think, is good publicity. This too echoes Trump\u2019s successes and his ability, unprecedented in American history, to shrug off scandals, from felony convictions to sexual assault judgments, that would sink anyone else ten times over.\nWhite has experience here also. In a 2011 unauthorized biography of her son, White\u2019s mother, June, accused him of having multiple affairs, including with UFC ring girls and his wife\u2019s own sister. White has never addressed the accusations publicly, and when asked about his parents\u2019 death in a 2023 interview, he said, \u201cI had almost no feelings about it, to be honest with you.\u201d Amid the Power Slap launch, a video surfaced of White slapping his wife, an incident for which he said there was \u201cno excuse\u201d and embarrassed their three college-age kids.\nNo matter. Populism embraces\u2014and, it seems, endlessly forgives\u2014outlaws. White claims that Power Slap can be even bigger than the UFC. \u201cWhen everybody\u2019s saying how horrible it is, you know you\u2019ve got something good,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually been fun for me because it\u2019s almost like if you built this incredible business, then you had the chance to go back and do it all again. And it\u2019s almost identically the same.\u201d\nJust as he used reality TV to reach his core demographic in the 2000s, White has focused his efforts this time on building relationships with influential internet creators. He gambles with them, gives them front row seats to events and offers free rein to mingle and create whatever content they want. \u201cThis is what we do now, this is my whole philosophy,\u201d White says. \u201cPower Slap was built on the internet.\u201d\nWith their help, Power Slap already has 35 sponsors and a media rights deal with conservative-leaning livestreaming platform Rumble. White says the league receives $2.5 million per event from the Fontainebleau and earned at least $4.5 million from a branded mobile game. Forbes estimates the company had $50 million in revenue in 2024, with less than $25,000 spent on marketing each event.\n\u201cIf you want to take these kids and have them do something for you, you have to pay them a shitload of money. They do it for free for me, and they spend their own money to come,\u201d White says. \u201cI\u2019m looked at as, like, the godfather of the influencers.\u201d\nAgain, politics and business blended seamlessly for White in 2024, notably the overlap between his curated \u201cmanosphere\u201d\u2014with creators like the Nelk Boys, Theo Von and Barstool Sports\u2014and young male Trump voters. Over the course of the presidential campaign, White coordinated Trump\u2019s appearances on their podcasts, eventually securing the participation of Rogan, whom White says initially refused to do any political content. The Trump episode, which aired two weeks before the election, rang up more than 55 million views on YouTube.\nThe day before the election, White says he was aboard a plane headed for Mar-a-Lago texting Rogan. \u201cI was like, \u2018You have to endorse him,\u2019 \u201d he recalls. \u201c \u2018Who are you voting for, Joe? Who are you voting for?\u2019 \u201d Rogan tweeted his official support at 9 p.m. on November 4, and the next night, White was called to the microphone during Trump\u2019s victory speech and thanked the podcasters by name.\nWhite says he received so many text messages after the election asking for his help that he had to change his phone number for the first time in 15 years. Nearly every day since, he says, entrepreneurs come to his Las Vegas office to ask for help raising money or marketing their products.\nIt\u2019s there, surrounded by a suit of Samurai armor and a saber-toothed tiger fossil, next door to the infrared therapy bed and cold plunge he uses every morning, that White plans the future. His next target: boxing, which two generations ago was in the pantheon of American sports but now struggles to compete with his UFC. It\u2019s hard not to think of Trump\u2019s gut-level reaction to last summer\u2019s assassination attempt\u2014\u201cfight!\u201d\u2014in pretty much everything White does.\n\u201cMy philosophy has always been that fighting is in our DNA as human beings,\u201d he says. \u201cNo matter what color you are, what country you come from, what language you speak, we like fighting.\u201d"

      "text": "David Ellison, son of software centi-billionaire Larry Ellison, nurtured a relationship with Paramount over the past 15 years as a movie producer. His father\u2019s fortune and political status also scored points.\nThe Federal Communications Commission greenlit the $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media on Thursday, 383 days after the deal was first announced. The merger, which is set to close on August 7, will transform Larry Ellison, 80, and his son David Ellison, 42, into one of the most powerful duos in Hollywood, wielding influence over TV shows, movies, news and more. As Paramount\u2019s chairman, CEO and owner of 50% of its voting rights, David Ellison will oversee an entertainment empire with more than 1,200 film titles, including everything from \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d to a remake of \u201cIt\u2019s A Wonderful Life,\u201d plus distribution rights to another 2,400 films. Other crown jewels include popular channels MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime and CBS News. But it\u2019s his father who controls the purse strings and owns the equity, according to regulatory filings. The elder Ellison may have helped get the deal over the hump in other ways, too.\nThe merger was approved only after some key concessions from both parties. Paramount agreed to pay President Trump $16 million\u2014to be used for his future presidential library\u2014in July to resolve a lawsuit over 60 Minutes\u2019 edit of a 2024 interview of Kamala Harris. (A couple of weeks later, CBS said it would end Trump critic Stephen Colbert\u2019s late night show next May, citing cost overruns.) Ellison\u2019s Skydance, meanwhile, had to make written commitments promising that the company\u2019s programming would embody \u201ca diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum\u201d and that it would \u201cadopt measures that can root out the bias that has undermined trust in the national news media,\u201d per the FCC\u2019s letter announcing the decision.\nAnother late change had to do with Ellison\u2019s control. FCC filings from September 2024 initially showed that David\u2019s father, Oracle cofounder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison, the second richest person on earth, held all of the voting and equity shares in the Pinnacle Media Ventures holding companies acquiring the Paramount stake. These shares were held through his Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust, the same entity that owns his Oracle shares and most of his estimated $1.5 billion in real estate. Per these filings, the Ellison family also owned 67% of the equity and 78% of the voting rights in Skydance in part via Sayonara LLC, a parent company of the Pinnacle entities. (Ellison, a devotee of Japanese art and architecture, named Sayonara\u2019s three subsidiaries Aozora, Hikouki and Furaito, Japanese words meaning \u201cblue sky,\u201d \u201cairplane\u201d and \u201cflight.\u201d) In October 2024, an amendment filed with the FCC changed the voting rights so that David Ellison held 100% of the Pinnacle entities\u2019 voting interest, but dad kept the equity.\nThere was yet another change in mid-July. This time David\u2019s voting rights in post-merger Paramount were reduced to 50%; his father Larry got 27.5%, according to FCC filings. That means no single shareholder can outvote David, but it also means that he needs his father to approve everything from budgets to key investments. (Larry Ellison appears to control all of the Ellison family\u2019s approximately 26% equity stake tied to those voting shares in post-merger Paramount, plus at least 10% more with no voting power, assuming all existing shareholders choose to receive their maximum cashout. On top of that, the Ellisons also own another 6.7% equity stake through Skydance Entertainment Group, per the initial 2024 filing, although it\u2019s unclear how that\u2019s split between father and son.) If his dad ever decided to team up with Gerry Cardinale\u2019s RedBird Capital, which invested in David\u2019s Skydance in 2020 and controls the remaining 22.5% of the vote, the two parties could block David Ellison. David Ellison could also sway RedBird if his father disagreed.\nThe main reason for the change, at least two sources say, has more to do with money than power. \u201c From a voting standpoint, David Ellison will be in control through his entities, but the taxable benefits will flow to Larry,\u201d says Los Angeles-based mergers and acquisitions lawyer Alex Davis, who is not involved in the transaction. Davis says the changes were probably due to regulatory reasons and are not unusual. \u201cHis profitable businesses could benefit from any kind of taxable losses or depreciation with this business.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Skydance declined to comment. RedBird, David Ellison and the FCC did not respond to a request for comment before publication.\nIt\u2019s possible that President Trump\u2019s taking office in January also had something to do with it, too. While David Ellison met with both Trump and FCC Chair Brendan Carr ahead of the deal\u2019s approval, he also donated around $1 million to Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign in February 2024. Meanwhile, Larry Ellison and Trump have a longstanding relationship. In January, Ellison showed up at the White House to help Trump announce his $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure initiative. And Trump told reporters that same month that he\u2019d be open to an Ellison-led deal to buy TikTok, for which Trump has extended its sell-by date to September. Plus, Ellison has promised an overhaul of Paramount-owned CBS\u2014potentially seeded by Skydance\u2019s vow to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to run CBS really well, and I think he\u2019s making a good deal to buy it. I think he\u2019s great,\u201d Trump said of Larry Ellison at a July 3 rally.\nOracle is reportedly in talks to have Paramount and Skydance run on the same Oracle-provided cloud technology, worth $100 million per year. That\u2019s a pittance for Ellison, who\u2019s worth more than $290 billion, and earns more than $1 billion (before taxes) each year in Oracle dividends alone.\nAs for how David shares in that wealth, it\u2019s somewhat of a black box\u2014intentionally. Larry Ellison put 90,000 shares into a trust for his two children, David and Megan, at Oracle\u2019s IPO in 1994. (They were three years and two months old at the time, respectively.) If the trust had held onto those shares, they\u2019d be worth more than $4 billion today. But there is little paper trail since. After the 1994 prospectus, the children\u2019s trust was mentioned intermittently, then for the last time in a 2012 filing. By then, David and Megan were listed as having 933,334 Oracle shares via their trust. That's a fraction of what they should have had by then on a split-adjusted basis, meaning that millions of shares were either distributed directly to them; swapped out of the trust for other assets; sold as part of diversification or some combination of all three. What we do know is that David and Megan also got shares in NetSuite, a pioneering cloud computing company in which their dad was an early investor. When Oracle bought NetSuite in 2016 for $9.3 billion, David pocketed some $370 million (pre-tax) that today could be worth as much as $550 million.\nSkydance, Paramount and Larry Ellison have been intertwined from the start. In 2008, Larry Ellison incorporated Sayonara LLC for \u201cmedia production investments,\u201d months after he started reporting pledges of his Oracle shares as collateral for lines of credit, around the time David and Megan Ellison were gearing up to start Skydance and production studio Annapurna Pictures in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Per FCC filings, Sayonara LLC is one of the entities that owns the Ellisons\u2019 controlling Skydance stake. In 2009, David Ellison raised $350 million, some from his father, to finance a five-year agreement with Paramount to co-produce movies. He notched his first big hit with The Coen brothers\u2019 Oscar-nominated 2010 film \u201cTrue Grit,\u201d the first feature film produced by Skydance, which grossed more than $250 million worldwide on a $38 million budget. As of mid-2024, Skydance had produced or co-financed 35 feature films, 24 of which were in partnership with Paramount, per regulatory filings. In 2023, Skydance lost $54 million on nearly $1 billion in revenue. (Meanwhile, Megan\u2019s Annapurna Pictures, known for critically acclaimed films including \u201cHer\u201d and \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d reportedly struggled with hundreds of millions in debt and flirted with filing for bankruptcy protection\u2014eventually resolved with her father\u2019s help.)\nAlthough it\u2019s not known whether Ellison uses his pledged Oracle shares to finance Annapurna, Skydance or possibly the latter\u2019s merger with Paramount, it\u2019s likely, according to Davis. As of September 2024, Ellison had pledged 277 million shares, or $47 billion worth, of Oracle stock, to \u201csecure personal term loans only used to fund outside personal business ventures,\u201d per a regulatory filing. Regardless, the fact that David Ellison has relied so heavily on his dad to help finance Skydance and now Paramount suggests that he may not yet have access to much if any of his Oracle shares. And while David, of course, will be running Paramount as CEO, behind closed doors, no one quite knows how Larry and David will coexist."

      "text": "After signing a new $1.5 billion deal with Paramount, Trey Parker and Matt Stone are part of Hollywood\u2019s most elite club.\nIf you piss off South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, they will make you pay\u2014both financially and satirically. On July 2, after Comedy Central delayed the Season 27 premiere of the show because Paramount, the network\u2019s parent company, was locked in a contentious negotiation for its streaming rights\u2014in the midst of months-long acquisition of Paramount by David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media\u2014Parker and Stone issued a statement on X.com and let it rip: \u201cThis merger is a shit show,\u201d the duo wrote, \u201cand it's fucking up South Park.\u201d\nBoth transactions were resolved this week, as Parker and Stone agreed Monday to a five-year, $1.5 billion streaming deal that will bring South Park to Paramount+ globally. And Thursday, the FCC officially approved the Skydance acquisition. The deal cements the duo\u2019s place as the highest-paid TV showrunners in Hollywood and made the 55-year-old Parker and the 54-year-old Stone billionaires\u2014worth an estimated $1.2 billion each.\nBut the new agreement\u2014which will pay the pair at least $250 million per year\u2014didn\u2019t end Paramount\u2019s headaches. In South Park\u2019s season premiere, which aired Wednesday, Donald Trump is depicted in bed with Satan, and Jesus is seen warning the show\u2019s young protagonists about the dangers of provoking him. \u201cYou guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount,\u201d says the Jesus character. \u201cYou really want to end up like Colbert?\u201d\nThe comedically fearless Parker and Stone now enter television\u2019s rare billionaire creative class, joining Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Dick Wolf and Jerry Seinfeld in the three-comma club.\nThat astonishing amount of money is a testament to the enduring popularity of South Park, which has been a cultural phenomenon since its debut on Comedy Central in 1997, becoming, in just its second season, the highest-rated non-sports program in basic cable history, with nearly six million viewers. Over the years it became indispensable to Comedy Central, and its 300-plus episodes have now become bulk inventory that re-air dozens of times per week.\nParker and Stone\u2019s real coup came in 2007, when the creators and their lawyer and business partner, Kevin Morris, struck a deal with the network to play South Park episodes online using a rudimentary Flash video player, agreeing to split the then-non-existent digital revenues 50-50 \u201cin perpetuity.\u201d\nThen came the streaming revolution. Hulu licensed the show\u2019s streaming rights in 2014 for $87.5 million and reupped for $110 million through 2019. HBO Max then won a bidding war over Peacock, Netflix and others to become South Park\u2019s exclusive domestic streaming home for $550 million over five years. That deal expired in June.\nInstead of just pocketing their half of the HBO deal, in 2021 Parker and Stone negotiated for a new arrangement with Paramount (which owns Comedy Central) for a guaranteed $155 million a year in exchange for creating new episodes of the show and their portion of the streaming revenue. Monday\u2019s agreement renegotiated the terms of that deal, upping the annual payout to $250 million.\nParker and Stone pour that wealth into Park County, not only the location of South Park\u2019s fictional town but also the name of their production studio, which is owned entirely by the pair. Founded in 2012, they route all income from their TV show, movie projects and stage productions of The Book of Mormon (which they cowrote) through the company, taking only an estimated $10 million per year in salary.\nIt\u2019s a common corporate structure among Hollywood\u2019s top earners, but unlike other companies such as Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Hello Sunshine or Brad Pitt\u2019s Plan B Entertainment, Park County has never taken on equity partners or investors. Instead, in 2012, Parker and Stone leveraged the existing and projected future income generated by South Park and other projects to score $60 million in convertible debt funding from media-focused merchant bank The Raine Group. As long as they paid off the loan on time, they would keep all of the equity. The bet on themselves paid off as the streaming dollars began to flow in, and in 2016 Parker and Stone bought out Raine, maintaining full ownership ever since.\nPark County continues to use debt to fund the company\u2019s growth, including securing an $800 million credit line from private equity giant The Carlyle Group in 2023. Using the cost of the debt and some clever Hollywood accounting around depreciating catalog value, Park County has been able to lower and delay its tax bills considerably.\nThe ultimate exit plan would be to one day sell the company, settle up with creditors and tax collectors, and pocket the remaining cash.\nSources tell Forbes that Viacom (Comedy Central\u2019s then-parent company) and Park County discussed doing exactly that in 2019, a deal reminiscent of Disney\u2019s acquisition of valuable brands such as Lucasfilm or Marvel. The two sides got as far as a $1 billion valuation before talks broke down. That same year Viacom was, just as it has been lately, in the midst of a messy merger with CBS that made high-priced acquisitions difficult. When the companies returned to the negotiating table in 2021, Park County\u2019s overall production deal rang in at $935 million over six years\u2014nearly the same price tag as the acquisition, without ownership changing hands.\nGiven Park County\u2019s guaranteed revenue and strong profitability, Forbes estimates the enterprise value of the company could now reach as much as $3 billion in a potential sale, netting Parker and Stone more than $1 billion each.\nParamount and Park County\u2019s most recent round of negotiations proved to be the toughest yet, and became an early referendum on the stewardship of Skydance\u2019s David Ellison, son of the world\u2019s second richest man Larry Ellison. He told analysts he wants his new Paramount to be \u201ca creativity-first studio and the first stop for best-in-class storytellers.\u201d Where previous owners had licensed some of the company\u2019s biggest shows, like South Park and Yellowstone, to other streaming services for a short-term cash influx, it seems Ellison is prioritizing bringing everything back under the company\u2019s own streaming platform, Paramount+.\nIt hadn\u2019t gone entirely smoothly. In late June, Park County threatened legal action against Skydance, which they believed was tampering with their talks with Netflix and Warner Bros. about potentially obtaining South Park\u2019s streaming rights. Paramount was motivated to make a deal and eager to avoid more negative publicity, like that which followed a $16 million settlement paid to Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris and the recent cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\nFacing the prospect of another season premiere delay and potential trash talking on stage at San Diego Comic-Con this week\u2014where Parker and Stone took a rare high road\u2014Skydance and Paramount agreed Monday to rework Park County\u2019s production deal in conjunction with the new streaming rights agreement, a sticking point in the negotiations.\nWith their pockets sufficiently lined by the $1.5 billion deal, Parker and Stone will produce 10 new episodes of South Park each year until 2030, and there\u2019s little doubt they will continue to poke fun at both their parent company and a very litigious president. When asked at during a Comic-Con panel Thursday evening what to expect from the rest of this season, Stone quipped, \u201cno politics,\u201d drawing laughter from the crowd.\nAnd Parker, when asked about Trump\u2019s negative reaction to the first episode, answered with similar deadpan: \u201cWe\u2019re terribly sorry.\u201d"

      "text": "Topline\nParamount struck a $7.7 billion deal with the Ultimate Fighting Championship just days after merging with Skydance, giving CBS and Paramount+ streaming and broadcasting rights to the mixed martial arts fights President Donald Trump has sometimes been spotted attending.\nKey Facts\nThe new deal is valued at $1.1 billion per year for a period of seven years, and will begin in 2026, multiple outlets reported.\nUnder the terms of the deal, CBS and Paramount+ will obtain the rights to stream and broadcast UFC\u2019s 13 marquee events and 30 \u201cFight Night\u201d events.\nThe Paramount deal ends UFC streaming deal with ESPN, which paid $550 million per year, and also ends ESPN\u2019s pay-per-view approach to charging for the fights.\nTrump, a noted friend of UFC President and CEO Dana White, was spotted at two fights with Ellison earlier this year, once in April and again in June.\nEllison was able to secure the Paramount deal after what appeared to be a number of concessions by the previous owner to placate Trump and his FCC, which had to approve the deal.\nWhy Is The Ufc Deal Lucrative For Paramount?\nEllison has said on numerous occasions he wants to boost Paramount+\u2019s subscription numbers and increase the amount of time subscribers spend using the streaming service. Paramount said in a quarterly report last month it had 77.7 million subscribers as of June 30, a decrease of 1.3 million from the previous quarter. Its subscriber total lags far behind competitors like Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max. In a message posted to Paramount\u2019s website on his first day as CEO last week, Ellison said no changes to the company \u201cwill be more pivotal to our future than the evolution of our streaming services,\u201d stating he wants to increase \u201cinvestment in premium, exclusive content,\u201d singling out sports as a possible draw for subscribers. Ellison also said he plans to consolidate Paramount+ with Pluto TV, the company\u2019s ad-supported free streaming service. Paramount recently struck an exclusivity deal with \u201cSouth Park\u201d worth $1.5 billion, claiming the streaming rights to the series from HBO Max.\nWhat Are Trump\u2019s Links To The Ufc?\nTrump has a decades-long relationship with the UFC, dating back to the early 2000s, when he allowed the organization to host matches at his Trump Taj Mahal property in Atlantic City, New Jersey. \u201cNobody took us seriously. Except Donald Trump,\u201d White said at the 2016 Republican National Convention about Trump\u2019s early help. White has backed Trump\u2019s presidential bids and Trump has been spotted at numerous UFC events throughout his presidencies, which typically draw raucous reactions from the crowds, including both standing ovations and boos. Trump attended a Miami UFC fight in April flanked by an entourage of administration members, including then-Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nKey Background\nThe Paramount-UFC deal comes less than one week after the media company closed its merger with Ellison\u2019s Skydance. Skydance and Paramount agreed to merge in July 2024, but the deal languished over a year of political tumult and apparent concessions to the Trump administration. Trump sued Paramount and CBS last year, accusing the CBS News show \u201c60 Minutes\u201d of deceptively editing an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, his election opponent. Paramount agreed in July to pay $16 million to settle the lawsuit, which Trump considered a victory. Paramount also stirred controversy for announcing the cancellation of \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d which it said was a financial decision, though Colbert, a Trump critic, noted the announcement was made shortly after the Paramount settlement. Skydance also vowed to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies in an apparent move to secure FCC approval, shortly before the deal was finalized.\nFurther Reading\nSkydance Closes $8 Billion Merger With Paramount (Forbes)\nWhat We Know About David Ellison\u2014Soon-To-Be Paramount Chief And Major Hollywood Honcho (Forbes)"

  "argos_summary": "The UFC has secured a lucrative seven-year media rights deal worth $7.7 billion with Paramount, allowing CBS and Paramount+ to stream its events, marking a significant shift away from the traditional pay-per-view model. This deal comes shortly after David Ellison's Skydance Media completed its $8 billion acquisition of Paramount, with Ellison aiming to boost Paramount's subscriber base and engagement through exclusive sports content. The partnership is also intertwined with political implications, as UFC President Dana White has maintained a close relationship with Donald Trump, who has attended UFC events and supported the organization since its early days.",
