  "description": "B&M shoppers were flabbergasted to find Christmas selection boxes on the shelves. We\u2019re still over two months away from Halloween, yet the festive chocolate treats are already being stock\u2026",
  "content": "The selection boxes advertised in B&M included classics such as Cadbury, Nestle, Galaxy and Reese's peanut butter snacks.\n\nB&M shoppers were flabbergasted to find Christmas selection boxes on the shelves.\n\nWe're still over two months away from Halloween, yet the festive chocolate treats are already being stocked.\n\nFans of the budget retailer have expressed conflicted opinions, with some arguing it's too soon, while others admitted they'd still \"scoff them\".\n\nA picture of the seasonal goodies was shared in the Dansway Gifts and Bargains UK Facebook Group.\n\n\"Festive Chocolate Selection Boxes are BACK at B&M,\" one shopper wrote.\n\n\"A few we found whilst in store today, there\u2019s lots of other Christmas chocolate to choose from!\"\n\nBut one disappointed customer penned: \"We\u2019ve not even finished summer yet or had Halloween.\n\n\"I swear Christmas gets earlier and earlier every year, makes you wonder how long these chocolates sit there before we buy and save for Christmas.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Too soon for Christmas but I\u2019d still scoff them.\"\n\nThe post is still garnering shares and likes, with many tagging their pals in the comments.\n\nWhile it may feel premature to start stocking up on Christmas treats, bargain hunters often bag better deals in the off-season.\n\nIn fact, one expert has shared why now is the ideal time to buy your festive decorations, and where to buy them.\n\nThe selection boxes advertised in B&M include classics such as Cadbury, Nestle, Galaxy and Reese's peanut butter snacks.\n\nThis comes as shoppers have also been complaining about Halloween decorations being pushed by major stores across the UK.\n\nClothing and homeware brand Matalan is already giving people a taste of Autumn with its Halloween-themed products.\n\nOne person complained: \"Does someone want to tell Matalan its July. Don't get me wrong my fave time of year is Autumn but we're not there yet.\n\n\"I've got to get through the hot months before I can look forward to hot chocs and blankets!\"\n\nAnother one added: \"Crazy.. let\u2019s have summer first!!\"\n\nA third commented: \"Getting too much with shops they always seem to be pushing things that are months away instead of enjoying the season we're in.\"\n\nOne fan said: \"Definitely not ready for this yet.\"\n\nElsewhere, shelves at TK Maxx have been stocked with Halloween tea towels, cushions, blankets and plush toys from four months before the spooky holiday.\n\nHow to save money on chocolate We all love a bit of chocolate from now and then, but you don't have to break the bank buying your favourite bar. Go own brand - if you're not too fussed about flavour and just want to supplant your chocolate cravings, you'll save by going for the supermarket's own brand bars. Shop around - if you've spotted your favourite variety at the supermarket, make sure you check if it's cheaper elsewhere. Websites like Trolley.co.uk let you compare prices on products across all the major chains to see if you're getting the best deal. Look out for yellow stickers - supermarket staff put yellow, and sometimes orange and red, stickers on to products to show they've been reduced. They usually do this if the product is coming to the end of its best-before date or the packaging is slightly damaged. Buy bigger bars - most of the time, but not always, chocolate is cheaper per 100g the larger the bar. So if you've got the appetite, and you were going to buy a hefty amount of chocolate anyway, you might as well go bigger.\n\nOne shopper shared pictures of Halloween items on the shelves in the retailer's Doncaster store, saying: \"It's starting.\"\n\nOthers chimed in to say they'd also seen Halloween products in the stores in Preston and Oldham.\n\nOne person commented: \"No no NO \u2026.. let's have summer first before we start seeing autumn things \u2026.. jeeeez way too early !!\"\n\nAnother said: \"Wooow really getting earlier and earlier every year huh!! will start seeing xmas stuff next week no doubt.\"\n\nA third person said: \"Its June!!!! this is far too early.\"\n\nSome experts have said the growth of online shopping has meant traditional retailers are trying to extend the holiday season to compete.\n\nIt's also because they have boosted profits during holiday seasons as shoppers spend more.\n\nShops have been putting out their holiday stocks even earlier in recent years.\n\nSome experts have said the growth of online shopping has meant traditional retailers are trying to extend the holiday season to compete.\n\nIt's also because they have boosted profits during holiday seasons as shoppers spend more.\n\nCharlotte Harrington, the manager at Summerhill's Garden Centre in Basildon, Essex, previously told The Sun that they open their Christmas department on the August bank holiday.\n\n\"The stock comes in early and we gradually start putting it out on the shop floor. This is just a small fraction of what we have,\" she said.\n\n\"But our Christmas displays are so spectacular it takes time to get everything set up, so we have to start early.\"\n\nLast year shoppers complained when B&M launched its Christmas range in the middle of August.\n\nThey also reacted when Morrisons, Tesco and B&M put Easter chocolates out on their shelves hours after Christmas Day.",
