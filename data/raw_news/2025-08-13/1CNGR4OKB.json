  "title": "Is Corbion N.V. (AMS:CRBN) Trading At A 46% Discount?",
  "description": "ENXTAM:CRBN 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Corbion's Fair Values from the Community and select yours Key...",
  "content": "Explore Corbion's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\u2022 Corbion's estimated fair value is \u20ac30.36 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\u2022 Corbion's \u20ac16.36 share price signals that it might be 46% undervalued\n\u2022 Our fair value estimate is 34% higher than Corbion's analyst price target of \u20ac22.73 Does the August share price for Corbion N.V. (AMS:CRBN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free. We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = \u20ac606m\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= \u20ac2.1b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.3%)10= \u20ac1.2b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is \u20ac1.8b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of \u20ac16.4, the company appears quite good value at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Corbion as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.113. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\u2022 Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\u2022 Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\u2022 Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\u2022 Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Chemicals market.\n\u2022 Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Dutch market.\n\u2022 Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\u2022 Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the Dutch market. Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Corbion, we've compiled three pertinent items you should look at:\n\u2022 Risks: As an example, we've found 2 warning signs for Corbion that you need to consider before investing here.\n\u2022 Future Earnings: How does CRBN's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?
