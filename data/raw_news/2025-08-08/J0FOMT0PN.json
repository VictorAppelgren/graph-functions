  "title": "I compared the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera to the Find X8 Ultra, and the winner is obvious",
  "description": "I expected one of them to take the crown, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Find X8 Ultra each win in different ways.",
  "content": "Most Android OEMs have shifted toward making an \"Ultra\" version of their flagship smartphones, featuring the best camera hardware they can offer. Many brands, including Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi, often collaborate with well-known camera companies, like Hasselblad, Zeiss, and Leica, to enhance their camera tuning.\n\nSamsung and Google, on the other hand, have taken a slightly different path. They rely more on their own computational photography and software optimizations rather than relying on these legacy names for their camera tuning.\n\nTo see how these two approaches compare today, I tested the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra against the Oppo Find X8 Ultra -- and the results were quite revealing.\n\nA closer look at the camera hardware\n\nBefore we look at the shots from both phones, let's quickly go over the camera hardware. The Galaxy S25 Ultra features a 200-megapixel primary sensor with an f/1.7 aperture and OIS. It's paired with a 50-megapixel ultra-wide lens, a 10-megapixel 3x optical zoom lens, and a 50-megapixel 5x zoom lens.\n\nThe Oppo Find X8 Ultra, on the other hand, comes with a quad 50-megapixel setup, including a 50-megapixel primary lens with an f/1.8 aperture, a 50-megapixel ultra-wide lens with a 120-degree FoV, a 50-megapixel 3x zoom lens, and a 50-megapixel 6x optical zoom lens.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Oppo has partnered with Hasselblad over the past few years to fine-tune photo post-processing, while Samsung handles image tuning entirely in-house. In fact, Oppo has renewed its collaboration with Hasselblad and claims to be working on a \"next-generation mobile imaging system\" that aims to set a \"new standard\" for smartphone photography.\n\nBut does Hasselblad processing actually make a difference? Let's find out.\n\nWhich Android smartphone has the better camera?\n\nBefore we begin, it's worth noting that this camera comparison focuses solely on images taken with the rear camera setups of both phones. All photos were captured in tap-and-shoot mode, with Pro mode not used, as most users typically don't shoot that way.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that images to the left of the slider were taken with the Oppo Find X8 Ultra, while those on the right were captured using the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\nRight off the bat, you'll notice a big difference in color reproduction and HDR processing between the two phones.\n\nIn the shot above, you'll notice that the Galaxy S25 Ultra goes for a more saturated and brighter look, while the Oppo Find X8 Ultra aims for realistic skin tones with a wider dynamic range. But the white balance on the Oppo shot feels slightly off. The greenery in the background has a cooler, almost bluish tint that doesn't look natural.\n\nSamsung may be boosting colors a bit, but its overall rendering feels more balanced and visually pleasing in this case. Personally, I prefer the look of the Galaxy S25 Ultra shot here.\n\nThis one tells a similar story. The Oppo shot once again seems to struggle a bit with either HDR or white balance. Look closely at the text above the truck -- it's clearly visible in the image taken using the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but harder to read in the Find X8 Ultra one.\n\nThat said, Oppo does a better job of highlighting the details inside the truck.\n\nThis is where Oppo really shines. I actually prefer the Find X8 Ultra's photo here. It goes for a more saturated, punchier look, which works beautifully in this scene, full of color and contrast.\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's version is flatter, with less color and contrast, and loses some information in shadowy regions.\n\nMoving on to the ultra-wide shots, the Find X8 Ultra produces a brighter (and warmer) image. The greens look a bit livelier, and there's more visible detail in the darker areas near the bottom left. The overall exposure feels more even across the frame.\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra, on the other hand, goes for a slightly cooler look. Yes, the image does look slightly more dramatic, but it also feels a bit flatter overall and lacks the punchiness that the Oppo manages to deliver straight out of the camera.\n\nThere's also a big difference in distortion handling. The image from the Galaxy S25 Ultra appears slightly more stretched toward the edges, while the Oppo flagship keeps things tighter and more balanced.\n\nAt 3x zoom, both phones capture contrast-heavy images, but the differences start to show once you look closer. The Oppo Find X8 Ultra uses a lower aperture (f/2.1 compared to f/2.4 on the Galaxy S25 Ultra), and that shows in the background blur and shallower depth of field. However, that wider aperture also makes it trickier to handle highlights, and Oppo doesn't quite pull it off here.\n\nSamsung does a noticeably better job at managing light. Look at the subject's white clothing -- the S25 Ultra retains texture and definition, while the Oppo shot blows out some of those details. The same goes for the red flowers in the bottom left.\n\nBoth are solid shots, but Samsung takes the lead here with better detail retention and more controlled contrast.\n\nThis is where the Find X8 Ultra pulls ahead. At 30x zoom, the Oppo flagship captures a noticeably sharper image. You can clearly make out the textures on the door as well as the walls. You can even clearly see the trees behind the shed.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra holds up surprisingly well, but loses sharpness when you zoom in. The walls and doors of the shed start to blur, and you lose definition around the grass in front.\n\nIn well-lit indoor conditions, both phones put in solid work, but they approach color and exposure differently. The Find X8 Ultra tends to go for a warmer, slightly more saturated look. The images have a bit of extra vibrance, just look at the mugs and books in the shot above.\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra leans towards a more neutral color tone. The image ends up looking a bit flat and less engaging. There's also slightly less clarity around the book labels and the mugs when you zoom in.\n\nSimilarly, in the second shot above, the difference lies in the tone. Oppo goes for a warmer tone, while the Galaxy S25 Ultra keeps things cooler. The shot from the Galaxy S2 Ultra is sharper as well. The texture of the fabric and the sharpness of the beads on the hairpiece are better maintained here.\n\nWhen it comes to low-light and night-time shots, the Find X8 Ultra clearly pulls ahead. It delivers a cleaner, more balanced night shot \u2014 lighting is more evenly distributed, highlights are better controlled, and the image looks brighter overall without overexposing any part of the frame.\n\nOn the other hand, the Galaxy S25 Ultra produces a warmer-toned image, but it feels overprocessed. Lights appear blown out, and there's more noticeable noise in the shadows. The shot lacks the natural dynamic range that Oppo manages to retain, especially around the bright string lights.\n\nSimilarly, here as well, the Find X8 Ultra again shines with better exposure and more accurate color tones. Details on the couch, wall textures, and decor appear crisp and evenly lit, without dark patches or overly bright highlights.\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra leans toward a contrast-heavy look, which also results in some loss of detail. Areas like the left side of the couch and the wood paneling appear muddier. The overall scene feels darker and lacks the warmth that Oppo delivers.\n\nWhich camera is better?\n\nSo, which camera is better? Well, that depends on what you value more.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra continues to deliver excellent consistency, especially in daylight, with its natural color science and excellent dynamic range. It also performs well in indoor lighting, maintaining neutral and natural tones without making images overly warm.\n\nThat said, the Oppo Find X8 Ultra makes a compelling case. Its ultra-wide camera produces livelier, more balanced shots, and both zoom and low-light photos are exceptionally good.\n\nIf I had to pick one, I'd lean toward the Oppo Find X8 Ultra. You get better zoom performance, superior low-light shots, and daylight image quality that's nearly on par with Samsung.",

      "text": "Summary\n- The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a stunning design with minimized bezels and rounded edges.\n- The phone's camera quality is top-notch, offering great performance across the board.\n- While lacking major new features, it's great for users upgrading from older Galaxy S series phones.\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra will likely be one of the best smartphones of 2025.\nIt looks great thanks to its minimized bezels and more rounded design, feels solid, and snaps excellent photos that rival the Pixel 9 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro-- it's the complete package. On the other hand, the phone is nearly identical to the Galaxy S24 Ultra and embodies the rapidly plateauing high-end smartphone perfectly.\nAny way you look at it, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a boring handset technology enthusiasts like myself don't have many reasons to get excited about. There's no flashy new feature this year like a questionably useful dedicated camera button, and while the design upgrades are welcome, they're undeniably subtle. Oh, and those new AI features Samsung is pushing? They aren't great.\nBut you know what? That's okay to some extent. If you're moving from a Galaxy S24 Ultra to the S25 Ultra, there isn't a lot to get excited about here. But if you're a Galaxy S20 Ultra, S21 Ultra, S22 Ultra, or even S23 Ultra user, you'll really feel the upgrades here. And in today's market where people are hanging onto their smartphones for several years before upgrading, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a top-tier package.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 6.9-inch\n- RAM\n- 12GB\nThe highest-end variant of Samsung's flagship smartphone lineup for 2025, the S25 Ultra ships with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a massive 6.9-inch display, and a quad camera setup.\n- Stunning design\n- Snaps great photos\n- Minimized bezels look great\n- Very similar to the Galaxy S24 Ultra\n- Now Brief isn't great\n- Most Galaxy AI features aren't useful\nPrice, availability, and specs\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra starts at $1,300 and is available from several retailers, including Samsung, in silverblue, gray, black, whitesilver. This year's Samsung Store exclusive colors include jetblack, jadegreen, and pinkgold.\nThe S25 Ultra features a version of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite (3nm) chip specifically designed for smartphones. Samsung says this chip offers a 40 percent AI boost, a 37 percent efficiency improvement, and a 30 percent visual performance jump over the Galaxy S24 Ultra's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip (check out my own Geekbench 6 benchmarks below). The phone's AMOLED display measures 6.9 inches and has a 3120 x 1440 Pixel resolution. Finally, the device also features a 5,000 mAh battery that's identical to the Galaxy S24 Ultra's.\nRegarding its cameras, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features the same array as the S24 Ultra, including an f/1.7 200-megapixel (wide) main shooter, an f/2.4 10-megapixel 3x (telephoto), and an f/3.4 50-megapixel 5x (telephoto). New for this year is the ultra-wide camera being kicked up to f/1.9 50-megapixel.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 6.9-inch\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\n- Battery\n- 5,000mAh\n- Ports\n- USB-C\n- Operating System\n- One UI 7\n- Front camera\n- f/2.2 AF 12-megapixel\n- Rear camera\n- f/1.7 200-megapixel wide, f/1.9 50-megapixel ultra-wide, f/2.4 10 megapixel 3x telephoto, f/3.4 50-megapixel 5x telephoto\n- Connectivity\n- WiFi 7\n- Colors\n- Titanium Black, Titanium Grey, Titanium Whitesilver, Titanium Silverblue\n- Display type\n- Dynamic AMOLED 2x\n- Weight\n- 7.7oz\n- Charge speed\n- 45w Super Fast Charging 2.0\n- IP Rating\n- IP68\n- Price\n- $1,300\n- Release\n- 2025\nGalaxy S25 Ultra build and design\nIt's still a familiar-looking Note with another name\nThis year, Samsung made minimal changes to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's design. In fact, at first glance, it's difficult to find any differences between the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra. Let's start with the back first -- the same rear camera array returns, and thankfully, there still isn't a sizable bump under the lenses like with the iPhone 16 Pro and other smartphones, with each lens sitting independently. Instead, Samsung has added a subtly lined black rim around each lens, just like the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6. Am I fond of this change? Not really, but it's so minor I don't really care, and I bet most people will feel the same way.\nThe edges of the Galaxy S25 Ultra are also slightly more rounded, giving the phone a friendlier, more iPhone-like look that matches the rest of the Galaxy S25 series and the Galaxy S24 line. It also struck me as odd that last year's Ultra was a little more squared-off than the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+, but now, that's no longer the case. I like this new look, but again, like a lot of things with the S25 Ultra, it's a minor shift some people might not even notice.\nThe S Pen is back again and has a convenient slot inside the Galaxy S25 Ultra, similar to the now-dead Note line. However, this year, Samsung has ditched Bluetooth from the stylus, which means it no longer works with \"Air Gestures,\" including using the stylus as a remote shutter for snapping photos. This is a disappointing and perplexing downgrade to what is supposed to be Samsung's top-tier smartphone. Realistically, most users won't notice that change since Air Gestures aren't that popular, but it doesn't make it any less of an odd cost-cutting decision on Samsung's part.\nAs far as design changes go, there really isn't anything new about the S25 Ultra when you pit it directly against the S24 Ultra.\nIt's worth pointing out that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is only \"Qi2 Ready,\" which, in the same vein as ditching Bluetooth from the S Pen, feels very weird. While the phone supports the new wireless charging standard, including faster wireless charging speeds, you need a Qi2-compatible case. That means if you want iPhone-like MagSafe-style magnetic charging, accessories, and faster wireless charging speeds, you'll need a Qi2 case with a built-in magnet. This feels like an accessory cash grab on Samsung's part, though there are already third-party cases available (check out the pricey but solid Casetify case below). Can we just bring Qi2 to every Android device already, please?\nAnd that's it -- seriously. As far as design changes go, there really isn't anything new about the S25 Ultra when you pit it directly against the S24 Ultra. I know we're firmly in the era of iterative smartphone updates, but how similar both devices look is wild.\nApple created the Qi2 charging standard alongside the Wireless Power Consortium, which includes companies like Google, LG, Toshiba, Panasonic, and, of course, Samsung. The only Android device that currently supports Qi2 is HMD's Skyline.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra display\nThe minimized bezels and bigger screen are its best new features\nThe screen is my favorite Galaxy S25 Ultra upgrade over its predecessor and earlier versions of Samsung's Ultra-tier smartphone. Thanks to its nearly non-existent bezels, the phone's 3120 x 1440 pixel resolution, 6.9-inch AMOLED display looks incredibly modern, especially sitting beside the Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro, its two key competitors in the US market.\nIt's truly the best smartphone display I've ever seen.\nLike in years past, Samsung's screen prowess is on display here. This display looks absolutely fantastic. Everything from its bright, vibrant colors to its 2,600 nits of peak brightness and even its dynamic 1Hz - 120Hz refresh rate (which isn't new, to be clear) is flawless. This is an expensive smartphone, but you get what you pay for in the screen department, with the display surpassing the Pixel 9 Pro/9 Pro XL and iPhone 16 Pro/16 Pro Max in terms of sheer quality. It's truly the best smartphone display I've ever seen.\nIt's worth mentioning that the Galaxy S25 Ultra's smaller bezels have occasionally caused me to accidentally press the display with my palm when I'm holding it. It doesn't happen often, but it can get annoying, so it's worth noting.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra camera\nThe new ultra-wide camera is impressive\nI've been pretty outspoken about my dislike for Samsung's out-there photography and video post-processing. I'm just not a fan of blown-out highlights and vibrant colors that look like they were shot on another planet, but I understand why some people are -- the photos can sometimes look very cool, after all. This aesthetic is toned down with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but I still miss the iPhone 16 Pro's highly customizable Photography Styles and the Pixel 9 Pro series' more grounded take on photos and videos. I'm hoping Samsung eventually brings a similarly intuitive feature to the Galaxy series that allows you to tweak photos exactly how you want before you shoot them.\nThere are a few more pro-focused additions this year, including Log video support, which gives you a flat video profile while retaining information related to highlights and shadows.\nOn the hardware front, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's lenses are identical to the S24 Ultra's, including the f/1.7 200-megapixel (wide) and f/2.4 10-megapixel telephoto, with optical zoom maxing out at 5x (I still miss the Galaxy S23 Ultra's 10x optical zoom). The same f/2.2 12-megapixel camera is also back. New for this year is the Galaxy S25 Ultra's f/1.9 50-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a step above last year's f/2.2 12-megapixel shooter. I don't shoot ultra-wide photos often, but the photos shot with the Galaxy S25 Ultra look great, offering more definition and improved low-light performance over the Galaxy S24 Ultra.\nGenerally, if you like Samsung's photography and video style, you'll enjoy the Galaxy S25 Ultra's cameras. Personally, I like Google's and Apple's more grounded take on smartphone photography, but it all depends on your preference. Any way you look at it, the Galaxy S25 snaps great photos and can even get clear shots when there's ample motion in the scene, an issue I've encountered with past Galaxy S series devices.\nThere are also a few more pro-focused additions this year, including Log video support. This feature gives you a flat video profile while retaining information related to highlights and shadows, making it easier to tweak the footage precisely how you want. This feature is aimed more at filmmakers and creators than the average user, so it's unlikely most Galaxy S25 Ultra users will take advantage of it.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra performance\nAll-day (and then some) battery is back\nHigh-end phones (and most phones, for that matter) have featured power overkill for roughly half a decade or more, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra is no exception. This year, Samsung's top-tier smartphone features a custom version of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip alongside 12GB of RAM. Would I have preferred the device to offer 16GB of RAM given its \"Ultra\" moniker? You bet -- but overall, the S25 Ultra is plenty powerful. Whether you're running questionably useful Galaxy AI features, playing high-end games, or just watching the world end on social media, the experience is silky smooth.\nFor those that care about benchmarks, the Galaxy S25 Ultra hits an impressive 3,104 for single-core and 9,831 for multicore on Geekbench 6. I've also been impressed with the smartphone's battery life. With average use, including a phone call or two, some camera testing, and scrolling social media, the S25 Ultra's 5,000 mAh battery holds up like a champ, lasting well into the evening with 20-30% leftover on most days.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra software\nThe new Now Brief disappoints\nLook, I get it. AI is a growth area for tech giants and is pegged as the next big thing. This industry moves in massive cycles and AI is just the thing right now. I'm also aware that all of this technology is very much a work in progress. With that out of the way, Galaxy AI still feels half-baked compared to Google's and even Apple's AI offerings.\nI genuinely think it could be the first example of smartphone-powered AI that fits into my life, but in its current state, it feels pretty useless.\nThis year's marquee feature is the \"Now Bar,\" which shows up on the phone's lockscreen, and the \"Now Brief,\" an AI-powered widget that lives on the home screen. The concept is that it pulls data from your phone, including your calendar, email, photos, and more, and delivers a snapshot of information you care about, all pulled from several apps.\nAfter a couple of weeks and making a concerted effort to integrate Google's app suite into Now Brief, it only shows me the weather, assumes I'm constantly traveling, and hasn't even started pulling in news stories I care about. No other information has appeared in the widget, which is very disappointing. The idea of Now Brief is spectacular, and I genuinely think it could be the first example of smartphone-powered AI that fits into my life, but in its current state, it feels pretty useless. Hopefully, Now Brief will improve the more the phone is used. I'm also curious if this Galaxy S25 series-exclusive feature will make its way to earlier S series devices in the coming months.\nOn a more positive note, OneUI 7 looks great -- it's simplistic and stripped back and features a revamped, easier-to-use camera app.\nSticking with this theme, while the S25 Ultra's cross-app functionality powered by both Gemini and Bixby is impressive (you can do a lot of this with other Android phones with just Gemini and Google, to be clear), it doesn't always work reliably. For example, I asked Gemini to make a Google Calendar listing for an upcoming work event with my work email, and couldn't differentiate between the two accounts I had signed in on the device. There's potential here if Samsung can iron out the issues and make its AI agents more capable, but as it stands currently, it's easier and far more reliable to perform tasks like this yourself.\nOn a more positive note, OneUI 7 looks great -- it's simplistic, stripped back, and features a revamped, easier-to-use camera app. It also kind of looks like iOS (sorry, Samsung fans), which, as far as I'm concerned, is a good thing. I have a lot of issues with Apple's smartphones, but the clean layout of iOS 18 isn't one of them.\nShould you buy the Galaxy S25 Ultra?\nIt depends on what phone you currently own\nOne of the biggest questions surrounding the Galaxy S25 Ultra is why you'd opt for it over the Galaxy S25 or 25+. Unless you're really into the S Pen and snap a lot of telephoto shots, you could probably opt for one of Samsung's very capable Galaxy S25 devices, depending on your display size preference. This year, the gap between Samsung's other devices and the Ultra is tiny, similar to the Pixel 9/9 Pro and the iPhone 16/iPhone 16 Pro.\nWhether the Galaxy S25 Ultra is truly worth it for you will depend on what Samsung device you're currently using. Those rocking a Galaxy S24 Ultra won't find much here, and the same can be said for Galaxy S23 Ultra owners to some extent. However, if you're using an earlier Galaxy Ultra phone, like the S20, S21, or S22, you'll get a lot out of the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nDespite the minimal upgrades, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is one of the most solid all-around smartphones Samsung has released in years.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 6.9-inch\n- RAM\n- 12GB\nThis device was provided to Pocket-lint by Samsung."

      "text": "Summary\n- Samsung's S25 Ultra is rumored to have rounder corners and reduced bezels.\n- The expectation for the base model S25 Ultra storage is 512GB instead of 256GB.\n- There's hope for S25 Ultra to feature 16GB RAM due to the increasing demand on Android phones.\nIt might be difficult to believe if you're familiar with how much I cover Apple's iPhone, but there was a time when I preferred Samsung's S series smartphones. Back in the day, compared to Apple's offering, they featured what felt like a monumental jump in design and hardware every year, especially regarding camera performance. I know it was years ago, but remember the big leap between the Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy S4? In 2013, it felt monumental.\nBut those days are long gone, with the South Korean tech giant instead content to release yearly iterative updates to its top-tier smartphone line, just like nearly every modern phone maker. Still, based on leaks and rumors, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is shaping up to be a formidable smartphone, especially if Samsung makes a few key upgrades to the flagship device. With only a few days until its official reveal on January 22nd, we won't have long to wait to know for sure.\nWith all of this in mind, here are four upgrades I hope we see with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 6.2-inch\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 128GB, 256GB\n- Battery\n- 4,000mAh\nThe base model of Samsung's flagship smartphone lineup for 2025, the S25 features the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a 6.2-inch display panel, and a triple camera array.\n1 Please make sure that iPhone-like design revamp is refined\nBased on leaks, Samsung is definitely on the right track\nI like the changes Samsung made to the look of Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 this year. The company's more squared-off design direction gives the foldable smartphones an angrier, slightly more mature look. But, with the Galaxy S25 Ultra (and the rest of the Galaxy S25 line), rumors point to Samsung taking things in a different direction.\nLike with all smartphones, I'll need to get my hands on the Galaxy S25 ultra before passing final judgment.\nAlong with reduced bezels and a slightly smaller size across the board, all Galaxy S25 devices (including the Galaxy S25 Ultra) are rumored to feature more rounded-off corners and rear camera bumps that look similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 6's. They're independent and not sitting on a more significant bump and seem to feature the thin black rings I wasn't a big fan of with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Overall, though, I'm into the friendlier, obviously iPhone-inspired, softer edges, but like with all smartphones, I'll need to get my hands on the Galaxy S25 ultra before passing final judgment.\n2 Please make 16GB of RAM standard\nIt's 2025 -- 12GB just doesn't cut it on an Android phone anymore\nWe know pretty much for sure that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, but how much RAM the smartphone will come equipped with is a different question. The Galaxy S24 Ultra featured 12GB of RAM unless you opted for the top-tier storage configuration, but with rumors surrounding Samsung's Galaxy AI efforts being kicked into overdrive, it makes sense for the tech giant to increase the Galaxy S25 Ultra's RAM to 16GB (for the record, I hope Bixby isn't poised for a comeback).\nMore RAM is never a bad thing.\nHopefully, this is true and all Galaxy S25 Ultra storage configurations, including 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB, come with 16GB of RAM. To be fair, my experience with all Galaxy S series devices has been smooth for several years, but more RAM is never a bad thing, particularly if you're a big multitasker.\n3 The Galaxy S25 Ultra needs to start at 512GB of storage\n256GB of storage isn't enough anymore\nYes, I know cloud storage exists -- Google Photos/Drive are great, for sure. However, given how much Samsung's top-tier flagship smartphone costs now, especially in the US, it feels ridiculous that the device has started at just 256GB of onboard storage for the past several years. I hope that this year, Samsung finally gives in and offers the base-tier Galaxy S25 Ultra with 512GB of storage.\nA 256GB upgrade to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's starting storage might not sound like a big deal, but double the storage can make a world of difference, especially when it's already that low. This change is long overdue and should have happened several years ago as app and photo file sizes continue to increase.\n4 I want Photographic Style-like features\nI use an iPhone 16 Pro as my daily device, and I know I'll find it difficult to give up phone's versatile camera settings\nAt least as far as the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera is concerned, I'm not expecting significant upgrades. This means we'll likely see a 200-megapixel main sensor, a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto lens, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto, and new for this year, an upgraded 50-megapixel ultra-wide. While the ultra-wide improvement is welcome, I find that I really don't use the lens very often.\nWhat I want from the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a something similar to the iPhone 16's Photographic Styles. As a smartphone photography enthusiast, this feature is a complete game changer. It allows me to tweak photos exactly how I want, right down to the tone and overall colors of the images. In the context of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I'd be able to more finely tune down the skin smoothing and out-there highlights that are so common with the tech giant's flagship smartphones. This would definitely encourage me to reach for the Galaxy S25 Ultra more frequently when I leave the house.\nMake sure to lock in on Pocket-lint on January 22nd for all the Galaxy S25 series news directly from Samsung's Unpacked keynote."

      "text": "Summary\n- Many smartphones now have extremely sharp main camera sensors, rated anywhere between 50 and 200 megapixels. That's higher than what many professionals use.\n- In reality, those pixels are mostly being put towards low-light performance and digital zoom, the latter coming with some serious drawbacks if you push it too far.\n- A dedicated telephoto camera will outshine any digital zoom as long as it has decent specs. That makes it vital to check out a phone's camera tech before you buy.\nBefore I was able to turn writing into a full-time career, I used to work as a part-time professional photographer. I was hardly Richard Avedon, but I knew my way around studio lighting and a DSLR, and that was enough to get some work. I started with a Nikon D70, eventually upgrading to a D300.\nThe D300 served me well until I sold it, yet it was quaint by modern standards. It had a 12.3-megapixel sensor that was too noisy to use beyond ISO 1600, or often just ISO 800. Contrast that with my iPhone 16 Pro, which has a 48-megapixel main sensor, and can sometimes shoot in near-darkness using a combination of software processing and optical image stabilization. I would've killed for that when I was shooting wedding receptions. Today, some phones now sport ridiculously high megapixel counts that would've once been considered state-of-the-art, such as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, which hits 200 megapixels.\nWhether I'm shopping for phones or dedicated cameras, however, I value a long telephoto lens a lot more than the sharpest possible main sensor. I'll tell you why.\nWhy phone makers emphasize sharper main sensors\nIt's about more than bragging rights\nLet's take a step back for a moment -- what's the value of an ultra-sharp main sensor? After all, the one in my D300 was good enough to print 8x10 portraits. A 200-megapixel sensor can theoretically output 12,240 x 6,320 pixel resolution, which is well beyond an 8K TV, let alone a frame you'd hang over your mantelpiece. Hypothetically, you should shoot for one of those billboards you see alongside the interstate.\nThe answer is that phone makers aren't really after maximum resolution. Rather, they're chasing two things, the first being light sensitivity. With larger sensors, pixels can be \"binned\" together to improve low-light performance. You temporarily sacrifice resolution, but it's better to have a usable 12-megapixel photo than a noisy, blurry 50-megapixel one. In well-lit conditions, binning can be scaled back.\nPhone makers are chasing two things: light sensitivity and a cheaper zoom effect.\nLarge sensors are also a cheap way of achieving a zoom effect. Since a 4K image will fit into a 100- or 200-megapixel one multiple times, you can often crop-zoom while losing little if any noticeable detail. With software processing, problems can potentially be masked over.\nDedicated telephoto cameras are comparatively tricky. They not only need a sensor of their own, but a bigger lens array that's difficult to cram into the dimensions of a smartphone. That's why many high-end devices have enormous camera bumps. As a consequence, \"digital\" zoom can be cheaper than the real deal, which is known as optical zoom.\nWhy pros go telephoto\nWith decent specs, that is\nNotice that I said large main sensors enable a cheap zoom \"effect.\" The reality, of course, is that you're just blowing up part of a more distant image. That means not just potential detail loss, but the magnification of any flaws, such as sensor noise or dust specks. And the further an image is cropped, the more likely it is you're going to notice individual pixels, since you're working with fewer of them. You might be able to digitally zoom in on the tip of the Empire State Building from Hoboken, but the resulting photo will be a pixelated mess.\nDigital zoom can also amplify any aberrations, such as heat distortion. Telephoto lenses are subject to these, too, but aberrations should at least be less prominent in the frame.\nYou might be able to digitally zoom in on the tip of the Empire State Building from Hoboken -- but the resulting photo could be a pixelated mess.\nOn top of all this, there's a marked difference in perspective with optical zoom. Telephotos tend to flatten a subject against the background, and make it easy to achieve shallow depth-of-field, at least when the subject is close by. This is why portrait photographers regularly use a 70- to 120-millimeter lens when a 50-millimeter one would hypothetically be sufficient. The results are more \"artistic,\" for lack of a better term.\nThe asterisk here is that a telephoto camera has to meet certain specs. Anything below 12 megapixels is questionable, and even above that threshold, telephoto sensors tend to perform worse in low light. That makes mechanical image stabilization essential -- I sometimes get blurry images with 5x zoom in well-lit conditions.\nAre you selling yourself short with a 200-megapixel camera?\nIt's a matter of use cases\nYou're not necessarily cursed if you've got a phone with a high-megapixel main camera but a low or non-existent telephoto. Rather, it's going to depend on how frequently conditions fall outside the norm. Most photos tend to be shot within close range of their subjects, no more than a dozen feet away, and in reasonably clear and well-lit environments. In those situations, cropping to zoom isn't a big deal, since your phone doesn't have to blow things up much if at all.\nIdeally, phone makers would be offering the best of both worlds, making long telephoto cameras standard and beefing up their associated sensors.\nIt's when you try to push the limits that digital zoom falls apart. Let's say you're attending a summer music festival, but trying to zoom in on a lead singer from the back of the crowd. You might be able to get a usable, high-resolution image -- but don't count on it. Optical zoom is generally going to be more reliable as long as the stage is properly illuminated, you've got enough zoom length, and you can hold your hand still.\nIdeally, phone makers would be offering the best of both worlds, making long telephoto cameras standard and beefing up their associated sensors. That's no doubt coming at some point. For now, if you care about quality photos, I'd suggest looking into the exact camera specs of each phone you buy."
