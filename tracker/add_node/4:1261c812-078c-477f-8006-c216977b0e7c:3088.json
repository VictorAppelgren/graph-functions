    "motivation_for_relevance": "India industrial output rose 3.5% YoY in July, a clear macro driver that will lift Indian equities, the MSCI EM index and the INR; provides a dated catalyst (July 2024) and maps to the MSCI EM handle with a positive sign.",

    "importance_classification_rationale": "The topic provides India’s industrial output growth figure but does not explicitly map to a canonical market handle (e.g., MSCI EM, India equity index) with a clear sign and magnitude range, nor does it specify a causal transmission path to a liquid asset. Without that explicit mapping and causal link, it fails the mandatory criteria for inclusion.",
