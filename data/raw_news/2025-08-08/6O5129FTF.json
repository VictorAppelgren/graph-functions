  "title": "Defensive tilt weighs on BMVP in fast stock market rebound",
  "description": "Bloomberg's large-cap BMVP portfolio delivered positive returns in 2Q but trailed its benchmarks, held back by its defensive tilt during one of the fastest market rebounds on record.",
  "content": "This article was written by Bloomberg Intelligence Quantitative Equity Strategist Christopher Cain and Director of Equity Strategy, Chief Equity Strategist Gina Martin Adams. It appeared first on the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s large-cap BMVP portfolio delivered positive returns in 2Q but trailed its benchmarks, held back by its defensive tilt during one of the fastest market rebounds on record. The primary drag came from its exposure to low-volatility stocks, which lagged as investors rotated into higher-risk names. Despite near-term underperformance, BMVP\u2019s long-term record remains intact, with higher annualized returns and lower risk than both equal and market cap-weighted benchmarks \u2014 underscoring the value of a disciplined, multifactor approach.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s large-cap BMVP portfolio underperformed its benchmarks in 2Q, weighed down by its defensive tilt \u2014 particularly the low-volatility component \u2014 during the fastest market rebound after a 15% drawdown on record. The BMVP portfolio returned 1.82% on the quarter, trailing the Bloomberg 500 equal-weight benchmark\u2019s 5.46% gain. Low volatility was the weakest contributing factor, with the sector-neutralized Q1 cohort declining 58 bps on the quarter. Despite 2Q softness, the BMVP strategy maintains higher long-term returns (10.71% annualized) than both the equal-weight (7.87%) and market-cap-weight (8.82%) benchmarks, along with lower volatility and drawdowns.",
