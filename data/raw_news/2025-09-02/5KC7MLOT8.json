  "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold gets a rumored launch date, and it\u2019s sooner than you think",
  "description": "Samsung's Galaxy Z TriFold, XR headset, and AI glasses are all rumored to be launching at a single Galaxy Unpacked event on September 29.",
  "content": "Samsung has long been working on a generational upgrade to its foldables, potentially called the Galaxy G Fold. As we discovered through animation files, this will be a dual-hinged foldable, popularly but misleadingly referred to as a \u201d tri-fold foldable.\u201d The device is expected to launch in the coming months, and now, a new leak has finally revealed when to mark our calendars.\n\nOn Weibo, leaker Ice Universe has shared that Samsung will reportedly release the Galaxy Z TriFold in South Korea on September 29. The company is also expected to launch its Project Moohan XR headset and new AI glasses dubbed the \u201cGalaxy Glasses\u201d at this purported Galaxy Unpacked event.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously heard September 29 as the date rumored for the next Galaxy Unpacked event, but it is primarily associated with the launch of the Project Moohan headset. This is the first time the purported event has been associated with the launch of the upcoming foldable as well as the new AI glasses. The Project Moohan headset is rumored to go on sale in South Korea on October 13, 2025. Presuming Samsung also follows the same timeline for the Galaxy Z TriFold/Galaxy G Fold, it would align with the Q4 2025 availability window from previous leaks.\n\nPrevious leaks have suggested that the Galaxy tri-fold could be priced upwards of 4 million KRW (~$2,930). This isn\u2019t surprising given the complexity of the form factor and its expensive components, but it\u2019s still eye-watering. Samsung also seemingly intends to sell the device in China and South Korea, so Samsung fans elsewhere shouldn\u2019t hold their breath on global availability.\n\nMeanwhile, the Project Moohan XR headset could potentially be rebranded as \u201cGalaxy XR.\u201d The XR headset\u2019s price tag is expected to be between 2.5 and 4 million KRW (~$1,800-$2,000). The headset is expected to reach global markets, but you might have to wait a while after the Korean launch.\n\nThe release of AI glasses is new information. Previous leaks for the Ray-Ban Meta-inspired smart glasses claimed a late 2026 launch. There\u2019s a chance that Samsung could merely tease these glasses at the event, as the company has been known to do for its new product lines.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nWe might finally have a name for Samsung's triple-screen foldable\nJanuary 31, 2025\n- A new blog post claims that Samsung\u2019s first double-folding phone could be called the Galaxy G Fold.\n- The G Fold name might come from its G-shaped folding mechanism, which folds inward from both sides to protect the screen.\n- The device is rumored to have a 10-inch display and could launch as early as Q3 2025.\nWhile Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 are still months away from launch, we are already getting some juicy tidbits about the company\u2019s first triple-screen foldable phone. A Naver blog post by yeux1122, citing industry sources and display analyst Ross Young, provides fresh details on what Samsung might call the device, when it could arrive, and how it aims to stand out.\nPerhaps the most intriguing new detail is the possible name of the device. According to the blog post, Samsung\u2019s double-folding phone could be called the Galaxy G Fold, following the naming pattern of its Z Fold series. While the reasoning behind the \u201cG\u201d branding isn\u2019t clear, it may have something to do with the folding mechanism used in this phone.\nLast year, HUAWEI launched the Mate XT, its own take on a triple-screen foldable phone. The device used an S-shaped folding mechanism, where the display bent inward at one point and outward at another. However, this design introduced some durability concerns, as the phone\u2019s screen remained exposed even when folded.\nInstead of an S-fold, Samsung will reportedly use a G-shaped fold, which was recently demonstrated in one of its G-Flex prototypes, as shown below. This design folds inward from both the left and right sides, covering and protecting the display entirely when closed. By avoiding an outward-facing screen when folded, Samsung\u2019s approach should offer significantly better protection from scratches, impact damage, and wear over time.\nAccording to the blog post, the rumored Galaxy G Fold could feature a 9.96-inch display, which would make it nearly 30% bigger than the Z Fold 6\u2019s 7.6-inch screen. When folded, its height is tipped to measure 6.54 inches, comparable to a standard smartphone.\nThe report notes that it will be similar in weight to \u201cH,\u201d which could be referring to HUAWEI\u2019s Mate XT. However, Samsung\u2019s tri-foldable is expected to be slightly thicker, likely due to the inward-folding design.\nThe blog also mentions that the G Fold will use newly developed displays and protective films that are distinct from those in current Z-series phones.\nNotably, the launch window for this particular foldable appears to be shifting. While earlier speculation pointed to early 2026, the blog suggests Samsung could release the Galaxy G Fold as soon as Q3 2025, with Ross Young endorsing this timeline in an X post. However, production volumes are expected to be limited, and the price could be steep \u2014 positioning it as a niche, experimental offering rather than a mainstream flagship.\nThis exclusivity makes sense when considering Samsung\u2019s recent track record with foldables. The company has struggled to bring major innovations to its Z Fold and Z Flip models in the past few years, often recycling the same internals and designs across multiple generations. Meanwhile, competitors like HUAWEI, OnePlus, and even Google have been pushing the boundaries with thinner, lighter, and more refined foldable devices.\nSamsung has been playing it safe with its foldables for far too long. Unless it brings some serious advancements with the Galaxy G Fold, we could be looking at another foldable being marketed as the next big thing while offering a severely compromised smartphone experience.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nSamsung tri-fold's eye-watering price tag may not be the only thing stopping you from buying it\nJuly 3, 2025\n- Samsung\u2019s tri-fold phone, rumored to be called the Galaxy G Fold, is said to begin production in September and be launched in Q4 2025, according to a new report.\n- It is also said to feature a 10-inch OLED display, a Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, and a 200MP primary camera, but may have a smaller battery than the competing HUAWEI Mate XT.\n- Initial availability is expected to be limited to China and South Korea, and the price could exceed ~$2,930.\nIt\u2019s raining tri-fold leaks today. We exclusively brought you the first look at Samsung\u2019s first tri-fold foldable, rumored to be called the Samsung Galaxy G Fold. While the animations reveal much about the device, we still don\u2019t know much about the specifications. A new report is filling in some of the blanks, though there may not be good news for the tri-fold\u2019s availability.\nSouth Korean publication The Bell (h/t Jukan Choi on X) has shared specifications and Samsung\u2019s production and distribution plans for the tri-fold foldable. The report states that the company will begin production of the phone in September, with a product launch slated for Q4 2025. At next week\u2019s Samsung Unpacked event, we may get only a few details around the phone\u2019s key specifications and design instead of a full reveal.\nSamsung is said to be producing the new foldable on a small scale to gauge market response, and the Unpacked sneak peek is intended to drum up interest. Samsung Display will begin producing OLED panels for the tri-fold phone in August, aligning with Samsung Mobile\u2019s production plan.\nThere\u2019s bad news on the availability front. The report suggests that Samsung intends to sell the phone only in China and South Korea, similar to what it did for the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition. Further, the phone\u2019s price is expected to exceed 4 million KRW (~$2,930), which isn\u2019t surprising given the complexity of the form factor and its expensive components, but it\u2019s still eye-watering.\nSpeaking of components, the inner OLED display is said to measure 10-inches diagonally. Samsung is also said to be using Qualcomm\u2019s current flagship SoC, the Snapdragon 8 Elite, on the tri-fold. However, we expect a new flagship SoC to succeed the Snapdragon 8 Elite by the time the tri-fold foldable goes on sale, so Samsung\u2019s cutting-edge phone may not be as cutting-edge at launch.\nThe report mentions that the camera setup could be similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 7. This is good news, as the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to feature a primary camera upgrade, going from a 50MP sensor on the Fold 6 to a 200MP sensor. The other cameras on the Fold 7 are expected to comprise a 12MP ultrawide camera, a 10MP 3x telephoto camera, and a 10MP selfie camera. Leaks aren\u2019t clear about the selfie camera on the Fold 7\u2019s inner display, so we don\u2019t know the same about the Galaxy G Fold either.\nSamsung\u2019s tri-fold will also reportedly feature a smaller battery than the competing HUAWEI Mate XT (5,600mAh). A smaller battery will limit how long you can enjoy the expansive inner display, so it remains to be seen how Samsung balances the device\u2019s thinness with its utility. Meanwhile, HUAWEI is also said to be working on an upgrade to the Mate XT with better durability and performance, so Samsung\u2019s tri-fold will have its task cut out for itself.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nExclusive: One UI 8 gives us our first look at Samsung's upcoming tri-fold phone\nJuly 3, 2025\n- Animation files from within the latest One UI 8 build give us our first look at Samsung\u2019s tri-fold foldable\n- The device features two inward-folding hinges, commonly referred to as a G-shaped fold, which is different from the S-shaped fold on devices like the HUAWEI Mate XT.\n- This tri-fold foldable is rumored to be called the Samsung Galaxy G Fold, and is said to be unveiled next week at Samsung Unpacked.\nSamsung is going to launch its next generation of Galaxy foldables at Samsung Unpacked next week. While we\u2019re hoping to see the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and the Galaxy Z Flip FE, Samsung has also been rumored to use the event opportunity to unveil its tri-fold foldable phone, potentially called the Galaxy G Fold. You won\u2019t have to wait until next week to get your first look at the device, as we bring that to you courtesy of One UI 8.\nAn APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\nThanks to animations within the latest One UI 8 build, we now have a fair idea of what the Galaxy G Fold could look like, ahead of its impending launch.\nThe animation relates to the NFC positioning on the device, but we\u2019re more interested in how it looks.\nAs you can see, Samsung\u2019s tri-fold flagship will likely comprise three rear panels. The left-most rear panel will likely house the triple rear camera setup, in a camera island reminiscent of what we see in current Galaxy Z Fold flagships. The middle panel will likely house the cover display, and you can make out the front-facing camera (for when the device is in its folded state). The right-most panel doesn\u2019t appear to have bezels, indicating that it could be just a panel, not a display.\nHere\u2019s a dark variant of the same animation, giving us a better look at the display setup:\nOne way in which the Samsung Galaxy G Fold will likely differ from HUAWEI\u2019s Mate XT is that both the hinges on Samsung\u2019s foldable will fold inwards, like a G-shaped fold similar to Samsung Display\u2019s Flex G prototypes. In contrast, HUAWEI\u2019s foldable has one inward folding and one outward folding hinge, which is referred to as an S-shaped fold.\nHere\u2019s a look at how the Galaxy G Fold will likely fold and unfold:\nYou can see in the animation that there are two inward folding hinges on the Galaxy G Fold. It also corroborates the point that the right-most panel (left-most when flipped towards the folding display) is just a blank rear panel, not a usable display.\nLooking closely, you will also see that the two hinges are different sizes. This is likely to sandwich the display better, as equally sized hinges will not give a flat-fold without stressing/breaking the display. The blank rear panel is meant to be in the middle of this sandwich.\nIn fact, Samsung also has a warning animation advising users not to fold the panel with the rear cameras first, likely because the other hinge is smaller. If you attempt to fold it this way, the blank rear panel will not fold flat on top of the rear camera panel without breaking.\nThe unfolding animation also gives us a look at the side frame, which is recessed in the middle, likely to accommodate the volume rocker and the side button.\nSamsung doesn\u2019t seem to be calling the device as \u201cGalaxy G Fold\u201d in these animation files, though. Instead, the device is referred to as \u201cMultifold 7.\u201d There\u2019s a chance that it could merely be a working codename and not the final marketing name.\nSide note, it would be wrong to call this foldable a \u201ctriple-screen foldable\u201d since there are just two displays. Calling it a \u201ctri-fold\u201d is also technically incorrect, as there are two folding hinges, not three. However, the industry widely refers to such foldables as tri-fold, so the incorrect terminology has stuck for now. \u201cMulti-fold\u201d would be a better term, so let\u2019s hope Samsung puts its weight behind this word in some way.\nOutside of one teaser at the last Samsung Unpacked, Samsung hasn\u2019t confirmed any plans for its tri-fold foldable yet, so these animation files still need to be treated with a touch of skepticism. There\u2019s a chance that these are merely working files, and Samsung\u2019s tri-fold foldable could end up looking like something else entirely. There\u2019s also a chance it doesn\u2019t get launched at the upcoming Unpacked too, so keep an open mind. Either way, we\u2019ll keep you updated when we learn more.\nThanks to thatjoshguy69 for the assistance!\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nSamsung is working on an all-new pair of smart glasses to take on Ray-Ban Meta\nAugust 15, 2025\n- Samsung is reportedly developing affordable smart glasses inspired by Ray-Ban Meta.\n- The glasses may include a camera, speakers, and a microphone, but no display.\n- Set for a late 2026 debut, these smart glasses are separate from Samsung\u2019s XR headset plans.\nSmart glasses remain a particularly niche genre of wearable technology, even in mid-2025, but they are steadily growing in popularity. While the Ray-Ban Meta continues to lead the charge and has proven that there is a willing market, few companies have stepped up to challenge it. However, based on a new report from Korea, Samsung may be among the first big names to heed the call.\nWould you buy a pair of Samsung smart glasses?\nA report by Seoul Economic Daily claims that Samsung is developing its own pair of smart eyewear inspired by Meta\u2019s product. The product may also include integrated speakers, microphones, and a camera. Notably, the Ray-Ban Meta utilizes these features to great effect, from its live translation and Meta AI assistant features to its media player smarts. We imagine Samsung\u2019s product could do much of the same, including the ability to snag short-form videos, act on voice commands, and replace dedicated earbuds in a pinch.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nMore interesting is Samsung\u2019s apparent vision for its eyewear. The report suggests the company is convinced that smart glasses may succeed smartphones in the future, as they have the unique advantage of viewing the world from the wearer\u2019s point of view. It does have a point. Mesh this tech with generative AI and Samsung\u2019s service integration, and you will have an interesting companion for your smartwatch, Galaxy phone, and smart home environment.\nImportantly, this doesn\u2019t mean Samsung isn\u2019t ploughing ahead with its current headwear programs. These glasses are reportedly separate from Samsung\u2019s XR headset efforts, including Project Moohan. Instead, these screenless shades are intended to be more portable and capitalize on the more affordable end of the market. This suggests a modest price tag similar to Meta\u2019s offering when they eventually debut.\nSo, when will Samsung launch these smart glasses? The report suggests a late 2026 arrival, which does leave the door open for its rivals, and some have already taken full advantage. This week, HTC rolled out its own pair of smart glasses with the fashionable Vive Eagle.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nFirst hands-on video of Samsung\u2019s Project Moohan headset is here and it's pretty impressive\nJanuary 28, 2025\n- MKBHD got an exclusive first look at Samsung\u2019s unfinished Project Moohan XR headset running Android XR.\n- The headset offers a removable magnetic light shield, physical controls like a volume rocker and touchpad, and a removable battery pack for easy swaps.\n- The demo highlights Gemini AI integration, with voice and hand gestures enabling intuitive UI navigation and real-time object recognition through the headset.\nYouTuber MKBHD has been given access to an unfinished prototype of Samsung\u2019s upcoming Project Moohan XR headset running Android XR. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen the Vision Pro rival in action in an unofficial capacity after Samsung displayed some units for the show at Unpacked earlier this month.\nWhile trying on Project Moohan, which still doesn\u2019t have an official name yet, the YouTuber described it as \u201cthe Nexus or Pixel, but for headsets.\u201d The demo shows upcoming features of the device, including the ability to hold an object and draw a virtual circle around it to bring up Samsung\u2019s Circle to Search tool.\nProject Moohan: The hardware\nUnlike the Apple Vision Pro, Samsung\u2019s XR headset does not display the user\u2019s eyes to others when they are wearing it. The device comes with a removable magnetic light shield that can be added to block out more light or taken out for improved peripheral vision.\nA dial at the back of the XR headset allows users to adjust its fit. \u201cWith this setup, most of the pressure is now on my brow above my eyes, unlike with the Vision Pro, which was below my eyes because of the way it sagged,\u201d the YouTuber noted in his video.\nFor physical controls, the Project Moohan headset features a single button at the top right and a volume rocker at the top left. There\u2019s a touchpad on the right strap of the headset, which users can easily identify while wearing the device thanks to a raised bar. It\u2019s unclear if the headset will come with any controllers in the box.\nAnother thing the Samsung XR headset borrows from the Apple Vision Pro is the removable battery pack, which is attached to a cable and goes in the user\u2019s back pocket. However, the key difference between Apple\u2019s version and the Project Moohan implementation is that the USB-C cable attached to the battery can be pulled out easily without requiring an extraction tool. This would allow users to quickly swap batteries and plug in another one if the pack runs out.\nAndroid XR in action\nOther than the headset\u2019s physical attributes, the YouTuber showcased the Android XR UI on the device, something we at Android Authority have presented to our readers before. Users will be able to move and resize windows using hand gestures. The video also shows the Google Play Store in action, and the YouTuber mentions that all apps available on the Play Store will be accessible on the Samsung headset.\nThen there\u2019s the Gemini integration. Google\u2019s AI chatbot is most definitely something we were expecting to see a lot of on Project Moohan, and that seems to be the case, as shown in the demo. Gemini will be able to recognize and talk about things you see through the headset. For instance, you can ask Gemini to take you to a location you see in a magazine and it\u2019ll pull up the place in Google Maps.\nMoreover, Gemini can also navigate the headset\u2019s UI to organize windows, perform in-app actions by following voice commands, and more. You can check out MKBHD\u2019s full video above.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
