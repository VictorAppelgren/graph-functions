      "feedback": "The draft fails the acceptance gate because it does not map to any canonical handle (e.g., spx, ndx, ust10y, dxy, gold, etc.) and lacks a clear catalyst window, magnitude range, and macro‑transmission path.  All sentences that drift from a handle‑based view should be removed or re‑framed to link to a broader market theme.  Rewrite the piece as a short, handle‑centric view: e.g., “US software index (ndx) +5 bp over the next 3–6 months if CrowdStrike’s Q3 2025 earnings (release Oct 15) beat guidance (revenue >$1.25 bn, margin >‑4 %) and Falcon Next‑Gen Identity Security shows >10 % new contract uptake.”  Include a catalyst window (Oct 15 2025 earnings), sign (+ for revenue, – for margin risk), magnitude ranges (22 % YoY revenue growth, margin to 8 % by 2028), and an invalidation path (margin deterioration, product under‑performance, competitive pressure).  All remaining sentences must reference a canonical handle with inline (ID) citation or be removed.",
