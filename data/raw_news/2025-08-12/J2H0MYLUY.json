  "content": "is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nGoogle\u2019s next Pixel launch event doesn\u2019t happen until next week, but the company has already announced the Pixel 10 Pro Fold with a brief video teaser published on Tuesday. Based on the video, the new Fold will closely resemble the Pixel 9 Pro Fold \u2014 though that\u2019s not a huge surprise, based on what\u2019s already leaked about the device.\n\nThe 30-second teaser includes a few shadowy glimpses of the new device, a peek at the unfolded inner display, and a solid look at the back of the foldable and its camera system. The teaser also shows that the phone will come in the nice gray color that Google has already shown in a similar video for a Pixel 10.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel 10 Pro Fold video doesn\u2019t include any specs, unfortunately, though the phone is rumored to have an IP68 rating that would make it dustproof. Leaks have also shown the phone in green and gold colors that aren\u2019t in this video. And while the video\u2019s description includes the August 20th Pixel 10 event date, the video doesn\u2019t say when the phone might actually be released \u2014 and a report from WinFuture indicates that may not happen until October.\n\nFortunately, with Google\u2019s event just over a week away, we don\u2019t have to wait too much longer to get all the details.\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",

      "text": "Google\u2019s upcoming Pixel 10 Pro Fold could be the first dust-proof foldable. A new leak published by Android Headlines says the Pixel 10 Pro Fold may come with an IP68 rating, which would make it completely dust-tight and allow it to withstand continuous submersion in water.\nGoogle\u2019s next Pixel Fold might be completely dust-proof\nA new leak from Android Headlines suggests the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could have an IP68 rating for complete protection against dust.\nTo compare, Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Motorola Razer Ultra have an IP48 rating, which means the phones offer similar protection against submersion in water, but aren\u2019t completely dust-proof. Instead, they\u2019re only capable of sealing out objects 1mm and larger.\nAdditionally, Android Headlines reports that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could have a smaller gap between the cover display and the hinge, resulting in a slightly larger 6.4-inch outer screen when compared to 6.3 inches on last year\u2019s model. The cover screen could also come with an upgraded 3,000 nits of peak brightness.\nAlong with Google\u2019s 3nm Tensor G5 processor and 16GB of RAM, Android Headlines says the Pixel 10 Pro Fold might have a new 1TB storage option, in addition to the 256GB and 512GB variants. Google is also rumored to include a 7 percent larger battery in its new foldable when compared to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, but other than that, it seems like things may largely stay the same.\nA previous leak from Android Headlines revealed that the new foldable could have the same 8-inch inner display size as its predecessor, and may still be thicker than the ultra-slim Galaxy Z Fold 7. This latest Android Headlines report also includes details about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold\u2019s camera setup, which is rumored to stay the same, featuring a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5MP ultrawide lens, a 10.8MP telephoto camera, and two 10MP selfie cameras.\nGoogle hasn\u2019t yet announced an official date for its next Pixel event, but rumors suggest it could take the wraps off its full Pixel 10 lineup on August 20th, 2025.\nMost Popular\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- This see-thru Game Boy is a work of art \u2014 because she designed a transparent circuit board"

      "text": "Google is readying its next set of hardware announcements, and has already confirmed that the Pixel 10 series is launching this month. We even know what one of the phones looks like, thanks to the official image up above.\nBut beyond the few tidbits Google has shared officially, there\u2019s an awful lot more we think we know about the Pixel 10 line thanks to leaks, from which phones are arriving \u2014 likely the 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold \u2014 to camera changes, US prices, and maybe even some long overdue Qi2 support.\nWhat we know officially\nLet\u2019s start with some stone-cold facts. We know that the Pixel 10 line will be announced at a Made by Google event in New York on August 20th, where the company will show off \u201cthe latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds, and more.\u201d\nWe also know that one of the phones in the lineup will look like the image above, including that blue-gray finish. Color aside, that phone looks almost identical to the Pixel 9 Pro, right down to the flash and temperature sensor inside the camera bar, confirming that Google isn\u2019t changing its design language.\nYou can also see a little more of it in action in this early ad, which doesn\u2019t miss the excuse to dunk on Apple for its repeated Apple Intelligence delays.\nThat\u2019s about all Google has said for certain, but here\u2019s everything else we\u2019re expecting to see at the launch later this month.\nTriple cameras all around\nThe biggest surprise this year appears to be a move to upgrade the base Pixel 10 to a triple rear camera, including a telephoto lens for the first time, bringing it in line with the three Pro models.\nBut before you get too excited, know that there are some downsides. To offset the added cost \u2014 and perhaps to give you a reason to consider the upgrade to the Pro \u2014 Google will reportedly downgrade the Pixel 10\u2019s other cameras.\nAndroid Authority reports that Google is using smaller sensors for the Pixel 10\u2019s main camera and ultrawide than the Pixel 9 had, meaning the cameras will capture less light. In fact, it will apparently use the same sensors it did on the Pixel 9A. That means that unless Google has made improvements elsewhere, the Pixel 10\u2019s main and ultrawide cameras will be worse than on the 9, but offset by the addition of the telephoto lens. At least the selfie camera should remain unchanged.\nIt also means the triple cameras on the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL \u2014 which will apparently be unchanged from the 9 Pro models \u2014 could be superior to the 10 across the board. The 10 Pro Fold camera will be comparable to the 10\u2019s, using the same sensors for its main and telephoto shooters, and similarly specced ones for the selfie and ultrawide. That represents a very slight upgrade to the main camera in the Fold, but the base 10 is the only model getting a real camera overhaul.\nContrasting colors\nGoogle may also be making unexpected decisions about the phones\u2019 colors, going by allegedly official renders leaked by Android Headlines.\nOn the base Pixel 10 that means brighter colors than ever (and confirmation of that triple camera). The site reports that the phone will come in \u201cObsidian,\u201d Google\u2019s standard black finish, along with a vibrant blue called \u201cIndigo,\u201d a paler shade called \u201cFrost,\u201d and an almost fluorescent green dubbed \u201cLimoncello.\u201d\nBy contrast, the Pro models look muted. The 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL come in the same \u201cObsidian\u201d black, plus the returning \u201cPorcelain\u201d white, a soft green called \u201cJade,\u201d and a gray-blue called \u201cMoonstone.\u201d You might recognize that shade from Google\u2019s official image up at the top.\nStranger are the colors for the 10 Pro Fold. Android Headlines reports that it only comes in two variants, but unlike last year those aren\u2019t black and white. Instead, the Fold will apparently only be available in \u201cMoonstone\u201d and \u201cJade,\u201d making it the rare phone to not launch in black at all.\nFor more confirmation of those colors, another leaked image from the Play Store shows the full Pixel 10 lineup with the three Pro models all in \u201cMoonstone\u201d and the regular 10 in \u201cIndigo.\u201d Leaker Evan Blass has also shared multiple images of all the phones in two separate collections of leaked images on X.\nQi2 charging\nIn July, the Wireless Power Consortium announced Qi2 25W, a faster version of the magnetic wireless charging standard, and promised support from \u201cmajor Android smartphones.\u201d We think that means the Pixel 10 line.\nGoogle hasn\u2019t supported Qi2 on its previous Pixels, but there are good reasons to think that might be about to change.\nThe first is that Android Authority reported in June that Google is preparing an ecosystem of magnetic Qi2 accessories under the \u201cPixelsnap\u201d brand, including two chargers and a stand. This has been followed by later leaks of a Pixelsnap case from Android Headlines, and a recent image of a magnetic charging puck shared by Blass.\nThat latter leak is arguably the most important. While it had previously been thought that Google might follow Samsung in certifying its phones Qi2 Ready, meaning they would support Qi2 charging but not contain the magnets, this image shows a charger attaching magnetically to the phone itself, which implies full Qi2 support, magnets and all.\nFor more evidence of that, we have the size of the new handsets. Android Headlines claims to have the official dimensions and weights of all four phones, and each is heavier than the previous generation, and all but the XL are thicker, too.\nThis could just be because the phones will have bigger batteries, which several reports have suggested. But Google could also be making space for the magnets required to enable Qi2 support.\nChip upgrades\nBoring, I know \u2014 every phone, every year, has a chipset upgrade. But we are expecting more from Google this time around.\nAndroid Authority has repeatedly reported that for the new Tensor G5 chip Google is moving manufacturing from Samsung to TSMC, using the same 3nm N3E process Apple uses for the iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s A18 Pro chip. Together with some tweaks to the core layout, that\u2019s expected to produce a significant boost in processing power, closing the gap between Pixels and the competition.\nAI everywhere\nAndroid Authority reports that Google is developing several new AI imaging features, though some may be for next year\u2019s Pixel 11. \u201cSketch-to-Image\u201d will be the Pixel version of a feature already seen on Samsung phones, while \u201cSpeak-to-Tweak\u201d should be a voice-based photo editing tool. The latter has more recently been reported by Android Headlines, which claims you\u2019ll be able to use voice prompts for simple edits like \u201cchanging backgrounds, brightening images, or removing objects.\u201d\nAndroid Headlines reports that a new AI feature called \u201cCamera Coach\u201d will use Gemini to advise you as you\u2019re taking shots, giving advice on adjusting camera angles or lighting to get a better photo before you take it.\nAndroid Authority has also reported that the Pixel 10 will have a new virtual assistant called \u201cPixel Sense,\u201d once rumored to be called \u201cPixie.\u201d Pixel Sense will reportedly use information from other Google apps to complete tasks across your phone, make predictive suggestions to help you before you ask, and better learn your tastes from all that data. Impressively, that will all be processed on-device.\nIt sounds like a more powerful version of the multimodal actions Google added to Gemini in January, but going by the name, it sounds like a Pixel exclusive.\nThese AI features should arrive alongside Android updates we\u2019ve known about since Google I/O, like the big Material 3 Expressive redesign and a desktop mode based on Samsung\u2019s DeX.\nFamiliar prices and a late Fold\nIf you\u2019re worried that it sounds like Google hasn\u2019t made many outright hardware upgrades this year, you may be reassured by news that they\u2019re probably not changing their prices either. A leak from Android Headlines includes the alleged US pricing for all four phones, and it\u2019s almost identical to last year\u2019s.\nPer rumors, the Pixel 10 will start at $799 for 128GB of storage, or $899 for 256GB. The 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB, rising all the way up to $1,449 for a 1TB option.\nThe two larger phones could be the only models with price changes. The 10 Pro XL may see a price bump from $1,099 to $1,199, but that\u2019s only because Google has scrapped the phone\u2019s 128GB option, starting at 256GB instead \u2014 and matching the 9 Pro XL\u2019s pricing at that and higher storage tiers.\nMeanwhile, the 10 Pro Fold may stick with a $1,799 starting price for 256GB of storage, but the leak suggests Google is adding a new 1TB option at $2,149.\nThe Fold may also go on sale separately from the other phones. A report from WinFuture claims that due to \u201csupply chain problems,\u201d the Fold won\u2019t go on sale until October 9th. The Pixel Watch 4 and Buds 2A will reportedly be late too, while the other three phones could hit stores on August 28th.\nUpdate, August 8th: Added new Google ad, rumors of a delayed launch for the 10 Pro Fold, and new rumors about AI software features.\nMost Popular\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- This see-thru Game Boy is a work of art \u2014 because she designed a transparent circuit board"

      "text": "Google might replace the upcoming Pixel Pro Fold\u2019s white and black models with two new color options. Leaked renders shared by Android Headlines show the Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a light green \u201cJade\u201d and a silvery blue \u201cMoonstone\u201d \u2014 with no black or white option at all.\nSince the launch of Google\u2019s first foldable in 2023, the company has sold the device and its Pixel 9 Pro Fold successor in either Obsidian (black) or Porcelain (white). The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could shake up these neutral tones for something a little more colorful, and I have to say that I\u2019m liking the look of the pistachio green.\nRecent rumors suggest that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will mainly offer just a spec bump, featuring a slightly larger 6.4-inch cover display, a bigger battery, and a new 1TB storage option. Android Headlines also previously reported that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could be completely dustproof, which would be a first for foldable phones.\nGoogle will likely show off the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, along with the Pixel 10 that it already teased, during its Made by Google event on August 20th.\nMost Popular\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- This see-thru Game Boy is a work of art \u2014 because she designed a transparent circuit board"

  "argos_summary": "Google has announced its Pixel 10 launch event scheduled for August 20, 2025, where it will unveil the Pixel 10 series, including the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The teaser for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold suggests it may feature an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, a larger cover display, and new color options. However, due to supply chain issues, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, along with the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2A, may not be available until October 9, 2025, while the standard Pixel 10 models will be available shortly after the event.",
