      "feedback": "The analysis has credible directional leverage from Cadillac ElevatED Velocity and GM’s $4B U.S. manufacturing push, but it needs a tighter, sourced, 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, invalidations, and path‑dependent timing; right now the causal chain from a concept car to real-world market signals and stock implications is too diffuse and under‑quantified. Edits to upgrade to world‑class quality: (1) crystallize the causal chain with hard links and dates—e.g., Elevated Velocity’s off‑road/ Terra/e‑Velocity modes and Sand Vision are meant to signal luxury EV demand and GM’s near‑term U.S. capacity expansion to about 2 million annual vehicles, anchored by the $4B domestic investment and the Orion/Spring Hill/GK footprint shifts; attach the exact source IDs after each claim (WTNT85IPR). (2) Build a concrete 3–6 month scenario map: base case (policy/industrial clarity and modest tariff risk containment; GM earnings strong; auto capex delivering incremental U.S. output within 6–8 quarters), a bear case (tariff/legal drift tightens margins and slows EV ramp), and a bull case (AI-enabled productivity/GDP gains accelerate autos and services, easing debt dynamics); specify timing windows for each catalyst (e.g., GM earnings cadence, tariff court rulings, tariff announcements) with citations. (3) Quantify catalysts and invalidations with source‑backed numbers: GM capex guidance and US output target (~2M/yr) from WTNT85IPR; debt/policy impulse magnitudes from EPJYXB7DX (Big Beautiful Bill, potential ~$4T debt growth and political risk), and the Range/Benzinga suite’s GDP/debt channel estimates (1–1.5% productivity gains, potential debt/GDP implications); also include Pacaso/mogul metrics and Range’s AI productivity claims as optional upside levers (UPV3X2MQ6). (4) Add a precise watch list: GM earnings/recalls, GM export/freight shifts (China exposure/halts), Pacaso/mogul fundraising milestones (10 new destinations for Pacaso; 10–12% portfolio cash yields in mogul; 18.8% IRR if cited), and HeartSciences’ FDA/Medicare milestones (UPV3X2MQ6). (5) Strengthen the valuation/transmission piece with boundaries: use the cited ranges (Pacaso’s $1.8T vacation market scope; Pacaso’s quarterly growth 21%, EBITDA uplift; 40% of Americans seeking a vacation home; HeartSciences’ $32B ECG market; Douglas tires’ 40k–60k mile life versus premium tires) and clearly label uncertainties; (UPV3X2MQ6, V8TEZOR8R). (6) Reconcile conflicts and caveats explicitly: present both the $2.4T and $4T debt‑impulse estimates for the “Big Beautiful Bill” and note policy/judicial validation risk; avoid treating any single source as gospel. (7) Tighten the write‑up’s structure to ensure every substantive claim has a cited source and avoid over‑generalized statements or prose that's not anchored to a source; (8) maintain SECTION FOCUS by ending with a crisp base case, 1–2 alternates, clearly labeled risks, watch‑list signals, and a stated confidence level; and (9) keep the final paragraph compact but searchable by tagging each claim to its ID (WTNT85IPR, EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, V8TEZOR8R) to meet the density/precision standard. Overall, the piece should read as a tightly sourced, named‑scenario map with explicit triggers, invalidations, timing windows, and quantified channels, not a high‑level narrative.",
