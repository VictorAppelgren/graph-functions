  "title": "Judge denies release of Maxwell grand jury transcripts",
  "description": "The federal judge said the U.S. Justice Department request to release the files was \u201caimed not at \u2018transparency\u2019 but at diversion.\u201d",
  "content": "With a stern rebuke, a federal judge on Monday denied President Trump\u2019s request to unseal grand jury transcripts involving convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, saying \u201cthere is no \u2018there\u2019 there.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said there was nothing in the grand jury files to justify unsealing them, calling the government\u2019s arguments for unsealing \u201cdisingenuous\u201d because it would not reveal any new information about the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell.\n\n\u201cA member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government\u2019s motion for their unsealing was aimed not at \u2018transparency\u2019 but at diversion \u2013 aimed not at full disclosure but at an illusion of such,\u201d Engelmayer wrote.\n\nHe further noted that the public\u2019s interest would not be served by violating grand jury secrecy in a case where the defendant, Maxwell, is still alive and has a right to due process. After reviewing the testimony, the judge also concluded that most, if not all, of the information was already part of the public record.\n\n\u201cThe materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor. They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein\u2019s or Maxwell\u2019s,\u201d Engelmayer wrote.\n\nMaxwell, 63, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sex trafficking a minor and other related charges. She has appealed her conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is reviewing her petition.\n\nLegal experts have long said that the grand jury records would uncover nothing new, as grand jury records typically contain limited information.\n\n\u201cThe DOJ was trying to create the appearance of transparency but conspicuously focused on a tiny portion of the files which they do not have control over,\u201d said Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York.\n\n\u201cIf DOJ wanted to make public the the non-grand jury portions of their files, they could do that on their own accord unilaterally.\u201d\n\nTrump, facing criticism from his own supporters, last month announced on his Truth Social account that he had requested that the Justice DepartmentJudge Denies release of Epstein-Maxwell Grand Jury Transcripts release the grand jury records, subject to court approval,\n\nMaxwell met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche for nine hours over two days in July. She has since been transferred from a maximum security federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to a minimum-security facility in Texas where most of the inmates are serving time for white-collar or non-violent crimes. Maxwell\u2019s designation as a sex offender would make her ineligible for such a transfer, but the federal Bureau of Prisons has not explained how and why she obtained an exemption from BOP\u2019s policies.",
