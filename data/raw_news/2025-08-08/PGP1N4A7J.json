  "title": "Five surprising stats for the 2025 San Francisco Giants",
  "description": "The Giants have seemingly disappointed offensively this season, but where do they really rank relative to the league? It may surprise you.",
  "content": "This is an article about the San Francisco Giants\u2019 surprising statistics, and I must warn you: They\u2019re incredibly surprising. They\u2019re so surprising that when I tried to publish them yesterday, the entire article disappeared. There are some things that the world simply isn\u2019t ready for. And it had a joke about Chad Zerbe that would\u2019ve really made you think.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s overselling it. These are stats that exist in the middle of a Venn diagram shared by surprising and interesting. You come into every season with a set of expectations \u2014 Patrick Bailey will have strong framing numbers, Logan Webb will have one of the highest groundball rates in the game, et cetera \u2014 and you\u2019re proven right. For as much that\u2019s unpredictable about baseball, there\u2019s a lot more that\u2019s perfectly predictable.\n\nThese are the outlier stats that made me stop and do a double take, then. The Giants are having a confusing season. Here are the numbers that aren\u2019t helping matters.\n\nNot surprising at all, but I\u2019m just taking a little batting practice before the article actually starts, don\u2019t mind me.\n\nThe 1968 Tigers had a .692 OPS. The 2000 Rockies had an .816 OPS. The \u201968 Tigers scored 671 runs, and the \u201900 Rockies scored 968. Which team had the better offense?\n\nIt\u2019s a trick question, of course. It\u2019s the Tigers, who led the American League that season in both OPS and runs scored en route to a World Series win. The 2000 Rockies finished 82-80, mostly on the strength of their pitching. OPS+ would have told us this right away, showing us that the Tigers were actually 7 percent better than the average team (107 OPS+) in 1968, while the Rockies were 13 percent worse than the average team in 2000, even though they almost scored 1,000 runs. Ballparks matter. The context of a league-wide scoring environment matters, and that environment changes every year.\n\nThose are two outlier teams in outlier offensive seasons, but you get the idea. The league average is set at 100 OPS+. Everything above represents how much better a team is relative to the league. Everything below is how much worse they are.\n\nThe 2025 Giants, as of right now, are a perfectly average offensive team. A cool 100 OPS+, right on the nose. They\u2019ve done some work to get there over the last two weeks, scoring eight runs or more in a third of their games, so this is a relatively recent development. Still, it\u2019s a reminder that the Giants aren\u2019t the complete offensive black hole that they can appear to be, especially during night games at Oracle Park.\n\nDoes that make it fun to watch them struggle to score three runs against the Pirates at Oracle on a Tuesday night? It does not. But it probably wouldn\u2019t be that much different if an excellent offense played there instead. They would often struggle to score four runs, instead. This is just a part of Giants baseball, and it probably always will be. Some fans get to watch a lot of runs and home runs; Giants fans get one helluva view and the best ballpark in baseball.\n\nWorth it. But the swap will occasionally lead to teams like this, where you squint and hold the computer up to your nose in disbelief? This team? This team is average at hitting baseballs?\n\nYep. And they should probably be even better, too.\n\nIndividual stat \u2014 Willy Adames has one of the longest swings in baseball\n\nWhat\u2019s your immediate reaction to this stat? Probably not a favorable one. I actually said \u201coof\u201d out loud when I read it. That\u2019s because, if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re conditioned to think of long swings as a cautionary tale. It\u2019s how you support a claim that a prospect will be a bust, and it\u2019s why nobody will be surprised when it happens. His swing was too long, they\u2019ll all say.\n\nExcept that\u2019s not quite how it works. Adames has the sixth-longest swing in baseball. Directly above him, in fifth place, is Aaron Judge. Right behind him, in seventh place as of Thursday, is Shohei Ohtani. That\u2019s a good set of baseball-player bookends to be in the middle of. It might be one of the best baseball-player bookends of all time. The obvious takeaway is it\u2019s likely that long swings don\u2019t correlate negatively with offensive production. It\u2019s possible that they don\u2019t correlate at all.\n\nThere\u2019s a marked difference between Adames and those players, obviously, and not just in terms of production. Both Judge and Ohtani have elite bat speed, and Adames\u2019 bat speed has been closer to league average. That\u2019s the difference between a good player\u2019s long swing and a future Hall of Famer\u2019s long swing, so please don\u2019t think the point of the factlet was to compare them. It just wasn\u2019t something I knew and/or expected.\n\nIf there\u2019s good news, it\u2019s that Adames\u2019 bat speed was well above average in 2024, and that combination helps explain the contract he got as a free agent. With a little more bat speed, it was a 30-homer swing, and there are all sorts of reasons why a player\u2019s average bat speed can fluctuate, so the explanation doesn\u2019t have to be age. It\u2019s a possible explanation, and it could even be the Occam\u2019s Razor-preferred one, but it\u2019s not a given. Bat-speed tracking is still brand new to the general baseball public, so we\u2019re all making it up as we go along.\n\nWaaaaaaait a second, you cry. You can\u2019t spend a couple paragraphs blathering about how the poor widdle Giants have to hit in the most extreme pitcher\u2019s park in baseball, only to turn around and fete their pitchers for using the ballpark to their advantage. That\u2019s double-dipping!\n\nSure, but there\u2019s a difference between \u201cOracle Park is a reason the Giants fare well in this category\u201d and \u201cOracle Park is the reason the Giants fare well,\u201d and this team is clearly an example of the former. There are 60 home-away splits to compare the Giants to \u2014 30 teams, each with two splits \u2014 and of those 60, the Giants are 59th in home runs allowed at Oracle Park. If there\u2019s a surprise there, it\u2019s only that they\u2019re not last. (Globe Life Park and the Rangers are the new champs here, which means Bruce Bochy has seen a lot of 2-1 games in his day.) Otherwise, yeah, the Giants don\u2019t allow home runs at Oracle Park. Big whoop.\n\nHowever, their road HR/9 is almost as impressive. The rank 50th out of those 60 home-away splits, and only two teams\u2019 away splits are better: the Dodgers and Mets. That\u2019s pretty good company for a pitching staff to keep in 2025, and it was surprising because while the Giants still have the highest groundball rate in baseball, their gap is shrinking. They\u2019ve had the highest GB% since 2021, sometimes with substantial margins over the second-place team. They\u2019re essentially tied with the Mets this season, with their lowest overall rate in several seasons.\n\nIt\u2019s going to get worse without Camilo Doval and Tyler Rogers in the bullpen. They\u2019ve consistently had low, low home run rates, allowing just five to the 406 combined batters they\u2019ve faced this season. For perspective, Carson Seymour has allowed that many home runs to the 48 batters he\u2019s faced this season. So keep an eye on this stat. It\u2019s possible that the Giants\u2019 reign of worm-threatening domination is over.\n\nEither way, this one caught me off-guard too because, anecdotally speaking, it\u2019s felt like the Giants\u2019 staff has gone through dinger-soaked stretches this season, more so than in the typical season. The numbers say no, however, which is why we keep the numbers around in the first place. It\u2019s like J. Edgar Hoover famously said to Ginger Baker during the recording of the \u201cDisraeli Gears\u201d album: \u201cThere are three types of truths: Truths, super-cool truths, and statistics.\u201d\n\nIndividual stats \u2014 Matt Chapman and Patrick Bailey have had the most important hits from any player in the 2025 season so far\n\nThis is according to a couple of nerd stats known as Win Probably Added (WPA) and Championship Win Probability Added (cWPA). When cWPA was released in 2021, I wrote about the Giants\u2019 cWPA heroes during the championship era, and it included an explanation of how these two stats work. Go there for some nuts and bolts, if desired.\n\nOtherwise, let\u2019s dig in. When Chapman came up to the plate in the ninth inning of the June 7 game against the Braves, the Giants\u2019 win probability was 9 percent based on the number of outs, the number of runners on base, the score and other factors. When his at-bat was over, the Giants had a 100-percent chance of winning the game \u2026 because they\u2019d just won the game.\n\nAccording to Baseball-Reference, no single swing did more to win a baseball game this season. That goes for all 30 teams, and what\u2019s more is that it was the 16th-most impactful swing of the entire 2000s. It was the single-most effective swing in the history of Oracle Park. It wasn\u2019t just your regular ol\u2019 walk-off home run, and there are a few reasons why. There were two outs, the run-scoring environment was tough and the runner was only on first base.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s one thing to win a single game. But what about a whole danged World Series? That\u2019s what cWPA is used for, and it takes even more factors into consideration, such as the standings at the time the game was played. When Bailey hit his walk-off inside-the-park home run, the Phillies and Giants were both in postseason position. And they were both potential wild cards at the time, which meant the system saw them as direct competitors. Taking a win away from the Phillies and giving it to the Giants made a small-but-substantial difference to each team\u2019s hopes.\n\nNo swing has gotten their team closer to a parade than this one so far. We\u2019re talking about the team\u2019s odds moving by less than 1 percent, so don\u2019t oversell it, but it still would have been an important win for a team with championship hopes. Unlike Chapman\u2019s homer, though, this one is guaranteed to get usurped as the season goes on. There will be more important swings in August, September and, of course, October by this metric.\n\nFor now, though, remember the good times. It was also one of the objectively coolest home runs that baseball can possibly produce, which doesn\u2019t count toward this stat, but counts in our hearts.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a chaos-theory nerd. Where most people are content to remember what Cody Ross did to the Phillies, I spend more time thinking about the dominos that had to fall for Cody Ross to be on the Giants in the first place. What if Giancarlo Stanton didn\u2019t convince the Marlins that he was ready for a full-time right field gig at the tender age of 20? What if the Marlins, who were over .500 when they waived Ross, could play for a second wild-card spot? What if Giants ownership was too frugal to block Ross from going to the Padres?\nAdvertisement\nDon\u2019t get me started about what happens if the Giants draft Beau Mills instead of Madison Bumgarner.\nThis what-if fetishization extends to what happened in the games, too. Sure, the Giants had a 3-1 series lead when Travis Ishikawa won the pennant in 2014, but what happens if he bounces into a 6-4-3 double play to end the inning, instead? The Giants might lose and head back to St. Louis with a 3-2 lead, which is still good, but maybe that just sets up the Cardinals\u2019 version of Barry Zito. Maybe Kolten Wong looks to the sky and drinks a few raindrops at the end of Game 7.\nWith the specific plays, though, there\u2019s a way to quantify the what-if. It\u2019s not perfect, but it is fascinating, and it comes from Baseball-Reference. It\u2019s called championship win probability, or cWPA, and although that sounds like something that makes your brain hurt, the math isn\u2019t that convoluted.\n\u2022 Assume each team has a 50 percent chance of winning every specific game\n\u2022 Assume a team has a 50 percent chance of winning every specific postseason series\n\u2022 Do a bunch of math for each play in every game\n\u2022 Come up with a number that helps explain just how much each play affected a team\u2019s championship hopes\nIs it irrefutable science? Nope. Can I do the calculations on the back of an envelope? Nooooooooooope.\nIs it cool? Heck, yeah.\nBaseball-Reference\u2019s example has to do with The Shot Heard \u2018Round the World, and it\u2019s perfect. If the Giants didn\u2019t win that game, their season was over. If Bobby Thomson made an out, their season was almost over. If he hit a home run, they were in the World Series. His at-bat affected his team\u2019s championship odds more than any in regular-season history. The Giants lost that World Series, but Thomson got them closer than any single play that season.\nSo I want to look for the cWPA plays for the Giants\u2019 postseason series from 2010-14. Because you don\u2019t want to know that the highest-leverage play from the 2002 World Series was actually a bloop single that Barry Bonds missed and booted. That isn\u2019t helping anyone feel good about themselves.\nAdvertisement\nThough it does make you think.\nWe\u2019ll break this down by hitters and pitchers, and we\u2019ll also look at each individual series. Which hits and outs were the most important in the championship runs?\nWild-card game\nWith just one wild-card game in the three championship runs, this isn\u2019t going to be much of a surprise. Brandon Crawford\u2019s grand slam was the most important at-bat of the 2014 wild-card game, of course, with a 2.41 cWPA. With one swing from Crawford, the Giants had a 4-0 lead, and it also cast Lvl. 56 Dispel on the entire crowd, which left them unable to speak for the rest of the game. It was \u2026 helpful in the team\u2019s championship efforts.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it was the only important part of that game. When the inning started, the Giants had a 50 percent chance of winning the game.\nWhen Pablo Sandoval singled with no outs, the Giants had a 54 percent chance of winning the game.\nWhen Hunter Pence followed that with a single, the Giants had a 61 percent chance of winning the game.\nWhen Brandon Belt walked to load the bases, the Giants had a 70 percent chance of winning the game. It was the second-most important plate appearance of the game, with a 1.14 cWPA, which roughly means that the walk improved the Giants\u2019 championship chances by a full percentage point. But Crawford\u2019s grand slam pushed the expected winning percentage to 90 percent in the game, and the Giants didn\u2019t look back.\nWhen Ishikawa grounded out to second after the grand slam, the Giants\u2019 expected winning percentage slipped by a point, which is simply unacceptable. Get it together and do something, Travis.\nNLDS\nAgain, this stat isn\u2019t perfect. We\u2019re not talking science. Every part of a championship season fits together like a 10,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, and if you miss just one piece, the picture is incomplete.\nAdvertisement\nBut I love it because it\u2019s a perfect way to appreciate some underappreciated moments. Here are the top-five NLDS moments for cWPA by the Giants from 2010-14:\n1. Brandon Crawford\u2019s triple off Mat Latos, 2012 Game 5 (4.91 cWPA)\n2. Buster Posey\u2019s ground ball to Brooks Conrad, 2010 Game 4 (4.59)\n3. Aubrey Huff\u2019s single right before that Conrad error, 2010 Game 4 (4.29)\n4. Buster Posey\u2019s grand slam off Mat Latos, 2012 Game 5 (3.36)\n5. Brandon Belt\u2019s 18th-inning HR, 2014 Game 2 (3.18)\nCrawford\u2019s triple in Game 5 of the 2012 NLDS definitely gets overlooked. If the inning ends without him scoring from third, it\u2019s still a huge moment in the game. And if the Giants end up winning that game without Posey\u2019s grand slam, what do you remember? It becomes the story of how it was Crawford who slew the diabolical Latos. While I can\u2019t embed the video for technical reasons, you can watch the triple here.\nI can embed this video, though:\nA fair trade.\nIf you asked me to guess before this, I probably would have assumed the Posey grand slam was higher, but this makes sense. It\u2019s an elimination game, which is why it\u2019s rated higher than Belt\u2019s homer or the Conrad play. And there\u2019s a big difference when it comes to win probability differences between the one-run lead after Crawford\u2019s triple and the six-run lead after Posey\u2019s grand slam: The additional four runs are building off the initial one-run lead.\nWe should talk about Crawford\u2019s triple more. According to the cold, unfeeling numbers, it added more to a Giants championship run than anything else they\u2019ve done in the NLDS.\nNLCS\nYou want upsets? Here\u2019s an upset:\n1. Juan Uribe\u2019s home run, 2010 Game 6 (7.87 cWPA)\n2. Marco Scutaro first-inning single, 2012 Game 7 (4.82)\n3. Matt Cain\u2019s second-inning single, 2012 Game 7 (4.75)\n4. Michael Morse\u2019s home run, 2014 Game 5 (4.70)\n5. Travis Ishikawa\u2019s home run, 2014 Game 5 (4.40)\nAdvertisement\nThe upset isn\u2019t the first one. You might have guessed Uribe\u2019s home run.\nBut Scutaro hitting a single in the first inning of Game 7 in the 2012 NLCS that moved \u00c1ngel Pag\u00e1n from first to third? Matt Cain\u2019s single the next inning? I had to be reminded of these moments. And it\u2019s at this point that you\u2019re ready to give up on the stat.\nDon\u2019t. I can explain! It\u2019s all about the importance of a Game 7.\nIf Ishikawa pops out in the 2014 pennant-clincher, the Giants\u2019 championship chances take a hit. But that would have been the second out of the inning. Maybe Crawford singles to win the pennant in the next at-bat. Or maybe he walks, and then Matt Duffy comes up as a pinch-hitter and gets hit by a pitch. Or maybe Andrew Susac hits a pinch-hit homer in the 16th inning. Or maybe Posey drives in seven runs in Game 6. Or maybe Bumgarner hits a go-ahead home run in Game 7.\nIf Scutaro makes an out, the Giants have 26 potential outs left in their season. Every out that doesn\u2019t lead to a run is an out that gets them closer to elimination. A team scores an average of 0.56 runs when they have a runner at first and one out. When they have runners at first and third and nobody out, they score an average of 1.8 runs. It\u2019s a huge shift in the inning.\nThere\u2019s more. I don\u2019t know the exact record, but teams that have been held scoreless have never won a single postseason game. It\u2019s true! So even just the potential one run gives the Giants a much better chance of winning Game 7. And winning Game 7 gives the Giants a 50-50 shot at winning the World Series, which is way better than the Cardinals had after that game.\nThere you have it. Put some respect on Cain\u2019s single while you\u2019re at it. It came with two outs, and it doubled the Giants\u2019 lead. They had a 66 percent win probability before his single and a 75 percent win probability afterward. That might not seem like a lot, but when it comes to Game 7 \u2014 and the chances of winning a World Series after that \u2014 it\u2019s bigger than it gets credit for.\nAdvertisement\nThe math says so.\nWorld Series\nAnd you can\u2019t argue with math. Can you?\n1. Michael Morse\u2019s game-winning single, 2014 Game 7 (11.45 cWPA)\n2. Pablo Sandoval\u2019s two-out, bases-loaded single, sixth inning of 2014 Game 4 (9.54)\n3. Brandon Belt\u2019s single to load the bases, second inning of 2014 Game 7 (7.74)\n4. Edgar Renter\u00eda\u2019s danged home run, 2010 Game 5 (7.53)\n5. Aubrey Huff\u2019s home run, 2010 Game 4 (6.15)\nThe top moment from the 2012 World Series was Sandoval\u2019s second homer off Justin Verlander, in case you were wondering. But when it comes to pushing the Giants closer to a championship, nothing he ever did can top his RBI single from the sixth inning of Game 4 in 2014.\nWhich you definitely remember. Right?\nI mean, I was covering the game. So I definitely remember it like it was yesterday.\nGimme one second.\nOf course, of course, of course. I really do remember it right now, and the whole comeback is starting to, well, come back to me. The Giants were in a pickle in Game 4, and then they rallied. Then they rallied some more. And then a right-handed hitting (!) Sandoval got them out in front, and they ended up running away with the game.\nIf Sandoval makes an out, the Giants might go down 3-1 in the series. With the single, they had an 86-percent chance of winning.\nIf Renter\u00eda makes an out in Game 5 of the 2010 fall classic, maybe the Giants win the World Series at home, with Tim Lincecum hitting a pinch-hit inside-the-park home run. You don\u2019t know what was stolen from you, you just don\u2019t.\nOK, fine, I am also just a little skeptical when it comes to ranking Sandoval\u2019s single over Renter\u00eda\u2019s home run. And that\u2019s before we get to Belt\u2019s Game 7 single from 2014, which is third on that list, even though it didn\u2019t lead to a run at all.\nThe overall idea makes sense, though. If you\u2019re trying to compute a path to winning the World Series, a ninth-inning homer in Game 1 of the NLDS is worth less than a ninth-inning homer in Game 7 of the NLCS. And once you\u2019re OK with that distinction, then you can get used to the idea of a fourth-inning single in the World Series being more valuable than a ninth-inning homer in the NLCS. Or that same single getting more credit than an actual World Series-winning homer from 2010.\nSo, in sum, here are the most important at-bats in Giants\u2019 postseason history from 2010-14.\n| Series | Game | Inning | Event | cWPA |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\n2014 WS\n|\nGame 7\n|\nt4\n|\nMichael Morse single\n|\n11.45%\n|\n|\n2014 WS\n|\nGame 4\n|\nb6\n|\nPablo Sandoval single\n|\n9.54%\n|\n|\n2010 NLCS\n|\nGame 6\n|\nt8\n|\nJuan Uribe home run\n|\n7.87%\n|\n|\n2014 WS\n|\nGame 7\n|\nt2\n|\nBrandon Belt single\n|\n7.74%\n|\n|\n2010 WS\n|\nGame 5\n|\nt7\n|\nEdgar Renter\u00eda home run\n|\n7.53%\n|\nDon\u2019t yell at me. Yell at the math. And don\u2019t yell at the math because we\u2019re just having fun here. There were still a lot of ways for the Giants to win the World Series if Renter\u00eda strikes out in 2010, but there were far fewer ways to win if Morse doesn\u2019t punch an RBI single to right field in 2014. I\u2019d never thought of it like that, but I sure do now.\nAdvertisement\nYou don\u2019t have to give up your favorite postseason moments. Just know that we have a new way to appreciate some of the moments that might have been forgotten otherwise.\nSo, where were you when Matt Cain hit his single?\nIt was one of the biggest moments in San Francisco Giants history, after all.\n(Photo: Jose Carlos Fajardo / Bay Area News Group via Getty Images)"
