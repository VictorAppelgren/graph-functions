Apple permanently closed its store at another dying mall in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook earlier this year.\nFortunately, there are two silver linings to this news.\nFirst, Apple said that all affected retail employees at Apple Partridge Creek will have the opportunity to continue their roles with the company.\nSecond, Apple confirmed that its all-new store in Downtown Detroit will open later this year, so the company's total number of stores in Michigan will ultimately not change. Apple Somerset will continue to serve customers in Detroit's northern suburbs.\nApple's full statement, shared with MacRumors:\nAt Apple, we're committed to delivering an exceptional experience for all customers, and we're excited to open our new retail location in Downtown Detroit later this year. As we prepare to open, we will not continue our lease at Apple Partridge Creek, and all of our valued team members will have the opportunity to continue their roles with Apple.

The company is still opening and remodeling stores in several countries, including the U.S., Spain, Sweden, Malaysia, South Korea, China, and others."
