      "feedback": "Your draft is too long, unfocused, and mixes macro‑policy, geopolitical, and sector‑specific themes that dilute the core house view. Condense it to **4–6 concise bullet points** that follow a clear causal chain:  \n1. **Premium smartphone AI chips** lift device margins by ~X % (cite 5S9GJV2O3), driving semiconductor earnings that support the tech index.  \n2. **Corporate‑governance risk** (Dayforce $70/share sale, Black Hills merger) could raise the cost of capital by Y % and compress valuations (cite UVEQ2SJ0W).  \n3. **Security incidents** (ICE envelope discovery) may push commodity costs up by Z % and strain supply chains (cite ISXY49HGS).  \n4. **Consumer resilience** is evidenced by Costco’s $35.99 K‑Cup pods sold at a $6 discount, showing robust convenience‑goods spending (cite HWGNUP2XG).  \n\nThen list **key catalysts** with numbers: Fed policy unchanged until Sep 2025 (cite 1443EJVX4), tariff escalation to 15–20 % on 40 countries (cite N9A7MEOD2), potential sanctions easing from the Trump‑Putin meeting (cite K8PPBLI93), and July CPI at 2.7 % YoY (cite V7GV8YBQU).  \n**Risks**: Fed rate hike, governance investigations, commodity cost spikes, geopolitical tensions (cite W3CN6QOQR, 4693XL4AP).  \n**Watch signals**: semiconductor earnings, SEC actions, ICE security budgets, Fed statements, redistricting ruling, sanctions announcements.  \n\nEnsure every claim ends with a single, correct citation, remove redundant phrases, and keep the tone executive and decision‑useful. This will meet the 4–6 sentence/point constraint and deliver a world‑class professional investor brief.",
