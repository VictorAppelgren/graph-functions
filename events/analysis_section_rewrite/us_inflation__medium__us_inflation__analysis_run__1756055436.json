      "feedback": "Strong start, but to reach world‑class, tighten the logic into a crisp 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, invalidations, and quantification anchored to the cited sources. Edit notes: 1) Reframe as a tight, event‑driven map: base case anchored in GM’s EV ramp and Elevated Velocity signals (WTNT85IPR) plus a tariff/price channel (25% passenger vehicle tariff and auto‑parts tariff timeline cited in WTNT85IPR and related Fox Business items) with a clearly stated timing window (next 1–4 quarters) and a path‑dependent view toward domestic capacity expansion (GM capex guidance 10–12B through 2027; >2M annual output by 2027). 2) State explicit triggers and invalidations: tariff announcements or escalations, GM’s capex/production updates, Cadillac/V‑Series EV market uptake, and policy moves around the “big, beautiful bill” (EPJYXB7DX) as a risk/embedded tail; invalidations if tariffs disappoint or if policy fails to pass, or if GM delays capacity plans (GM). 3) Build two concrete alts: (a) AI/fintech/real‑estate platform growth as a secular offset to macro headwinds (Range’s AI wealth platform and Pacaso expansion to 10 international destinations with 1.8T vacation‑home market potential) and (b) healthcare AI adoption via HeartSciences’ AI‑ECG with FDA/Medicare milestones; cite Pacaso/Range content in UPV3X2MQ6 and HeartSciences in ILYC1M41F. 4) Quantify where possible: cite 25% tariffs; GM capex band; GM’s stated capacity targets; Pacaso’s revenue/expansion metrics; HeartSciences’ addressable market and FDA/Medicare timelines; use these numbers as the numeric backbone rather than qualitative adjectives. 5) Strengthen the causal chain by mapping channels: tariff → pricing/inventory dynamics at dealers (illustrate with AI‑driven pricing signals) → GM/U.S. production lift → EV mix shift and margins; cross‑check that logic against the Range/Pacaso/HeartSciences growth channels as alternative engines of growth (WTNT85IPR; GM; UPV3X2MQ6; ILYC1M41F; EPJYXB7DX). 6) Ensure clarity on watch signals and invalidations: tariff roadmaps, GM volume/capex cadence, equity rotations in autos/industrials, AI platform capital flows, and HeartSciences FDA/ Medicare milestones; reconcile signals that tariffs can both boost domestic content and raise consumer prices (capture both sides). 7) Tighten format to satisfy SECTION FOCUS: present a base case, 1–2 alts, defined catalysts, timing windows, and a concise risk/watch list; end with a succinct confidence assessment. 8) Citations: ground every assertion to IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL (WTNT85IPR, GM, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, EPJYXB7DX) and reconcile any conflicting signals within those sources rather than introducing external views. This will yield a sharper, numbers‑driven, 3–6 month roadmap with explicit triggers, invalidations, and a defensible base case plus two plausible alternatives.",
