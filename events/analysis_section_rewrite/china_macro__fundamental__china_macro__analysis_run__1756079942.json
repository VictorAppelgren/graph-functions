      "feedback": "Strongest path to world-class quality is to replace the current narrative with a tightly structured, multi‑year regime framework anchored in first principles, then layer quantitative, source‑backed specifics and explicit catalysts/invalidation points. Edit plan in one compact paragraph: 1) Build a clear multi‑year regime map (Regime A: U.S. policy stabilizes with dollar softening and EM inflows; Regime B: a tactical policy tightening/strong dollar shock reappears; Regime C: sustained U.S.–China tech/ tariff pressure) and state regime transition conditions (e.g., Fed path implied by inflation/labor data; dollar trajectory; China growth/credit impulses; AI‑chip policy signals). Ground the anchors in invariant concepts: real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity, BoP/external balance dynamics, and standard policy reaction functions; cite explicit anchors from the sources (75187DPQA for the undervalued Asian stock slate; N26K1HXBH and related pieces for macro/FX transmission; 40M82JY72 for geopolitical/defense backdrop that can alter risk premia). 2) Clarify the causal chain from regime inputs to market pricing: regime implies discount rate/risk premia moves, which shifts cash‑flow discounting and drives re‑rating of cash‑flow names (600100, 2645, 300253) when earnings growth proves durable; specify how debt loads (600100 ~67.5% vs 300253 ~18.8% vs 2645 ~41.3%) constrain capex/dividends and hence cash flows, tying to their reported interest coverage and cash balances (e.g., 2645 interest coverage 374.8x; 300253 debt/eq 18.8%; 2645 cash NT$5.54b; 300253 cash CN¥1.33b; 600100 debt/eq 67.5% with limited near‑term cash coverage). 3) Strengthen the scenario structure with concrete catalysts/invalidation: specify trigger events and timings (e.g., next earnings cadence for 600100/2645/300253; Tencent AI path and NVIDIA/AI‑chip policy signals; AUKUS deployments/maintenance capacity; China property/consumption signals; tariff pace). Also give an explicit invalidation vector: a surprise tightening of US policy or a sharp dollar rally, a re‑acceleration in China real estate/consumption weakness, or a tech export restriction shock that derates E/R growth. 4) Quantify inputs with traceable numbers and reconcile conflicts: present the base, bull, and bear numbers with explicit deltas and sources (600100: fair value CN¥14.58 vs price CN¥8.13; 44% undervalued; earnings forecast ~93.8%/3yr; 300253: fair value CN¥20.62 vs price CN¥10.92; 63.4% earnings growth; 18.7% revenue; 24.8%/18.8% debt metrics; 2645: fair value NT$205.47 vs NT$183; 63.4%/18–19% growth; 41.3% debt; Cash/FCF coverage; include timescales and last update stamps (75187DPQA; ce106cd6-ffa6-420d-b083-2d569d2c7abb; 6b0f4dfd-8123-408b-8e12-2d3948a1b2b9; 40M82JY72). 5) Improve citation discipline and conflict resolution: after each quantitative claim attach the exact ID (e.g., “600100 fair value CN¥14.58 (Simply Wall St screener, 600100;  ce106cd6-ffa6-420d-b083-2d569d2c7abb)”); explicitly note any inconsistencies across sources (e.g., 12 vs 71 submarines in the naval pieces; 3 vs 11 carriers) and state which source you treat as baseline for that fact; 6) Tighten the transmission channels: map valuation re‑rating to macro signals (weaker dollar and EM breadth from N26K1HXBH; Fed timing from OLND309B9/N26K1HXBH; geopolitical/chip policy from 40M82JY72/N5CNJJE9J) and add a concise “watch list” of 6–8 datapoints (Tencent earnings; NVIDIA/H20 policy; AUKUS maintenance spillover; China property and domestic demand; Chinese cash‑flow upgrades; US‑China tariff postures). 7) Deliver a clean base‑case with a 2–3 year uplift target (e.g., 10–40% upside on top undervalued screens where cash‑flow growth proves durable and debt is manageable); provide explicit probability weights for each regime and attach a brief confidence rubric. 8) Refine formatting to present a coherent narrative, with a short executive framing, followed by regime/map anchors, then a driven causal chain, then the base/bull/bear cases with catalysts/invalidation, then a watchlist and a concise conclusion; ensure every factual claim ties to a single ID from the source set (75187DPQA, 600100/300253/2645 health/valuation records, 40M82JY72, N26K1HXBH, OLND309B9, and related scraped health/future pages) to meet the density and correctness standard.",
