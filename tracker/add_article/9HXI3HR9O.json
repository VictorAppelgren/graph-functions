      "summary": "The article reports increasing vandalism of public electric vehicle charging stations, with cracked screens and damaged cords causing outages and eroding driver confidence. Incidents in the U.S., U.K., and Minnesota highlight the vulnerability of on‑screen interfaces and the broader reliability concerns for EV infrastructure. The damage not only inconveniences drivers but also undermines trust in the network, prompting some to install home solar chargers instead. The piece underscores the need for more robust, vandal‑proof charging solutions to support the transition away from gasoline vehicles.",
