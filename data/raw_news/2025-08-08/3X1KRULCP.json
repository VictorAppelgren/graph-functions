  "content": "China came close to overtaking the United States as Germany's largest trading partner in the first half of 2025, preliminary data from the German statistics office showed, as German exports to the U.S. declined amid higher tariffs.\n\nGerman imports and exports with the U.S. totalled about 125 billion euros ($145 billion) from January to June, while trade with China reached 122.8 billion euros, according to Reuters calculations.\n\n\"Although the U.S. was able to defend its position as Germany\u2019s most important trading partner, the lead over German trade with China is razor-thin,\" said Vincent Stamer, economist at Commerzbank.\n\nThe U.S. had overtaken China as Germany\u2019s top trading partner in 2024, ending an eight-year streak for China. The shift came as Germany sought to reduce its reliance on China, with Berlin citing political differences and accusing Beijing of unfair practices.\n\nTrade dynamics shifted again, however, in 2025 with Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House and renewed tariffs. The EU\u2019s trade deal with the U.S. in July set tariffs at 15% for most products.\n\n\u201cAs the year progresses, losses in German exports to the U.S. are likely to continue and even intensify,\u201d said Juergen Matthes, head of international economic policy at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research.\n\nGerman exports to the U.S. fell 3.9% to 77.6 billion euros in the first half compared to the same period last year.\n\nCommerzbank expects new U.S. tariffs to slow Germany\u2019s exports to the U.S. by 20% to 25% over the next two years.\n\n\u201cAs a result, China is likely to regain the top spot among Germany\u2019s trading partners over the course of the year,\u201d Stamer said.\n\nImports from China surged 10.7% year-on-year in the first half, reaching 81.4 billion euros.\n\n\u201cApparently, German companies and consumers find it difficult to replace Chinese goods,\u201d Stamer said.\n\nThe rise may indicate China has begun redirecting trade from the U.S. to Europe, flooding the German and European market with cheaper goods, said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. A significant undervaluation of the yuan against the euro is also making Chinese imports cheaper, said Cologne Institute's Matthes.\n\nGerman exports to China fell 14.2% to 41.4 billion euros, with exporters struggling amid increased competition from Chinese manufacturers.\n\nThe sharp decline in exports to China, combined with surging imports, has led to a record trade deficit of 40 billion euros, second only to 2022.\n\n\u201cAll these developments are damaging the German economy and further exacerbating the industrial crisis,\u201d Matthes said.",

  "summary": "China nearly surpassed the United States as Germany's largest trading partner in the first half of 2025, according to preliminary data from the German statistics office. This comes as German exports to the U.S decreased due to higher tariffs and increased political differences with China. The U.K. had previously overtaken China as Germany\u2019s top trading partner, ending an eight-year streak for China. However, this changed in 2025 due to the return of President Donald Trump and renewed tariffs. The EU's trade deal with the US in July set tariffs at 15% for most products.
