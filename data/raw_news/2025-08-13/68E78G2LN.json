  "content": "The next stage of Glasgow's \u00a31bn campus redevelopment is under way as it seeks to create facilities to keep it ahead of the pack before its 600th anniversary in 2051. Only Oxford, Cambridge and St Andrews have been around longer, and Glasgow's global reputation for excellence means it recruits internationally, with overseas students making up around one in five of the record undergraduate intake in September 2024. The main Gilmorehill campus is in Glasgow's West End; a 14-acre site next door is where all the new buildings are going up. A further campus at Garscube, four miles away, is home to outdoor sports facilities, veterinary medicine students and the catered Wolfson Hall student accommodation. Further afield in Dumfries, the university teaches social and environmental sustainability, as well as its primary education with teaching qualification. Four in five of the domestic intake are recruited from Scotland, although a sizeable minority make the long trip from London and South-East England - some of them taking advantage of generous bursary support that more than offsets the extra year of study required for Scottish degrees for students from low-income households.\n\nStudents recruited from the rest of the UK (RUK) who live in homes with income of \u00a325,000 or under receive a World Changers RUK Access bursary worth \u00a33,000 per year. Worth \u00a312,000 over the course of a standard four-year degree, it more than offsets the extra \u00a39,535 in tuition fees incurred in Scotland from the additional year of study compared top non-Scottish universities. A further \u00a31,000 a year can be earned with a World Changers RUK Excellence scholarship, which is paid to students who achieve A*AA or better in their A-levels or equivalent, so long as they're not applying for medicine, dentistry or veterinary medicine. For Scottish students, there are up to 50 Talent scholarships worth \u00a31,500 per year if they achieve AABB to BBBB in Higher examinations and can show via two 4,000-character personal statements their motivation and commitment to education and the family and financial circumstances that might preclude them from taking up their place at university. About 30 James McCune Smith scholarships, worth \u00a32,000 in the first year of study, are awarded each year to black heritage students who could face financial difficulties in taking up their place at Glasgow. With close to 5,400 places in university-owned residential accommodation, Glasgow can guarantee a room to all first years who want one. Shared self-catered rooms begin at \u00a34,876 for a 39-week tenancy, while a premium studio will cost \u00a39,126 for 39 weeks. Catered accommodation at Wolfson Hall costs from \u00a37,972 to \u00a38,812.\n\nA \u00a3324m investment in IT network infrastructure and the new Keystone Building has been approved in the past year as the latest phase of Glasgow's \u00a31bn campus redevelopment programme, one of the biggest ongoing higher education capital projects in the UK. The 27,000 square metres Keystone Building will be the second biggest structure by size on the Gilmorehill campus after the 19th century Gilbert Scott Building. It will accommodate about 3,600 students in multi-use premises dedicated to teaching, learning and research. It will be home to the James Watt School of Engineering and provide a range of wet and dry laboratories as well as high-spec computing labs. Work also began in November 2024 to upgrade the annexe of the main university library. Four major developments have been completed already under the ongoing building programme. They include the Clarice Pears Building, which opened in 2024, bringing together the university's school of health and wellbeing staff and students on one site; the Adam Smith Business School and postgraduate teaching hub; and the James McCune Smith Learning Hub, which opened in April 2021. With a capacity of more than 2,500 students, it combines flexible study and social areas with technology-enabled teaching spaces. The Mazumdar-Shaw Advanced Research Centre houses some 600 academics and researchers working across five themes - creative economies and cultural transformation, digital chemistry, global sustainable development, quantum and nanotechnology, and technologies touching life. The university says this is the first time one of the elite Russell Group of research-intensive universities has co-located such a diverse mix of interdisciplinary research in one research facility.\n\nAbout one in three students received or qualified for a contextual offer for admission in September 2024, one of the higher proportions among Russell Group universities, which traditionally ask for the highest grades. The grade adjustments vary from course to course, but eligibility doesn't. Criteria include living in one of the 40% of postcodes considered to be the most deprived, having been in care or being a young carer, and being estranged from your family. The university also makes adjusted offers to students who complete one of the Glasgow's pre-entry programmes, such as a summer school or taster week, which are among the outreach initiatives the university runs across Scotland, with a particular focus on Glasgow and the west of the country. Once enrolled at the university, all students are well supported. The university offers those experiencing mental health difficulties one-to-one appointments with counsellors, cognitive behavioural therapists, psychologists and mental health advisers. And students themselves play a significant part in looking after one another. Student Listeners is a student-led service where students can talk and share problems with trained students, covering everything from anxiety, stress, isolation, and homesickness to academic and financial worries. Nightline is a confidential listening and information service, run by and for student at the city's three universities - Glasgow, Strathclyde and Glasgow Caledonian. A student-led workshop in partnership with Rape Crisis Scotland, called Let's Talk About Sexual Violence, is held for students to help keep them safe on campus. It includes segments on consent and bystander intervention.",
