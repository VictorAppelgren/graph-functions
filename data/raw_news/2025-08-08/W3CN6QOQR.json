  "description": "The man who oversees the nation\u2019s military has reposted a video on X, formerly Twitter, about a Christian nationalist church that included various pastors saying women should no longer be allowed to vote and should \u201csubmit\u201d to their husbands",
  "content": "The man who oversees the nation\u2019s military reposted a video about a Christian nationalist church that included various pastors saying women should no longer be allowed to vote and should \u201csubmit\u201d to their husbands.\n\nThe extraordinary repost on X from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, made Thursday night, illustrates his deep and personal connection to a Christian nationalist pastor with extreme views on the role of religion and women.\n\nIn the post, Hegseth commented on an almost seven-minute-long report by CNN examining Doug Wilson, co-founder of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, or CREC. The report featured various pastors of the denomination advocating the repeal of women\u2019s right to vote from the Constitution and parishioners saying that women should \u201csubmit\u201d to their husbands.\n\n\u201cAll of Christ for All of Life,\u201d Hegseth wrote in his post that accompanied the video.\n\nHegseth\u2019s post received more than 12,000 likes and 2,000 shares on X. Some users agreed with the pastors in the video, while others expressed alarm at the defense secretary promoting Christian nationalist ideas.\n\nPentagon chief spokesman Sean Parnell said Friday that Hegseth is \u201ca proud member of a church\u201d that is affiliated with CREC and he \u201cvery much appreciates many of Mr. Wilson\u2019s writings and teachings.\u201d\n\nIn May, Hegseth invited his personal pastor, Brooks Potteiger, to the Pentagon to lead the first of several Christian prayer services that Hegseth has held inside the government building during working hours. Defense Department employees and service members said they received invitations to the event in their government emails.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the nation be a Christian nation, and I\u2019d like to see the world be a Christian world,\u201d Wilson said in the CNN report.\n\nToropin writes for the Associated Press.

      "text": "Hegseth says the Pentagon has contingency plans to invade Greenland if necessary\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared to acknowledge that the Pentagon has developed plans to take over Greenland and Panama by force if necessary but refused to answer repeated questions at a hotly combative congressional hearing Thursday about his use of Signal chats to discuss military operations.\nDemocratic members of the House Armed Services Committee repeatedly got into heated exchanges with Hegseth, with some of the toughest lines of questioning coming from military veterans as many demanded \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers and he tried to avoid direct responses about his actions as Pentagon chief.\nIn one back-and-forth, Hegseth did provide an eyebrow-raising answer. Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) asked whether the Pentagon has developed plans to take Greenland or Panama by force if necessary.\n\u201cOur job at the Defense Department is to have plans for any contingency,\u201d Hegseth said several times.\nIt is not unusual for the Pentagon to draw up contingency plans for conflicts that have not arisen, but his handling of the questions prompted a Republican lawmaker to step in a few minutes later.\n\u201cIt is not your testimony today that there are plans at the Pentagon for taking by force or invading Greenland, correct?\u201d said Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio).\nAs Hegseth started to repeat his answer about contingency plans, Turner added emphatically, \u201cI sure as hell hope that is not your testimony.\u201d\n\u201cWe look forward to working with Greenland to ensure that it is secured from any potential threats,\u201d Hegseth responded.\nTime and again, lawmakers pressed Hegseth to answer questions he has avoided for months, including during the two previous days of hearings on Capitol Hill. And frustration boiled over.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an embarrassment to this country. You\u2019re unfit to lead,\u201d Rep. Salud Carbajal snapped, the California Democrat\u2019s voice rising. \u201cYou should just get the hell out.\u201d\nGOP lawmakers on several occasions apologized to Hegseth for the Democrats\u2019 sharp remarks, saying he should not be subject to such \u201cflagrant disrespect.\u201d Hegseth said he was \u201chappy to take the arrows\u201d to make tough calls and do what\u2019s best.\nQuestions emerge on Signal chats and if details Hegseth shared were classified\nHegseth\u2019s use of two Signal chats to discuss details of the U.S. plans to strike Houthi rebels in Yemen with other U.S. leaders as well as members of his family prompted dizzying exchanges with lawmakers.\nHegseth was pressed multiple times over whether or not he shared classified information and if he should face accountability if he did.\nHegseth argued that the classification markings of any information about those military operations could not be discussed with lawmakers.\nThat became a quick trap, as Hegseth has asserted that nothing he posted \u2014 on strike times and munitions dropped in March \u2014 was classified. His questioner, Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat and Marine veteran, jumped on the disparity.\n\u201cYou can very well disclose whether or not it was classified,\u201d Moulton said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s not classified is that it was an incredible, successful mission,\u201d Hegseth responded.\nA Pentagon watchdog report on his Signal use is expected soon.\nMoulton asked Hegseth whether he would hold himself accountable if the inspector general finds that he placed classified information on Signal, a commercially available app.\nHegseth would not directly say, only noting that he serves \u201cat the pleasure of the president.\u201d\nHe was asked if he would apologize to the mother of a pilot flying the strike mission for jeopardizing the operation and putting her son\u2019s life at risk. Hegseth said, \u201cI don\u2019t apologize for success.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s speech at Fort Bragg raises Democratic concerns about politics in the military\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who appeared along with Hegseth, was questioned about Trump\u2019s speech at Fort Bragg this week and whether the military was becoming politicized.\nThe Defense Department has a doctrine that prohibits troops from participating in political activity while in uniform. Members of the 82nd Airborne Division were directed to stand behind Trump at Fort Bragg, and they booed and cheered during his incendiary remarks, including condemnation of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\nThere also was a pop-up MAGA merchandise stand selling souvenirs to troops in uniform.\nCaine repeatedly said U.S. service members must be apolitical but that he was unaware of anything that happened at Fort Bragg.\nHegseth is pressed about policies on women in uniform and transgender troops\nHegseth got into a sharp debate about whether women and transgender service members should serve in the military or combat jobs.\nHe said he has worked to remove diversity programs and political correctness from the military. He said he has not politicized the military but simply wants the most capable troops.\nRep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) demanded to know if Hegseth believes that both men and women can pull a trigger, cause death, operate a drone or launch a missile.\n\u201cIt depends on the context,\u201d Hegseth said, adding that \u201cwomen carry equipment differently, a 155 round differently, a rucksack differently.\u201d\nHegseth, who has previously said women \u201cstraight up\u201d should not serve in combat, asserted that women have joined the military in record numbers under the Trump administration. He said the military \u201cstandards should be high and equal.\u201d\nHe also was asked about three female service members \u2014 now being forced out as part of the Pentagon\u2019s move to ban transgender troops.\nHegseth agreed that their accomplishments \u2014 which Houlahan read out \u2014 were to be celebrated, until he learned they were transgender.\nRepublican lawmakers jumped to his defense, criticizing any Pentagon spending on gender transition surgery.\nDemocrats ask about plans for action against Greenland and Panama\nPresident Trump has said multiple times that he wants to take control of the strategic, mineral-rich island nation of Greenland, long a U.S. ally. Those remarks have been met with flat rejections from Greenland\u2019s leaders.\n\u201cGreenland is not for sale,\u201d Jacob Isbosethsen, Greenland\u2019s representative to the U.S., said Thursday at a forum in Washington sponsored by the Arctic Institute.\nIn an effort not to show the Pentagon\u2019s hand on its routine effort to have plans for everything, Hegseth danced around the direct question from Smith, leading to the confusion.\n\u201cSpeaking on behalf of the American people, I don\u2019t think the American people voted for President Trump because they were hoping we would invade Greenland,\u201d Smith said.\nBaldor and Copp write for the Associated Press. AP writer David Klepper in Washington contributed to this report."

      "text": "Hegseth refuses to commit to following possible court order on Marine deployment\n- Share via\n- Seven members of the committee questioning Hegseth on Thursday are Democrats from California.\n- At a hearing Wednesday, Hegseth insisted the deployment of Marines in Los Angeles was lawful but couldn\u2019t name the law under which it is allowed.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth refused to say Thursday whether he would abide by a possible legal ruling about the federal government\u2019s authority to deploy the Marines to Los Angeles.\n\u201cWe should not have local judges determining foreign policy or national security policy for the country,\u201d he said in response to repeated questions by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Fremont) during a House Armed Services hearing.\nA federal judge in San Francisco was holding a hearing Thursday on California\u2019s challenge to President Trump\u2019s deployment of U.S. Marines and National Guardsmen in Los Angeles.\nHegseth decried what he billed as the expansion of judicial power, but after repeatedly being pressed on how he would respond if the Supreme Court weighed in, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not here to defy a Supreme Court ruling.\u201d\nDuring a testy back-and-forth with Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Santa Barbara), Hegseth did say that the Marines in Los Angeles are not authorized to fire warning shots.\nThe congressman said he feared the federal government had escalated the situation on the ground in Los Angeles and described it as political theater, and asked if the Marines were allowed to protect federal property \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d\nHegseth responded, \u201cICE officers and police officers being attacked is not political theater.\u201d\nAfter additional sparring, Carbajal called Hegseth incompetent and \u201can embarrassment to this country.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s been bipartisan members of Congress that have called for your resignation,\u201d Carbajal said. \u201cYou should just get the hell out and let somebody competently lead this department.\u201d\nCarbajal was one of several California Democrats questioned Hegseth on Thursday about the immigration raids that have roiled Los Angeles, the federal commandeering of the state\u2019s National Guard and the deployment of Marines in the region.\nThe congressional hearing lasted more than five hours and covered a multitude of national security issues, including the unprecedented delay in the Department of Defense submitting a budget, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, border security and apparent contingency plans to invade Greenland.\nFederal immigration sweeps have spread fear and uncertainty across the region and forced some into hiding.\nRepublicans on the committee defended the administration\u2019s actions, which began Friday.\nRep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.) pushed back at Democrats\u2019 description of the Trump administration\u2019s actions as unprecedented.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen similar actions throughout history, from Eisenhower sending the 101st to Little Rock to Johnson and Kennedy federalizing the guard over the objections of southern governors during the Civil Rights era to George H.W. Bush deploying federal troops during the 1992 L.A. riots,\u201d DesJarlais said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it fair to say that there\u2019s a well-established precedent for presidents acting when state leaders are either unwilling or unable to enforce federal law or protect federal facilities?\u201d\nThe National Guard was sent to Los Angeles in 1992 at the bipartisan request of state and local officials. But Hegseth agreed with DesJarlais\u2019 contention.\n\u201cSir, nothing that we\u2019re doing on the ground is unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cI would argue what is unprecedented is a governor and a mayor unwilling to protect law enforcement.\u201d\nRep. Derek Tran (D-Orange) questioned Hegseth about why he did not consult the mayor, local law enforcement leaders or the governor before unleashing federal forces.\n\u201cIt would be great if the governor attempted to actually coordinate instead of grandstand,\u201d Hegseth said.\nSeveral committee members said earlier that they received no advance notice about the federal immigration sweeps at workplaces and other locations that started Friday and that prompted large and at times fiery protests in downtown Los Angeles.\n\u201cWe need to de-escalate the situation,\u201d Tran said in an interview. President Trump and his administration\u2019s moves, most recently deploying hundreds of Marines in Southern California, \u201cescalates the situation, sending in troops that shouldn\u2019t be there, that are trained to shoot and kill.\u201d\nThough largely peaceful, protests about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s actions have been punctuated by incidents of violence and lawlessness.\nAfter dissenters blocked the 101 Freeway, vandalized buildings in downtown Los Angeles and stole from businesses, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass on Tuesday imposed a curfew in the city\u2019s civic core from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.\nContinued federal immigration enforcement actions have disrupted lives across greater Los Angeles, including a middle school graduation where teachers and families were left hunkering down in fear.\nThursday\u2019s testimony before the House Armed Services Committee was Hegseth\u2019s third appearance on Capitol Hill this week. He was questioned Tuesday by the House Appropriations subcommittee on defense and the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday.\nOn Wednesday, Hegseth insisted the deployment of Marines in Los Angeles was lawful but couldn\u2019t name the law under which it is allowed. On Tuesday, he was buffeted with questions about the \u201cchaos\u201d in his tenure, his discussion of national secrets on a Signal group chat and the lack of information provided to elected leaders about Defense Department operations and budgets, including the cost of the federal deployment in Los Angeles.\n\u201cI want your plan!\u201d Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) demanded. \u201cWhat is your plan for the future? Can we get that in writing and on paper so that we know where you\u2019re going? Because we don\u2019t have anything today. We have zip! Nada!\u201d\nHegseth responded that the agency has the details and would provide them to members of Congress. The Pentagon posted a video clip of the back-and-forth on X that tagged the congresswoman and was titled \u201cWHY ARE YOU SCREAMING!\u201d\nThursday\u2019s hearing was especially notable because the committee oversees the Pentagon budget. None of the Republican members of the committee are from California. More than a dozen who were asked to weigh in on the hearing didn\u2019t respond.\nRepublicans reflected the sentiments expressed by Trump, most recently on Wednesday when he took questions from reporters on the red carpet at the Kennedy Center shortly before attending a performance of \u201cLes Miserables\u201d with First Lady Melania Trump.\nLos Angeles and cities around the nation were bracing for \u2018No Kings\u2019 protests ahead of Trump\u2019s military parade as an appeals court ruling kept the National Guard under the president\u2019s control for now.\n\u201cWe are going to have law and order in our country,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t act quickly on that, Los Angeles would be burning to the ground right now.\u201d\n\u201cThese are radical left lunatics that you\u2019re dealing with, and they\u2019re tough, they\u2019re smart, they\u2019re probably paid, many of them, as you know, they\u2019re professionals,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you see them chopping up concrete because the bricks got captured, they\u2019re chopping up concrete and they\u2019re using that as a weapon. That\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d\nLaura J. Nelson contributed to this report."

      "text": "- Share via\nThis past week Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Trump spoke at a rally. Trump\u2019s speech seemed familiar: Disparage Los Angeles (\u201ctrash heap\u201d). Criticize Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass (\u201cincompetent, and they paid troublemakers, agitators and insurrectionists\u201d). Restate grievances about the 2020 election (\u201crigged and stolen\u201d). Chide the crowd to support the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d (\u201cYou better push your favorite congressmen\u201d).\nBut this speech was different from his others. The location was Ft. Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 and the audience was mostly soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division, the \u201cAll Americans.\u201d Internal unit communications revealed soldiers at the rally were screened based on political leanings and physical appearance. \u201cIf soldiers have political views that are in opposition to the current administration,\u201d the guidance advised, \u201cand they don\u2019t want to be in the audience then they need to speak with their leadership and get swapped out.\u201d\nSo what followed was to be expected. A sea of young soldiers in uniform \u2014 selected for their preference for the president \u2014 cheering and clapping for partisan commentary. This obviously violates Defense Department regulations. Heck, it\u2019s even spelled out in a handy Pentagon FAQ:\nQ. Can I ever wear my uniform when I attend political events?\nA. No; military members must refrain from participating in political activity while in military uniform in accordance with both DoDD 1344.10 and DoDI 1344.01. This prohibition applies to all Armed Forces members.\nBut what happened during Trump\u2019s appearance at the Army base is worse than breaking regs. The commander in chief forced an important unit to choose sides. He broke the All Americans in two. In essence, his statement to the troops there was: \u201cThose who like me and my politics, come to my rally. The rest of you \u2014 beat it.\u201d (Maybe we should start calling them the \u201cSome Americans.\u201d)\nImagine what it was like the day after. The soldiers who chose not to attend wondered how their next rating would go. Some lieutenant from California worried if his commander now has a problem with where he\u2019s from \u2014 and is checking whether he was at the rally. Maybe it\u2019s better if he wasn\u2019t, and he instead chose to abide by Defense regulations?\nNo matter which way you lean, that speech injected partisan acid into the 82nd Airborne. And it will drip down and corrode from the stars at the top to the lowest-ranking private.\nMilitaries require extraordinary cohesion to function in combat. For those of us who\u2019ve chosen this profession, one thing is burned into our brains from that very first day our hair\u2019s shorn off: We\u2019re all we\u2019ve got. There\u2019s nobody else. When you are hundreds and thousands of miles away from everyone else you\u2019ve ever known, and you\u2019re there for weeks and months and a year, you realize just how important the person next to you is, regardless of where they\u2019ve come from, who their parents are, or whether their community votes red or blue.\nFighting units are like five separate fingers that form a fist. Partisan acid burns and weakens our fist.\nThen there are the indirect effects. This speech damaged the military\u2019s standing with a large swath of America. The image of soldiers cheering the partisan applause lines of a commander in chief who just sent thousands of troops to Los Angeles over the state\u2019s objections? Not a good look.\nThese optics risk ruining the military\u2019s trust with roughly half of America. The military is the last remaining federal institution that a majority of Americans trust \u201ca great deal.\u201d But it\u2019s been slipping since the last Trump administration and may fall under 50%. Yet the military requires firm trust to fund and fill critical needs.\nThat\u2019s important because not everyone wants to serve in the military. Many would prefer not to think about the expected self-sacrifice, or the daily discomforts of military discipline. Moreover, not everyone is even able to serve in the military. Roughly three-quarters of young Americans can\u2019t qualify.\nWhat if someone who would have been the next Mike Mullen \u2014 Los Angeles native, Navy admiral and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs \u2014 gets turned off by this rally and opts against the Naval Academy?\nThen zoom out a little. What if much of California takes offense at this speech, not to mention at the soldiers and Marines so recently forced upon the local and state governments?\nCalifornia hosts more active-duty troops than any other state \u2014 by a wide margin. It\u2019s also the biggest donor state in the country, contributing $83 billion more to the federal government than it receives. The bases and other strategic locations up and down the Pacific Coast are beyond value. California is America\u2019s strong right arm.\nTo sever California\u2019s support for the military is simply unthinkable. It just can\u2019t happen. We\u2019ve got to fix this.\nThe first fix is simple. Hold troops to the accepted standards. Hegseth\u2019s most recent book argued that the Defense Department has \u201can integrity and accountability problem.\u201d Here\u2019s the secretary\u2019s chance to show America he stands for standards.\nBut we know mistakes happen, and this could become a powerful teachable moment: When the commander in chief orders troops to such an event, the only acceptable demeanor is the stone cold silence the generals and admirals of the Joint Chiefs display at the State of the Union, regardless of their politics and regardless of what the president is saying. Just a few years ago, two Marines in a similarly awful situation did just this right thing.\nA further fix calls for more individuals to act: The roughly 7,500 retired generals and admirals in America need to speak up. The military profession\u2019s nonpartisan ethic is at a breaking point. They know the old military saying: When you spot something substandard, and you fail to correct it, then you\u2019ve just set a new standard.\nThe reason many of these retired senior officers often don\u2019t speak out is their fear that defending neutrality risks having a political impact. Yet their continued silence carries a grave institutional effect \u2014 the slow-motion suicide of the profession that gave them their stars.\nThe president mentioned Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in his speech, and it\u2019s too bad his speechwriter didn\u2019t include a certain anecdote that would\u2019ve fit the occasion. When the Civil War was over and terms were being agreed upon at Appomattox Court House, Lee noticed Col. Ely Parker, a Tonawanda Seneca man serving on Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s staff. Lee quipped, \u201cI am glad to see one real American here.\u201d\nTo which Parker replied, \u201cWe are all Americans.\u201d Since that very moment, we\u2019ve been one country and one Army, All Americans, indivisible and inseparable from society.\nIf only we can keep it.\nML Cavanaugh is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cBest Scar Wins: How You Can Be More Than You Were Before.\u201d @MLCavanaugh\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

  "argos_summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faced backlash after reposting a video promoting extreme Christian nationalist views, including the idea that women should not vote and must submit to their husbands. His connection to the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches and his hosting of Christian prayer services at the Pentagon raised concerns about the intersection of religion and military leadership. Additionally, during a congressional hearing, Hegseth acknowledged the Pentagon's contingency plans for potential military actions in Greenland and Panama, which sparked heated exchanges with lawmakers regarding his handling of classified information and the politicization of the military.",
