      "feedback": "Your draft captures the headline inflation and oil‑oversupply facts but falls short on the depth, causal chain, and actionable signals required for a world‑class view. 1) **Causal chain & market transmission**: Explicitly link the 2.7 % CPI rise to Fed policy expectations (e.g., a 25‑bp hike in Q4 2025) and show how that would compress discretionary‑spend sectors (consumer‑discretionary, autos) and lift defensive names (utilities, consumer staples). 2) **Macro‑policy synthesis**: Combine the IEA’s 2.5 m bpd supply lift with the OPEC+ production‑increase plan (cite J99EM2TPZ) to forecast a 5–7 % decline in Brent by Q3 2025, and explain how that feeds into energy‑sector P/E compression. 3) **First‑principles grounding**: Use the Phillips curve to argue that persistent inflation + weak job growth (73 k jobs in July) may keep the Fed in a “tight‑but‑not‑too‑tight” stance, rather than a “tight‑and‑tight” stance implied by your draft. 4) **Scenario structure**: Build a 3‑scenario matrix: (a) Fed hikes 25 bp in Q4 2025, oil falls 5 %, inflation stalls; (b) Fed holds, oil falls 3 %, inflation rises 1 %; (c) Fed hikes 50 bp, oil falls 8 %, inflation stalls. 5) **Quantification & catalysts**: Replace vague “modest earnings expansion” with a 3–5 % YoY EPS growth forecast for the S&P 500, and a 10–15 % decline in energy‑sector EPS if Brent drops 5 %. 6) **Citation density**: Add IDs for the Fed policy expectations (e.g., FED2025), the OPEC+ production plan (OPEC2025), and the job growth data (JOB2025). 7) **Watch‑list**: Highlight July CPI, August Fed minutes, September oil supply data, and the next FOMC meeting as decisive signals. 8) **Fragility**: Note that the view is fragile to a Fed “rate‑cut” surprise or a sudden oil demand rebound (e.g., from China). 9) **Formatting**: Keep the paragraph under 200 words, use bullet points for scenarios, and ensure each claim is backed by a source ID. 10) **Avoid platitudes**: Replace “challenging backdrop” with specific valuation ranges (e.g., S&P 500 P/E 18–20 vs. historical 22–25). Implement these edits to elevate the analysis to a rigorous, actionable, and source‑rich market view.",
