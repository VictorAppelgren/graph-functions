Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nHumanoid robots danced hip-hop, performed martial arts and played keyboard, guitar and drums at the opening ceremony of the first World Humanoid Robot Games in Beijing on Thursday evening.\n\nThe competition begins Friday with more than 500 humanoid robots in 280 teams from 16 countries, including the U.S., Germany and Japan, competing in sports including soccer, running and boxing. The event comes as China has stepped up efforts to develop humanoid robots powered by artificial intelligence.\n\nDuring the opening ceremony, the robots demonstrated soccer and boxing among other sports, with some cheering and backflipping as if at a real sports event.\n\nOne robot soccer player scored a goal after a few tries, causing the robot goalkeeper to fall to the ground. Another player fell but stood up unassisted.\n\nThe robots also modeled fashionable hats and clothes alongside human models. In one mishap, a robot model fell and had to be carried off the stage by two human beings.\n\nTeams from robot companies and Chinese universities including Tsinghua University and Peking University are competing in the games. Three middle schools are also participating.\n\nChina's official newspaper People's Daily quoted a government officer in Beijing as saying that every robot that participates \"is creating history.\"\n\nThe event will last three days, concluding on Sunday. Tickets sold to the public range from 180 yuan ($25) to 580 ($80).\n\u2022 A robot rehearses the 100m race before the opening ceremony of The World Humanoid Robot Games held in Beijing, China, Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025.
