  "title": "Forbes Daily: Apple Secures Carveout In New U.S. Chip Tariffs",
  "description": "Today\u2019s Forbes Daily covers Trump\u2019s 100% tariff on AI chips, a new Apple commitment in the U.S., ESPN\u2019s big streaming moves, a promising cancer treatment and more.",
  "content": "Some of history\u2019s most impactful business founders\u2014Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, to name a few\u2014dropped out of college in pursuit of a greater goal.\n\nBut with concerns about artificial intelligence weighing heavily on today\u2019s college students, some are choosing to leave their studies behind in favor of working full-time. Forbes heard from students eager to work in AI safety who cited fears of AGI and the threat they believe it spells for humanity, and from others who worry there simply won\u2019t be jobs left once they graduate.\n\n\u201cIf your career is about to be automated by the end of the decade, then every year spent in college is one year subtracted from your short career,\u201d said Nikola Jurkovi\u0107, who graduated from Harvard in May.\n\nEntrepreneur Daniella Pierson has cozied up to everyone from Diane von Furstenberg to Selena Gomez, burnishing her image\u2014as founder and CEO of lifestyle newsletter The Newsette and cofounder of mental health startup Wondermind\u2014as her businesses have unraveled. \u201cI don\u2019t know that she actually cares about building a successful business as much as she cares about being able to say she\u2019s a badass CEO,\u201d a former employee told Forbes. \u201cIt\u2019s all smoke and mirrors.\u201d\n\nJake Becraft founded Strand Therapeutics with an idea that he believed could change the way doctors treat cancer, by lighting up tumor cells. Eight years later, the company is close to making that dream a reality. Strand\u2019s preliminary phase 1 clinical trial showed that its first programmable mRNA drug\u2014which instructs tumors to produce signals that make them visible to the body\u2019s immune system\u2014is not only safe, but can shrink tumors in cancer patients who had otherwise run out of treatment options. With $250 million in funding and a $550 million valuation, Strand is aiming to hit the market by 2030.\n\nThis is a published version of the Forbes Daily newsletter, you can sign-up to get Forbes Daily in your inbox here.\n\nApple promised another $100 billion investment to expand manufacturing in the U.S., adding to a $500 billion commitment announced earlier this year by CEO Tim Cook. The announcement includes a new \u201cAmerican Manufacturing Program\u201d that would bring more of Apple\u2019s supply chain into the U.S., with plans to manufacture critical components domestically. Apple shares rose 5% Wednesday following the news.\n\nMORE: Trump also announced on Wednesday a 100% tariff on chips and semiconductors exported to the U.S., while noting companies like Apple would receive exemptions for producing goods domestically.\n\nFollowing through on his threat to raise tariffs against India, President Donald Trump doubled the levy on imports from the country, from 25% to 50%. The additional tariff, which the president said was \u201cbecause they\u2019re buying Russian oil,\u201d will go into effect within 21 days. In a statement, India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs called the reciprocal tariffs \u201cunfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\u201d\n\nAmazon-owned robotaxi company Zoox got the green light from regulators to operate its purpose-built electric vehicles without steering wheels, pedals or mirrors\u2014a first-ever exemption from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on such features. The waiver clears the way for Zoox, founded 11 years ago, to launch its robotaxi service later this year in Las Vegas, with San Francisco, Austin, Miami, Los Angeles and Atlanta to follow.\n\nESPN\u2019s new standalone streaming service\u2014which carries a price tag of $29.99 per month\u2014will launch August 21, the Walt Disney Company said Wednesday, just hours after the broadcaster announced a deal to purchase the NFL Network from the football league. As part of the deal, the NFL will acquire a 10% equity stake in ESPN. The broadcaster also announced a new partnership with WWE, which will make the network the exclusive home to premium events such as WrestleMania.\n\nMORE: Fox One, a new streaming service featuring the entirety of Fox\u2019s video portfolio, will also launch August 21 at a price of $19.99 per month, CEO Lachlan Murdoch announced. Like ESPN, the big draw will be sports\u2014specifically Fox\u2019s NFL and Big 10 football games.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court on Tuesday, asking the court to declare that state Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, forfeited his office when he fled the state in an effort to block Republicans\u2019 redistricting efforts. Texas law gives the state Supreme Court power to issue a \u201cwrit of quo warranto\u201d against state officials, which is a legal determination over whether the official has the right to hold office. It\u2019s unclear how the court will rule it this case, though it is made up entirely of Republican justices.\n\nThe Eighth-Generation Heir Driving Big Changes At Philippines\u2019 Oldest Conglomerate Ayala\n\nJust over a decade ago, Mariana Beatriz Zobel de Ayala was a 24-year-old equity analyst working on Wall Street when she got a call from her father, Jaime Augusto. The chairman of the Philippines\u2019 oldest conglomerate, Ayala Corp., nudged his eldest daughter to come home.\n\n\u201cHe hinted at opportunities in the Philippines,\u201d Mariana recalls. There was never any pressure, she adds, with the option of her returning to New York left on the table. But her sense of duty won out and she quit her job at JPMorgan: \u201cIt was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nAfter spending 12 years learning the ropes in various roles across the 191-year-old banking-to-property group, Mariana, 36, was appointed this March as a managing director at Ayala Corp. She\u2019s tasked with sprucing up its vast leasing portfolio of aging malls, office buildings and hotels. At the same time as her elevation, her brother Jaime Alfonso, 34, and cousin Jaime Urquijo, 37, were named executive directors at the group. With these promotions, Ayala Corp. said, the next-generation of leaders is in place to drive its future growth.\n\nAyala Corp. traces its roots to a distillery built in 1834 by Antonio de Ayala, and the family was a key player in developing Makati City, a financial hub in the broader Manilla metropolitan area. Mariana\u2019s grandfather Jaime Zobel de Ayala, 91, under whom the family\u2019s $3.4 billion fortune is listed at No. 7 on Philippines\u2019 50 Richest for 2025, took the helm in 1983.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re firing on all cylinders in the next few years,\u201d Mariana tells Forbes Asia. As one of the stewards of a storied legacy and with her dad\u2019s office just a few doors away from hers, the Harvard-and-Insead grad isn\u2019t taking things lightly. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how the prior generations charted new paths,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s something we hope we can continue to do.\u201d\n\nWHY IT MATTERS Mariana says her father\u2019s big theme for the group is to build more consumer-focused businesses, and that resonates with her. While she appreciates her father\u2019s counsel, she says she\u2019s learned the most by observing how he makes decisions: \u201cHe stays true to his values even when he encounters rough winds.\u201d\n\nNew research from the Federal Reserve outlines how five countries used gains on their official gold holdings to raise government funds. It does not propose the U.S. do the same, and critics cite inflation as a major concern, but the Fed noted that a recent bill proposes the use of revaluation proceeds to create a sovereign wealth fund or a strategic bitcoin reserve:\n\n$11 billion: The value of U.S. gold reserves, 261.5 million ounces, based on a price per ounce that was set in 1973\n\nMore than $750 billion: The value at today\u2019s market price\n\n\u2018I can say today we\u2019re not revaluing the gold,\u2019 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on the All-In podcast in March\n\nWith ultra-polished websites and slick promotional materials, researching top colleges these days can feel like searching for substance in a luxury ad campaign. Prospective students and their families should go straight into individual department pages, especially for their ideal majors. Skip any official \u201cStudent Life\u201d pages in favor of checking out the student newspaper.\n\nA new movie streaming on Amazon Prime Video starring rapper-actor Ice Cube has been universally panned, earning a shocking 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes. The film is a modern adaptation of which classic science fiction novel?\n\nThanks for reading! This edition of Forbes Daily was edited by Chris Dobstaff and Caroline Howard.",

      "text": "Topline\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday announced another $100 billion investment by Apple to expand manufacturing in the U.S., adding to a $500 billion commitment announced earlier this year by Tim Cook featuring plans for a new factory in the country and tens of thousands of new jobs.\nKey Facts\nTrump\u2019s announced a new \u201cAmerican Manufacturing Program\u201d that will bring more of Apple\u2019s supply chain into the U.S., with plans to manufacture critical components domestically.\nThe president also said the U.S. will place \u201capproximately 100%\u201d tariff rates on chips and semiconductors, adding if companies are building in the U.S., \u201cthere will be no charge\u201d on the tech supplies.\nCook announced plans in February for Apple\u2019s $500 billion investment that included a doubling of its \u201cAdvanced Manufacturing Fund\u201d to $10 billion, building a factory in Houston and a training facility in Michigan while adding 20,000 new jobs.\nCook said under the new manufacturing plans, all iPhones and Apple Watches sold across the world will contain coverglass made in Kentucky.\nShares of Apple closed up 5% to $213.25 after the company\u2019s latest U.S. investment was first reported by Bloomberg.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America\u2019s economic and national security,\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Forbes in a statement.\nTangent\nTrump on Wednesday said he would double the U.S. tariff rate on India to 50% because the country continues to purchase Russian oil. In a call last week with analysts, Cook said a \u201cvast majority\u201d of iPhones sold in the U.S. come from India, noting Apple would \u201cobviously try to optimize our supply chain\u201d and \u201cultimately, we will do more in the United States.\u201d In May, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he \u201clong ago\u201d told Cook he expected Apple\u2019s iPhones to be manufactured in the U.S., \u201cnot India, or anyplace else.\u201d Trump warned Apple would pay a 25% tariff unless the company shifted its production domestically.\nKey Background\nTrump has pressured companies to increase production in the U.S. in the wake of his wide-reaching tariffs in recent months. He announced a $100 billion investment in AI data centers from Oracle, SoftBank and OpenAI earlier this year, with plans to up the total to at least $500 billion, as they boost American innovation in AI. Both Oracle and OpenAI later revealed expanded plans to upgrade data center capabilities. Trump also targeted Walmart after the retailer warned its prices would increase to absorb the cost of his tariffs. Trump said the company should \u201cEAT THE TARIFFS\u201d and \u201cnot charge valued customers ANYTHING.\u201d"

      "text": "By Monica Hunter-Hart and Jemima McEvoy\nDaniella Pierson has cozied up to everyone from Diane von Furstenberg to Selena Gomez, burnishing her image as her businesses unraveled. A case study in how hubris is bad for business.\nDaniella Pierson turned 30 on Monday\u2014a milestone acknowledged by a bevy of successful friends, from Spanx founder Sara Blakely to the singer Jewel to designer Diane von Furstenberg. It\u2019s an especially auspicious birthday for an entrepreneur who spent her 20s building a lifestyle newsletter called The Newsette, which she launched as a student at Boston University in 2015; garnering a feature in USA Today in 2019; debuting on our Forbes \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list in 2020; appearing on the the cover of Entrepreneur magazine in 2021 (with Selena Gomez) for a second company, mental health startup Wondermind; ranking number 16 on Inc. 5000\u2019s list of fastest growing private companies in 2022. And giving talks and speeches throughout, at schools from Stanford to BU and media gatherings from the Forbes Power Women\u2019s Summit to Newsweek\u2019s Women\u2019s Global Impact Forum just this week.\nHer high profile owes itself to brains and hustle\u2014and, it turns out, a consistent history of large exaggerations and extreme self-promotion, those latter two traits reinforcing the other. Over the course of the last three months, Forbes spoke to more than a dozen people who\u2019ve worked closely with her and reviewed documents, press releases and videos of all four of her recent business ventures. What emerges is someone who fails to understand the difference between entrepreneurial zeal and extreme hyperbole\u2014and now faces a potential reckoning.\nFor all the celebrity plaudits and press love, Pierson\u2019s businesses seem to be unraveling. Business partnerships have collapsed, the staff at her original startup has shrunk to roughly one-quarter its peak size, and revenue has tumbled from $40 million in 2021 (if you believe Pierson) to less than $4 million in recent years, according to four former employees. (Pierson declined to comment on any revenue figures after 2021.) Kicked out of a second startup she cofounded, Pierson is now starting her third venture in four years, that one also seemingly riddled with problems.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that she actually cares about building a successful business as much as she cares about being able to say she\u2019s a badass CEO,\u201d says one former employee who, like others in this article, spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. \u201cIt\u2019s all smoke and mirrors.\u201d\nThe daughter of a Colombian immigrant oral surgeon mother and a car dealership owner father from Niagara Falls, Pierson grew up in Jacksonville, Florida. She speaks often of her early struggles with ADHD, depression and particularly OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).\nShe says she got mediocre grades in school and was called the \u201cdumb twin\u201d compared to her sister, Alex, who received straight As. (Her sister, who writes under the name Alex Aster, is now a bestselling author of young adult fiction, including the romantic fantasy series Lightlark.)\nPierson started Newsette using tactics that would become something of a playbook: scrappy\u2014and disingenuous. In those early days, she sent messages from fake emails to make it seem like the company had more employees than just her. She also posed as an intern, messaging friends of friends to subscribe and telling them if they successfully referred 10 others, they could call themselves \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d on their resum\u00e9s. \u201cI made it look like it was bigger than it was,\u201d she said in a talk at the Stanford Graduate School of Business last year. \u201cI literally just faked it \u2019til I made it.\u201d\nA notable milestone came when Pierson, then about 24, met Diane von Furstenberg, the legendary fashion designer known for her iconic wrap dress. Married to billionaire Barry Diller, von Furstenberg introduced her to a host of other celebrities, as well as connections at Amazon. Newsette then ran a campaign for Amazon highlighting female founders on the e-commerce giant\u2019s homepage on International Women\u2019s Day in 2020. Soon after, Pierson started Newland, a creative marketing agency within Newsette, structured to connect influencers with Amazon and other brands.\nThings looked promising. In 2021, the company generated $34 million in sales, according to a document shared by a spokesperson\u2014$6 million less than what Pierson has frequently said, but still its best year ever. Newsette\u2019s spokesperson clarified that the company \u201cbooked\u201d $40 million in sales in 2021, but that Amazon, then its biggest customer, paid the remaining sum in the first quarter of 2022.\nAt this point, Pierson reached out to Forbes to nominate herself for its Richest Self-Made Women list. In looking into her company in 2022, Forbes confirmed that RXBar founder Peter Rahal had come on as an outside investor. Rahal, who sold 50% of his former company for $300 million five years earlier, has since put money into some 100 businesses. His 1.25% investment valued Newsette at $200 million.\nMore than the cash, Rahal\u2019s bet on Pierson gave her clout. Based on that deal\u2019s numbers, Forbes valued Pierson\u2019s own 84% stake in the company at just under $170 million. At the time, she also owned more than a third of Wondermind, a mental wellness startup she cofounded with Selena Gomez and Gomez\u2019s mom, Mandy Teefey. Wondermind was then worth $100 million after attracting $5 million in a funding round led by tennis star Serena Williams\u2019 venture capital firm. Pierson also eagerly showed Forbes millions in other assets, enough for us to declare her in August 2022 \u201cone of the wealthiest women of color in the U.S.,\u201d worth $220 million and, then age 27, \u201cyounger than just about any self-made female entrepreneur with a nine figure fortune.\u201d\nThat Forbes story marked a turning point for Pierson, according to former employees who say she repeatedly used the net worth figure to sell others on her success\u2014even when her businesses turned south.\nAnd it turns out the net worth figure she loves to cite was even less grounded in reality. Yes, Rahal invested at a $200 million valuation, which is traditionally a blue chip way to appraise a private company. But he now tells Forbes that he didn\u2019t even look at the financials when he made the investment. In other words, the company touting its $200 million valuation had no real chance of any other serious investor touching it at that price.\nThe Newland business\u2014which had become Newsette\u2019s main source of revenue\u2014soon started to falter. Partnerships with Amazon and Mattel, its only significant clients, fell apart. Amazon stopped being a client in late 2022, per former employees. (Amazon declined to comment and Mattel did not reply to a request for comment.) In January 2023, Pierson took to Instagram to drum up business, claiming that demand was high: \u201cNewsette Media Group keeps the agency under wraps because of our waitlist, but hit us up at GoNewland.com and let\u2019s see if we can make magic together.\u201d She began laying off staff and shut down the Newland segment entirely at the end of 2023, according to several people who were employed at the company then, though never publicly announced it. One person with knowledge of the situation says Pierson continues to pitch agency capabilities as though Newland is still active, and Pierson has continued, even this year, to include it on her email signature.\nThings haven\u2019t been that much better at the original newsletter business. Former employees say Pierson has described it being in difficult financial straits over the years, claiming at times to have partly funded it out of her own pocket.\nTwo sources say she also wildly exaggerates to clients the value of her company\u2014using the $200 million figure even after revenue nosedived\u2014and the amount that other brands spend on Newsette, claiming that customers like Nike and Ulta Beauty are \u201cspending tens of millions on us per year.\u201d Four former employees tell Forbes that is not true: no individual brand deal for the newsletter ever hit $1 million, and deals were usually in the tens of thousands or low hundreds of thousands of dollars. (Branded content is Newsette\u2019s main source of revenue.) Nike and Ulta did not reply to requests for comment.\nAnother of her embellishments: subscriber numbers. Around the time Rahal came on board in 2022, Pierson cited subscribers in excess of 500,000. But according to two internal documents, subscribers totaled just over 400,000 at that time. \u201cThey got us all on the phone and said, \u2018Stop talking about the number of subscribers we have,\u201d says a former employee. \u201cThey never said why. But it was because, I think, we didn\u2019t actually have that many.\u201d She adds that her team was also asked to start describing the number of subscribers in ranges, rather than specific numbers.\nThe overstating hasn\u2019t stopped. Newsette had about 500,000 subscribers last year, per internal documents, but new business pitches claimed to have over 1.3 million subscribers across the company\u2019s three newsletter products. It didn\u2019t specify that most readers of the newer weekend shopping and wellness bulletins also receive the main Newsette offering, meaning that those 1.3 million were not unique subscribers.\nToday, Newsette\u2019s business is likely worth \u201cno more than $12.2 million,\u201d according to media valuation expert Kevin Kamen, who reviewed the most recent financial figures and subscribers Forbes obtained, as well as its social media following. Emphasis on \u201cno more than.\u201d\nWondermind, which Pierson spent most of 2022 running as co-CEO with Gomez\u2019 mother Mandy Teefey, is in even worse shape. Pierson was ultimately pushed out in January 2023, after the two women clashed, according to four former staffers. \u201cShe would not characterize it as \u2018pushed out,\u2019\u201d says a spokesperson for Pierson. \u201cLeaving Wondermind was a very difficult decision, but she was proud of what they had built in the time there.\u201d Regardless, problems at Wondermind snowballed. Two thirds of its 15 employees were laid off in May.\nWhen it comes to leadership, Pierson promotes herself as a motivational uplifter of women. \u201cI have made it my life\u2019s mission to ensure that NOBODY gets knocked down by false labels or barriers to success. I\u2019m here for you\u2014with a hand that will always help you back up,\u201d she posted on Instagram on her 30th birthday.\nBut that is not how many former employees describe her. The 11 people who worked with Pierson at Newsette or Wondermind interviewed for this article describe her as prone to fits of anger. They say she berated employees, often claiming their work was \u201cembarrassing\u201d and that she could do all of their jobs better.\n\u201cThere was definitely this culture of Danny having two personalities,\u201d says a former employee. \u201cOne was online, and with us she was different.\u201d Ex-staff say she repeatedly interfered with their ability to do their jobs, covertly reading their emails, rescheduling meetings over a dozen times, hiring industry experts and ignoring their suggestions. She\u2019d jeopardize relationships with clients, dominating sales calls with details from her personal story and turning down future campaigns they offered because the money wasn\u2019t immediate.\n\u201cShe denied people on our team their annual bonuses, people that had worked really hard,\u201d says another ex-staffer. \u201cAnd then like five minutes later she was on Instagram posting all these stories of her new Chanel roller blades and of the new marble kitchen she\u2019s installing in her Soho apartment.\u201d\nAdds one former employee, \u201cI have never before in my life worked with someone who knew so little, but thought that she knew everything.\u201d\nPierson\u2019s rise, powered in part by promoting her one-time net worth estimate from Forbes, almost led her into an unexpected deal\u2026 Forbes itself.\nIn 2023, Austin Russell\u2014who three years earlier became the world\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire at age 25 when Luminar Technologies, the company he founded as a teenager to enable self-driving cars to navigate, went public via a SPAC\u2014assumed the lead role in a high-profile bid to buy Forbes Media. Two previous deals for Forbes had fallen through in the late hours because the controlling bidders were foreign entities. As a major U.S. media outlet, Forbes potentially falls into a category of strategic assets whose sale to non-Americans requires approval by the Treasury Department.\nRussell, a California-born Stanford dropout, had no such issues. But while Russell was enthusiastic about the purchase, multiple sources close to the deal say, and he would maintain an 82% controlling interest, he also had a full-time job as the CEO of a publicly-traded company and no experience in the media business. So in stepped Pierson, a fellow Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree and new acquaintance. \u201cIt all happened so fast,\u201d says someone outside Forbes familiar with the deal.\nThe purchase already had a star-studded lineup supporting it, including the founders of Brex, ScaleAI and Plaid, as well as superstar names like Kevin Hart, Tony Robbins and Jimmy \u201cMr. Beast\u201d Donaldson. The idea was that Pierson would invest a relatively token amount, then serve as an active board member.\nIt didn\u2019t go so well. In calls with large institutional investors, according to two people\u2014neither affiliated with Forbes\u2014who attended multiple fundraising meetings, Pierson proved polarizing. While some were impressed, \u201csome people definitely did not like her,\u201d says one. Adds the other: \u201cPeople were like \u2018We can\u2019t invest in this.\u2019 It was that kind of reaction, they couldn\u2019t understand how someone like this could be involved.\u201d\nPierson also immediately took charge of the bidders\u2019 public relations. In September, the group took the unusual step of issuing a press release announcing that the deal was \u201csubstantially oversubscribed\u201d and naming the board of the new company that would own Forbes\u2014even though the deal hadn\u2019t closed yet. Pierson, according to multiple sources involved, engineered the announcement, which described her as \u201crecognized by Forbes as one of the youngest and wealthiest self-made women of color in the U.S.\u201d\nExtremely unusual for a press release, a group image of the new principals sat atop the announcements\u2014individual shots stitched together like a business version of The Avengers. The world-famous Mr. Beast and Robbins on one side, the formidable Hart and Russell (and his 82% controlling stake) on the other. At the dead center, standing slightly above the others, her hand on her hip: Daniella Pierson.\nTwo months later, the closing deadline passed and the deal fell through. Pierson has since told people in private that \u201c\u2018Forbes wanted me to be the CEO,\u2019\u201d according to two people with knowledge of her conversations.\nDespite the deal\u2019s collapse, Pierson still describes herself on her speaker\u2019s agent web page as a board member of Forbes\u2014which is wholly incorrect. A spokesperson for Pierson says the claim comes from when Pierson was en route to join the board as part of that possible 2023 purchase and that the page is \u201cout of date.\u201d Yet the page also lists her venture Chasm, which launched less than three months ago.\nNo matter the problems behind the scenes, publicly Pierson has never cracked. She continues to present herself as an underdog who\u2019s overcome great odds and earned a place in the world of glamorous female business elites. She has a knack for leveraging her ever-expanding network into financial opportunities.\nFor instance, her almost-fellow-board member Kevin Hart introduced Pierson to Kristin Lemkau, CEO of J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. Over lunch in January 2024, Pierson wooed Lemkau with her latest concept: Be a Breadwinner, a company that would empower women to become their own breadwinners by promoting financial planning. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018We have the same idea,\u2019\u201d Pierson recalled in a Forbes interview she did with Lemkau last March, \u201cAnd it literally came from that conversation, and I\u2019ve never seen any company move this quickly. It\u2019s truly a partnership.\u201d\nPierson told other outlets at the time that Breadwinner would eventually include a newsletter, podcast series, book and a venture capital fund. Lemkau told Forbes that the Chase mobile app\u2019s free wealth-planning tool would integrate some of Breadwinner\u2019s content.\nJ.P. Morgan sponsored a \u201cbread carpet\u201d event on March 20, 2024 at its Manhattan headquarters. Pierson declared it the official launch of the company on social media and in the press. Speakers included Diane von Furstenberg and poet Rupi Kaur. Von Furstenberg, who remains a close mentor to Pierson, tells Forbes that she didn\u2019t realize the event also served as a company launch. \u201cI personally only thought it was a conference,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, she asked me to speak at J.P. Morgan, so I said yes.\u201d\nThere were similar struggles with the media launch of Breadwinner. Pierson pitched an \u201cexclusive\u201d to Forbes, which was killed, given her recent ties to a potential Forbes purchase and increasingly desperate, hyperbolic tendencies. Pierson\u2019s response defaulted to what an exaggerator might do when cornered: She threatened.\n\u201cSince there is absolutely zero conflict of interest, blocking the story seems like a repression of freedom of speech or some sort of discrimination,\u201d she wrote to a Forbes reporter in March of last year, before escalating to the company\u2019s chief content officer and CEO: \u201cI just explained clearly that your \u2018reason\u2019 is actually not valid\u2026 As a woman of color who was amplified by your platform, I sincerely thought unethical, discriminatory, or personal feelings were not part of your editorial process\u2026Let me know if you have an answer to this or if I need to loop in my family office team.\u201d\nSince then, Be a Breadwinner appears to have gone nowhere. Pierson has stopped mentioning it, and the website still says that \u201cBreadwinner\u2019s content is coming soon.\u201d\n\u201cWe were never in a partnership with her,\u201d says Veronica Navarro, head of communications at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. \u201cWe promoted the event, and that was the end of the collaboration with her,\u201d adding that Breadwinner content did appear in the Chase app for an unspecified amount of time.\nPierson recently transitioned the Be a Breadwinner Instagram page (which has 13 followers) to link to Chasm, a new venture she launched in May to address gender disparities in venture capital funding. A spokesperson for Pierson says the idea for Breadwinner has now turned into Chasm: \u201cShe\u2019s always been passionate about supporting female entrepreneurs.\u201d\nPitched as an invite-only club of \u201cthe most successful men and women in the world\u201d who contribute $25,000 annually, Chasm promises to award monthly grants and offer resources to female founders. It claims in marketing materials to have already partnered with 50 high-profile investors and entrepreneurs, including Spanx founder and billionaire Sara Blakely, Drybar founder Ali Webb, Tony Robbins and Instacart CEO Fidji Simo. Yet none of these advertised \u201cmembers\u201d attended the kick-off on May 20\u2014an expensive affair at luxury watchmaker Audemars Piguet\u2019s swank AP House in Manhattan where espresso martinis featured the name \u201cChasm\u201d inscribed in foam.\nNor do those \u201cmembers\u201d appear to have shared anything about the company on social media or spoken about it publicly. Forbes reached out to every known name: Webb confirmed her participation, a Simo spokesperson denied that she is a member and others did not reply to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Pierson insists Simo is a member and \u201cclose friend\u201d and says Pierson is paying her membership fee to ensure involvement.\nAs Forbes was finishing this article, Pierson took to Instagram to post a preemptive response.\n\u201cIn the last 24 hours, people who represent everything that my gender equality initiatives have fought to change, have launched a smear campaign against me and my companies. The result has been an eagerness to spread false statements and fabricated information intended to discredit me and eliminate my ability to continue to put millions of my own dollars into helping women.\u201d\n\u201cI will not allow anyone to get away with defiling the character of me and my companies with uninformed speculation and outright lies.\u201d\nOne person in a position of informed speculation doesn\u2019t seem impressed. Peter Rahal still owns the 1.25% of Newsette that he vastly overpaid for, the investment that provided Pierson her inflated net worth figure, but the state of their relationship is murky. When Forbes asked him for comment, he replied, \u201cDanielle is a great entrepreneur\u201d\u2014misspelling her name. And when Pierson was making announcements about Chasm on LinkedIn this May, he publicly responded with a comment.\nIt was a clown emoji."

      "text": "Topline\nPresident Donald Trump raised tariffs on Indian imports from 25% to 50% Wednesday in what he said was retaliation against India for buying Russian oil.\nKey Facts\nThe additional tariff will go into effect within 21 days, on top of the 25% tariff that will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, along with new tariffs on more than 60 countries, when the deadline Trump set for U.S. trading partners to negotiate new tariffs expires.\nTrump suggested in recent days he would raise tariffs against India ahead of the Thursday deadline, telling CNBC on Tuesday, \u201cIndia has not been a good trading partner,\u201d while threatening he would \u201craise [the new tariffs] very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they\u2019re buying Russian oil, they\u2019re fueling the war machine.\u201d\nThe move comes as Trump has sought to pressure Russia to reach a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine as he seeks to broker an end to the war between the two countries.\nIndia\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs called the reciprocal tariffs \u201cunfair, unjustified and unreasonable\u201d in a statement, adding it\u2019s \u201cextremely unfortunate that the U.S. should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest,\u201d an apparent reference to other countries, such as China, that also purchase Russian oil.\nBig Number\n$52.7 billion. That\u2019s the value of Russian oil India imported last year, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Robin Brooks and Ben Harris published by the Harvard Kennedy School last month. India is the second largest importer of Russian oil, behind China.\nWhat To Watch For\nTrump suggested in Wednesday\u2019s executive order that other countries that buy Russian oil could face similar penalties. The order directed administration officials to \u201cdetermine whether any other country is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil\u201d and if they should face penalties for the deals.\nTangent\nTrump\u2019s doubling of the tariffs against India comes as Apple\u2014which manufactures a significant portion of iPhones in India\u2014is expected to announce a new $100 billion investment in the U.S. Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff against Apple unless it moves to more domestic production, though the company is largely exempt for now from the new tariffs against India under the exemption Trump announced in April for all smartphones, computers and other electronics.\nKey Background\nMost of the new tariffs set to take effect Thursday on 67 U.S. trading partners were announced by Trump in April on \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d when Trump imposed a slate of what the White House called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs. Trump initially delayed the tariffs until July 9 then again until Aug. 1 and for a third time until Aug. 7 to give U.S. trading partners time to negotiate new rates with the U.S., though only a handful of countries reached new deals.\nFurther Reading\nThese Are The Trump Tariffs Launching Friday: Far Short Of The 90 Promised Deals (Forbes)\nTrump Announces New Global Tariff Rates\u2014As He Pushes Back Start Date Again (Forbes)\nApple Invests Another $100 Billion Into The U.S., White House Says\u2014As Shares Jump 3% (Forbes)"

      "text": "AGI \u2014 a theoretical AI that can do many of the same tasks as humans can \u2014 could come within a decade. College students, including from elite universities, are abandoning school now to work full-time on preventing it from turning on humanity.\nWhen Alice Blair enrolled in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a freshman in 2023, she was excited to take computer science courses and meet other people who cared about making sure artificial intelligence is developed in a way that\u2019s good for humanity.\nNow she\u2019s taking a permanent leave of absence, terrified that the emergence of \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d a hypothetical AI that can perform a variety of tasks as well as people, could doom the human race.\n\u201cI was concerned I might not be alive to graduate because of AGI,\u201d said Blair, who is from Berkeley, California. \u201cI think in a large majority of the scenarios, because of the way we are working towards AGI, we get human extinction.\u201d She\u2019s lined up a contract gig as a technical writer at the Center for AI Safety, a nonprofit focused on AI safety research, where she helps with newsletters and research papers. Blair doesn\u2019t plan to head back to MIT. \u201cI predict that my future lies out in the real world,\u201d she said.\nBlair\u2019s not the only student afraid of the potentially devastating impact that AI will have on the future of humanity if it becomes sentient and decides that people are more trouble than they\u2019re worth. \u201cExtinction-level\u201d risk is possible given how fast AI is being developed, according to a 2024 U.S. Department of State-commissioned report. Efforts to build AI with safeguards to prevent this from happening have exploded in the last few years, both from billionaire-funded nonprofits like the Center for AI Safety and companies like Anthropic.\nA lot of researchers disagree with that premise\u2014\u201chuman extinction seems to be very very unlikely,\u201d New York University professor emeritus Gary Marcus, who studies the intersection of psychology and AI, told Forbes. \u201cBut working on AI safety is noble, and very little current work has provided answers.\u201d\nNow, the field of AI safety and its promise to prevent the worst effects of AI is motivating young people to drop out of school.\n\u201cIf your career is about to be automated by the end of the decade, then every year spent in college is one year subtracted from your short career.\u201d\nPhysics and computer science major Adam Kaufman left Harvard University last fall to work full-time at Redwood Research, a nonprofit examining deceptive AI systems that could act against human interests.\n\u201cI\u2019m quite worried about the risks and think that the most important thing to work on is mitigating them,\u201d said Kaufman. \u201cSomewhat more selfishly, I just think it\u2019s really interesting. I work with the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met on super important problems.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not alone. His brother, roommate and girlfriend have also taken leave from Harvard for similar reasons. The three of them currently work for OpenAI.\nOther students are terrified of AGI, but less because it could destroy the human race and more because it could wreck their career before it\u2019s even begun. Half of 326 Harvard students surveyed by the school\u2019s undergraduate association and AI safety club were worried about AI\u2019s impact on their job prospects.\n\u201cIf your career is about to be automated by the end of the decade, then every year spent in college is one year subtracted from your short career,\u201d said Nikola Jurkovi\u0107, who graduated from Harvard this May and served as the AI safety group\u2019s AGI preparedness lead. \u201cI personally think AGI is maybe four years away and full automation of the economy is maybe five or six years away.\u201d\nAlready, some companies are hiring fewer interns and recent graduates because AI is capable of doing their tasks. Others are conducting mass layoffs. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and cause unemployment to rise to 20% in the next few years.\nStudents are terrified that this shift will dramatically accelerate when true AGI arrives, though when that might happen is up for debate. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks AGI will be developed before 2029, while Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts that it\u2019ll come in the next five to 10 years. Jurkovi\u0107 believes it might arrive even sooner: He co-authored a timeline forecast for the AI Futures Project, which aligns with the prediction that most white-collar jobs could be automated by 2030.\nOthers disagree: \u201cIt is extremely unlikely that AGI will come in the next five years,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cIt\u2019s just marketing hype to pretend otherwise when so many core problems (like hallucinations and reasoning errors) remain unsolved.\u201d Marcus has noted that throwing more and more data and computing power at AI models has so far failed to produce models sophisticated enough to do many of the same kinds of tasks as humans.\nWhile questions remain about when AGI will occur and how valuable a college degree will be in a world upended by human-level artificial intelligence, students are itching to pursue their careers now, before, they worry, it\u2019s too late.\nThat\u2019s led many to drop out to start their own companies. Since 2023, students have been leaving college to chase the AI gold rush, drawn to the success stories of generations past like Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell, now 24, and Mercor CEO Brendan Foody, 22, dropped out of MIT and Georgetown University respectively to pursue their startups. Anysphere was last valued at $9.9 billion, while Mercor has raised over $100 million. With AGI threatening to completely replace human labor, some students see a ticking clock\u2014and a huge opportunity.\n\u201cI felt that there\u2019s a limited window to act in order to have a hand on the steering wheel,\u201d said Jared Mantell, who was studying economics and computer science at Washington University in St. Louis before dropping out to focus full-time on his startup dashCrystal, which aims to automate design of electronics. The company has raised over $800,000 so far at a valuation of around $20 million.\nDropping out means losing out on the benefits of a college degree. According to the Pew Research Center, younger adults with a bachelor\u2019s degree or more generally make at least $20,000 more than their peers without one. And in a world where entry-level jobs are being decimated by AI, lacking a degree could limit job prospects for young people even more.\nEven the cofounder of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator known for funding young founders who have dropped out, thinks students should stay in school. \u201cDon\u2019t drop out of college to start or work for a startup,\u201d Paul Graham posted on X in July. \u201cThere will be other (and probably better) startup opportunities, but you can\u2019t get your college years back.\u201d\nBlair doesn\u2019t think that dropping out of school is for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult and taxing to drop out of college early and get a job,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something that I would only recommend to extremely resilient individuals who felt they have been adequately prepared to get a job by college already.\u201d"

      "text": "Topline\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott wants to oust from office the Democratic leader who fled the state to block Republican's attempt at redistricting \u2014 though it\u2019s unclear if the latest move in the escalating battle over redistricting will actually work.\nKey Facts\nAbbott filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court Tuesday that asks the court to declare that state Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, has forfeited his office by leaving the state.\nWu and more than 50 of his Democratic colleagues left Texas on Sunday in order to block GOP lawmakers from changing the state\u2019s congressional map to more heavily favor Republicans; their absence left the legislature short of the quorum that\u2019s necessary in order to hold votes.\nAbbott argued the Supreme Court should expel Wu because the Democrat abdicated his position by leaving the state and refusing to show up for work, writing, \u201cThis Court should make clear that a legislator who does not wish to perform his duties will be stripped of them.\u201d\nTexas law gives the state Supreme Court power to issue what\u2019s called a \u201cwrit of quo warranto\u201d\u2014Latin for \u201cby what warrant\u201d\u2014against state officials, which is a legal determination over whether the official has the right to hold office.\nPaxton also said he will take legal action against Democratic lawmakers if they don\u2019t return to Texas by Friday, invoking a separate state law that gives attorneys general and district attorneys the power to file \u201cquo warranto\u201d petitions in court if a \u201cpublic officer does an act or allows an act that by law causes a forfeiture of his office.\u201d\nWu has remained defiant\u2014saying in a statement that leaving the state \u201cwas not an abandonment of my office; it was a fulfillment of my oath\u201d\u2014and it\u2019s unclear if Abbott and Paxton\u2019s legal gambit will work, whether for Wu or as a broader effort to expel Democratic lawmakers.\nWhat To Watch For\nAbbott has asked the state Supreme Court to rule on whether Wu has forfeited his office by Thursday at 5 p.m. local time, though Paxton asked justices to hold off on making their decision until Friday, which is Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows\u2019 deadline for Democratic lawmakers to return to the state. Paxton has said he \u201cintends to pursue all available judicial remedies\u201d if Democrats don\u2019t return by Friday, including through the \u201cquo warranto\u201d petition process. It remains to be seen if the attorney general will also take aim at Wu specifically, or if he could file more legal challenges against all of the absent Democrats.\nChief Critic\n\u201cI took an oath to the Constitution, not to a politician\u2019s agenda, and I will not be the one to break that oath,\u201d Wu said in a statement Tuesday responding to Abbott\u2019s lawsuit and allegations that the lawmaker has abdicated his duty as a legislator. \u201cWhen a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant \u2026 Unable to defend his corrupt agenda on its merits, Greg Abbott now desperately seeks to silence my dissent by removing a duly-elected official from office.\u201d\nHow Would The Process To Remove Texas Lawmakers Work?\nIt will ultimately be up to the courts to determine whether or not lawmakers can be removed. The legal statute that Abbott invoked in his lawsuit doesn\u2019t specify a legal process for the Supreme Court issuing a writ of quo warranto, and it remains to be seen if justices will draw out the process by asking for a hearing or additional court briefs to be filed. The separate statute giving Paxton and local district attorneys authority to ask courts to remove lawmakers says that if there\u2019s \u201cprobable ground\u201d to challenge a person\u2019s office, local judges will ultimately decide the outcome of those requests. That suggests that any effort to remove lawmakers could take a while to play out, particularly if challenges are filed against multiple lawmakers in different courts. That would leave it up to each individual judge to determine when any rulings could come out, Politico notes, and Paxton told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson that bringing \u201cquo warranto\u201d challenges won\u2019t result in an \u201cimmediate answer\u201d over whether lawmakers can be removed. \u201cWe\u2019d have to go through the court process, and we\u2019d have to file \u2026 in districts that are not friendly to Republicans,\u201d Paxton told Johnson, noting \u201cevery, every district would be different.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d have to go sue in every legislator\u2019s home district to try to execute on that idea,\u201d the attorney general said.\nWill The Texas Supreme Court Rule Lawmakers Should Be Expelled?\nIt\u2019s still unclear how the Texas Supreme Court could rule on Abbott\u2019s request to expel Wu. In a 2021 legal opinion, Paxton said lawmakers breaking a quorum could constitute an \u201cabandonment of office\u201d that justifies removing them, but that opinion is non-binding, and Paxton said the issue must ultimately be decided by the courts. The state\u2019s Supreme Court is made up exclusively of Republicans, including multiple justices that Abbott appointed himself. Chief Justice Jimmy Blacklock is also Abbott\u2019s former general counsel, and the governor said when he appointed the justice in 2018 that he \u201cwanted to make sure that the person I appointed was going to make decisions that I know how they are going to decide.\u201d That being said, Blackrock authored a 2021 opinion that said the Texas Constitution \u201cdoes enable quorum breaking by a minority faction,\u201d suggesting Democrats\u2019 actions are lawful\u2014though he also said the Constitution allows lawmakers to impose penalties in order to compel members\u2019 attendance. Legal experts cited by the Texas Tribune argued it\u2019s unlikely that taking action to break a quorum would be considered abdicating a lawmaker\u2019s duty, as Abbott claims. \u201cI am aware of absolutely no authority that says breaking quorum is the same as the intent to abandon a seat,\u201d University of Missouri constitutional law expert Charles \u201cRocky\u201d Rhodes told the Tribune, arguing that would be \u201cinconsistent with the very text of the Texas Constitution.\u201d\nHow Long Will Texas Democrats Stay Out Of State?\nDemocrats left the state in order to halt a special session of the legislature that\u2019s slated to end in late August. They would have to stay out of state for even longer in order to actually block the redistricting process, however, as Abbott could simply call a new special session whenever they return. Lawmakers would have to stay out of Texas until at least November to successfully stop the new maps, Rice University political science professor Mark P. Jones told the Texas Tribune. That\u2019s when filing opens for the 2026 midterms, meaning new congressional districts would have to be set by that point. It\u2019s unclear if Democrats will successfully be able to stay out of state for that long, given lawmakers\u2019 commitments at home and a $500 fine that accrues per lawmaker for each day they remain out of state.\nKey Background\nTexas Democrats\u2019 decision to leave the state in order to block redistricting comes as the issue of changing states\u2019 congressional maps outside the normal 10-year timeframe has become a national issue ahead of the 2026 midterms. Democrats are historically favored to fare better in the midterms as the minority party, prompting Republicans in states like Texas to try and manipulate congressional districts to their advantage and add GOP-leaning seats. In addition to Texas, Republican officials in states such as Missouri, Florida and Indiana have at least floated the idea of redistricting\u2014prompting Democrats in states like California, New York and Maryland to also consider redrawing their maps in order to balance out any advantage Republicans give themselves. Texas has become the first flashpoint in the redistricting debate, with Democrats leaving the state Sunday afternoon\u2014repeating a playbook that Texas Democrats have used before to stymie the legislature, most recently in 2021. Abbott\u2019s lawsuit Tuesday came after the governor previously threatened over the weekend to take legal action against the lawmakers. The Texas House has separately issued arrest warrants for the missing lawmakers. Those warrants are ineffective while the lawmakers remain out of state, however, as Democratic lawmakers in the states where the legislators have relocated\u2014primarily Illinois\u2014have refused to extradite them to Texas to be prosecuted.\nFurther Reading"

      "text": "Topline\nIce Cube\u2019s new movie \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d is the No. 1 film on Amazon Prime Video\u2014but it is going viral for the wrong reasons and facing brutal mockery by social media users and critics, who have called it \u201ctragic\u201d and \u201ccheap-looking,\u201d slapping it with a rare 0% score on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.\nKey Facts\nRapper-actor Ice Cube stars in a new adaptation of the 1898 H.G. Wells novel, \u201cWar of the Worlds,\u201d on Amazon Prime Video, in which he plays a Department of Homeland Security computer security agent who contends with an alien invasion.\nThe movie is a modern remake of the century-old novel, and it is told completely through the perspective of computer screens as characters interact with one another through video calls.\n\u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d is the No. 1 movie on the streaming platform as of Wednesday\u2014but the movie has been universally panned by critics and audiences, earning a 0% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes and a dismal 17% audience score.\nThe movie was directed by first-time feature film director Rich Lee, who has previously made music videos for artists including Lana Del Rey, Billie Eilish and Eminem, with the cast of \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d being rounded out by actors Eva Longoria, Clark Gregg, Andrea Savage and Henry Hunter Hall.\nWhat Are Critics Saying About \u201cwar Of The Worlds?\u201d\nVariety critic Peter Debruge slammed the movie as a \u201ccheap-looking thriller\u201d and criticized Ice Cube\u2019s performance, stating he has \u201ctwo expressions: a resting scowl and nuclear overreaction,\u201d neither of which make him convincing as a government security agent. The Daily Telegraph critic Ed Power said the movie is \u201cone of the most tragic things Prime has put on screen,\u201d stating it \u201cleeches all the fun out of what should be an epic tale of alien invasion.\u201d \u201cNobody put any effort into this. None,\u201d said Korey Coleman, a Rotten Tomatoes-approved film critic who runs the Double Toasted podcast, criticizing the graphics and the way the film was designed to be told entirely through computer screens. Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic Austin Burke said \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d is \u201cin the discussion for worst movie of the decade so far,\u201d criticizing the CGI and stating the movie is unintentionally funny. Some critics said the movie had an excessive amount of product placement for Amazon. Power said in one scene, a character tells another: \u201cI need you to place an official order on Amazon to activate the drone,\u201d and an Amazon delivery driver saves the day.\nHow Are Social Media Users Reacting To \u201cwar Of The Worlds?\u201d\nThe film has gone viral on social media, largely because users have poked fun at it. Popular YouTube creator penguinz0, who has 17 million subscribers, criticized \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d in a video titled, \u201cThis is Actually the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,\u201d garnering 3.5 million views. He said the film is an \u201cinsult to the entire medium of making movies\u201d and is \u201cone big ad for Amazon.\u201d One user on X called the movie \u201chilariously awful\u201d and attached a clip of the scene, panned by many reviewers, in which an Amazon delivery driver sends Ice Cube\u2019s character a thumbdrive he needs. Other clips have gone viral on social media making fun of Ice Cube\u2019s expressions throughout the movie.\nKey Background\n\u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d started production in 2020, Deadline reported, though it is unclear why the film was not released until five years later. The movie was produced by Timur Bekmambetov, who has helmed other movies that take place entirely on computer screens, like \u201cSearching\u201d and \u201cUnfriended,\u201d though those movies were better reviewed by critics. Bekmambetov told Deadline the movie was told through screens to put a modern twist on the original novel, so audiences can \u201cask themselves: If aliens invaded today, how would we experience it? Most likely, we\u2019d be watching it on our phones.\u201d\nTangent\nWells\u2019 novel has been adapted for film before to much greater success. In 2005, Steven Spielberg directed a \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d film starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, which earned a 76% score on Rotten Tomatoes and three Academy Award nominations. Spielberg\u2019s version grossed $604 million at the global box office, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of that year. A 1953 film adaptation titled \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects and earned nominations for editing and sound recording."

      "text": "As a grad student in biological engineering at MIT, Jake Becraft had an idea that could change the way we treat cancer: What if genes could be turned on and off like light switches? Thinking it through a bit further, he envisioned \u201ccircuits\u201d in which messenger RNA (mRNA), which carries the instructions for making proteins to cells, could be programmed to cause cancerous tumors to reveal themselves to the body\u2019s immune system.\nIt was an idea at the cutting-edge of science, and when Becraft cofounded Cambridge, Mass.-based Strand Therapeutics to pursue it there was no guarantee of success. Now, eight years later, Strand seems on the cusp of it. Strand\u2019s preliminary phase 1 clinical trial showed that its first programmable mRNA drug is not only safe, but can shrink tumors in cancer patients who had otherwise run out of treatment options.\n\u201cIt shocked even us,\u201d Becraft told Forbes. \u201cYou hope something happens, but you don\u2019t expect to see a huge response because these patients have already proven to have cancers so resistant to treatment.\u201d\nWith those results, Strand Therapeutics raised $153 million in new venture funding led by Swedish investment giant Kinnevik to build out its programmable mRNA therapeutics pipeline. Other investors include VC firms Iconiq and Playground Global; Regeneron Ventures, the venture arm of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; and drugmakers Amgen and Eli Lilly.\nThe investment brings Strand\u2019s total funding to $250 million and its valuation to an estimated $550 million. That number pales in comparison to the stratospheric valuations of today\u2019s AI startups, but it\u2019s a significant one for a clinical-stage biotech that was worth $359 million at its last round, in November 2024, according to venture-capital database PitchBook. The funding comes at a time when biotech firms have been struggling to raise money and the public markets are filled with zombie biotechs that are trading below their cash on hand. Strand, which hopes to get its first therapy on the market by 2030, does not yet have revenue.\nMost people know mRNA as the backbone of the vaccines from Moderna and BioNTech during the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite their success, those vaccines have become a political football, with Health & Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announcing on Tuesday that he was pulling $500 million of federal funding from mRNA vaccine projects. But mRNA could potentially be used to treat a variety of diseases, from cancer to heart disease. Unlike Covid-19 vaccines, which send instructions to a cell\u2019s nucleus to create antigens for a virus, Strand\u2019s mRNA therapeutics instruct tumors to produce signals that make them visible to the body\u2019s immune system\u2014essentially lighting them up\u2013so that it can fight back.\n\u201cThe clinical results blew us away,\u201d said Ala Alenazi, an investment manager at Kinnevik, who will join Strand\u2019s board of directors with the deal. \u201cThey have been able to prove out these ambitions that had stayed in textbooks.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s become very clear in the past year or year-and-a-half is that the age of messenger RNA and genetic medicines is finally here.\u201d\nBecraft, who is now 34, calls himself \u201ca reluctant biotech executive.\u201d In 2017, he and Tasuku Kitada, the company\u2019s president and head of research and development\u2014the first scientist to create synthetic mRNA gene circuits while working as a researcher at MIT\u2014spun Strand out of MIT. Becraft\u2019s Ph.D. advisor, Ron Weiss, a professor of biological engineering whose work focuses on engineering cells and building circuits, was also a cofounder and remains an advisor to the company. In 2019, Strand scored seed funding with Playground leading the round. Its valuation then was just $15.5 million, according to venture-capital database PitchBook. \u201cThey were young Ph.D.s with amazing ideas when we first met with them,\u201d said Jory Bell, a general partner at Playground Global.\nBecraft has long believed that the biggest barrier to new and personalized medicines is delivery. Today, many therapies are administered by \u201cbrute forcing the proteins into the right cells,\u201d requiring lengthy hospital stays for patients and high costs for insurers, he said. \u201cWhat we want to do is deliver proteins that have a therapeutic outcome into a cancer cell or immune cell or into the bone marrow,\u201d he said. That targeting allows the treatment to be potent where it\u2019s needed without being toxic where it isn\u2019t.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s become very clear in the past year or year-and-a-half is that the age of messenger RNA and genetic medicines is finally here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see that as the path to how we will build medicines in the future.\u201d\nConsider the first protein that Strand is working with, an immune system stimulant called interleukin 12, or IL-12. It\u2019s promising as a cancer immunotherapy, but so far its toxicity has outweighed any anti-cancer benefits. Without targeting, \u201cit is ineffective or toxic,\u201d Becraft said. \u201cYou want effective and non-toxic.\u201d\nThe results of Strand\u2019s study of 22 cancer patients showed it was possible to use targeting to create a potent therapy that wasn\u2019t toxic, he said. \u201cFrom the very first patients we dosed, we started to see the tumors shrinking,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey have been able to prove out these ambitions that had stayed in textbooks.\u201d\nReferring to a contrast dye scan of a patient with stage 4 melanoma, Becraft noted tumors, indicated with black dots, across the body. A second scan of the same patient after treatment with Strand\u2019s mRNA drug revealed a stunning improvement. \u201cThe only dot left was where the contrast agent was injected in their arm,\u201d Becraft said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone expects that. This was very shocking.\u201d\nBut even with results like this, it\u2019s a long road from early clinical trials to commercialization. Strand now plans to use its new influx of funds to conduct additional clinical research with the hopes of getting its first drug approved by 2030. The company also has a few other pre-clinical mRNA therapies in its pipeline, including one that gets infused through a patient\u2019s bloodstream rather than injected into a tumor. That would allow it to potentially be used for additional types of cancer that are harder to reach, such as lung cancer.\n\u201cWe can rewire the way we treat cancer,\u201d Becraft said. \u201cWe think we are just on the precipice of what this technology can do.\u201d\nMORE FROM FORBES"

      "text": "Gold is up more than 40% in the past year, from under $2,400 an ounce to over $3,400. Meanwhile, the national debt is approaching $37 trillion.\nThat\u2019s helped revive an idea long dismissed as fringe: revaluing the government\u2019s gold reserves to raise cash. It sounds far-fetched. But a new research note from the Federal Reserve suggests it may not be as out there as it seems.\nOn August 1, the Federal Reserve published a research note called \u201cOfficial Reserve Revaluations: The International Experience.\u201d It outlines how five countries used gains on their official gold holdings to raise funds. It does not propose the U.S. do the same, but it explains the steps involved and what to expect if it happens.\nThe note covers Germany, Italy, Lebanon, Curacao and Saint Martin, and South Africa. Some used revaluation proceeds to reduce debt. Others used them to cover central bank losses. The examples are limited but show how governments have tapped into hidden value without raising taxes or issuing new bonds.\nThe U.S. Treasury values its gold at $42.22 an ounce, a price set in 1973. It holds 261.5 million ounces, the majority of it at Fort Knox in Kentucky. At the official price, the gold is worth $11 billion. At today\u2019s market price, it would be worth more than $750 billion. Revaluation would not require selling the gold. It would simply update its book value.\nThe Treasury could adjust the value of U.S. gold reserves through a few bookkeeping steps. It might retire its current $11 billion gold certificate (issued by the Treasury) and establish a higher official price for gold (which could be lower or even higher than the market price). Next, it could \"transfer\" the gold to the Fed at this new price, potentially gaining billions or trillions (remember, it need not revalue the gold to the current market price). The Fed would then return the gold to the Treasury for a new certificate. No gold physically moves, but the Treasury ends up with a significant amount of newly created funds.\nWhat would happen next depends on policy decisions.\nThe cash infusion from the revalued gold could be used to pay down debt or finance new spending. A footnote in the Fed paper notes that recent U.S. legislation proposed by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis (a Republican and crypto champion) contemplates using revaluation proceeds to create a sovereign wealth fund or a strategic bitcoin reserve. (Both the sovereign wealth fund and the bitcoin reserve are ideas that President Donald Trump has talked about.)\nSounds good, but there are potential repercussions.\nCrediting the Treasury with new funds increases the money supply. That could stoke inflation. Critics have described the idea as backdoor money printing or, even, as plain old \u201caccounting manipulation.\u201d Others point to the 1934 gold revaluation, which led to a sharp increase in the money supply. It also sidelined the Federal Reserve, giving the Treasury effective control over monetary policy until the 1951 Fed-Treasury Accord restored the central bank\u2019s independence.\nThat history may be one reason the idea hasn\u2019t moved forward. With renewed criticism of the Federal Reserve from the Trump administration, including chiding the central bank over its decision to delay interest rate cuts, any move seen as potentially undermining Fed independence could draw political fire\u2013and a negative reaction in the markets.\nThat may help explain why officials have been quick to shut the door.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed the issue earlier this year. On the All-In podcast in March, he said the Treasury is not considering revaluation. \u201cI can say today we\u2019re not revaluing the gold,\u201d he declared. (The All-In podcast, hosted by investors Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks and David Friedberg, is popular in business and investing circles\u2013and among those who have Trump\u2019s ear. Sacks, in fact, holds the title of chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.)\nBessent\u2019s March disavowal of any thought of revaluation may still be the case. But the Federal Reserve publishing a note on how a revaluation has worked for others means the Overton window\u2013that is, the realm of ideas that get seriously discussed\u2013might have cracked open."

      "text": "Ayala Corp. managing director Mariana Beatriz Zobel de Ayala takes up challenge to recharge 191-year-old group\u2019s future growth.\nThis story is part of Forbes\u2019 coverage of Philippines\u2019 Richest 2025. See the full list here.\nMariana Beatriz Zobel de Ayala was a 24-year-old equity analyst working on Wall Street over a decade ago, when she got a call from her father, Jaime Augusto. The chairman of the Philippines\u2019 oldest conglomerate, Ayala Corp., nudged his eldest daughter to come home. \u201cHe hinted at opportunities in the Philippines,\u201d Mariana recalls. There was never any pressure, she hastens to add, with the option of returning to New York left on the table. Her sense of duty won out and she quit her job at JPMorgan: \u201cIt was the right thing to do.\u201d\nAfter spending 12 years learning the ropes in various roles across the 191-year-old banking-to-property group, Mariana, 36, was appointed this March as a managing director at Ayala Corp. She\u2019s tasked with sprucing up its vast leasing portfolio of aging malls, office buildings and hotels\u2014a number of which sprung up after Ayala Corp. spun off its expanding real estate division in 1988 and listed Ayala Land three years later.\nAt the same time as her elevation, her brother Jaime Alfonso, 34, and cousin Jaime Urquijo, 37, were named executive directors at the group. With these promotions, Ayala Corp. said, the next-generation of leaders was in place to drive its future growth.\n\u201cWe\u2019re firing on all cylinders in the next few years,\u201d Mariana tells Forbes Asia from her top-floor office at the 39-story Ayala Triangle Gardens Tower 2, in Makati City, home to Ayala Corp. and other Philippine corporate giants, such as noodle maker Monde Nissin and telecoms firm PLDT. The booming financial hub was the family\u2019s first real estate development, carved out from vast tracts of agricultural land acquired when the Philippines was still a colony of Spain.\nAs one of the stewards of a storied legacy and with her dad\u2019s office just a few doors away from hers, the Harvard-and-Insead grad isn\u2019t taking things lightly. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how the prior generations charted new paths,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s something we hope we can continue to do.\u201d\nWhile her brother is charged with the group\u2019s EV infrastructure and car distribution businesses as CEO of AC Mobility, and cousin Jaime Urquijo targets ESG deliverables as Ayala Corp.\u2019s chief sustainability and risk officer, Mariana has her work cut out for her at Ayala Land, the nation\u2019s second-largest property developer by market cap ($6.5 billion).\nMariana is working with its president and CEO Anna Ma. Margarita B. Dy as the group undertakes one of its biggest capital investments to date: $2.5 billion to be spent on expanding Ayala Land\u2019s footprint across the country over the next five years. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about our family shareholders, we have public shareholders too,\u201d Mariana says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge responsibility.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re firing on all cylinders in the next few years.\u201d\nThe masterplan includes a $1.5 billion makeover of its retail properties: On the to-do list is refurbishing eight of its 34 malls and building new ones to add 700,000 square meters of gross leasable area (GLA) by 2028 to the current 2.2 million square meters. Several Ayala-owned hotels and resorts, operating under homegrown brands Seda Hotels and El Nido Resorts, are also slated for redevelopment alongside plans to seek new global brand partners. And this year will see the launch of Ayala Land\u2019s first two \u201ctechnohubs,\u201d purpose-built buildings for science and tech companies.\nFirm Foundation\nAyala Land\u2019s portfolio of shopping malls, office buildings and hotels makes up about a third of revenue.\n\u201cOur malls, offices and hotels provide a steady stream of recurring income that complements the dynamic nature of our property development business,\u201d Dy says by email. \u201cUnder [Mariana\u2019s] leadership, we\u2019re not just renovating spaces, we\u2019re reimagining them...shaping environments that reflect the evolving needs of a new generation of users.\u201d\nAyala Land isn\u2019t a laggard by any stretch. It posted record revenue in 2024 of 181 billion pesos, up by a fifth from a year earlier. But future-proofing is a key priority, says Benjamin Garcia, head of research at AP Securities in Manila\u2014in particular, reducing its reliance on cyclical residential sales, currently the biggest contributor to the company\u2019s top line. Then there are its deep-pocketed rivals to contend with.\nSM Prime, the country\u2019s biggest mall developer with 88 malls and 10 million square meters of GLA, owned by the Sy siblings (No. 1 on the list of Philippines\u2019 50 Richest), is spending 10 billion pesos to add seven new hotels to its hospitality portfolio. Robinson Land, controlled by Lance Gokongwei and his family (No. 14), in June hived off nine of its 56 shopping malls into a commercial REIT to bankroll expansion plans. Meanwhile property-to-spirits billionaire Andrew Tan\u2019s (No. 15) real estate arm Megaworld is building new resorts outside of Metro Manila and recently partnered with French hotel chain Accor.\nSince joining Ayala Land in 2015, after two years with the parent company\u2019s strategy and business development team, Mariana has learned first-hand the perils of underestimating competitors. She cut her teeth as a project manager at The 30th Corporate Center, a 19-story mixed-use building east of Manila, becoming general manager of the mall when it opened two years later. While its office tower is almost fully leased, the shopping mall is about 80% occupied\u2014well below the company\u2019s targeted occupancy benchmark of 95%.\nIn hindsight, Mariana says she and her team made the mistake of assuming that with the Ayala brand, \u201cif we build a mall, people will come.\u201d They also too easily dismissed its proximity to the Sys\u2019 SM Megamall, which sits about a kilometer away. \u201cThat early grounding gave her a deep understanding of the business from the ground up,\u201d says Dy.\nThe budget of 18 billion pesos for upgrading its four flagship malls, three in Metro Manila and one in Cebu, starting this year, will be strategically spent. \u201cI want to ensure that our malls don\u2019t just serve the community around them, but there\u2019s a reason for people to visit,\u201d Mariana explains. \u201cEach mall should have a story.\u201d\nAt the fore is Greenbelt 1 in Makati, the group\u2019s oldest shopping center of 1980s vintage, that was demolished last year. In its place will rise a new mixed-use complex designed by American architectural firm Gensler, which, she says, is known for combining a global outlook with a local sensibility. (Its projects include converting a freight terminal in New York\u2019s Hudson Square into a workplace for Google.) With such elements as a rainwater collection system for its three-hectare garden, \u201cit will be one of our most premium developments,\u201d says Mariana.\nGrowth Pillars\nAyala Corp.\u2019s crown jewels, Bank of the Philippine Islands and Ayala Land, continued to be the biggest contributors to core net profit last year.\nShe\u2019s lining up a slew of luxury brands for its 2028 reopening. Ayala Land already counts Balenciaga, Herm\u00e8s and Louis Vuitton among its high-end tenants. \u201cThis goes to show the strength of the demand from the premium side, which has always been their key market,\u201d says Raffy Mendoza, a Manila-based analyst at Maybank Securities. The company has lately been churning its retail mix, adding such brands as Singaporean fashion chain Love, Bonito, New York-headquartered perfume maker Le Labo and Australian home and lifestyle brand Anko.\nDespite the encroachment of online shopping, Mariana remains a firm believer of brick-and-motar retail. \u201cBecause the Philippines doesn\u2019t have a lot of public parks, malls serve as a gathering place for friends and families,\u201d she explains. While malls accounted for 23 billion pesos, or 13% of Ayala Land\u2019s revenue in 2024, residential projects made up the lion\u2019s share of its sales, though growth in that segment slowed in the first quarter of 2025. In a recent research note, Jelline Gaza, an analyst at JPMorgan in Manila, attributes the sluggish offtake to an oversupply of condos in Metro Manila.\nEmpty offices are also on the rise in the capital city, and with global tensions keeping interest rates high and borrowing costs elevated (the company\u2019s debt rose 9% to 282 billion pesos last year), Ayala Land shares took a knock, dropping nearly 20% in the past 12 months. Office vacancy rates in Metro Manila stood at 18% in the first half of 2025 as tenants vacated about 470,000 square meters of office space, according to Leechiu Property Consultants.\nDespite the supply glut, Ayala Land will deploy 28.6 billion pesos to grow its office portfolio. Mariana counters that demand in prime locations remains strong and convenience is key. The company says it has achieved an average vacancy rate of 9% across its office buildings, including at One Ayala, a mixed-use retail and office property with direct links to commuter rail and a bus interchange.\nMariana\u2019s also involved in the renovation of Ayala Triangle Gardens Tower 1\u2014built in 1996\u2014which will offer amenities such as daycare centers and gyms to keep tenants sticky. Across the business hub\u2019s main street\u2014Ayala Avenue\u2014the company is constructing the new headquarters for Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), another of Ayala Corp.\u2019s crown jewels. The 45-story office tower of the country\u2019s second-most valuable bank is set to redefine Makati\u2019s skyline when completed in 2029. With the upcoming technology hubs in Laguna, south of Manila, and in the central Philippine province of Iloilo, the company\u2019s gross leasable office space will increase 26% to about 1.8 million square meters by then.\nOn another front, Ayala Land is going all out to grow its hospitality portfolio, betting on a travel boom. The company will spend $500 million on renovations and new builds to almost double its current room count to 8,000 by 2030. In May, it bought 578-room New World Makati for an undisclosed amount from Hong Kong-based New World Development, the debt-laden company controlled by Henry Cheng and his family.\n\u201cTourism is largely untapped in the country,\u201d Mariana says. \u201cWith minimal incremental investments, we could reap major benefits.\u201d While tourist arrivals increased nearly 9% to 5.4 million in 2024, that number is way below the 8.3 million peak set in 2019 just before the Covid-19 pandemic, government data show.\nRevenue from the hospitality business increased 10% to 2.6 billion pesos in the first quarter after rising 11% to 9.7 billion pesos in the whole of 2024, according to Ayala Land. \u201cOur hotels are doing very well,\u201d Mariana says, adding that in March, hotel room rates at their luxe El Nido Resorts in Palawan jumped almost 80% on average from a year earlier, thanks to high demand for their island villas that can cost upward of $1,000 a night. And in addition to expanding its Seda business hotel group, which manages almost 3,300 rooms across 12 properties, on the anvil are two new homegrown brands to offer tourists Filipino-style hospitality, says Mariana.\n\"Tourism is largely untapped in the country. With minimal investments, we could reap major benefits.\"\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly talking to international hotel companies for potential partnerships,\u201d she adds. Ayala Land is set to open the 276-room Mandarin Oriental at its Makati complex next year, and its latest project is a 260-room hotel under Marriott\u2019s Moxy brand, to open in late 2026 at an Ayala mixed-use estate on the edge of Makati. It also owns three hotels managed by Fairmont, Holiday Inn and Raffles. \u201cProperty developers really have to diversify their revenue streams away from residential, and hotels seem like the best choice,\u201d AP Securities\u2019 Garcia says.\nOver the past three decades, Mariana\u2019s father Jaime Augusto and uncle Fernando Zobel de Ayala have steered Ayala Corp., branching from its mainstay businesses of banking and property into telecoms and utilities and lately into education and healthcare. But BPI and Ayala Land remain the group\u2019s biggest cash generators, accounting for about 95% of 2024 core net profit of 45 billion pesos.\nLast year, Ayala Corp. rebranded its automotive subsidiary AC Motors as AC Mobility, the largest distributor (by dealership) for Japanese automakers Honda and Isuzu Motors in the Philippines, which under Jaime Alfonso, is stepping up the distribution of China\u2019s BYD electric vehicles in the country. It\u2019s also installed 226 EV charging stations nationwide and plans to expand the network to over 700 by year end. Meantime, under Jaime Urquijo\u2019s watch, Ayala Corp. cut its greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter in 2023 compared with 2021 levels, and is on track to realize the group\u2019s net zero target by 2050.\nMariana says her father\u2019s big theme for the group is to build more consumer-focused businesses and that resonates with her. \u201cI love thinking about what\u2019s going to excite Filipino consumers,\u201d she says. While she appreciates her father\u2019s counsel, she says she\u2019s learnt the most by observing how he makes decisions: \u201cHe stays true to his values even when he encounters rough winds.\u201d\nFrontier Family\nAyala Corp. traces its roots to 1834 when Antonio de Ayala and Domingo Roxas built a distillery to make a juniper-flavored liquor called Ginebra San Miguel. (That eventually morphed into a gin-production company, today\u2019s largest by volume, owned by billionaire Ramon Ang.) Antonio, whose daughter married a Zobel, was later named a director of the Philippines\u2019 first bank, the predecessor to Bank of the Philippine Islands.\nThe family began developing Hacienda Makati in the late 1940s, which had been the site of the country\u2019s first commercial airport, later turned by the Americans into an airbase during World War II. Joseph McMicking, a colonel who married Mercedes Zobel de Ayala from the fifth generation, created the blueprint that would transform the virtual grassland into the country\u2019s financial capital.\nJaime Zobel de Ayala, 91, Mariana\u2019s grandfather, under whom the family\u2019s $3.4 billion fortune is listed at No. 7, took the helm in 1983 when his cousin, Enrique Zobel (d. 2004) retired. Amid political and economic turmoil, which led to the ouster of late President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., Jaime steadied the ship, listing the property division as Ayala Land. When his sons\u2014Jaime Augusto and Fernando\u2014became co-vice chairmen in the mid-1990s, the conglomerate was ready to embark on expansion. The brothers pushed into new businesses with Jaime Augusto taking over as group chairman after the patriarch retired in 2006."

      "text": "Zoox, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Amazon, has received approval from U.S. regulators to operate its purpose-built electric robotaxis that lack steering wheels, mirrors and conventional vehicle controls on public roads, a necessary step as it prepares to take on Alphabet\u2019s Waymo.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it granted Zoox the first-ever exemption from U.S. rules requiring the use of certain features as part of its expanded Automated Vehicle Exemption Program, which applies to all the company\u2019s vehicles now on the road. As part of the waiver, Zoox must \u201cremove or cover\u201d statements claiming its robotaxi meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, NHTSA said. The agency also said it\u2019s closing an investigation of Zoox\u2019s self-certification of its robotaxis.\nFor the latest in cleantech and sustainability news, sign up here for our Current Climate newsletter.\nThe decision is \u201ca win-win for safety and innovation,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. \u201cAmerica \u2013 not China \u2013 can and will drive the future of self-driving cars forward.\u201d\nThe waiver clears the way for Zoox, founded 11 years ago, to launch its robotaxi service later this year, first in Las Vegas, with San Francisco, other Bay Area cities, Austin, Miami, Los Angeles and Atlanta to follow. Like Waymo\u2013and unlike Tesla\u2013the Foster City, California-based company has secured permission to operate paid rides in self-driving vehicles in the Golden State. Also like Waymo, Zoox is using far more robust sensors for its autonomous system, including laser lidar, radar, thermal cameras and microphones (to hear emergency vehicles), in addition to digital cameras.\nWith its decision, \u201cNHTSA has proposed a way to enable Zoox to move forward with confidence,\u201d the company said in an email. \u201cThrough this new exemption process, we are excited to embark on this new path, put these discussions behind us, and move forward, so Zoox can continue to lead the way in autonomous innovation.\u201d\nRather than loading up existing vehicles with sensors and computers like Waymo has, Zoox\u2019s plan from the outset has revolved around creating a robotaxi service with an electric model built from the ground up. Along with the absence of conventional physical controls, it features sliding doors reminiscent of transit trains and is a bidirectional vehicle, with identical front and rear ends. The toaster-shaped robotaxi has a top speed of 75 miles per hour, though it won\u2019t typically exceed 45 mph on urban and suburban runs. It\u2019s also intended to operate for up to 16 hours per charge per day, rack up 100,000 miles a year and remain in service for at least five years.\n\u201cWe\u2019re offering a unique experience for riders that we think they\u2019ll prefer,\u201d cofounder and CTO Jesse Levinson told Forbes during a tour of Zoox\u2019s robotaxi factory in Hayward, California, in June. \u201cThe ride quality, the carriage-style seating, the roomy interior\u2013we think all of this is going to be what sets us apart.\u201d"

      "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizdoestone/2025/08/04/how-to-decode-a-college-website-like-an-admissions-insider/",
      "text": "In 2025, a polished college homepage can look like a luxury ad campaign. But behind the curated messaging, universities are sending signals about politics, priorities, and pedagogy. For families navigating an increasingly competitive college admissions landscape, knowing how to read between the lines isn\u2019t just smart. It\u2019s essential.\nAs a longtime college admissions counselor and academic, I\u2019ve spent years decoding what colleges choose to highlight, downplay, or quietly omit. Here\u2019s how prospective students and their families can do the same.\nGo Straight To The Academic Departments\nEvery school says they offer \u201crigorous academics\u201d and \u201cexceptional faculty.\u201d But what\u2019s actually happening in the classroom? And how easy will it be for your student to secure research or pursue their intended major?\nDig into department pages, especially in majors your student is considering. Look beyond the course lists and faculty bios to see how undergraduates truly engage with the department. Dartmouth Engineering, for instance, showcases its First-Year Research in Engineering Experience program, which offers research and mentorship opportunities to first-year students. Opportunities such as this one signal a genuine commitment to undergraduate teaching and early academic involvement.\nOn the other hand, some departments at top schools may emphasize faculty research, but make it difficult to determine how (or whether) undergraduates participate. For instance, Columbia University\u2019s physics department page highlights Nobel Prize-winning faculty, but it offers limited insight into whether undergraduates engage meaningfully in research. Even at MIT, many introductory courses are taught by lecturers or graduate students rather than tenured professors, and its research opportunities, while abundant, often require more initiative to secure.\nIf your student is interested in business, it\u2019s especially important to dig into the details. The University of Virginia McIntire School of Commerce, for instance, requires students to apply in the spring of their first year of classes, and admission is highly competitive. The University of Michigan Ross School of Business has a preferred admission pathway for first-year applicants, but many students still go through a rigorous internal transfer process after their first year of classes.\nEven within liberal arts disciplines, be aware of hidden gatekeeping. Yale University requires competitive applications to enter selective majors like architecture, global affairs, or cognitive science, and Northwestern has limited spots in its journalism and musical theatre certificate program, which require auditions or portfolios.\nFind The Core Curriculum Or Lack Thereof\nColumbia University is unapologetically structured. Its famed core curriculum is central to its identity and required of all undergraduates, covering everything from literature humanities to contemporary civilization. The University of Chicago is also rigorous, with a core curriculum that makes up about one-third of a student\u2019s coursework, emphasizing a classical liberal arts foundation across disciplines.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Brown University offers a fully open curriculum, encouraging students to forge their own pathway with virtually no general education requirements. Amherst College and Wesleyan University take a similar approach with no core curriculum and no distribution requirements. Instead, they trust students to build a personalized academic experience with the support of faculty advisors.\nMany schools fall somewhere in the middle. At Stanford University, students complete a flexible set of general education requirements under the Ways of Thinking and Ways of Doing framework, which allows for broad exploration. Duke University has distribution requirements across several areas (humanistic inquiry, investigating the natural world, and more) but allows students to choose from hundreds of courses to fulfill them.\nThese models appeal to different types of learners. On a college website, they may sound equally positive \u2014 phrased as \u201cintellectual exploration\u201d or \u201ccommon academic journey\u201d \u2014 but they create vastly different student experiences. If your teen thrives with more structure, or seeks more freedom, pay close attention to what\u2019s under the hood.\nCheck Out The Daily Student Newspaper\nThe glossy \u201cStudent Life\u201d tab will tell you what the college wants you to see, but the student newspaper will tell you what students are actually talking about. The Stanford Daily covered tensions around free speech policies in 2024, including restrictions on protest zones and ID requirements, as well as critiques that only \u201cpleasant speech\u201d is protected. At Yale, the campus climate has come under scrutiny following a \u201cD\u201d grade from the Anti-Defamation League for incidents of antisemitism linked to protests, and a student group lawsuit about punitive mental health leave policies.\nAt the University of Pennsylvania, The Daily Pennsylvanian has reported on tensions between student groups and administration over diversity initiatives, the university\u2019s protection of international students, and protest policies, while at Harvard University, The Crimson has published numerous stories on the fallout from the school\u2019s leadership controversies and donor influence, as well as the growing divides over campus speech, amplified by Harvard\u2019s clash with the Trump administration. These stories reveal the real campus dynamics and offer a far more honest view than a brochure ever could.\nSee What Is Changing And What Is Missing\nIn 2025, leadership changes at top universities have become a window into broader cultural and political pressures. At the University of Virginia, President Jim Ryan, a well-respected leader who served in this post since 2018, announced his resignation following a federal investigation into the school\u2019s DEI programs.\nIn an emotional campus-wide message, Ryan explained that while he remained committed to diversity as essential to institutional excellence, he could not, in good conscience, risk the financial aid, research funding, and visa status of students and faculty by staying and fighting a politically charged battle with the federal government. His resignation, submitted despite a successful capital campaign and near-completion of the university\u2019s strategic plan, was a sobering reminder that even well-established, accomplished presidents can be forced out under political pressure.\nAt MIT, President Sally Kornbluth oversaw the closure of the Institute Community and Equity Office in May, a move that was framed as streamlining but widely seen as part of a broader rollback of DEI infrastructure. In the University of California system, regents chair Janet Reilly announced in March that diversity statements would no longer be required in faculty hiring, an anticipatory shift made \u201cwhile the university has no systemwide policies\u201d but aligned with increasing federal scrutiny.\nThese shifts today reflect deeper values such as intellectual meritocracy, social mission, institutional boldness, or risk aversion. As prospective students track public statements by university officials, they should ask: What values does the university leadership stand for, and are those aligned with my own?\nInvestigate Mental Health And Career Support\nTwo of the most overlooked but revealing sections on a college website are counseling services and career development. What are the wait times for mental health support? Does the school offer short-term therapy and long-term care coordination? Princeton University\u2019s health services website, for instance, outlines a comprehensive step-by-step guide to therapy referrals and even Peer Health Advisors, showing a real commitment to student well-being.\nCareer development offices can be equally telling. Some schools emphasize support for first-generation students or internship funding for unpaid opportunities, suggesting they\u2019re attuned to equity and access. Others are more transactional, focusing only on outcomes and job placement stats.\nA college website will never tell you the whole story. As schools continue to revise DEI language, reinstate testing policies, and debate academic freedom, the stakes for college applicants and their families have never been higher. Understanding what a school truly values, beyond prestige, can help your student find a place where they\u2019ll thrive."

Semiconductors are electronic components essential to phones, computers, medical equipment, vehicles and more. Tech is one of several sectors included within Trump\u2019s push for increased domestic manufacturing, as the president has announced multibillion-dollar investments from companies like OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank, which are slated to increase their cumulative investment in AI data centers to $500 billion. Google and investment management firm Blackstone have also committed $50 billion worth of investments to the U.S. for data centers and infrastructure. The president has levied tariffs as an attempt to bolster manufacturing in the U.S., recently reaching reduced tariff deals with trading partners including Japan (15%), the U.K. (10%) and the European Union (15%).\nFurther Reading\nThese Are The Trump Tariffs Launching Friday: Far Short Of The 90 Promised Deals (Forbes)\nApple Invests Another $100 Billion Into The U.S., Trump Says\u2014As Shares Jump 5% (Forbes)"

      "text": "Topline\nPresident Donald Trump told Walmart to stop blaming his sweeping tariffs as the reason for price increases, urging the retail conglomerate to absorb the costs of the tariffs as it prepares to raise the prices of several goods this month.\nKey Facts\nTrump told Walmart to \u201cEAT THE TARIFFS\u201d in a Truth Social post, telling the retailer to not charge customers anything extra as his tariffs begin to take effect.\nJohn David Rainey, Walmart's chief financial officer, told CNBC this week the increase in tariffs is \u201cmore than any supplier can absorb and so I'm concerned that [the] consumer is going to start seeing higher prices\u201d toward the end of May and even more so in June.\nWhat Walmart Items Could Tariffs Make More Expensive?\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon said during the retailer\u2019s first quarter earnings call that tariffs on trading partners like Columbia, Peru and Costa Rica have applied pressure on the prices of bananas, avocados and coffee. However, McMillon has assured consumers Walmart \u201cwon't let tariff-related cost pressure on some general merchandise items put pressure on food prices.\u201d Child products such as strollers, car seats and toys could also see a jump in cost despite Trump\u2019s recent decision to lower tariff rates on most Chinese goods to 30%. McMillion also noted electronics prices could be pressured, as China represents a large share of imported electronic products.\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cWalmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWalmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, \u2018EAT THE TARIFFS,\u2019 and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I\u2019ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!\u201d\nWhat Other Companies Have Warned Of Tariff Impacts?\nFoxconn, one of the world\u2019s largest contract manufacturers and a major Apple partner, recently downgraded its outlook from \u201cstrong growth\u201d to \u201csignificant growth,\u201d with the manufacturer's chairman saying \u201cchanges in U.S. tariff policies have considerably impacted the global supply chain\u2026with recent exchange rate fluctuations adding to the uncertainty.\u201d Toyota cited the impact of U.S. tariffs when it estimated $1.25 billion in profits were erased in April and March. Toy company Mattel paused its full-year guidance this month over the tariffs and said it may raise prices of its toys \u201cwhere necessary.\u201d (Check here for a full list of companies feeling the tariff crunch).\nWhy Do Businesses Increase Prices Over Tariffs?\nTariffs are taxes on imported goods, raising costs for the companies importing the goods. Companies may pass those higher import costs onto customers by raising retail prices.\nKey Background\nMuch of the uncertainty from large companies over tariffs comes as Trump has repeatedly flip-flopped on tariff rates against various countries. In April, the president issued 10% baseline tariffs on imports from scores of countries throughout the world, with some countries getting hit with rates as high as 50%. China, a manufacturing superpower, was hit with 145% tariff rates before the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day reduction in rates, dropping the levy on Chinese goods to 30% as negotiations continue. Trump\u2019s tariffs have shaken up markets while also stoking fears of a recession. Experts have said tariffs will provoke higher inflation, but the Trump administration\u2019s ever-changing tariff policy has made it hard to predict the extent of any inflationary impact."
