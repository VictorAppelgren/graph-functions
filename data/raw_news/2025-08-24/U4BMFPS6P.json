  "content": "When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the United Utilities Group PLC (LON:UU.) share price is up 40% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 17%.\n\nAfter a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring the five years of share price growth, United Utilities Group moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd hope to see the share price to rise.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, United Utilities Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 76%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nIt's nice to see that United Utilities Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 12%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with United Utilities Group .",

  "argos_summary": "United Utilities Group PLC\u2019s share price has risen 40% over five years, yet it still lags the market, while the stock delivered a 17% return last year. The company has moved from loss to profit, with a 108.6% earnings jump in the past year despite a 4% average decline over five years, and its dividend yield and total shareholder return (TSR) of 76% over five years underscore the importance of dividends. Revenue has grown 2.6% annually and the firm\u2019s return on equity sits at 13.2%, but the company\u2019s high debt\u2011equity ratio and a CEO pay below the median raise concerns. Overall, the stock offers attractive income and recent momentum, but investors should weigh the earnings volatility and capital allocation issues highlighted in recent news.",
