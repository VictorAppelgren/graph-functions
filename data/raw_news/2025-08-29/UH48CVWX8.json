The numbers say they shouldn\u2019t.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nThe August 2025 report, \u201cFact vs. Fiction in Real-Time Payments Fraud,\u201d published by PYMNTS Intelligence and The Clearing House, gives rise to a striking contradiction: financial institutions are disproportionately worried about fraud risks in real-time payments, even as those same rails show the lowest fraud rates in the industry.\n\nThat fear is shaping decisions at the infrastructure level. According to the report, 78% of organizations choose to start their real-time implementation in receive-only mode, a risk-avoidance strategy that limits the value of faster payments and stalls ecosystem-wide adoption.\n\nBut the data undermines the fear. Fraud is happening, but not where banks expect it.\n\nThe headline findings from the report are familiar. Real-time payments are gaining ground, but adoption is hindered by persistent myths. The RTP network and FedNow Service, the two primary real-time rails in the U.S., are designed with built-in fraud mitigation tools \u2014 yet only 22% of banks have embraced full send-and-receive functionality.\n\nThe report makes the case that security fears are less a reflection of actual threats and more a legacy mindset carried over from fraud-prone systems like checks and wires.\n\nWhat\u2019s buried beneath the top-line summary, however, is this:\n\u2022 Just 2% of firms reported any fraud on RTP or FedNow. In contrast, a staggering 63% of firms reported check fraud in 2024, while ACH and wire transfers saw fraud rates of 38% and 30%, respectively.\n\u2022 Only 3% of financial institutions characterized real-time fraud as \u201csignificant.\u201d Most categorized the fraud impact as either \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cslight\u201d\u2014and a large portion reported no impact at all.\n\u2022 Despite these numbers, 85% of U.S. payment professionals still expect fraud to rise with real-time payments. Among large institutions (50,000+ employees), that expectation climbs to 95%, with half anticipating a sharp increase.\n\nThe discrepancy isn\u2019t just academic. It has market consequences. Institutions are over-indexing on risk and under-leveraging one of the industry\u2019s most secure payment systems. The irony is stark: checks remain in use by 75% of firms despite being the most fraud-prone instrument.\n\nMeanwhile, real-time systems \u2014 designed with push-only architecture, API-level security, and instant transaction visibility \u2014 are still eyed with suspicion.\n\nPart of the problem may be optics. Fraud that does occur on real-time rails \u2014 such as authorized push payment (APP) scams \u2014 tends to make headlines, while the day-to-day security wins go unnoticed. Still, tools like Confirmation of Payee (CoP) have near-universal support (96% of banks) and have already cut fraud 60% in the U.K. market. In the U.S., however, partial adoption risks rerouting fraud to less protected institutions.\n\nOther findings in the report further reinforce the case for real-time rails. The Clearing House and the Fed continue to expand fraud defenses with tools like real-time monitoring, collaborative data exchange, and scam classification models. Banks themselves are prioritizing AI, multifactor authentication, and interbank data sharing to further reduce risk. Yet without broader adoption, those efforts risk being underutilized.\n\nThe path forward doesn\u2019t require new tech; it requires a mindset shift. The report offers ample evidence that the real-time rails are ready. Now it\u2019s time for institutions to catch up.",

Please confirm your email to view all our Trackers.\nFaster payments are gaining traction, but fraud fears haven\u2019t kept pace with facts. Convinced that speed invites scams, many banks in the United States remain hesitant about fully embracing real-time rails such as the RTP\u00ae network and the FedNow\u00ae Service. This fear persists\u2014even though it\u2019s outdated. Today\u2019s instant rails offer stronger fraud defenses than checks, wires or automated clearing house (ACH). Still, stubborn myths about payment speed and its attendant risks shape how financial institutions (FIs) act. Too many try to \u201cplay it safe\u201d by offering receive-only service, bottlenecking adoption and limiting faster payments\u2019 value. It\u2019s time for a reset. Clearing up misperceptions could unlock real-time payments\u2019 broader benefits\u2014from better customer experience to lower fraud exposure.\nFraud Fears Still Hamper Real-Time Payments Adoption\nFear of fraud remains one of the biggest hurdles to real-time payments adoption. Many banks limit participation to receive-only mode, driven by concerns that speed increases exposure to scams and fraud risk.\nBanks\u2019 fear of fraud in instant payments is widespread\u2014and growing.\nFraud remains a central fear restricting real-time payments adoption at scale. In a recent study by RedCompass Labs, 85% of U.S. payment professionals said they expect fraud to increase as instant payments become more common. Larger banks, worried about being bigger targets, are the most on edge. Ninety-five percent of firms with more than 50,000 employees expect fraud to rise, and half predict a sharp increase, according to the same findings.\n85%\nof U.S. payment professionals expect more fraud as instant payments scale.\nIn fact, fraud\u2019s ranking as a hurdle to real-time rails adoption saw the biggest increase this year, climbing to fourth place from ninth in 2024, though this was still relatively low, cited by 26% of FIs. Of all the named obstacles to instant payments implementation, fraud followed fierce competition from FinTechs at number one (36%), the challenge of needing to offer 24/7 availability at number two (34%), and the difficulty of updating architecture and internal systems at number three (28%). Researchers noted that the rise of fraud concerns as a barrier makes sense as banks come to grips with the actual operation of instant payments after focusing almost exclusively on structural challenges until now.\nAmid rising financial fraud, robust protection is essential.\nThe 2025 Faster Payments Barometer found that the specific fraud fears surrounding real-time payments adoption mirror those in the financial industry at large. At 35%, account takeover fraud ranks as the top worry regarding instant payments, followed closely by authorized push payment (APP) fraud, such as scams that trick users into sending money, at 30%. Other risks\u2014including synthetic identity and invoice fraud\u2014draw more moderate urgency (10% to 15%). Meanwhile, so-called money mule activity\u2014when fraudsters use individuals to transfer stolen funds\u2014occupies a lower yet still significant tier of concern, at less than 5%.\nThese apprehensions suggest that FIs should prioritize authentication and customer education to address both the technical and the human weaknesses that fraudsters exploit. However, many institutions are taking the less rational approach of forgoing adoption altogether.\nOpting out of instant payments serves no one.\nFears tied to authorized sender fraud\u2014especially on platforms like Zelle, where it has drawn regulators\u2019 attention\u2014are shaping real-world choices, with many banks adopting receive-only functionality to reduce exposure. According to the 2025 Faster Payments Barometer, 78% of all surveyed organizations planned to begin their implementations with receive-only capabilities, whereas just 22% intended to launch full send-and-receive services.\nThe assumption behind these decisions? \u201cFaster payments equal faster fraud.\u201d That myth still shapes how institutions act, even as today\u2019s rails tell a different story. FIs that limit engagement due to a lack of confidence in their defenses only create a bottleneck that constricts adoption across the banking ecosystem.\nFraud on the RTP\u00ae Network and FedNow\u00ae Remains Rare\nDespite these anxieties, current fraud rates on faster payment rails are significantly lower than for traditional payment systems. Real-time transactions face less fraud than checks, wires or ACH\u2014yet many institutions still view them as riskier.\nLegacy rails face higher fraud risk than real-time payments.\n63%\nof firms report check fraud. Just 2% report fraud on RTP or FedNow.\nFraud on traditional rails still exceeds real-time payments fraud by a wide margin. According to the 2025 Association for Financial Professionals (AFP) Payments Fraud and Control Survey Report, 63% of firms reported attempted or actual check fraud in 2024, compared to just 2% on RTP or FedNow. According to The Clearing House (TCH), fraud rates on the RTP network are a fraction of a percentage point. In April 2025, for example, out of 35 million transactions, there were just 123 instances of reported fraud. Meanwhile, ACH debits and wire transfers took second and third place in actual or attempted fraud, at 38% and 30%, respectively.\nThose findings reflect how fraudsters target older systems that move high volumes while lacking modern safeguards. Real-time networks, by contrast, often run in tokenized API environments that improve transaction security and access control. Real-time payments networks allow only push payments, where the account holder must send the transaction. This is unlike other payment types, such as ACH, where pull (debit) payments are allowed.\nChecks still dominate payments despite high fraud exposure.\nChecks remain widely used, despite persistent fraud risks. Although nearly two in three institutions experienced check fraud in 2024 and nearly one in four incidents involved stolen mail, 75% of firms still plan to keep using checks over the next two years. Instant payments are often better protected, but that advantage still hasn\u2019t revolutionized institutional behavior.\nMeanwhile, the government is taking action against the tidal wave of check fraud. The U.S. Treasury and banking groups are fast-tracking the digitization of federal checks per an executive order ahead of a September deadline. This move, which specifically recommends real-time payments as a safer alternative, is a crucial step in the government\u2019s broader efforts to safeguard federal payments against fraud.\n\u201cRemoving paper Treasury checks from circulation is an important step toward reducing theft and the related losses,\u201d top banking associations said in a recent joint letter to the Treasury regarding the order.\nMost fraud cases tied to RTP and FedNow are low-impact.\nMoreover, the severity of fraud\u2019s impact on faster payments is often limited. According to the Faster Payments Barometer, just 3% of financial institutions report real-time payments\u2019 fraud impact as \u201csignificant.\u201d Most incidents are categorized as \u201cslight\u201d or \u201cmoderate,\u201d and a large portion of FIs report zero impact. These findings suggest that current controls are working, though sustained investment is still needed to stay ahead of evolving threats.\nFraud Prevention Tools Win Bank Support\nFinancial institutions must raise awareness of real-time payments\u2019 strong fraud prevention tools to encourage broader adoption. Many FIs already support advanced solutions\u2014and U.S. real-time rails are fully on board, launching their own initiatives.\nBanks back stronger fraud defenses\u2014but broader adoption is needed for them to work.\nMany institutions back targeted tools to contain fraud. For example, nearly all banks, at 96%, support introducing an ID verification system like Confirmation of Payee (CoP). The principle is simple: Before processing a transaction, the recipient\u2019s details are matched against the sender\u2019s entered information, with the sender then notified of any discrepancy. Among small to mid-sized banks, support rises to 97%.\nSuch a system has already proven effective at combating APP fraud in the United Kingdom, where its mandate has resulted in a 60% reduction in fraud cases. However, for tools like CoP to work, bank participation must be near-universal. The concern is that partial adoption of this tool, as in the fragmented U.S. real-time payments market, would simply reroute fraud to banks that are not covered.\nThe top five tools banks say they need.\nRedCompass Labs asked U.S. banks which fraud prevention measures they consider most urgent. Leading the list: artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) (40%), followed by real-time detection (39%) and multifactor authentication (MFA) (35%). Data sharing among banks (32%) and coordination with telecom and tech firms (27%) round out the top five.\nAll five strategies aim to stop fraud before funds move. Confidence is growing in technology\u2019s potential to achieve just that, with 54% of U.S. big banks this year believing AI can improve financial crime detection, up from only 31% overall last year.\nTCH and the Fed step up fraud defense.\nBanks that participate in the major U.S. real-time networks, meanwhile, will find these rails\u2019 defenses already robust and gaining strength. The Clearing House and the Federal Reserve have each launched new fraud mitigation tools for the RTP network and FedNow, respectively. These include real-time monitoring, collaborative data exchange and the Fed\u2019s ScamClassifier model\u2014a framework for tracking scam types and patterns. These efforts matter. With the measures\u2019 continued success fueling more bank participation, the U.S. could quickly become a leader in the real-time payments race.\nTurning the Page on Faster Payments Myths\nEven as fraud rates remain low, persistent myths about risk are slowing real-time payments adoption. To move forward, stakeholders must confront the perception gap, equipping institutions and consumers alike with the tools and clarity needed to build trust at scale.\nFraud is still a top concern\u2014but not the top threat. Just 2% of firms report fraud on real-time rails, versus 63% on checks.\nRisk is concentrated, not constant. Account takeover and push payment scams top the threat list, yet most fraud events have limited impact on faster payment rails.\nCoP-style ID checks have near-universal support. Ninety-six percent of banks want them\u2014but coverage must be consistent to close gaps.\nTechnology works best when paired with collaboration. Banks rank AI, MFA and real-time monitoring highly\u2014but also want stronger data sharing.\nNetwork operators are stepping up. RTP and FedNow are expanding real-time defenses and scam-tracking frameworks.\nReal-time payments have reached an inflection point. While risk won\u2019t disappear entirely anytime soon, the tools to manage it are mature, tested and widely endorsed. Widespread instant payments adoption now depends on better communication, smarter coordination and closing the trust gap.\nAbout\nThe Clearing House operates U.S.-based payments networks that clear and settle funds through ACH, check image, the RTP\u00ae network and wire transfers.
