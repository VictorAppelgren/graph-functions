      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Scope & Focus**  \n   - The draft must stay *exclusively* on the UST 10‑year. Remove any mention of equity indices, 2‑year yields, or other assets unless they are used *as a causal link* to the 10‑year.  \n   - When equity data is referenced, re‑frame it as a *risk‑aversion proxy* that influences the 10‑year, and cite the source inline (e.g., 3YAQ8JUPL or 97MD1FHW8).  \n\n2. **Causal Chain & Market Transmission**  \n   - Explicitly map:  \n     - **PCE (2.6% July)** → Fed’s dovish stance → market‑priced September cut → 10‑year rise (cite 97MD1FHW8).  \n     - **Trump tariff plan (mid‑Oct window)** → potential inflationary tail‑winds → term‑premium shift → 10‑year upward pressure (cite 1DEM6P1Y2).  \n     - **Fed Governor Waller’s comment** → 89% cut probability → 10‑year level (cite U21K4ALYQ).  \n   - Each link must have an inline citation and a brief quantitative range (e.g., “10‑year likely to trade 4.20‑4.30% if cut probability >85%”).  \n\n3. **Quantification & Numbers**  \n   - Replace vague “4.23% level” with a precise range: “4.23% ± 0.05% today, projected 4.20‑4.30% over next 1–2 weeks.”  \n   - Provide explicit thresholds: “Above 4.30% invalidates 89% cut odds; below 4.20% reinforces them.”  \n   - Quantify tariff impact: “If tariffs extend, 10‑year could rise 20‑30 bp; if curtailed, fall 10‑15 bp.”  \n\n4. **Catalyst Windows & Timing**  \n   - Clearly list the next catalysts:  \n     - **Fed meeting 16‑17 Aug** (Powell remarks, minutes).  \n     - **PCE release 30 Aug** (core PCE).  \n     - **Supreme Court ruling on tariffs (mid‑Oct)**.  \n   - For each, state the expected direction on the 10‑year and the probability change.  \n\n5. **Citation Density & Correctness**  \n   - Ensure every substantive claim has an inline ID: e.g., “core PCE 2.6% (97MD1FHW8)”.  \n   - Remove any unreferenced statements.  \n\n6. **Eliminate Non‑Asset Drift**  \n   - Delete or re‑frame any discussion of S&P 500, Nasdaq, or other indices unless they are used purely as a *risk‑aversion indicator* for the 10‑year.  \n   - If kept, add a sentence: “Tech‑sector weakness (3YAQ8JUPL) has historically correlated with 10‑year tightening; current 0.7% S&P decline is consistent with a 20‑bp rise in the 10‑year.”  \n\n7. **Structure & Brevity**  \n   - Condense the draft into a 4‑paragraph executive summary:  \n     1. Current 10‑year snapshot & Fed outlook.  \n     2. Tariff risk transmission.  \n     3. Catalyst timeline & expected moves.  \n     4. Key thresholds & monitoring checklist.  \n\n8. **Alignment with Section Focus**  \n   - Verify that the final version addresses the 0–3 week horizon, lists immediate drivers, catalysts, reaction function, key levels, invalidation, and next monitoring points—all tied to the UST 10‑year.  \n\nImplement these edits to meet the “uncompromising, LLM‑driven Neo4j world model” standard: concise, evidence‑based, and fully mapped to a single canonical handle (UST10Y).",
