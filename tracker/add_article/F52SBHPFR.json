      "summary": "The S&P 500 is trading at historically high levels, largely driven by the 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants that now make up over a third of the index. Its elevated Shiller CAPE ratio signals a potential pullback. An equal‑weight S&P 500 ETF, such as Invesco RSP, offers more diversified exposure that mitigates concentration risk. The article also explains how the P/E ratio works and why it matters for investors.",
