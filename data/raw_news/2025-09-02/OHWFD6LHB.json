  "title": "If I Could Buy Only 1 High-Yield Dividend Stock for Passive Income in September, This Would Be It",
  "description": "This company provides two different passive income streams.",
  "content": "\u2022 The BDC also periodically pays supplemental quarterly dividends.\n\u2022 The company offers additional upside potential from its equity investments.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Main Street Capital \u203a My primary financial goal is to build enough passive income streams to cover my basic living expenses. Achieving this milestone would enable me to be more financially independent. This strategy leads me to invest money each month to grow my passive income. Investing in high-yielding dividend stocks is a core aspect of my strategy. I tend to buy several each month. However, if I could only buy one high-yield dividend stock this month, it would be Main Street Capital (NYSE: MAIN). Here's why it's my top passive income investment in September. Main Street Capital is a business development company (BDC) that provides private debt and equity capital to lower-middle-market companies ($10 million\u2013$150 million in annual revenue) and debt capital to middle-market companies (over $150 million in revenue). These investments generate recurring income. The BDC distributes a portion of its income to investors each month through dividend payments. Main Street Capital sets its monthly dividend at a level it can sustain during more turbulent market conditions (currently 1.4 times its distributable net investment income). That enables it to provide investors with a recurring income stream they can count on each month. Main Street Capital has never reduced or suspended its dividend payment since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2007. This bankability is a desirable feature for those seeking a durable passive income stream. Main Street Capital currently pays $0.255 per share each month ($3.06 annually). That gives the BDC a 4.6% dividend yield, nearly four times higher than the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 1.2% yield. The BDC routinely increases its monthly dividend, aiming to grow it at a sustainable rate. Since its IPO, Main Street Capital has increased its payout by 132%, including by 4.1% over the past 12 months. This steadily rising payout provides its investors with a growing stream of passive income. As a BDC, Main Street Capital must distribute 90% of its taxable net income to investors via dividends to remain compliant with IRS regulations. The company does this through a unique dividend policy. It pays the aforementioned conservative monthly dividend. Additionally, Main Street Capital periodically pays quarterly supplemental dividends from its excess income.\n\nIt recently declared a $0.30 per-share supplemental dividend payment that it will pay in September. The company has paid quarterly supplemental dividends at that rate for the past two years. This additional payment has pushed Main Street Capital's annualized dividend yield up to around 6.5%, even further above the S&P 500's level. The company has historically paid supplemental dividends during healthy market conditions and pauses these payments during more challenging periods to preserve its financial flexibility. I see this additional dividend payment as a nice bonus income stream. Another bonus Main Street Capital provides its investors is the potential for meaningful value growth. Most BDCs focus on making debt investments. While that provides them with a lucrative income stream to pay dividends, it caps their upside potential. Main Street Capital, on the other hand, aims to be a one-stop capital solutions provider by offering its clients debt and equity capital. Those equity investments (30% of its lower-middle-market portfolio, and 5% of its middle-market investments) supply it with dividend income and upside potential as the value of its private equity investments increases. These equity investments have enabled Main Street Capital to meaningfully grow its net asset value per share (151% since its IPO). That has provided investors with an additional return above the dividend income. Main Street can periodically harvest gains by selling its equity investments, which it can use to make additional investments. These investments have enabled the company to steadily increase its dividend payments. Main Street Capital is an ideal investment for my passive income strategy. It provides a very bankable monthly income stream that steadily rises. Additionally, it routinely pays a supplemental dividend, supplying even more passive income. To top it all off, the company's equity investments have helped steadily grow the value of its shares, providing additional upside potential beyond the lucrative income. This combination of income and upside potential is why Main Street Capital is the high-yield dividend stock I'd buy if I could only purchase one this September.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "A business development company (BDC) is a specific corporate structure for companies that provide capital to smaller and midsize companies, as well as distressed businesses in need of capital. Publicly traded BDCs can be compelling investments, as they give investors of any level of wealth access to strategies like investing in private equity and distressed debt, which are more often associated with the well-heeled.\nIn addition, BDCs appeal to investors seeking a source of income or a good dividend yield. Because of their structure, they are required to distribute 90% of taxable income to shareholders each year. The downside is that the BDC doesn't retain much of its earnings, so these large distributions can fluctuate from year to year.\nWhat is a BDC?\nWhat is a BDC?\nAt its core, a business development company (BDC) invests in private companies, typically small- and medium-sized ones, to provide them with the capital they may need to grow during their early stages of development. Some BDCs also provide capital to larger companies that may be distressed and in need of cash to turn the business around or avoid insolvency.\nThe capital that a BDC provides may be structured as debt, often secured by the business or particular assets it owns. Alternatively, it can be issued as equity or as debt that can be converted to an equity investment. Depending on the size and condition of the business, these strategies are often unattainable to individual investors. They can be structured to reduce the risk of loss for the BDC and its investors, even in the case of a business failure.\nA BDC's offerings and/or shares are registered with and regulated by the SEC, subject to many of the regulations applicable to registered investment companies. BDCs are a type of closed-end fund, meaning they invest the money raised during their IPO and don't take in new money from investors.\nA BDC must be a U.S. company. Additionally, it must invest at least 70% of its assets in U.S. companies with a market value of less than $250 million. In addition to capital, BDCs also provide assistance in the form of expertise in managing their companies as well.\nPros and cons\nPros and cons of investing in a BDC\nAs mentioned above, BDCs can be very compelling income investments. Because they pay no income tax so long as they distribute 90% of their taxable income, the average BDC pays a very high dividend yield compared to the majority of dividend-paying stocks.\nAnother benefit of BDCs for retail investors is they are highly liquid; it's easy to buy and sell shares on securities exchanges. By contrast, typical private equity and venture capital investments require your funds to be locked up for many years at a time.\nLastly, there's a diversification benefit. So long as the BDC you invest in owns a diverse portfolio of investments, it's a nice way to spread your capital across multiple opportunities and risks at one time.\nHowever, there are downsides, too. Those dividends can sometimes come at the cost of lower stock price appreciation. Most BDCs must distribute 90% of income, meaning they have far less retained earnings to reinvest and grow the value of the enterprise. And since most BDCs don't pay income tax, their distributions are not qualified. That means you will likely pay more in taxes on the distributions you get from the BDCs you own.\nThe result of paying out most of its earnings while still pursuing growth means most BDCs have a lot of debt as a percentage of assets. This means rising debt expense as they must refinance debt as it matures. This environment means potential risk and opportunity for BDCs now. Since interest rates have moved sharply higher, BDCs can potentially strike more lucrative new deals, but they could also be handcuffed by existing agreements that tie up their capital. And if portfolio companies struggle to repay their debts, a BDC could end up owning its assets and disposing of them at a loss.\nAnother potential issue with BDCs is fees. Just like with an open-ended fund like a mutual fund or ETF, the manager of the BDC will charge fees to cover its expenses, and these fees can be significant. According to Closed-End Fund Advisors, the 48 average publicly traded BDC had an expense ratio of 14.28% as of July 2023. In other words, access to these lucrative strategies comes with a significant cost.\nExpense Ratio\nInvesting in a BDC\nWhat to know about investing in a BDC\nBecause business development companies pay out almost all of their taxable income and use a lot of debt to fund deals, investors need to be familiar with their balance sheets and capital structures. It's important to know their interest rate on debt, when debt is maturing, and how much of a discount to current market rates it may be paying. This is especially true if it must refinance cheap debt at higher rates, while still earning subpar yields on existing debt from portfolio companies.\nIt's also really important to understand the strategy of the BDCs you are interested in. Some focus on specific sorts of companies or sectors or industries. The majority of the largest BDCs focus on debt opportunities and less equity. Make sure that the strategy the BDC's management takes aligns with you as an investor.\nLastly, make sure you know how a BDC's management is compensated. Does the manager get an outsize portion of returns above a certain threshold? It's not uncommon for the BDC's manager to take a \"2 and 20\" fee structure, meaning 2% of assets and 20% of profits earned. These fees come right off the top, before you get anything at all.\nMany BDCs are entities created by a larger company. For instance, FS KKR Capital Corp (FSK 1.39%) was formed in a merger of entities managed by privately held FS Investments and a subsidiary of KKR & Co. (KKR -0.34%) and Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (BXSL 0.57%) is managed by Blackstone (BX -0.25%), the largest alternative asset manager on earth.\nLastly, valuation matters. With BDCs, net asset value (NAV) is a useful way to find fair value. NAV is the value of the underlying assets that a business development company owns. Shares may trade for a discount or a premium to NAV, and there are reasons why you would want to pay more or less than NAV, depending on the market value of those assets. A BDC that made a risky investment in a business that goes poorly may be worth less than NAV. Conversely, a wildly successful investment could cause it to be worth a premium. Either way, NAV is a useful starting point to valuation.\nThe largest publicly traded BDCs\nThe largest publicly traded business development companies (BDCs)\nAccording to Closed-End Fund Advisors, there were 48 publicly traded BDCs as of July 11, 2023. While a few of them have been around for many years, the vast majority came into existence or went public 2004 and later.\nFor the most part, these remain relatively small, with an average market capitalization of $5.8 billion. The largest focus on debt, carrying an average market cap of $6.5 billion, compared to a tiny $40.6 million market cap for equity-focused BDCs.\nOf this group, here are the six largest, by total assets.\n| BDC Name | Trailing Dividend Yield | Total Assets | Market Cap |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Ares Capital Corp (NYSE:ARCC) | 8.7% | $21.8B | $10.5B |\n| Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (NYSE:BXSL) | 9.5% | $9.85B | $4.4B |\n| Blue Owl Capital Corp (NYSE:OBDC) | 9.6% | $13.7B | $5.4B |\n| FS KKR Capital Corp (NYSE:FSK) | 13.4% | $16.1B | $5.5B |\n| Main Street Capital Corp (NYSE:MAIN) | 7.6% | $4.3B | $3.25B |\n| Prospect Capital Corp (NYSE:PSEC) | 10.2% | $7.7B | $2.6B |"

      "text": "My primary financial goal is to build enough passive income streams to cover my basic living expenses. Achieving this milestone would enable me to be more financially independent. This strategy leads me to invest money each month to grow my passive income.\nInvesting in high-yielding dividend stocks is a core aspect of my strategy. I tend to buy several each month. However, if I could only buy one high-yield dividend stock this month, it would be Main Street Capital (MAIN 0.61%). Here's why it's my top passive income investment in September.\nA lucrative, growing monthly dividend\nMain Street Capital is a business development company (BDC) that provides private debt and equity capital to lower-middle-market companies ($10 million\u2013$150 million in annual revenue) and debt capital to middle-market companies (over $150 million in revenue). These investments generate recurring income.\nThe BDC distributes a portion of its income to investors each month through dividend payments. Main Street Capital sets its monthly dividend at a level it can sustain during more turbulent market conditions (currently 1.4 times its distributable net investment income). That enables it to provide investors with a recurring income stream they can count on each month.\nMain Street Capital has never reduced or suspended its dividend payment since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2007. This bankability is a desirable feature for those seeking a durable passive income stream.\nMain Street Capital currently pays $0.255 per share each month ($3.06 annually). That gives the BDC a 4.6% dividend yield, nearly four times higher than the S&P 500's (^GSPC -0.64%) 1.2% yield.\nThe BDC routinely increases its monthly dividend, aiming to grow it at a sustainable rate. Since its IPO, Main Street Capital has increased its payout by 132%, including by 4.1% over the past 12 months. This steadily rising payout provides its investors with a growing stream of passive income.\nA bonus income stream\nAs a BDC, Main Street Capital must distribute 90% of its taxable net income to investors via dividends to remain compliant with IRS regulations. The company does this through a unique dividend policy. It pays the aforementioned conservative monthly dividend. Additionally, Main Street Capital periodically pays quarterly supplemental dividends from its excess income.\nIt recently declared a $0.30 per-share supplemental dividend payment that it will pay in September. The company has paid quarterly supplemental dividends at that rate for the past two years. This additional payment has pushed Main Street Capital's annualized dividend yield up to around 6.5%, even further above the S&P 500's level.\nThe company has historically paid supplemental dividends during healthy market conditions and pauses these payments during more challenging periods to preserve its financial flexibility. I see this additional dividend payment as a nice bonus income stream.\nAdditional upside potential\nAnother bonus Main Street Capital provides its investors is the potential for meaningful value growth. Most BDCs focus on making debt investments. While that provides them with a lucrative income stream to pay dividends, it caps their upside potential.\nMain Street Capital, on the other hand, aims to be a one-stop capital solutions provider by offering its clients debt and equity capital. Those equity investments (30% of its lower-middle-market portfolio, and 5% of its middle-market investments) supply it with dividend income and upside potential as the value of its private equity investments increases.\nThese equity investments have enabled Main Street Capital to meaningfully grow its net asset value per share (151% since its IPO). That has provided investors with an additional return above the dividend income. Main Street can periodically harvest gains by selling its equity investments, which it can use to make additional investments. These investments have enabled the company to steadily increase its dividend payments.\nSteadily rising income and a lot more\nMain Street Capital is an ideal investment for my passive income strategy. It provides a very bankable monthly income stream that steadily rises. Additionally, it routinely pays a supplemental dividend, supplying even more passive income. To top it all off, the company's equity investments have helped steadily grow the value of its shares, providing additional upside potential beyond the lucrative income.\nThis combination of income and upside potential is why Main Street Capital is the high-yield dividend stock I'd buy if I could only purchase one this September."

      "text": "Money for nothing \u2014 what could be better? That's the optimistic promise of passive income. Passive income is money you earn with minimal regular effort.\nWhile most passive income sources will require some investment in time or money up front, that hurdle can be worth it. Once you get your passive income stream rolling, you have a source of cash that's not tied to your boss or your timecard. It could even grow into a business that allows you to quit the daily grind and achieve financial independence.\nHere's a closer look at 11 smart passive income ideas divided into four categories: easy, most profitable, online, and low-investment ideas for students.\nEasy ideas\nEasy passive income ideas\n1. Dividend investing\nAs a dividend investor, you purchase stocks that share earnings with shareholders by way of dividend payments.\nDividend investing is a top passive income idea because it's low effort. You'll do some research up front to pick your stocks and then monitor them over time. That's it \u2014 no hustling or sales involved. Your dividends are deposited to your brokerage account automatically.\nDownsides and risk. Dividend yields for quality stocks are modest, about 2% of the stock price. You can find stocks that pay higher yields, but those usually come with more risk. Also, dividends are not guaranteed. The company can cancel or lower the payment at any time, or the stock price could drop and reduce the value of your investment.\nGetting started. Open a brokerage account and start researching how to invest in dividend-paying companies. Learn some metrics, such as the dividend payout ratio, to help you assess the company's ability to keep paying its dividend.\n2. REITs\nREITs, or real estate investment trusts, are companies that buy and rent commercial properties. Like stocks, many REITs are publicly traded. Also like stocks, REITs don't require much effort besides research and monitoring. And, because the IRS requires REITs to pay out 90% of their taxable income to shareholders, they can yield more than dividend stocks.\nDownsides and risk. REIT earnings are taxed as ordinary income, which is higher than the long-term capital gains rates used for most dividend income. Also, REITs fluctuate in value and profitability \u2014 meaning you could lose money on your investment.\nGetting started. Open a brokerage account and start researching REIT funds. REIT funds invest in a diversified collection of REITs, which is less risky than owning a single REIT.\n3. Bond investing\nBonds are loans to corporations or government entities that are sliced up into units and sold to investors. When you invest in a bond, you put up funds and the borrower repays those funds with interest over time.\nDownsides and risk. The borrower could go out of business or stop repaying the loan. Market interest rates could rise so that your bond's rate is less than what you could earn elsewhere.\nGetting started. The simplest way to get into bond investing is to buy a bond exchange-traded fund (ETF) from your brokerage account. A bond ETF provides exposure to corporate or government bonds of varying maturities, which is safer than funding just one bond or one type of bond.\nMost profitable ideas\nMost profitable passive income ideas\n4. Rental property\nRental property investors buy homes, usually with a loan, and then rent those homes to long-term tenants. The trick is to make sure the rents you collect cover the mortgage payment, property taxes, maintenance costs, and any other expenses \u2014 while leaving a nice chunk of profit for you. Ideally, you'll profit on the rents, plus your property should appreciate over time.\nDownsides and risk. You can fall behind on the mortgage if your tenants don't pay their rent or the home is vacant. You may incur large maintenance expenses if tenants damage your property.\nGetting started. You need good credit and a cash down payment to get started as a property investor. Review housing prices and home rentals near you. Identify investable neighborhoods and start estimating how much capital you'll need.\n5. Vacation rentals\nRenting your existing home or an investment property to travelers is another passive income option. For properties in popular neighborhoods, vacation rentals command higher nightly rates than residential rentals. They are also a lower commitment. You can customize the property's availability schedule however you want, and most of your visitors will only stay for a few days.\nDownsides and risk. If you are renting an unused room in your existing home, the risks are low. Your renters might be loud or messy, or your room may not generate the rents you expected. Renting an investment property is a different story. As with a long-term rental, you risk default if the property doesn't generate enough income to pay the mortgage plus the other expenses.\nGetting started. Check your homeowner's insurance to see if you need more coverage for short-term rentals. Review properties like yours on vacation rental marketplaces, including Airbnb, HomeToGo, and FlipKey. Then fix up your place, take some pretty photos, and list it.\nOnline ideas\nOnline passive income ideas\n6. Affiliate marketing\nAs an affiliate marketer, you earn commissions for referring people to products and services online. Your referrals are tracked by way of links you publish on your website or social media posts. When someone clicks on your link and buys something, the transaction is credited to you.\nDownsides and risk. Affiliate commissions can often be low, usually 1% to 5% of the sale amount. You may not generate enough transactions to produce a solid revenue stream.\nGetting started. Most affiliate marketers use a website to promote products, but you could also use Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest. Make sure you understand the FTC's disclosure requirements for affiliate marketers. Then join affiliate programs for products you'd like to represent and start promoting.\n7. Dropshipping\nDropshipping is another way to sell products online and without having a warehouse full of inventory. You'd have an online store, either on your own website or on Amazon. Your product catalog would be items you can purchase from wholesalers. When someone places an order, you collect the funds and then order the item directly from the wholesaler at a lower price. The wholesaler ships the product straight to your customer.\nDownsides and risk. As with affiliate marketing, the biggest challenge with dropshipping is generating traffic and sales. A secondary risk is fraudulent transactions. If you fund the purchase with the wholesaler and the customer's payment subsequently fails, you're on the hook.\nGetting started. Find wholesalers that dropship products you can promote. Then set up those products in an online store and start driving traffic to it.\n8. Membership website\nA membership website charges members a monthly fee for access to exclusive content. If you have specialized knowledge, you could build a website to share that knowledge through articles, videos, and other tools. Membership websites also allow members who share an interest in the site's subject matter to connect and interact.\nDownsides and risk. You could spend many hours building a website and developing your exclusive content and then have trouble securing new members. If your content isn't better than what's available online for free, your members will cancel their memberships.\nGetting started. Join a membership site or two to see how they work. Define how your site will be different and ask friends and family for feedback on your idea. Once you've set your direction, start creating content.\n9. Peer-to-peer lending\nIf you have cash on hand, you can make small loans at high interest rates via peer-to-peer lending platforms such as Prosper, LendingClub, and Funding Circle. These are fixed-rate, fixed-payment loans with no collateral. The platform manages the money transfer and repayments, and you are responsible for choosing borrowers and funding the loans. Prosper reports that its loans average a 5.5% annual return.\nDownsides and risk. The risk of default can be high, and you have no collateral to collect if the borrower stops paying. You can mitigate the risk somewhat by diversifying your funds across many small loans.\nGetting started. Review how the different platforms work, including minimum loan amounts and tools available to manage your funds. Choose a platform and start making small loans to test the experience. You can invest more as you gain confidence.\nLow-investment ideas for students\nLow-investment passive income ideas for students\nIf you are a student, you may not have the budget or the time to set up an online store or buy investment property. What you can do, though, is leverage your online network of friends. Here are two passive income ideas \u2014 no cash outlay required \u2014 that use your circle of influence to make money.\n10. Cashback apps\nCashback apps pay rebates when you shop. To earn, you may need to upload receipts or use the app to pay at the retailer. You won't make big money on your own shopping, but you can generate passive income for referring your friends to the app. GetUpside, for example, pays you a commission every time one of your referrals earns cashback.\nDownsides and risk. Most cashback apps have minimum payment thresholds of $5 or $10. If you give up on the app before you reach the threshold, you won't collect your funds.\nGetting started. Download apps such as Ibotta, Fetch, and GetUpside and learn how they work. Pick one app to start using regularly and start sharing your referral link with friends.\n11. Social media brand ambassador\nAs a social media brand ambassador, you earn free products and cash payments for promoting brands in your social media posts. You can connect with brands through influencer platforms such as Activate and BrandBacker.\nDownsides and risk. To make money as an influencer, you need a strong and engaged follower community. You could lose some of that engagement if your feed becomes too promotional. Avoid any brands that require their influencers to buy products.\nGetting started. Join influencer platforms and compare your social metrics to other influencers. Review and apply for brand opportunities that interest you.\nRelated Investing Topics\nMaking passive income work for you\nThe profit potential of a passive income idea often correlates to the size of the up-front investment in time or money. Dividend stocks, for example, can generate tens of thousands in income over time \u2014 but they demand a larger cash outlay to start. On the other hand, cashback apps have lower upside potential but don't require much to get started.\nIf the strategy you can afford today has less potential than you'd like, you could use one passive income stream to fund another. For example, you could take your cashback app earnings and invest them in dividend stocks. That's a long-term play, but it's also a smart move financially. Down the road, you can look at your portfolio and feel good about how you funded it."
