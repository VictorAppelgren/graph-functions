      "summary": "Fed officials note that core inflation remains sticky, especially in non‑housing services, and that progress toward the 2% target has stalled. The Fed may consider a modest 25‑basis‑point cut in September as an insurance move, but the dual mandate and uncertain labor market weaken the case for a clear rate path. Political pressure on the Fed, exemplified by lawsuits against governors, adds a risk of policy loss and potential inflationary fallout, though markets have not yet reacted strongly.",
