      "summary": "Validea’s P/E/Growth Investor model, based on Peter Lynch’s PEG concept, rates Becton Dickinson & Co (BDX) at 54%, indicating moderate attractiveness but below the 80% threshold for strong interest. The strategy seeks stocks trading at a reasonable price relative to earnings growth and strong balance sheets, and BDX’s fundamentals meet many of these criteria. Validea’s model has delivered an average annual return of 12.9% since 2003, outperforming the S&P 500’s 8.8% over the same period. The report includes extensive performance history, risk metrics, and a detailed explanation of Lynch’s investment philosophy and Validea’s methodology, with repeated disclaimer that model returns are hypothetical and not guaranteed.",
