  "description": "Dyson is holding a Labor Day sale right now and the deals include the 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for just $500. That's half off.",

Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nLabor Day sales might have just what you're looking for in the home cleaning department. Dyson is having a big sale for the holiday that discounts vacuums, hair care devices and more by up to $500. One of the best discounts is on the 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum, which is 50 percent off and down to $500. That's a seriously great deal and the lowest price we've seen for this product.\n\nThe Vis Nav made our list of the best robot vacuums, primarily based on the unit's superior suction power. This thing can pull up dirt like a beast. We said it had the strongest suction power of any robovac we've tested and easily took out pet fur from a carpeted floor. We also noted in our official review that the power here was on par with Dyson's stick vacuums.\n\nThe unit includes a stellar obstacle avoidance system, with cameras and LED lights to help the vacuum navigate around furniture. During our testing we found it to be nearly flawless, as it only crashed into a chair leg a couple of times. Also, we never received any alerts that the robot got stuck somewhere while working.\n\nThe bin here is on the larger side, but there's no self-emptying base. This is also not a hybrid unit. It's a vacuum and not a mop. This made it tough to recommend the unit at $1,000, despite the fantastic suction, but $500 makes it a whole lot easier.\n\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is also down to $800 as part of this sale, which is a discount of $200. This cordless stick vacuum features a HEPA filtration system and advanced wet-cleaning capabilities. It's a great tool for cleaning both carpets and hard floors.\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.",

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nDyson 360 Vis Nav review: Superior suction at a steep price\nPerfecting the basics comes at the expense of advanced features and affordability.\nDyson helped pioneer the cordless vacuum space, and now it\u2019s testing the waters of the robot vacuum arena. The Dyson 360 Vis Nav has been available in other parts of the world for a little while, but it recently came stateside to the tune of $1,200. The company claims a 360-degree vision system, complete with cameras and LED lights, along with suction power akin to that of its stick vacuums sets the 360 Vis Nav apart from competitors. But even if that\u2019s true, Dyson is undeniably late to the party. Robot vacuums have gotten a lot better in the past three to five years, and there are dozens on the market \u2014 including some that offer much more in the way of features for a similarly exorbitant price. That said, did Dyson pull an Apple and shake up a product category despite its late entry to the stage? I spent some time with the 360 Vis Nav to find out.\nSetup and design\nUnboxing and setting up the 360 Vis Nav is similar to any other robot vacuum. In addition to the device, the box contains a charging cable and the vacuum\u2019s base, a rectangular, purple unit with two black-and-white checkered spots at either corner. While it\u2019s refreshing to see a gadget that doesn\u2019t wear the typical black or gray uniform, the 360 Vis Nav and its dock stick out like sore thumbs among the other items and furniture in my home. There\u2019s no semblance of \u201cblending into the decor\u201d with this robo-vac.\nDyson\u2019s first robot vacuum may be late on the scene, but it impresses with excellent suction power and remarkable obstacle avoidance. However, its $1,200 will be prohibitively expensive for some.\n- Excellent suction power\n- Impressive obstacle avoidance thanks to 360-degree vision system\n- D-shaped design cleans room corners better\n- On-device display provides handy setup and cleaning instructions\n- Super expensive\n- No self-emptying base\n- No mopping capabilities\nOnce docked for the first time, the Dyson 360 Vis Nav\u2019s small onboard display prompts you to choose a preferred language and get connected via the mobile app. The screen doubles as a button, too, so you can press fully down on it to select options and move forward in the setup process. As I learned while using the machine, the display also shows helpful maintenance tips and accompanying graphics when you need to clean the robot\u2019s sensors. The My Dyson app (on iOS and Android) provides all of the same information and more, and will guide you to connect the machine to your home\u2019s Wi-Fi network, update the firmware if necessary and finish the prerequisites before you get to cleaning. Aside from waiting a few minutes for my review unit to update its firmware, the entire process took me only about 15 minutes.\nTo get the lay of the land, let\u2019s revisit the few things Dyson claims set the 360 Vis Nav apart from other robot vacuums. The D-shaped design isn\u2019t one of them, but it certainly helps the machine\u2019s side-edge actuator when cleaning room corners. Dyson claims the actuator only opens up when cleaning corners like this, and it uses suction (rather than sweepers like other robo-vacs do) to capture debris from these hard-to-reach places. Along with that, the machine has a 360-degree vision system that helps it map our your home and clean around furniture and other objects, plus a sensor that detects the amount of dust present so it can kick up the suction when necessary and create a heat map of the dirtiest parts of your home. Those are the main differentiators, along with the claim that the 360 Vis Nav essentially has a similar level of suction power as one of Dyson\u2019s cordless stick vacuums.\nPerformance\nSo how did all of that come together in practice? Pretty well, as it turns out. For the initial go-around, I had the Dyson 360 Vis Nav clean the main floor of my home, rather than map it out first. I did this mainly because I like chaos, but also because I wanted to see how the machine would navigate around coffee tables, couches and other furniture, plus small things like cat toys left in its path. Dyson states very clearly in the setup process that you should remove all small obstacles out of the way of the 360 Vis Nav before it cleans \u2014 I picked up a couple of reusable bags languishing from our last grocery run and the smaller cat toys, but I left some charging cables snaking on the ground because, let\u2019s be real, most people aren\u2019t going to clean before sending the robot they bought to clean for them out to do its job.\nI was quickly struck by how many times the Dyson 360 Vis Nav came to a complete stop, \u201clooked\u201d around and kept moving during the first cleaning. It did a decent job avoiding large pieces of furniture like chairs and couches because \u2014 when it did get close to pieces like that \u2014 it seemed to sense it a few inches before hitting it, so it could then stop and redirect itself. It was most confused by a coffee table with a supporting beam that runs on the floor in between two legs. The 360 Vis Nav has adjustable wheels that allow it to \u201cclimb\u201d on top of things like thicker rugs when it\u2019s cleaning, and I think it confused this roughly 0.5-inch supporting beam for a piece of decor. The robo-vac tried so hard to climb over it; it was borderline concerning, but I was rooting for it the whole way. It actually did manage to climb over the beam, get back down onto the floor and keep cleaning, so kudos to the little guy for never giving up.\nAfter that thrilling show, I left the 360 Vis Nav to its own devices. It proceeded to clean the main floor of my home for almost an hour, audibly notching up the suction when it detected a messier area. Notably, it seemed better at avoiding furniture than other robot vacuum cleaners I\u2019ved tried. Yes, it did knock into a few things, but the number of times that happened was slim to none. The first run I did was in Auto mode, the default cleaning setting and one of four you have to choose from, and while the machine was a tad loud, it\u2019s nothing that will drive pets or young children from a room. It\u2019s loudest when the machine automatically kicks the motor into high gear upon detecting a high-dust area, which it did a few times in the highest trafficked areas of my kitchen and on top of a few area rugs. Like any other robot vacuum worth its salt, the 360 Vis Nav automatically returned to its dock to recharge when the battery got low.\nI deemed that first cleaning job a success, and the case was the same when I did the first mapping run. The 360 Vis Nav is much quieter when it\u2019s puttering around your home not sucking up dirt, but rather just using its vision system to create a map of your home and all its furniture and obstacles. The map it created of my main floor was accurate, and the Dyson app makes it simple to add boundaries and create rooms that you can label. Once you do this, you can create no-go zones and other restrictions like cleaning without the brush bar. And like most other vacuums with smart mapping, you can tell the 360 Vis Nav to only clean certain rooms with each job if you please.\nLike most other robot vacuums, the companion app experience focuses on home maps, schedules and basic on-off controls. Dyson lets you choose from Auto, Quick, Quiet and Boost cleaning modes before you start a job, and if you have rooms designated on your map, you can customize cleaning modes for each room every time. For example, I could tell the machine to clean my kitchen in Auto mode and then the den in Quiet mode. The app presents a heat map of your home after every job that highlights the areas with the most dust, which is interesting to look at but didn\u2019t provide me with a ton of groundbreaking information. I was not surprised that the dirtiest spots on my main floor were almost always next to the front door and my deck door.\nUltimately, the two things that impressed me the most about the Dyson 360 Vis Nav were its suction power and its obstacle avoidance capabilities. I live in a one-cat household, but if you saw how much cat hair my cordless stick vacuum sucks up every time I use it, you\u2019d think I live with a few more felines. There\u2019s always more fur in the bin after I clean the upper floor of my home, since it\u2019s carpeted. After leaving the 360 Vis Nav on my upper floor to clean for almost an hour, I was surprised to see that the contents of its bin looked nearly identical to that of my cordless stick vac after cleaning up there. Even the best robot vacuum cleaners I\u2019ve used in the past never sucked up this much pet fur in one go-around on carpeted floors \u2014 it\u2019s impressive.\nAs for obstacle avoidance, I didn\u2019t expect much from the 360 Vis Nav in this department because the instructions tell you, more than once, to clear your floors of any obstructions before cleaning. Most of the time, I had at least a few pairs of shoes, a couple of charging cables and other small objects on the floor while the machine was cleaning, but I never once got an alert that it was stuck. Some robot vacuums I\u2019ve tested have sent me close to a half dozen alerts during a cleaning job, and I\u2019d have to remove an object they were choking on before they could start up again. That never happened with Dyson\u2019s machine.\nThe competition\nWith the Dyson 360 Vis Nav coming in at an eye-watering $1,200, the competition squarely within that price range is pretty slim. The $1,400 iRobot Roomba Combo j9+ is arguably its most direct competitor and it offers quite a bit more for that extra $200. (We\u2019ve seen the Combo j9+ drop to as low as $1,000 in the past, so you might be able to pick it up for even less than Dyon\u2019s machine.) As a \u201ccombo\u201d device, the j9+ vacuums and mops without the help of a human (mostly) and it\u2019s smart enough to know when it needs to switch from sucking up dirt to mopping floors using its built-in scrubbing pad and water reservoir. It also comes with a self-emptying base that can hold up to 60 days worth of dry debris and refill the water reservoir with clean supply. While auto-mopping is more of a nice-to-have than a requirement on a robot vacuum, it\u2019s painful that Dyon\u2019s $1,000+ machine doesn\u2019t come with a clean base \u2014 a piece of hardware included in some models half of its price.\nWrap-up\nWhen you understand the lay of the robot-vacuum landscape, the Dyson 360 Vis Nav seems almost quaint \u2014 and a bit confusing. Robot vacuums aren\u2019t new, they\u2019ve been around for a long time \u2014 long enough where you can get a pretty decent one for less than $300. For Dyson\u2019s machine, spending $1,200 gets you a damn good robot vacuum with possibly the best suction power I\u2019ve experienced on one, impressive obstacle avoidance, good home mapping and a clean app experience. But none of those features are unique to the 360 Vis Nav. Its suction power and obstacle avoidance may be superior, but is that enough to justify the cost? If you\u2019re already willing to spend $1,000 or more on a robot vacuum, you have other options that will give you similar features and more, including mopping and self-emptying capabilities. That said, there are two groups of people who I\u2019d recommend the 360 Vis Nav to: those who are willing to give up advanced features in exchange for the most suction power possible (and have cash to burn), and Dyson diehards."

If vacuuming comes to mind for you, consider a robot vacuum cleaner. These smart home gadgets have come a long way in recent years. Previously, you\u2019d shell out hundreds for basic dirt-sucking capabilities. Now, robot vacuums have gotten so advanced that even affordable machines have good suction power, and maybe even a handful of extra features like home mapping and mopping capabilities. Prices for models with self-emptying bases and mopping capabilities are also falling.\nThat\u2019s all to say that the robot vacuum space has gotten much more crowded recently. While that means you have many good options to choose from, making sense of the market gets tougher and tougher each year. Engadget has tested dozens of robot vacuums over the years and we continue to try out the latest models as they become available. Below, we\u2019ve collected our top picks for the best robot vacuums you can get right now.\nTable of contents\nBest robot vacuums 2025\nWi-Fi connectivity: Yes | Floor type: All floor types | Features: Obstacle avoidance, home mapping, LiDAR navigation | Assistant support: Alexa/Google Assistant | Mopping capabilities: No | Self-empty: Yes | Good for pet hair: Yes\nShark\u2019s AI robot vacuum \u2014 of which there are many models with small differences between them \u2014 ticks all of the boxes that a mid-range machine should. It offers reliable cleaning performance, its mobile app is easy to use and it produces accurate home maps. On top of that, its auto-empty base is bagless, which means you won\u2019t have to spend money on extra bags every few months.\nSetting up the Shark is as simple as taking it and its base out of the box, plugging the base in and downloading the companion mobile app to finish things up. The machine connects to Wi-Fi, allowing you to control it via the app when you\u2019re not at home, or using Google Assistant and Alexa voice control. The first journey the Shark makes is an \u201cExplore Run,\u201d during which it produces a map of your home that you can then edit from the mobile app.\nThe Shark produced a pretty accurate floorplan of my home, and I was happy to see a \u201cre-explore\u201d option that I could use if the map wasn\u2019t up to my standards. With a completed map, you\u2019re then asked to label rooms in your home. That way, you can send the Shark to only the bedroom for more direct cleaning jobs, select \u201cno-go\u201d zones and more.\nThe first few times I ran the Shark robot, I had it clean my whole home. It boasts a respectable run time of up to 120 minutes, which will be handy for bigger homes. I was impressed by how quiet it was \u2013 or rather, how much quieter it was compared to other robo-vacs I\u2019ve tried. You\u2019ll have to turn up the volume on your TV if it\u2019s cleaning in the same room, but it\u2019ll be hard to hear when it\u2019s sucking up debris down the hallway.\nIt also did a decent job maneuvering its way around the cat toys I left out on the floor. The device\u2019s object detection feature claims it can avoid things as small as four inches, but I found that it was much better at sensing and moving around the three-foot-long cat tunnel on my floor than the many tiny mouse toys.\nBut even if Mr. Mouse caught the edge of the Shark\u2019s wheels now and then, the robo-vac took it all in stride. One thing I look for when testing robot vacuums is how much attention they need from me during cleanings. The best ones are hands-free and require no extra attention at all \u2013 once they start a job, they\u2019re smart enough to putter around your home, move around objects and return to their base when they\u2019re finished. With Shark\u2019s robo-vac, I never had to tend to it when it was cleaning.\nNow, I did my due diligence and picked up pieces of clothing and charging cables off the ground before running the Shark (ditto for every other robot vacuum I tested), so those things were never in the way. Most companion apps will actually remind you to do this before starting a cleaning job.\nThis Shark machine comes with an auto-empty station, so it will dump out the contents of its dustbin after every cleaning run \u2013 and also during a job if its bin gets full before it\u2019s done. In the latter situation, the Shark will go back to cleaning automatically after it\u2019s freed up its bin. That\u2019s a great feature, but I found the best thing about the base to be its bagless design. Shark\u2019s device is unlike most other robot vacuum clean bases because you don\u2019t have to keep buying proprietary garbage bags to outfit the interior of the base. When you want to empty the base, part of it snaps off and opens to eject debris, and it easily locks back in place when you return it. Not only is this convenient, but it also brings the lifetime cost of ownership down since you won\u2019t be buying special bags every few months.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Shark has a couple of models that are similar to this one that just have a different color scheme, a 30- versus 60-day self-cleaning base capacity and other minor differences. The biggest feature that would impact how you use the machine is the clean base capacity: we recommend springing for the 60-day models if you want to interact as little as possible with your robo-vac.\n- Strong suction\n- Included bagless self-emptying base\n- Easy to use mobile app\n- Loud while cleaning\nWi-Fi connectivity: Yes | Floor type: All floor types | Features: Obstacle avoidance, home mapping | Assistant support: Alexa/Google Assistant | Mopping capabilities: Yes | Self-empty: Yes | Good for pet hair: Yes\nRead our full Roomba Combo j9+ reivew\nThe Roomba Combo j9+ has everything we want in a combination robotic vacuum and mop. It offers incredibly powerful suction, deep floor scrubbing and a slew of smarts to avoid obstacles (including cat and dog poop!). It\u2019s a better vacuum than its predecessor, the Roomba Combo j7+, and it also features a new Clean Base that can automatically refill its liquid tank. More than any Roomba before it, the Combo j9+ can make your floors sparkly clean with very little intervention on your part.\nWhile it\u2019s expensive, the Roomba Combo j9+ certainly beats paying for a professional cleaning service. It\u2019s also an excellent accessory for busy parents who just want to keep their floors looking tidy. It\u2019s one of the best robotic vacuums and mops for pet owners, especially for its ability to avoid pet waste. In fact, if the j9+ ends up making a poopy mess due to cat or dog droppings, iRobot will send you a replacement unit for free. (That offer only works for the first year, and it only applies to solid waste from cats and dogs, but it\u2019s still a helpful guarantee for pet owners afraid of the havoc that a robo-vac might wreak.)\nThe Roomba Combo j9+ features home mapping and can accurately map your home far faster than any previous Roomba, and you can also use the iRobot app to specify room borders. You can also create cleaning routines and label objects to help it clean exactly where you\u2019d like. The j9+ works with smart assistants from Amazon and Google as well, so you can just shout out cleaning requests to your smart speaker. While it\u2019s not a completely magical cleaning robot \u2013 you\u2019ll still need to clear up your floors to help it run well \u2013 it\u2019s certainly the closest we\u2019ve seen yet to the ideal robotic vacuum and mop for whole-home deep cleaning. \u2014 Devindra Hardawar, Senior Reporter\n- Excellent vacuuming performance\n- Mops on its own\n- Great obstacle (and poop) detection\n- Clean base is well designed\n- Solid battery life\n- Expensive\n- Mopping pad isn't great for sticky messes\nWi-Fi connectivity: Yes | Floor type: All floor types | Features: Auto mopping, obstacle avoidance, home mapping, self-emptying and self-refilling base | Assistant support: Alexa/Google Assistant | Mopping capabilities: Yes | Self-empty: Yes | Good for pet hair: Yes\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Shark to make stiff competition for iRobot\u2019s Roomba Combo j9+. The PowerDetect 2-in-1 robot vacuum and mop works slightly differently to vacuum and wash your floors, but the outcome is quite similar. Instead of lowering a mop pad when scooting over hard flooring, Shark\u2019s machine has a mop pad that lives on its underside and will deploy it when cleaning tile, wood and other similar floors. You as the user, during the initial setup process, will indicate in your home map where you have hard floors and when you have carpet. In that sense, it\u2019s not as automated as iRobot\u2019s device, but it\u2019s just one additional step that you should only have to do one time.\nWhen I tested the PowerDetect, I found that it had a very easy setup process (just like all of the other Shark robot vacuums I\u2019ve tried) and it took very little time to putter around the main floor of my house to get an initial home map reading. After that, you can choose if you want the machine to vacuum, mop or do both, in which case it will first vacuum the floors and then mop those freshly cleaned surfaces.\nAside from the fact that it took the robo-vac a long time to fill up its tank before mopping (a minute or two longer than I expected), it did a nice job cleaning my mix of hardwood and tile floors. I also never had to untangle it from a messy situation, be it rogue charging cables on the floor or a steep lip on the legs of my coffee table. While I spent most of my time manually dictating cleaning jobs for the PowerDetect, you can set regular cleaning schedules using the modes you prefer, or tell the machine to only clean certain rooms at specific times.\nShark didn\u2019t pull the NeverTouch Pro Base\u2019s name out of thin air, either. After initial setup, you really don\u2019t have to touch the base until you need to empty or refill it in some way \u2014 empty its debris container or refill its reservoir with water and cleaning solution. Shark claims the base can hold up to 60 days worth of vacuumed debris, which is pretty standard for a machine like this, and it can hold 30 days worth of liquid refill. That means you should be able to run the PowerDetect for at least a month before you have to interact with its base \u2014 great for those who hate floor chores, or just don\u2019t have the time to baby a new gadget in their home.\n- Good suction and mopping capabilities\n- Auto-empty and auto-refilling base for vacuum and mopping, respectively\n- Expensive\nWi-Fi connectivity: Yes | Floor type: All floor types | Features: Obstacle avoidance, home mapping | Assistant support: Alexa/Google Assistant | Mopping capabilities: No | Self-empty: No | Good for pet hair: Yes\nDyson may have been late to the robo-vac party, but it made a remarkable machine with the 360 Vis Nav. Let\u2019s get this out of the way at the top: this is a $1,000 robot vacuum cleaner that doesn\u2019t have mopping abilities or a self-emptying base. Those factors alone make it less versatile (and more cost prohibitive) than our other top picks, but two of its features make it worth a shout here: its suction power and obstacle avoidance capabilities.\nThe Dyson 360 Vis Nav has the strongest suction power of any robot vacuum I\u2019ve tested; it\u2019s certainly the closest you\u2019ll get to using one of the company\u2019s cordless stick vacs. It sucked up an impressive amount of pet hair from my carpeted floors, and I didn\u2019t even get a \u201cbin full\u201d alert after the fact. Dog hair can be really tricky to pull up from carpets, but it appears this hands-free cleaning machine can handle it all.\nObstacle avoidance is impressive as well, thanks in part to the machine\u2019s 360-degree vision system that uses a camera and LED lights to navigate around things like furniture, and map out your home. No robo-vac I\u2019ve used has been able to fully avoid crashing into a chair leg now and again, and the 360 Vis Nav is no exception \u2014 but it did so only a couple of times. More importantly, I never got an alert that the robot was stuck or got tangled up with a rogue charging cord and needed human assistance to get it back on track.\nIn many ways, the Dyson 360 Vis NAv distills a robot vacuum down to its essence: it\u2019s really good at sucking up dirt and debris on its own, with little to no interaction with humans needed (after initial setup, of course). Some people will be willing to spend a pretty penny on that \u2014 but in a saturated market like that of robot vacuums, you can get a lot more for your money.\nA self-emptying base and mopping capabilities are all but standard on most robot vacuums priced at $700 or more (and you can increasingly find one, or both of those features on cheaper machines). Personally, I think it\u2019s particularly painful to pay $1,000 and not get a self-emptying base, at minimum. But if you\u2019re willing to spend more on a machine that gets the basics almost perfect, the Dyson 360 Vis Nav is the machine to get.\nWi-Fi connectivity: Yes | Floor type: All floor types | Features: Obstacle avoidance | Assistant support: Alexa/Google Assistant | Mopping capabilities: No | Self-empty: No | Good for pet hair: Yes\nThe iRobot Roomba Vac Robot Vacuum is a good affordable option for most people thanks to its good cleaning power and easy-to-use mobile app. We won\u2019t get too deep into it here since we have a whole guide to cheap robot vacuums with additional recommendations. But suffice to say, the Roomba Vac gives you all the essentials you\u2019d expect from a robot vacuum, along with all of the convenience that comes with iRobot\u2019s mobile app.\n- Simple yet attractive design\n- Good suction power for its size\n- Easy to use mobile app\n- Cannot fit under low furniture\nWi-Fi connectivity: Yes | Floor type: All floor types | Features: Obstacle avoidance, home mapping, stick and hand vac accessories (included) | Assistant support: Alexa/Google Assistant | Mopping capabilities: No | Self-empty: Yes | Good for pet hair: Yes\nRead our full Anker Eufy E20 review\nAnker\u2019s Eufy home brand made a first-of-its-kind machine with the E20 robot vacuum that, surprisingly, doesn\u2019t succumb to too many of the pitfalls that a first-gen device typically does. The E20 comes as a robot vacuum with a self-emptying base, and also included in the box are the attachments to turn it into a cordless stick vacuum and a handheld vac. Just pop out the cleaning module from the robovac, snap in your attachments and get all of the conveniences of a cordless vacuum without spending (potentially) double to buy a second device.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the E20 excels as a robot vacuum. Eufy has made a number of solid robovacs over the years, and the E20 is no exception, dutifully sucking up dirt, debris and pet hair as it putters around your home. In my testing, it rarely got stuck on household objects like door mats and it has good obstacle avoidance. I also appreciate that it\u2019s smart enough to know when its built-in dustbin is getting full, and it will return to its base to empty it periodically as it cleans.\nAs a cordless stick vacuum, it\u2019s just ok. You\u2019ll need to keep it on the highest suction mode to get the deepest clean and the build quality feels a little cheap. But its small profile will make it easy for anyone to use (and to take it out to your car for a quick clean up) and it doesn\u2019t choke at the first sign of pet hair. A device like this could be exactly what some have been hoping for: a solid robot vacuum that can clean for you most of the time, but also lets you manually clean hard-to-reach spots when necessary.\n- Quickly turns into a cordless stick vacuum and a handheld vacuum\n- Strong performance as a robot vacuum\n- Self-emptying base holds a lot for its compact size\n- Improved Eufy Clean app\n- Good price for a 3-in-1 machine\n- Most stick vac cleaning modes have weak suction\n- Stick vac build quality is lackluster\n- Wall mount costs extra\nWhat to look for in the best robot vacuums\nFloor type\nWe recommend thinking first about the floors in your home: Do you have carpet throughout, or tile and hardwood floors, or a mix? Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job picking up dirt on carpets as they can get into the nooks and crannies more easily. Some machines have \u201cmax\u201d modes as well, which ups suction power but also typically eats battery life faster than the \u201cnormal\u201d floor cleaning mode.\nVacuum suction\nSuction power is an important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a standard power scale that all robo-vacs adhere to, so it\u2019s difficult to compare among a bunch of devices. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger the vacuum cleaner will be. But other companies don\u2019t rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots. If you\u2019re looking for the best vacuum for your needs, it\u2019s helpful to pay attention to real-world testing and how well the vac can pick up fine dust, crumbs and pet hair in an environment similar to that of your home.\nWi-Fi connectivity\nAs we explained in our budget guide, Wi-Fi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren\u2019t Wi-Fi connected, though, so it\u2019s best to double check before you buy cheap. Wi-Fi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone.\nMapping features and object detection\nPast a certain price threshold, you\u2019ll find advanced perks like home mapping features, improved object detection and automatic dustbin disposal. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home\u2019s layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or avoid no-go zones where you don\u2019t want it to roam.\nMost robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children\u2019s toys. High-end models even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine.\nSelf-empty station\nFinally, for peak convenience, consider a self-empty robot vacuum that comes with a self-empty station. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine\u2019s docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base \u2013 that means you won\u2019t have to empty the dustbin yourself and you\u2019ll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks.\nJust keep in mind that most self-emptying bins require proprietary garbage bags \u2013 another long-term expense you\u2019ll have to factor in. Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you\u2019ll still have to clean up that yourself.\nRobot vacuums with mopping capabilities\nMopping capabilities are much more common now in robot vacuums than they were just five years ago. Machines with this feature have a water tank either built into the robot\u2019s chassis, the auto-empty bin or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part.\nFilling and emptying the reservoir remains a human\u2019s job for the most part (except on the most expensive machines), as does adding cleaning solutions if the mopping robot comes with this feature to ensure it uses clean water for every cycle.\nRobot vacuum maintenance tips\nFirst and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum\u2019s dustbin after every cleaning job. If you have a model with a self-emptying base, there\u2019s less work for you to do yourself. If not, simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning. It\u2019s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides.\nIn addition, you\u2019ll want to regularly examine the machine\u2019s brush roll to see if any hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it\u2019s a good idea to check your robot\u2019s brushes regardless \u2014 both their main brush and any smaller roller brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards.\nRobot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine\u2019s user manual or the manufacturer\u2019s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart.\nHow we test robot vacuums\nWe primarily test robot vacuums by using them as they are intended to be used: in a home, across different types of flooring and in the face of all sorts of messes including pet hair, spilt coffee grounds and other food debris, dust bunnies and more. We set up all robot vacuums according to their provided instructions and run multiple cleaning jobs during a testing period of at least one to two weeks per machine.\nIf the robot has mopping capabilities, we also test those as well on hardwood and tile flooring. For models with self-emptying bases, we rely on those built-in trash cans for all post-job cleaning, and we make sure to test the robot vacuum's mobile app for usability and convenience. As we're testing, we make note of things like how loud the robot and its components are, how much human attention the robot needs on a regular basis, how the robot handles large messes and big dust bunnies, if the robot gets stuck on rugs, doormats or other furniture and more.\nRobot vacuum FAQs\nAre robot vacuums worth it?\nWe tackled this question when we reviewed budget robot vacuums and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors \u2013 just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere.\nThat\u2019s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They\u2019re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don\u2019t have the same level of suction you\u2019ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine\u2019s attention on a specific area, which almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 mimics the spot-cleaning you\u2019d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum.\nHow long do robot vacuums last?\nRobot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you're emptying the machine's bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It's also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum's filter needs changing.\nDo robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums?\nThere's no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most.\nHow often do you have to clean a robot vacuum?\nCleaning a robot vacuum isn\u2019t too much of a chore, but you\u2019ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you\u2019re running it and how much dirt it\u2019s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won\u2019t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it\u2019s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly.\nWhat are the negatives of robot vacuums?\nRobot vacuums won\u2019t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don\u2019t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a cordless stick vacuum, so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They\u2019re also designed for floors only, so if you\u2019re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you\u2019ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you\u2019ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they\u2019re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning.\nCheck out more from our spring cleaning guide."

  "argos_summary": "Engadget reports that Dyson\u2019s 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum is on sale for $500, a steep discount from its $1,200 list price. The review highlights its strong suction power\u2014comparable to Dyson\u2019s stick vacuums\u2014and impressive obstacle\u2011avoidance thanks to a 360\u2011degree vision system, but notes the lack of a self\u2011emptying base and mopping capability. The article compares the Vis Nav to competitors like the iRobot Roomba Combo j9+ and Shark AI, noting that while the Vis Nav excels at pet\u2011hair pickup, its higher price and missing features make it less attractive in a crowded market. The sale coincides with broader Labor Day tech deals, including discounts on Apple, Sony, and other consumer electronics.",
