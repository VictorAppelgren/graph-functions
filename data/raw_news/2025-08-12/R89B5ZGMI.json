  "description": "NY Post readers discuss The Post\u2019s editorial urging President Trump to endorse Mayor Adams for re-election.",
  "content": "The Issue: The Post\u2019s editorial urging President Trump to endorse Mayor Adams for re-election.\n\nWasn\u2019t it the New York Post that featured photos of Mayor Adams greeting busloads of illegal immigrants at Port Authority (\u201cThe Post says: Endorse Adams Apple,\u201d Editorial, Aug. 8)?\n\nHave you already forgotten about the billions of dollars that taxpayers shelled out to house, feed and educate illegals?\n\nHave you forgotten about all the corrupt politicians Adams surrounded himself with in his administration?\n\nOne would think The Post would do the right thing for New Yorkers and instead ask President Trump to endorse Curtis Sliwa.\n\nThe Post\u2019s support for Eric Adams illustrates a lack of innovation.\n\nNew York City is primed for a change, which requires the insights of Sliwa.\n\nAny other candidate inhabits a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d mentality.\n\nGod willing, enough people will stop the madness and give Sliwa his due.\n\nI urge all New Yorkers to get behind Adams.\n\nI believe that he cares about New York City and is well aware of the mistakes he has made in his first term.\n\nAbove all else, he cares about the quality-of-life issues in all five boroughs.\n\nHe does not want to brainwash us, seize property, close family businesses or make our neighborhoods less safe.\n\nWhether you live in Chinatown, Little Italy, Forest Hills, Harlem or elsewhere, Adams will advocate for you.\n\nAdams is the greatest sleazeball since Jimmy Walker during the Roaring \u201920s.\n\nYes, Andrew Cuomo is distasteful and Zohran Mamdani is over the moon, but going to bat for Adams indicates rabid insanity.\n\nHas the New York Post lost its mind?\n\nHow, for the love of God, could you ask President Trump to endorse Adams for re-election?\n\nAdams has been a complete disaster since his first day in office.\n\nCuomo and Mamdani \u2014 the despicable communist \u2014 are even worse.\n\nSliwa is the only viable candidate with a chance to bring some semblance of sanity back to our once-great city.\n\nWhile The Post raises legitimate questions about Cuomo\u2019s record, endorsing Adams overlooks how many of his policies resemble those of Mamdani and Cuomo.\n\nTrump would be wise to refrain from any endorsements to avoid involvement in the federal scrutiny the next mayor will likely face over a range of ludicrous campaign proposals.\n\nThe Issue: The possible cancellation of \u201cThe Howard Stern Show\u201d following a dropoff in listeners.\n\nHoward Stern lost his edge years ago when he suddenly went woke (\u201cBye bye booey: Staff coasting,\u201d Aug. 10).\n\nFor most of his career, he eschewed good taste and battled critics, going out of his way to be politically incorrect.\n\nThe more outrageous he was, the funnier he got, and that earned him a tremendous following.\n\nBut, as Howard\u2019s longtime fans know, he is driven by money.\n\nWhen Stern realized his brand of humor could get him canceled, he became a soft liberal.\n\nThis is not the old Howard Stern; he is kissing up to the targets, like the woke people he once hated.\n\nI have a better opinion of Stern staffers Gary Dell\u2019Abate and Fred Norris than I do of Stern.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be offered any extension of his show.\n\nThe time to pull the plug is now.\n\nWant to weigh in on today\u2019s stories? Send your thoughts (along with your full name and city of residence) to letters@nypost.com. Letters are subject to editing for clarity, length, accuracy, and style.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications. If you access the Services through a mobile application or other type of third party platform, the applicable End User License Agreement for the platform through which you downloaded the mobile application may apply in addition to these Terms and you agree that you are subject to such terms in addition to these Terms."

      "text": "When my friend Rebecca in Highland Park, NJ, opened her PSE&G gas and electric bill last month, she almost fell out of her seat: It had tripled.\nIt\u2019s now costing her more than $1,000 a month to keep her modest home running.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been creeping up for months, in spite of the fact that nothing about our house has changed,\u201d she told me. \u201cIn years past, it was averaging about $300 a month.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re expected to absorb these new bills,\u201d she posted on Facebook.\nHer neighbor Felix Urman wondered the same as he ticked off his household costs for me.\n\u201cProperty taxes are up 6.3%,\u201d he said \u2014 on top of what had already been the nation\u2019s highest.\n\u201cCar insurance up 15%. Home insurance up 17%. Health insurance up 19%.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how non-dermatologists are living in New Jersey,\u201d he concluded.\nThat question \u2014 how are we expected to live here? \u2014 is why the solidly blue Garden State is rapidly turning purple.\nAffordability and taxes, at 54% and 43% respectively, have become the defining issues in New Jersey\u2019s tightening governor\u2019s race.\nThe latest survey, released this week, showed Democratic Party nominee Mikie Sherrill leading Republican Jack Ciattarelli by just 6 percentage points.\nThose who ranked affordability as their primary issue were split over which candidate is better equipped to handle it: 36% of them named Sherrill, while 34% chose Ciattarelli.\nBut on taxes, Ciattarelli holds a commanding lead. When asked which candidate would do a better job lowering them, 50% picked the Republican, compared to just 15% who went for the Democrat.\nIt\u2019s clear New Jersey residents have lost confidence in their Democratic lawmakers when it comes to tax policy.\nOnce they realize that Democrats\u2019 bungled energy policies are to blame for their exploding utility bills as well, it could blow November\u2019s race wide open.\n\u201cThey took generation off before they brought generation on,\u201d one energy expert told me, pointing to the state\u2019s aggressive shutdown of coal-powered plants under Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and the closure of the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in 2018.\nThe result? A shrinking energy supply, at a time when demand is exploding.\nDan Lockwood, a spokesperson for PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, explained the problem plainly to the New Jersey Monitor.\n\u201cThese higher prices are the result of a loss in electricity supply caused primarily by decarbonization policies that have led to an uptick in generator retirements,\u201d Lockwood said.\nOn top of that came \u201can unprecedented spike in electricity demand,\u201d he added, due to burgeoning AI data centers and the increasing use of \u201cgreen\u201d technologies like electric vehicles and appliances.\nIn short: the state is using more electricity than ever before, after legislators systematically dismantled the infrastructure that used to provide it.\nAnd the New Jersey lawmakers who championed these green policies as bold and forward-thinking left regular families to foot the bill.\nAdding insult to injury, they apparently thought a $30 rebate would make a difference.\n\u201cIf you just opened your July electric bill and noticed a $30 \u2018credit,\u2019 don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 it\u2019s not relief,\u201d state Assemblyman Alex Sauickie snarked last week in Central Jersey Newswire.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a failed rebate scheme from Gov. Phil Murphy and the Democrat-controlled Legislature. It was designed to distract you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not help,\u201d Sauickie scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s an insult . . . a Band-Aid over a bullet hole.\u201d\nNo one prepared the grid for this transition. No one told Rebecca or Felix that their bills would quietly triple while they were busy chauffeuring kids to camp and grocery shopping for dinner.\nThe policymakers pushed the policies, but didn\u2019t build the safety net, or the replacement energy sources, first.\nInstead, families face a double squeeze. Their bills are rising, and so are the taxes funding the very lawmakers who forced costs up.\nVoters are rightly asking: What am I getting in return for this crushing cost of living?\nThe answer, so far, is not much.\nRebecca\u2019s story is hardly unique. Families across the state are considering relocating, cutting their budgets to the bone, or simply skipping utility payments and hoping for the best.\nThat\u2019s not how it should be in one of the wealthiest states in the country.\nThis isn\u2019t about politics, it\u2019s about survival. And as New Jersey\u2019s election heats up, candidates who ignore the pain of middle-class families do so at their peril.\nThe bills are real. The frustration is growing.\nAnd the demand for accountability is rising along with the utility costs.\nVoters are watching, and they\u2019re not buying the excuses anymore.\nBethany Mandel writes and podcasts at The Mom Wars."

Andrew Cuomo in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary \u2014 and both the Guardian Angels founder and the Queens assemblyman will face Mayor Eric Adams in November.\n\u201cI\u2019m focused on one thing: winning this race and saving New York City from the corruption and collapse he created,\u201d Sliwa told The Post of Adams on Thursday.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not running against a fantasy. He\u2019s running against me. I\u2019m the only one capable of beating Zohran Mamdani and I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d\nSources said Adams, who is running as an independent, hasn\u2019t given up his Hail Mary hope of taking over Sliwa\u2019s spot on the coveted GOP party line in the general election.\nAdams has been gunning \u201cbig time\u201d for Sliwa\u2019s spot as recently as Wednesday, and even told bigwig donors that the red beret-wearing vigilante was dropping out for a job in the Trump administration, according to the sources.\nBut Sliwa scoffed at the idea.\n\u201cIt\u2019s laughable that Eric Adams is telling donors I\u2019m headed to the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly panicked.\u201d\nRepublicans, big business leaders and even some moderate Democrats are panicked over the prospect of Mamdani sailing to victory against a divided field of opponents: Sliwa, Adams, independent Jim Walden and perhaps even a stubborn Cuomo also running as an independent.\nFollow The Post\u2019s coverage of the NYC mayoral race\n- Top NY Dems \u2018freaking out\u2019 over \u2018absolute insanity\u2019 of Mamdani taking over NYC: Mike Lawler\n- Eric Adams tells \u2018Pod Force One\u2019 socialist Zohran Mamdani\u2019s \u2018false promises\u2019 are sure to harm lower-income New Yorkers\n- Andrew Cuomo staying on NYC mayoral election ballot \u2014 as critics slam ex-gov as \u2018spoiler\u2019 candidate\n- Adams pulls in massive $1.5M haul for re-election after Cuomo\u2019s embarrassing Dem primary defeat\n- Cuomo blasted for \u2018cringe, inauthentic\u2019 campaign ad where he jump starts man\u2019s car\nEven if Cuomo does end up deciding to carry on his campaign, sources said he\u2019s viewed as a loser unlikely to stop Mamdani.\nBut Adams viewed Mamdani\u2019s victory as a way to resurrect his own waning re-election hopes, casting himself as the best chance to stop the socialist from winning, sources said.\nLike-minded big donors have also been pushing to get Sliwa a job in the Trump administration to clear the lane for Adams, sources told Post financial correspondent Lydia Moynihan.\nGrabbing the GOP line would make Adams\u2019 task easier, but many hurdles remain.\nAccording to an obscure New York election law that aims to stop party jumping, Adams would need to gain the backing of three out of five Republican county chairs, or Sliwa would have to die, be named a judge or move out of New York City for Hizzoner to take the GOP nomination.\nA GOP insider said Adams was \u201cbig time\u201d trying to boot Sliwa, with no success.\n\u201cIt\u2019s immense pressure,\u201d the insider said Thursday. \u201c(Adams) is still calling around to county chairs as recently as yesterday \u2026 They are telling him no, he had his chance and they are behind Curtis.\u201d\nBut Staten Island Republican Chair Michael Tannousis said he hasn\u2019t heard about Adams\u2019 overtures, making it unlikely the mayor\u2019s machinations will work.\nThe island is the backbone for the Republican Party in the city, and Sliwa easily carried it over Adams when the two faced off in 2021\u2019s mayoral election.\nAdams ended up trouncing Sliwa, carrying 67% of the vote to the Republican\u2019s 28%.\nJohn Catsimatidis, a billionaire Republican and ally of Adams, said Sliwa is unlikely to budge.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Curtis is getting out,\u201d he said.\nThe Adams campaign denied any talk of a Sliwa White House job offer.\n\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true. Whoever is spreading that is not being honest. There has been no conversation between Mayor Adams, Curtis Sliwa, or President Trump about any job offer,\u201d spokesman Todd Shapiro said. \u201cThese are just rumors that don\u2019t deserve serious attention \u2014 we\u2019re focused on delivering real results for New Yorkers.\u201d"

      "text": "President Trump, do what\u2019s right for NYC and endorse Mayor Eric Adams for re-election\nPresident Trump, if you decide to get involved in this year\u2019s mayoral race, do what\u2019s right for the city we all love: Back Eric Adams.\nWith his commitment to public safety and civic pride, Adams has shown he deserves a second term in Gracie Mansion.\nHe has stood up to the left-wing legislators of Albany and the City Council, the radicals who want to legalize theft, hold no one on bail and empty all the jails.\nFor the first half of this year, New York enjoyed the lowest number of shootings since the city started keeping track.\nThat didn\u2019t happen by accident.\nSocialist Zohran Mamdani would reverse all that progress.\nThe \u201cDefund the police\u201d activist would hobble the NYPD, drive away businesses and make the streets unsafe.\nWe agree Mamdani must be stopped.\nBut don\u2019t believe that Andrew Cuomo, who already failed to beat him once, is the answer.\nHe\u2019s everything at once\nReports are that Cuomo\u2019s campaign is heavily lobbying you to help him in the New York City mayoral race.\nDon\u2019t listen to him, Mr. President: You know as well as we do that Cuomo cannot be trusted \u2014 except to betray anyone and everyone as fits his convenience.\nFor starters, consider how he treated you during your first term, casting doubt on the \u201cTrump vaccine.\u201d\nThen, once Democrats decided it was their vaccine, Cuomo was a leader of the \u201cYou must get jabbed or you\u2019ll be fired\u201d crew.\nCuomo was for fracking until he was against fracking.\nHe was for charter schools until he was against charter schools.\nHe signed all of the \u201cno bail\u201d laws and other \u201creforms\u201d that caused crime to skyrocket, but now claims he would \u201cfix\u201d them.\nAnd he still refuses to admit those laws were a mistake.\nHeck, he won\u2019t admit to any mistake, ever.\nHow wormy is he?\nOn Thursday (after planting stories to the contrary), Cuomo flatly denied talking to you recently.\nHe\u2019s also blatantly contradicting himself on how hard he\u2019ll \u201cfight Trump\u201d: He recently told business leaders that he\u2019s not \u201cpersonally\u201d looking for conflict with the president.\nHah!\nA month ago, in advance of the Democratic primary, he was vowing he\u2019d \u201cspend eight years in Washington\u201d fighting against your agenda.\nNo: If you care about the city\u2019s future, the man to support is Eric Adams.\nAdams was one of the few Democrats who stood up to Joe Biden, telling the truth about the massive border crisis.\nAnd for that, the previous administration punished him and New York City.\nFound his footing\nThere have been missteps, but Adams has lately found his footing \u2014 particularly by finding a great police commissioner in Jessica Tisch.\nAnother positive sign: The Police Academy just graduated its largest class in years.\nQualified young folks want to join New York\u2019s Finest, confident that they have a commish and mayor who\u2019ll have their backs.\nAn Adams re-election would mean that excellent work will continue.\nA Commissioner Tisch won\u2019t be there under a Cuomo or Mamdani.\nWe\u2019re sure Cuomo\u2019s pollsters painted a picture about the former governor\u2019s chances, but they were wrong in the primary and they are wrong now.\nAll Cuomo is doing is selfishly splitting the vote, trying to hold on to one last shred of relevancy.\nAdams is supported in his re-election bid by all of the police unions and all the major black churches.\nYou know New York, Mr. President, and understand that\u2019s a remarkable coalition \u2014 a perfect start on building a majority in November."

      "text": "Putin is under pressure to agree to a ceasefire. Few leaders would continue to pursue a war that has cost around a million casualties and where outright victory looks impossible.\nBut while he might agree to an end to the exchange of drone barrages, which are causing huge damage to Russian oil and gas facilities, the bloody ground war is likely to continue.\nWhile Russia may be suffering a thousand casualties a day, the grim mathematics involved means that Putin can take those losses and see the result as a win, because no amount of human suffering weighs in his calculus.\nRussia is advancing, but at a slow rate and huge cost. In June, Russia gained about 190 square miles or less than 0.1% of Ukrainian territory.\nAs Michael Kofman recently noted after a trip to Ukraine, mass attacks with armored vehicles are vanishingly rare. Pervasive drone surveillance means any movement is spotted miles before it reaches the front line, and a mass of First Person View drones hits any assault group long before it gets within sight of Ukrainian forces.\nInstead, attacks are a matter of trying to infiltrate the lightly held Ukrainian lines. Russian forces advance stealthily or rapidly on foot, trying to get through the barrage of FPV drones.\n\u201cRussian attacks are sometimes in 4-6-man groups, but in many cases have decreased to numerous 2-3-man sections trying to penetrate in between Ukrainian positions,\u201d Kaufman notes. \u201cRussian infantry seeks to advance as far as possible past Ukraine\u2019s initial line and entrench there. Although many may be lost, some get through and entrench, awaiting reinforcements. Much the same can be said of motorcycle and buggy assaults. . . . Most fail, but not all, leading to small tactical advances.\u201d\nLosses are high and successes rare. But if commanders throw enough troops against a line for long enough, they eventually push it back.\nSome reports suggest that the casualties are a point of pride among Russian commanders, who boast about the number of troops they lost to gain a position \u2014 \u201c\u2018I killed five Storm units to take this village\u201d is a typical attitude, according to Russian bloggers translated by Chris_O.\nCasualty rates of 80% or more among assault units are reportedly commonplace, with injured survivors rounded up and forced to join the next wave \u2014 even on crutches.\nTechnical specialists and other troops are drafted into assault units. The entire crew of Russia\u2019s only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, was sent ashore, reorganized as a naval infantry unit, and deployed to the Pokrovsk sector in 2024.\nUkrainian casualties are unknown but likely very much lighter. Defending forces typically only lose a fraction as many as attackers. And very few Ukrainian soldiers now have contact with the enemy as drones take on more and more of the fighting.\nBut as long as Russia\u2019s war machine gets a supply of fresh bodies, it can continue to advance.\nAccording to the Institute for the Study of War, in 2024, each square mile cost around 150 Russian casualties. By mid-2025, Ukrainian Presidential Office Deputy Head Pavlo Palisa gave a figure of 432 casualties per square mile.\nIt is expensive territory, but Putin wants to buy it because he can.\nCasualties on this scale might be unthinkable to Western nations, but in Russia, few people seem troubled by the scale of losses, as far as they are aware of them.\n\u201cMany people are actually not aware of the nature and scale of casualties,\u201d Samuel Bendett, an expert on the Russian scene and advisor to the CNAS and CSIS think tanks, told me. \u201cAnd the official propaganda and all manner of social media tools such as pro-Kremlin Telegram channels state that sacrifices are necessary.\u201d\nRussia takes great pride in the many giant cemeteries honoring the over 20 million Soviet dead lost in WWII, known as the Great Patriotic War.\nWar in Russia is all about sacrifice for the Motherland, the individual dying and achieving glory for the greater good. Putin made this exact point in a televised meeting with the mother of a dead soldier in 2022.\n\u201cSome people die in road accidents, others from alcohol \u2014 when they die, it\u2019s unclear how. But your son lived, do you understand? He fulfilled his purpose,\u201d Putin told the mother.\nOne of the main reasons there is no public outcry is that the men dying are not young conscripts (known as \u201cMobiks\u201d) but contract soldiers (\u201cKontraktniki\u201d) who sign up voluntarily for a fixed duration. The Mobiks, perhaps 25% of the army, are kept well back, Kontraktniki go to the front.\nThe amounts of money on offer are, to Russians, staggering. One region offers a million rubles (about $12,000), while the national government adds another 400,000 (about $5,000) to new soldiers. In some of the poorer Russian regions like the Caucasus, the average monthly is just 35,000 rubles ($400). Signing on the army is like winning a game show \u2014 you get several years\u2019 salary in one lump and are seen as a sort of patriotic hero. And if the recruit is killed, their families get a lavish payout, at least in theory.\n\u201cMany underprivileged men see it as an opportunity to earn money and do something really great in their generally miserable life,\u201d notes analyst Kirill Shamiev in a detailed Twitter thread on public opinion in Russia.\nRecruits typically come from deprived areas, and as Russia\u2019s economy disintegrates in slow motion, the bonanza offered by the army looks increasingly appealing.\nBecause Russia is not seeking high quality troops, they will take anyone. An RBC report from the city of Mordovia describes how the recruiters visit homeless shelters looking for recruits, regardless of their mental condition or whether they are drug addicts or alcoholics: \u201cPeople who show at least minimal interest are immediately offered to sign a contract for military service.\u201d\nIn the early years of the war, Russia had thousands of convicts who were recruited directly from prisons under a special program, and mercenaries like the Wagner group, both of which took disproportionate casualties because they were expendable without affecting public opinion. While these sources have dried up, Russia can now also count on North Korean troops, who again are thrown into the most intense combat and suffer a high rate of casualties.\nBut most of those that are being fed into the meat grinder are Kontraktniki, and Russia is recruiting them, and losing them, at a rate of around 30,000 a month.\nA country of 140 million can sustain losses at this rate for a considerable period. And as long as they are seen as patriotic volunteers dying for a cause \u2014 \u201cfulfilling their purpose\u201d as Putin has it \u2014 there is no public outcry.\nFrom Putin\u2019s point of view, this slow, grinding advance is a winning strategy. He is gaining territory and counting on Ukraine facing a political crisis in the coming months.\nIf a future ceasefire freezes the existing situation on the ground, every day of fighting is a day of progress.\nSeveral things could change this: accelerating economic collapse, more military aid to Ukraine, or a successful Ukrainian offensive. Without these, expect the bloodshed to continue.\nReprinted with permission from Forbes."

      "text": "Howard Stern staffers prepping for show\u2019s demise, withholding best material as future uncertain\nThe writing has \u201cbeen on the wall for well over a year now\u201d that SiriusXM wouldn\u2019t be renewing Howard Stern\u2019s colossal contract \u2014 and his employees have been taking advantage, \u201ccoasting\u201d on the clock and trolling for new gigs, two current show staffers told The Post.\nThis week, reports surfaced that the \u201cHoward Stern Show\u2019s\u201d \u201c19-year run at SiriusXM was nearing its end, with his $500 million contract expiring at the end of the year and an audience that\u2019s apparently dwindled from 20 million a day to 125,000.\nSome of the show\u2019s writers have been their best jokes for themselves, to use after the show\u2019s eventual demise, one worker said.\n\u201cMost of us have been coasting at work the last year,\u201d because \u201cwe know he\u2019s retiring, whether by choice or because he\u2019s forced out,\u201d admitted one of the longtime staffers who dished to The Post this week.\nStern\u2019s employees have been putting out feelers for other showbiz gigs, the two said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been hard, because the industry [in New York City] is so incestuous, so you don\u2019t know who\u2019s talking to who,\u201d the first employee said.\n\u201cI\u2019m just hanging in there until this is all sorted out, and then I will take some time to unwind after all this,\u201d the staffer continued. \u201cI\u2019m a fan and it\u2019s been a big part of my life for so long, but it hasn\u2019t been fun for a while.\u201d\nBefore taking his annual summer break, Stern, 71, hinted in staff meetings his retirement is nigh. The staffers said they\u2019ve only heard rumors regarding Stern\u2019s future at SiriusXM \u2014 nothing definitive from management or the self-proclaimed \u201cKing of All Media\u201d himself.\nThe looming end of the once mighty radio personality comes after a sharp change in Stern\u2019s politics.\nThe radio host used to maintain a friendship with President Trump, but came out against him when he ran against Hillary Clinton in 2015.\nOnce a strong supporter of Republicans like former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Governor George Pataki, Stern has been accused of going woke and was an infamously ardent backer of President Biden and Kamala Harris.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if its wokeness that alienated some of his audience, or if he just got tamer with age, but whatever it is, its apparent no one wants to hear it anymore,\u201d the second staffer offered.\nThe political U-turn was done to appease the Hollywood elite, the employee said.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s content to be out in there in the Hamptons with his celebrity friends,\u201d the first staffer offered. \u201cHe likes being liked by famous people. That seems more important [to him] than his legacy.\u201d\nSome ribbed Stern, calling him \u201cHollywood Howie\u201d after he started hanging around with the likes of Jimmy Kimmel, Jennifer Aniston, Jerry Seinfeld, and John Stamos during the late 2000s and early to mid 2010s.\nBut since COVID Stern\u2019s become \u201ca hermit,\u201d the second staffer said.\n\u201cEveryone knows he hasn\u2019t been the same since COVID. He does the show from his [Southampton] basement. And it\u2019s been sad to see how irrelevant he\u2019s become,\u201d the employee added.\nStern has also suffered immense loss in recent years, with the deaths of his father, Ben, in 2022, his best friend and stylist, Ralph Cirella, in 2023, and then his agent, Don Buchwald, in 2024.\nFans have complained for years about the show\u2019s dwindling quality, and Stern\u2019s kids-gloves approach with certain guests he once would\u2019ve skewered.\n\u201cHis passion hasn\u2019t been there, and that can be infectious,\u201d the first staffer said. \u201cWhen your boss doesn\u2019t even seem like he wants to be there, its like, why should I bust my ass?\u201d\nStern and SiriusXM did not return requests for comment.\nAccording to a DailyMail report, Stern might make a move to a streaming platform, like Netflix or HBO Max, and insists \u201cAll this unknown is music to Howard\u2019s ears.\n\u201cHe thrives in this element of the unknown,\u201d the source added."

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani\u2019s $2,300 rent scandal exposes whom this \u2018socialist\u2019 is really looking after first \u2014 himself\nWhom are government-mandated rent-stabilized apartments for? Apparently, well-compensated bureaucrats.\nMayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is only paying $2,300 for his stabilized place in Astoria, despite making $142,000 a year as an assemblyman, plus stipends, in addition to however much his artist wife is raking in.\nIt\u2019s part of a long-term pattern of Mamdani using programs meant for less fortunate people for his own benefit. First he\u2019s claiming to be an African American to get into college, now he\u2019s grifting on rent stabilization that should be benefiting lower-income people.\nMamdani\u2019s rent had been pointed out for around a week before Andrew Cuomo caught on and challenged him in a Friday tweet about the matter, which attracted a staggering 33 million views on X.\n\u201cYou are actually very rich, [yet] you and your wife pay $2,300 a month, as you have bragged, for a nice apartment in Astoria,\u201d the former governor wrote.\n\u201cI am calling on you to move out immediately and give your affordable housing back to an unhoused family who needs it.\u201d\nCuomo inaccurately first claimed that Mamdani\u2019s home is rent-controlled (a statement he\u2019s since corrected). The one-bedroom apartment is actually rent-stabilized, as are almost half of rentals in New York City.\nBut Cuomo is not wrong to question why Mamdani \u2014 who claims to be a champion of the less fortunate \u2014 has never sought to correct why someone like him can benefit from a system that should be for low-income, housing-insecure New Yorkers first.\nRent-stabilized apartments are subject to only modest annual increases in rent, as determined by the Rent Guidelines Board, and virtually guaranteed rights to lease renewal. And there are generally no income restrictions for moving into one \u2014 it\u2019s mostly a matter of luck.\nBut shouldn\u2019t a socialist assemblyman be concerned with making sure low-income New Yorkers who need those protections most are prioritized in getting them?\nApparently not so much. Mamdani has bragged about only paying $2,300 a month for rent in debates and interviews alike.\nHe has made housing the primary pillar of his campaign, calling on New York City to freeze the rent for apartments under the provision of the government and to build 200,000 affordable housing units in the next 10 years.\nThe question is: Who gets to benefit from these policies? Will well-off New Yorkers like Mamdani, who are unfairly occupying rent-stabilized homes, benefit from indefinite freezes?\nFormer Gov. Cuomo told The Post Sunday that he\u2019s proposing new legislation, calling it Zohran\u2019s Law, which would block wealthy New Yorkers like Mamdani from accessing rent-stabilized housing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to be providing rent-stabilized apartments to the children of millionaires,\u201d he said.\nMamdani\u2019s father is a major Columbia professor, his mother an internationally renowned movie director.\nCuomo is right, but he shouldn\u2019t stop there. Mamdani \u2014 who has previously called for the \u201cabolition of private property\u201d \u2014 should be made to explain exactly who will benefit from his expanded affordable housing scheme.\nHe did, after all, tell the New York Editorial Board that he\u2019s \u201cdeeply skeptical of means testing\u201d when asked by an interviewer whether we should \u201chave any way of ensuring that people who are better off who live in rent-stabilized housing don\u2019t get those benefits.\u201d\nSeems like Mamdani has a very personal interest in batting down proposals for means testing.\nThis scandal fits into a larger pattern in the candidate\u2019s past. It\u2019s not unlike when Mamdani, who grew up in Uganda but is of Indian descent, decided to check the \u201cAfrican American\u201d box on his application to Columbia University.\nMamdani had no problem potentially benefiting from racial affirmative action \u2014 a system set up to uplift the descendants of American slaves \u2014 in the admissions process, despite quite evidently not being black or African American.\nSimilarly, he seems to have no issue getting all the perks of rent stabilization \u2014 a system set up to receive cash-strapped New Yorkers \u2014 despite being the well-compensated son of successful parents.\nMamdani has a long history of identifying special-interest programs meant for others worse off than he, and then using them for his own benefit. Is this really the sort of leader whom New Yorkers trust to roll out and dole out vast new entitlement programs?"
