      "feedback": "This draft parsimoniously strings disparate signals into a narrative but omits a rigorous multi‑year regime framework, explicit first‑principles anchors, and concrete catalysts/invalidations; to lift to world‑class, rewrite as a four‑regime model anchored in invariant drivers (AI‑driven productivity, governance/disciplinary risk from large M&A, consumer demand/margin dynamics, and domestic policy/security risk), then map each source to its regime and spell out a persistent causal chain: AI productivity cycles raise the marginal value of information/software, hardware upgrade tempo and Gemini/AI features from 5S9GJV2O3 justify higher capex/valuation in tech ecosystems, governance frictions (DAY/BKH) set higher risk premia and potentially alter exit terms (UVEQ2SJ0W), price/promotions in retail reflect demand/margin pressures feeding inflation pass‑through (HWGNUP2XG), and security/policy shocks (ISXY49HGS) inject episodic volatility into risk assets; explicitly state regime transition conditions (e.g., DAY/BKH deal disclosures/outcomes, pace of AI adoption, inflation prints, or geopolitical‑policy shocks) and lay out base/optimist/pessimist trajectories with trigger thresholds and invalidation rules; quantify where possible using the numbers that exist in the four core sources (DAY at $70 cash per share and 56% Black Hills ownership post‑merge in UVEQ2SJ0W; 7‑year/update commitments and 65–70W charging/6000mAh/60–70W‑class charging references in 5S9GJV2O3 and HWGNUP2XG; specific KA metrics like 6‑year/7‑year software‑update windows in the Android coverage) and present ranges rather than blunt assertions when exact figures are unavailable; replace or deprioritize non‑economic items from NYPost unless clearly tied to sentiment or policy environment, and then cite only the IDs above to maintain density and avoid conflicts; build the base case around a damped AI productivity impulse plus contained governance/policy risk (cite 5S9GJV2O3, UVEQ2SJ0W, HWGNUP2XG, ISXY49HGS), outline a crisp set of catalysts/triggers (e.g., DAY/BKH disclosures; AI adoption milestones; major inflation prints; a security incident), and specify invalidation conditions (e.g., adverse DAY/BKH outcome or a sudden security/regulatory shock); craft the narrative as a horizon‑focused, regime‑driven framework with explicit “What to watch,” “Key risks,” and “Confidence” sections, ensuring each claim is tethered to the cited source IDs; finally, tighten the prose for precision and remove extraneous color from non‑economic sources.
