  "title": "Kobo finally brings Instapaper integration to its eReaders",
  "description": "Kobo replaces Pocket with Instapaper in its latest firmware update, bringing built-in read-it-later support across all Kobo eReaders.",
  "content": "After more than a decade of serving as Kobo\u2019s built-in \u201cread it later\u201d service, Pocket is officially out of the picture. In its place, Kobo has rolled out support for Instapaper across its eReader lineup. The change comes via the brand\u2019s latest firmware update, which is already landing on devices. The move isn\u2019t particularly surprising. First, because the integration was announced back in July, but also because Mozilla shut down Pocket on July 8, 2025, with data exports available through October. Kobo needed a replacement, and Instapaper is a natural fit. Like Pocket, it offers stripped-down offline reading and cross-platform sync, though with a more minimalist bent.\n\nFor anyone new to the platform, Instapaper is a longtime \u201cread-it-later\u201d tool. It lets you stash articles from the web, ditch all the ads and formatting, and circle back later in a clean, minimalist reading view, even when you\u2019re offline. Unlike Kindle devices, which rely on Send to Kindle or Instapaper\u2019s premium \u201csend\u201d feature to shuttle web content onto the page, Kobo bakes Instapaper right into the eReader itself. This native integration makes the process a lot smoother.\n\nThe new software brings the updated experience to all models, from the original Touch through to the Clara BW, Clara Colour, and Libra Colour. Depending on your device, you\u2019ll see firmware version 4.38.23429 (on older readers) or 4.43.23418 (on newer ones). Instapaper support seems to be the only real addition in either build, so if you\u2019ve been waiting on fresh annotation tools or stylus upgrades, you\u2019ll need to keep waiting.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that rollout hasn\u2019t been entirely uniform. According to Reddit users, the update isn\u2019t appearing everywhere just yet. Several Kobo owners on Reddit report still waiting on the new Instapaper integration to hit their devices, suggesting availability may vary by region. Here in Hawaii, the update didn\u2019t appear on my Kobo Libra Colour until the morning of August 27.\n\nTo get started, update your device over Wi-Fi. You can find available updates in the Settings menu under Device information by tapping Check for updates. Once the feature is live, you\u2019ll see an announcement screen explaining that Pocket is out and Instapaper is in. If, for some reason, you do not, look for Instapaper under More Articles. I had to restart my device for the new option to appear, then sign in to Instapaper via the QR code.\n\nFor Kobo owners, this is a straightforward swap. If you\u2019ve been using Pocket, you\u2019ll need to migrate your saved articles to Instapaper (export tools are available), but otherwise, the workflow remains familiar: save content from the web, sync, and dive in later without distractions. Whether the transition feels like an upgrade will depend on how much you value Instapaper\u2019s pared-back approach.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe Kobo Libra Colour is my favorite Kindle alternative for one key reason\nMay 24, 2025\nKobo Libra Colour\nMSRP: $219.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nKobo Libra Colour\nI\u2019ve been a long-time Kindle user, but when offered the chance to try the $219 Kobo Libra Colour, I was intrigued. Lured by the prospect of physical buttons, a color display, and a more open ecosystem, I wanted to see if this Kobo could compete with the Kindle experience I\u2019ve been accustomed to for years. A concerning number of dragon-themed books later, I can confidently say that it\u2019s a worthy alternative, especially if you\u2019re after a tactile page-turning experience with a unique selling point the Kindle no longer has: physical buttons.\nTurn the page, with buttons!\nLike many E-Ink tablets, the Kobo Libra Colour (yes, that\u2019s officially Colour, not Color in Kobo land) has a clean, minimalist design that\u2019s lightweight (just under 200 grams) and comfortable for long reading sessions. Compared to the similarly sized Kindle Paperwhite, though, the Libra has a wide side bezel with a slight curve. For me, this makes it easier to grip single-handedly (even when lethargy loosens my hold half an hour into my book). And as I already alluded to, unlike the Paperwhite, the Libra Colour also features physical page-turn buttons.\nPhysical page-turning buttons, which can't be found on Amazon's current readers, make the Kobo Libra Colour an incredibly pleasant device to read on.\nFans of the Kindle Oasis will already know the benefits of this feature, but as someone who\u2019s primarily used touchscreens for years, I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed the tactile experience. Using the buttons is considerably more convenient and seamless than my standard habit of navigating through pages with one hand and holding my e-reader with the other. In bed, it allows me to keep more of my limbs comfortably under the blanket. On the couch, it leaves one hand free for my cup of emotional support tea.\nSince Kindle officially shuttered the Oasis line (which was the brand\u2019s only remaining model with buttons) the Kobo device stands out. The buttons are even customizable so you can determine what makes the most sense for you. I learned that, like playing with inverted controller settings on Xbox, my brain expects the exact opposite functionality as my partner.\nThe reading rainbow\nThe Libra Colour\u2019s headline feature is, of course, right in its name. Kobo uses a Kaleido 3 color E-Ink touchscreen display with a 1264 x 1680 resolution to add subdued but meaningful pops of color to all the device\u2019s content, from book covers and menus to highlights and annotations. To be clear, it\u2019s not vibrant like a tablet, the hues are muted to almost pastel saturation. Still, it makes perusing my library significantly more engaging.\nThough subdued, color enhances the Kobo Libra Colour's UI, from navigating menus to engaging with content.\nOn that front, the interface is intuitive, offering a user-friendly experience whether you\u2019re new to e-readers or a longtime Kindle convert like me. The subtle color accents give the UI a fresh, modern feel without being distracting and transitions are generally smooth, though there can be a slight lag when handling especially content-dense pages. I did fumble a few taps here and there, but never enough to pull me out of a reading session.\nMy absolute favorite discovery was that I could adjust the display\u2019s brightness on-demand, with a simple slide of my finger down the left edge of the screen. Now, I want to see the same tool added to the right side for text size. Overall, the UI feels thoughtfully designed.\nCompared to black-and-white-only tablets, it\u2019s fantastic for comics and graphic novels, as well as for children\u2019s books. With a ten-hour flight in my child\u2019s near future, I love the prospect of loading the Libra with classics. There is, however, some significant flashing between pages that gives me pause. I imagine it\u2019s low risk but could be a concern for kids with visual sensitivity. The color display is also helpful when reviewing notes in nonfiction titles; the ability to color-code highlights brought a sense of structure that\u2019s hard to get from monochrome screens.\nWith that said, the Libra\u2019s display seems to have slightly less contrast in pure text than other devices. For hard specs, the device offers 300 PPI when displaying black-and-white content (like regular text) and 150 PPI when displaying color. In practice, I haven\u2019t had any issues reading on it, and again, the Libra\u2019s color support makes it far more versatile. It also offers adjustable warmth (like most devices) and the brand\u2019s ComfortLight PRO feature automatically reduces blue light exposure for evening reading.\nThe Libra Colour is especially great for graphic novels, comics, and kids books.\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed reading on the device. The 7-inch display is amply sized while keeping the overall build small. It also packs in 32GB of storage, which I really appreciate for audiobooks in particular. Meanwhile, its IPX8 waterproofing meant I could also take it to the beach and poolside without stress, which I did begrudgingly, of course, for the sake of the review. The Libra Colour\u2019s display looks great in virtually direct sunlight, though the colors did mute out slightly more.\nPerfect and imperfect add-ons\nColor isn\u2019t the only perk of the Libra, it also supports note-taking via the Kobo Stylus 2, which is sold separately for $69.99. Hot off testing the Kindle Scribe (2024), I was curious to see how well these tools compare. In the end, the stylus/writing compatibility of the Libra is a thoughtful addition, but far from perfect. Writing on the Libra\u2019s E-Ink screen feels notably slower, and the stylus often misses strokes. There\u2019s also a noticeable lag, and the eraser is hard to use with any precision. I like the variety of color and tool options, but the experience is too finicky to be used for much beyond quick jots.\nThe stylus itself is slightly awkward to hold, and I constantly accidentally hit the tool swap button. It also needs to be recharged via USB-C, which isn\u2019t as convenient as those that charge magnetically. It\u2019s fine for highlighting passages or making small notes, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t rely on it for longer writing sessions or detailed sketching. If handwriting is a priority, shoppers might be better off with a third-party stylus or even a more specialized device.\nThe Kobo Libra Stylus needs refinement across the board.\nIn other words, the Libra is no replacement for a reMarkable Paper Pro or an iPad, but if you\u2019re just looking to mark up while you read, it gets the job done. It\u2019s certainly satisfying to underline a sentence or leave a quick note in the margin and see soft color among grayscale pages.\nAs for other accessories, I also tested the official Kobo SleepCover (available for $39.99), which, unlike many third-party covers, feels like it was actually designed with the device in mind. It snaps on magnetically, folds into a stand, and automatically wakes or sleeps the device when opened or closed. It\u2019s not flashy, but when no more than three blinks short of passing out at night or groggily trying to squeeze in a few pages in the morning, not having to fumble with buttons or a lock screen is a mini luxury.\nAn open-door approach\nOne of the biggest differences between the Kobo Libra Colour and Amazon\u2019s Kindle is each brand\u2019s ecosystem. The Libra doesn\u2019t come locked into a proprietary store, though the Kobo store is built into the device. I was able to purchase from my Libra instantly but I could also easily load EPUB files and PDFs without any hassle. Kobo\u2019s integration with Overdrive/Libby makes it easy to borrow eBooks directly from the library. Emphasis on direct. I love that I can instantly download free books without needing a second device.\nMost importantly, the Kobo Libra Colour supports an open ecosystem and features seamless Libby integration.\nFor my audiobooks, the Kobo Libra Colour also features Bluetooth support, so I could pair up my own wireless headphones. Unfortunately, Kobo audiobooks are fine audio quality-wise, but the selection is limited compared to Audible, which is owned by Amazon. Likewise, the device isn\u2019t integrated with Goodreads, another popular service owned by Amazon. If you use Goodreads to keep track of your read and rated books, you\u2019ll have to do a little more heavy lifting.\nAs of now, the device also supports limited internet browsing, but the feature is still in beta. I am interested to see how this is developed going forward and how that might round out the tablet even further.\nKobo Libra Colour review: The verdict\nIf you\u2019re deep into the Amazon ecosystem, the Kobo Libra Colour might feel like a step away from the convenience of Kindle\u2019s integration across apps and devices. However, if you\u2019re looking for an alternative to Amazon that offers the novelty of physical buttons, combined with plenty of file support and a color screen, the Libra Colour has a lot to offer. It\u2019s not without flaws (the optional stylus could be more responsive, and the audiobook store is limited), but overall, it\u2019s worthy of serious consideration for casual readers and serious bibliophiles alike.\nWith that said, the e-reader market is a crowded one. If you just want a dedicated color e-reader, the Kobo Clara Colour ($149.99 at Amazon) is a great portable alternative that drops stylus support and buttons but still offers a nice 6-inch color screen.\nAnyone committed to Kindle might want to check out the Kindle Colorsoft ($279.99 at Amazon) or the ever-popular 2024 Kindle Paperwhite ($159.99 at Amazon) instead, though you won\u2019t find buttons or stylus support on board, and the latter doesn\u2019t have a color screen. For more detailed note-taking, the 2024 Kindle Scribe ($419.99 at Amazon) pairs reading and writing nicely, but doesn\u2019t support any color. It\u2019s also quite bulky if reading is your primary goal.\n- Physical buttons streamline navigation\n- Portable, ergonomic build\n- Color enhances the user interface and reading experience\n- Open ecosystem offers versatility\n- Waterproof\n- Kobo Stylus 2 costs extra and needs refinement\n- Online access still in beta\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Instapaper Rakuten Kobo Integration\nWe\u2019re excited to announce a new integration that will bring Instapaper to all Rakuten Kobo eReaders. The integration will provide Kobo readers with a seamless way to save and read web articles directly on their Kobo eReaders.\nIn close partnership with Kobo, we\u2019re working diligently on the integration, and we\u2019re aiming to launch at the end of this summer. The new Kobo Instapaper integration will replace Kobo\u2019s previous integration with Pocket which shut down earlier this month.\nSince the Pocket shutdown, our top priority has been to help Pocket users migrate to Instapaper. Pocket users who have made the switch praise Instapaper on its clean, distraction-free reading experience, and robust organization tools.\nWe\u2019re excited to be partnered closely with Rakuten Kobo to power the read-it-later functionality on their Kobo eReader devices!\nImporting from Pocket\nIf you\u2019re a former Pocket user, you can import your articles into Instapaper in 2-clicks at instapaper.com/pocket.\nAlternatively, you can download your Pocket export file and import to Instapaper Settings.\nAs always, if you have any questions, concerns, or requests, you can reach us at support@instapaper.com. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\u2013 Instapaper Team"

Learn more.\nDisplay Week 2018: A look at the future of E Ink displays\nMay 25, 2018\nDisplay Week 2018 has been filled with ultra-high-res OLEDs, sound-emitting panels, and more, but the one company that really stuck out this year was E Ink. You might know its technology from products like the Amazon Kindle and the YotaPhone. The company has been using ultra low-power ink technology to create static images on displays, and had a number of new demos to showcase all the new products the technology is being injected into.\nThe first set of displays showcased on the wall showed full-color E Ink which would switch images every minute or so. These images gave the impression they were drafted by something like a colored pencil, and looked much more \u201cauthentic\u201d than a traditional display. I could see this tech being injected into e-readers, allowing users to read things like magazines where most of the content is text but images are present every now and then.\nThe company also showed off a few different monochrome panel arrays. While this wasn\u2019t quite as new as the colored ink, it gave a really cool and professional effect. This panel changed between lions and some horses, and I cold see this being displayed in a gallery somewhere.\nThis tech isn\u2019t only used for art and e-readers though. E Ink showed off a couple of wearables that are using the technology, including a smart band called Tago and a Sony and Epson smartwatch. One of the biggest issues that plague smartwatches today is the the crummy battery life, and E Ink could help solve this problem. The technology only uses battery power when it is switching the state of the ink, and that is quite infrequent in applications like this.\nBeyond this, there were a few other applications, like credit cards that can hold multiple accounts and have a super low-energy screen using E Ink tech. While this isn\u2019t brand new technology, it\u2019s quite cool to see it in person, and the whole booth made it evident that this could be the future of low-energy multi-state screens.\nThank you for being part of our community.

The update, which follows Pocket\u2019s July 2025 shutdown, lets users sync and read web articles offline in a minimalist interface, with migration tools for former Pocket users. The article also reviews the Kobo Libra Colour e\u2011reader, highlighting its physical page\u2011turn buttons, muted color E\u2011Ink display, open ecosystem, and limited stylus support, noting it as a solid alternative to Amazon\u2019s Kindle for readers who value tactile navigation and color.",
