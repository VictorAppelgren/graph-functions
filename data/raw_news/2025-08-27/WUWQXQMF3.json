  "title": "Google's Browser-Based Video Editor Is Now Available for Free",
  "description": "Google Vids is a simple video editing tool that works in any browser. It can now be used for free, or you can pay extra to unlock AI features.",
  "content": "Google Vids is the company's web-based video editor, and you can now use it for free. Up until now, Vids was available only for paying Google Workspace subscribers, but this move makes it accessible to everyone. The pitch here is quite simple: Vids is a simple video editing tool that integrates extremely well with Google Drive. You can use basic editing tools and templates for free, and if you're a paying Google subscriber, then you can use its AI features, too.\n\nBefore you get too excited about Google Vids, though, you should know that it's not a replacement for professional editing software. It's more intended as a good place to get started, a bit like what Windows Movie Maker used to be about 15 years ago. You can do a lot with Google Vids, but if you're a professional, you'll hit the limits of the app's capabilities fairly quickly. The good news is that there are alternatives like DaVinci Resolve for those who want professional-grade editing software and don't need to do their editing in a browser. But if that's a bit overkill for your needs, Google Vids is still worth looking into, especially because of the new free tier.\n\nOver the years, I've learned to lower my expectations for web-based video editing tools, but Google Vids is quite decent. My favorite thing about it is that if you have no idea how you want to present a video, it has several built-in templates to help you get started. For instance, there's a template that lets you create a \"year in review\" style video. Within each template, you can insert premade scenes alongside your own footage. For instance, a sourdough prep template I found had premade scenes showing an ingredient list (with text you can swap out for your own recipe), someone prepping dough, someone making dough, and so on.\n\nYou also have the option of importing a presentation from Google Slides and converting it into a video. It's a great use of the app's integration with Google Drive, and even better, you can also easily import pictures from your Google Photos account if you need still shots. There's even a handy feature that lets you search stock photo/video websites to get filler footage.\n\nThe tools available for basic edits are also quite intuitive. Even as a novice, I was able to easily add basic animations for text or transition effects, and modify on-screen elements like the background. Google Vids also lets you easily search for royalty-free music to add to your videos, which is a nice touch. The best bit is that you can use Google Vids via any browser, not just Chrome.\n\nYou can pay for AI integration\n\nIf you are a paying Google Workspace subscriber, then you can also use AI features in Google Vids. The basic editing tools remain the same, and all the AI stuff basically revolves around using a text prompt to generate ideas or videos. For instance, you can use a text prompt to generate a rough storyboard, or just ask Gemini to look at a Google Docs file to generate it even without a prompt. Vids also lets you throw in a script and generate an AI voiceover for your videos, and you have the option to choose from multiple types of voices.\n\nUsing Veo 3, you can also now make eight-second video clips from a text prompt, or convert still photos into video using AI. If that's not enough, you could also input your entire script, and Vids will generate an AI avatar to read it out loud for you, with no restriction on time, over your other footage. I'll presume Google has done its due diligence to not base any of these avatars on actual people\u2014you can see a few avatar choices above\u2014but still, it does mean that some of the talking heads you're about to see online won't resemble the person making the video at all. Be careful with what you assume is real.",

      "text": "One would think that you can talk to Gemini (or any other AI chatbot) like a friend and instantly get the answers you want. But to truly get the most out of an artificial intelligence machine, you have to give it all the help you can. This is where the art and method of prompting come in. The official Google Workspace prompt guide can help elevate your productivity using Gemini for Workspace. The free handbook was released at the Google Cloud Next 2024 event.\nStart by downloading the Gemini for Google Workspace Prompt Guide in PDF format.\nA look inside the prompting guide\nWithin its 45 pages, the Gemini for Google Workspace Guide (April 2024 edition) helps you learn the basics of writing prompts that make Gemini work better. It teaches you to break big tasks into smaller steps so you can clearly tell Gemini what to do.\nThe guide covers different use cases for different types of people in an organization, examples of how to use it within Google Workspace apps, and sample prompts for everyday tasks done by executives, founders, and workers in sales, marketing, customer service, managing projects, and human resources.\nPrompting 101 covers these roles within an organization:\nCustomer service\nExecutives and entrepreneurs\nHuman resources\nMarketing\nProject management\nSales\nIt's useful to remember this takeaway from the experts behind Gemini before you start practicing the prompts:\nYou will likely need to try a few different approaches for your prompt if you don\u2019t get your desired outcome the first time. Based on what we have learned during our Workspace Labs program, the most successful prompts average around 21 words, yet prompts people often try without knowing this are short\u2014usually less than nine words.\nEvery prompt has four main pillars that can make it easier for LLMs like Gemini to understand your query.\nPersona: Give the AI a role that matches your own.\nTask: Tell Gemini what it needs to do.\nContext: Give as much background as you can about the outcome.\nFormat: Tell Gemini how to structure the answer\u2014word count, bullet points, numbered lists, paragraphs, tables etc.\nTip: This framework works similarly across all AI chatbots like ChatGPT. You don't need all four for the AI to work, but including them as much as possible can give more precise results.\nNext, you can jump straight to the section that best matches your current role. But do look at the others, too, because it can give an idea of different prompt styles that help you collaborate better with Gemini in any situation.\nUse the guide as a primer for more advanced prompts\nAI prompting in Gemini or other tools is all about natural conversations (\"Make it a conversation,\" as the guide says). You don't need to end the chat there. The guide stresses that you should iterate on the basic prompt. Each successive chat gives Gemini a chance to get more context and fine tune the answer.\nHere are a few more tips from the guide to help you master the finer points of the instructions.\nBreak up related tasks into several prompts.\nContinue to build on the initial prompt and fine tune the generated response.\nGive Gemini a few constraints (like word count) for precise results.\nUse the scenarios as inspiration for how you can collaborate with Gemini for Workspace.\nForce Gemini to work harder for you by asking questions like, \u201cWhat questions do you have for me that would help you provide the best output?\u201d\nTailor your prompts for a specific tone in the answers like formal, informal, technical, creative, or casual.\nThis Prompting 101 guide will benefit beginners to Gemini the most. Keep it open on your taskbar the next time you use any Google Workplace app."

      "text": "We know that AI tech is progressing at a rapid rate, and Google's recent unveiling of the Veo 3 video generator highlighted this once again. Veo 3 is a step up in terms of realism, and adds audio for the first time. Much of the time, the outputs from Veo 3 are pretty much indistinguishable from real videos.\nIt's not perfect yet, but Veo 3 is taking the internet by storm, with viral clips covering everything from street interviews to incompetent Stormtroopers. Depicting soldiers of the Galactic Empire is at least one way of ensuring consistency between clips, because of course they all look the same.\nGoogle itself has provided a showreel of impressive-looking video clips as well, which include a sailor at sea and a classical violinist. You need to look very, very hard to tell that these videos are AI, and even then it's not always possible.\nBut those are the end results. What about the creation process? If you pay Google for an AI subscription, then you can produce Veo 3 videos of your own, and there are a couple of ways to go about it, which I'll get into here.\nAll this AI video creation needs to be put into context each time: There are question marks around the technology in terms of energy use, copyright infringement, the threat to the creative industries, and misinformation spreading, all of which we've written about extensively before.\nCreating videos with Veo 3\nIf you pay $20 a month for the Google AI Pro plan, then you get three Veo 3 video generations per day in the Gemini app, using the faster, lower-quality Veo 3 Fast model. If you've gone big with the $250-per-month Google AI Ultra plan, you get the \"highest limits\" for full Veo 3 access\u2014Google doesn't quantify this exactly, so there may be no hard ceiling, and it may well fluctuate based on demand. Each video is fixed at eight seconds long.\nIf you're using the Flow and Whisk tools for your video creation, rather than the Gemini chatbot, it's a bit different: You get 1,000 AI credits on the Pro plan per month, and 12,500 credits on the Ultra plan. A standard Veo 3 video will set you back 100 credits, and a Veo 3 Fast video is going to cost you 20 credits\u2014and in these tools, the resolution can be upscaled to 1080p (it's 720p if you're using the Gemini app).\nAs per Google's Josh Woodward, Veo 3 Fast is faster (obviously), less demanding in terms of processing, and sticks to the same 720p resolution as normal Veo 3. It's not clear exactly what trade-offs there are in terms of quality (the Google team wouldn't elaborate when I asked via email), but anecdotally, it seems some of the textures, lighting, and details aren't as good. Inside the Flow app, there's a label saying Veo 3 Fast is a fifth the quality of Veo 3.\nTo start making videos, if you're a Google AI Pro subscriber like me, you need to head to the Gemini app on the web (mobile video creation is limited to Google AI Ultra subscribers for now). Click the model picker in the top left corner, then choose 2.5 Pro (preview) or whatever the latest model is by the time you're reading this: You can then select Video in the text input box and you're ready to do some prompting.\nPreviously, I used Veo 2 to try and recreate the old Sony TV ad, where thousands of colored bouncy balls get thrown down the streets of San Francisco. The results weren't great, so I gave Veo 3 Fast the same challenge. As you can see below, I got a better video back. It could almost pass as something that had been filmed in real life (the sun through the trees is great), but it still ignores most of my prompt instructions, and is nowhere near as good as Sony's ad.\nThis brings us back to the nature of generative AI, which is to mimic what it's seen before. I'm guessing Veo 3 has been trained on lots and lots of street interview vox pops, and not many ads where bouncy balls are cascading down hills. It also highlights that it can take a lot of prompting to get what you want, and throughout my AI video tests, getting tools to follow the prompts is an ongoing challenge.\nWith only two Veo 3 generations left for the day, I tasked Veo 3 Fast with recreating the classic \"welcome to Jurassic Park\" scene in Spielberg's movie. Again, it's better than the Veo 2 effort, but there are problems with prompt adherence, and there are too many paleontologists. The dinosaurs (and the dinosaur sounds) are well done, though.\nUsing Flow to create longer movies\nGoogle also offers Whisk for animations and Flow for longer movie projects, using the same AI models as you'll find in the Gemini app, corresponding to the plan you're subscribed to. If you don't want to make videos of your own, or you're a free Google Gemini user, you can watch what other people have made via Flow TV.\nOnce you get into Flow in your web browser, click New project to get started. You can then start prompting, using the settings button in the top right of the prompt box to choose the model you want to use\u2014you'll see how many credits the generation is going to use up as well, before you do any rendering.\nI decided to splash out on 100 credits for a proper, full Veo 3 clip in an attempt to better produce the Jurassic Park scene in full and get my AI movie making career off the ground. I added a little more detail to the prompt, as well as some dialog, and what came out the other end was about on a par with the Veo 2 output. You actually get two generations to choose between, which you can see here and here.\nAgain, we have the usual problems, in that the AI generator doesn't really know what it's supposed to be doing here, or how to construct a scene beyond what it's seen in other videos. Our intrepid adventurers are looking in the wrong direction when one of them delivers the \"wow... would you look at that\" line, and everything from the dinosaurs to the trees looks generic.\nThe difference with Flow and creating extended videos is that you can click Add to scene on any of these generated videos and start building something longer, made up of eight-second chunks. Scenes can then be extended and arranged as needed, with the same characters and environments carried over from one clip to the next.\nMy attempts to get John Hammond to enter the scene didn't really work. The original characters stayed in place well enough, but our new character appeared out of nowhere and all sound was suddenly cut out because Flow had somehow switched me back to Veo 2. We also got a freak camera shake half way through. It's clear that I'm not going to be able to switch from tech journalism to AI film directing anytime soon, especially with just 1,000 credits per month.\nVeo 3 is still at an early stage, and Google has put \"experimental\" labels all over it and the Flow interface. However, at the moment you're going to have to spend a lot of credits and a lot of time working on prompts to get something that's consistent and realistic. It's likely that hours of effort and trial runs went into the polished AI videos you see populating your social media feeds."

      "text": "Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.\nSome Google Drive users are getting a new way to edit their videos without needing to download them to another program first.\nGoogle announced the news in a Workspace update on Friday. The company says that it is now rolling out Google Vids\u2014the company's AI-powered video editor\u2014 integration directly into Google Drive for eligible Workspace and AI customers. If you have a compatible subscription, you'll now see an \"Open\" button when viewing videos in your drive on desktop. Click this, and Google Drive will launch the clip in Google Vids.\nVids gives you a basic video editor with AI integration. There are a number of things you'd expect to see from an editor, like trimming, titles, music, and animations, but you can also use generative AI to have Vids create different elements for you. It's a simple yet useful additional to Google Drive workflow, especially for anyone who regularly works with video clips. I can't imagine this would actually replace a dedicated video editor for anyone who needs it, but if you need to regularly trim and adjust clips from Drive, this could save you some time and headaches.\nThere are some restrictions on this feature. As with all Vids projects, video clips cannot exceed 35 minutes or 4GB in size. In addition, these are the specific file types you can work with:\nMP4\nQuicktime\nOGG\nWebM\nWho has access to Vids in Google Drive\nIf you subscribe to either of Google's AI plans (AI Pro and AI Ultra), you now have access to Vids in Google Drive. If not, your organization's workspace plan may cover it, if you belong to any of the following:\nBusiness Starter, Standard, and Plus\nEnterprise Starter, Standard, and Plus\nEnterprise Essentials and Enterprise Essentials Plus\nNonprofits\nEducation Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus\nGemini Business\nGemini Enterprise\nGoogle says that if Google Docs are turned off for your Workspace account, Vids will also be unavailable. Your organization's IT department can also turn off Vids access independently. This could explain why you aren't seeing the \"Open\" button when viewing clips in Drive."

      "text": "From the moment I first launched Windows Movie Maker, I've been on the hunt for a good, free video editor. Not a perfect one, mind you. Not one that could replace a professional workflow, just one that's good enough. After giving up on \"free\" and learning Premiere Pro, I thought my dream would remain dead. Then I found DaVinci Resolve.\nFor the uninitiated, DaVinci Resolve is a free video editor from camera and production gear manufacturer Blackmagic Design. While the software has an optional Studio version ($300 for a lifetime license, though many of Blackmagic's products come with free codes), the free version is so robust and powerful that most users probably won't need to upgrade until editing becomes a full-time job.\nAt first, I was hesitant to jump ship from the Adobe suite. Sure, Premiere Pro was janky and crashed way too often, but my subscription also came with access to tools like Photoshop and After Effects, which I relied on for my own video projects. Surely, a free video editor couldn't replace all of that, I thought. I couldn't have been more wrong.\nMaking the basics accessible\nI've come to expect one of two major drawbacks from free video editors: either they have basic functions that work while advanced tools are busted, or they rely on gimmicks like AI to \"edit for you\" in a way that rarely works. The ByteDance-owned CapCut is a good example of both. It's fine for editing TikTok videos, but if you want to grow your skill set, you'll probably hit a ceiling quickly.\nDaVinci Resolve, on the other hand, is built for professional-level video editing first. Which means if you need to sync footage for multi-cam shoots, or dive into color spaces, the options are available. For beginner users, though, all that extra stuff doesn't get in the way. One of my favorite aspects of Blackmagic's design (both in Resolve and its on-board camera software) is the company's emphasis on user-friendliness without sacrificing power.\nThe foundation of this approach can be seen in the toolbar along the bottom. Pages labeled Media, Cut, Edit, and Deliver automatically arrange your workspace for different tasks. This is more than just moving windows around, though. The Cut page, for example, is an excellent tool to build rough cuts from raw footage, without worrying about precise edits, transitions, audio levels, or any of the other fiddly bits that video editors have to obsess over. Just get your clips in the right order, and move to the Edit page when you're ready to fine tune.\nThe Color page is also Resolve's most famous superpower. Here, the app offers pro-level color grading that, frankly, I've never seen even attempted in other free video editing software. While it's built around Blackmagic's own BRAW format, it can handle a wide range of RAW formats, including ArriRaw, CinemaDNG, and Canon Cinema RAW Light.\nAn ode to nodes\nDaVinci Resolve might be a good video editor, but that wasn't going to be enough to persuade me on its own. After all, if I still needed After Effects, I may as well stay with Adobe. Though, now that I think of it, After Effects is also pretty clunky these days. And after getting used to node-based interfaces in apps like Blender, I was getting tired of AE's approach of relying on layers, like animation cels, to build effects.\nEnter Fusion. One of Resolve's dedicated editing pages, Fusion is a full node-based effects suite. If you're used to After Effects, adjusting to nodes can take some getting used to, but the benefits are worth it. Nodes are, essentially, a visual representation of a set of instructions. Think of it like a flow chart, where each node is a specific set of instructions. You can reuse nodes, create non-linear instruction sets, and best of all, easily preview your effect at any step in the chain.\nFor example, in the screenshot above, I have a simple node tree setup that I put together for a CRT pixel effect. I take the initial video, split it into three nodes that isolate the red, green, and blue channels from the video. In the next step, I multiply those channels by a repeating pixel texture. Then in the final step in the chain, I recombine them into a final image. The result?\nNot bad, right? Of course, there are a thousand ways to make (and improve) this effect\u2014personally, I'm not happy with how dark the final image is, so I'll likely keep tweaking this\u2014but the node setup means that not only can I easily adjust any step of the process, but it's easy to tell at a glance what the node tree does.\nIn the node tree screenshot, you can also see a box with a small white dot underneath the first and last node. This is the viewer selection. Select the left most circle and a preview of the effect at that stage in the node tree will appear in the left preview window. Select the middle dot and it appears in the right-hand window. (In Resolve 20, the third dot is for a VR preview, for some reason.)\nThis foundation of an intuitive, useful interface supports a robust library of powerful effects tools like depth maps and excellent modifiers. It's also incredibly easy to save and share node trees\u2014just select and copy the nodes and you can either paste them directly in Resolve, or into a text document for sharing online. It's a deep pool of tools worth exploring.\nAI, but actually good this time\nThe final straw for me in making the switch from Adobe products to Resolve was when the two companies' approaches to AI started to crystallize. Adobe touted the use of generative AI for extending the duration of video clips, or searching for clips by describing what's in them. Not necessarily a bad toolset, but, to me at least, it felt like AI for the sake of it. And, frankly, I just don't trust an artificially extended clip to look as natural as just shooting it right the first time.\nMeanwhile, the latest version of Resolve introduced something much more useful to me: IntelliScript. This feature can take your video's script and automatically assemble a rough cut from your footage. While it's not perfect\u2014and it particularly gets tripped up by improvisation or incomplete takes\u2014I was able to build an initial rough cut of a nearly two hour video in less than an hour.\nThis tool is actually built out of a few other smaller tools, many of which are also AI-powered in a very targeted way. Resolve has had automatic video transcription for a few years now, and its text-based editing lets you select clips by simply highlighting the text being spoken. IntelliScript automates this process, and even selects multiple takes of the same line and layers them in multiple video tracks on top of each other. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a start.\nA lot of Resolve's AI-powered features are like this. Rather than starting with generative AI and forcing a way to make it a feature, Resolve's AI features stem more from real-world use cases. The Relight tool, for example, uses machine learning models to relight a subject in post, without having to fiddle with complicated masks. It's a surprisingly powerful tool that supports the editor's goals, rather than trying to replace creative work directly.\nIn fairness, Adobe has added some similar features\u2014Premiere Pro added text-based editing after Resolve did\u2014and most of the AI-powered features in Resolve require the paid Studio edition. The fee is worth it though, in my opinion, as Resolve seems to be doing a better job of coming up with useful features (whether AI-powered or not) and implementing them first. And often better.\nPicking a good video editing suite is always going to be a deeply personal choice, and the bigger your productions, the more complicated the logistics of switching. But after years with Premiere Pro, I can safely say Resolve has met all my needs, and the transition was far less bumpy than I expected.\nOh, and Resolve hasn't crashed during a render once, in the entire time I've been using it. So there's that."

The editor supports templates, stock media, voice\u2011over generation, and the new Veo\u202f3 AI video generator, which creates short clips from prompts but still requires careful prompting and subscription credits. Google also released a Gemini Prompt Guide to help users craft effective AI prompts across roles such as marketing and sales. While Vids is handy for quick edits, professionals may turn to more robust tools like DaVinci Resolve, which offers advanced editing, color grading, and node\u2011based effects with optional AI\u2011powered features in its paid Studio edition.",
