  "description": "President Trump has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff as a mark of respect for the victims of the \"senseless acts of violence.\"",
  "content": "President Donald Trump and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday, Aug. 27, ordered Michigan and U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff across the United States to honor victims of the \"senseless acts of violence\" that took place in Minnesota earlier in the day.\n\nTwo children were killed and at least 17 were injured when a man shot through the windows of Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis. Young students were at Mass at the time of the shooting, authorities said.\n\nHere's what you should know and the latest news about the shooting in Minnesota.\n\nWhy are flags flying at half-staff today?\n\nHours after the shooting, Trump issued a proclamation ordering U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff across the country.\n\n\"As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence ... I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff,\" the proclamation said.\n\nWhitmer issued an order as well Wednesday afternoon, \"in accordance\" with Trump's order.\n\n\u201cMichiganders' hearts are with the students, families, and teachers of Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, Minnesota,\u201d Whitmer said in a release. \u201cTo honor those we have lost, I am ordering flags to be lowered across Michigan. Let\u2019s also keep those who were injured and in the hospital in our thoughts. We are grateful to all the first responders and medical professionals for their hard work and steadfast in our belief that every child deserves to learn and grow up without fearing for their life.\u201d\n\nHow long should flags be flown at half-staff for the victims of Minnesota shooting?\n\nFlags should be flown at half-staff until sunset Aug. 31, Trump's proclamation said.\n\nWhere should US flag be flown at half-staff?\n\nThe U.S. flag should be flown at half-staff at the White House and all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the federal government in the District of Columbia.\n\nFlags also should be flown at half-staff at all U.S. embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.\n\nMichigan flags within the State Capitol Complex and upon all public buildings and grounds across the State of Michigan wil be lowered to half-staff to honor and remember the victims of the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Whitmer's release said.\n\nWhat happened at Annunciation Catholic School in Minnesota?\n\nTwo children were killed just before 8:30 a.m. Aug. 27 and at least 17 people were injured when a man shot through the windows of Annunciation Church in Minneapolis. Inside, students were attending Mass, authorities said.\n\nThe church also has a school. Students started their school year just two days prior to the shooting, Aug. 25, according to the school's calendar. Thursday was scheduled to include a butterfly release.\n\nAn all-school Mass was scheduled for 8:15 a.m. Wednesday, just minutes before the shooting started.\n\nThe shooter, identified as Robin Westman, 23, approached the outside of the church building and fired inside toward the children sitting in pews, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara.\n\nThe children killed were ages 8 and 10. Fourteen of the 17 injured victims were children, and two were in critical condition, O'Hara said.\n\nThe assailant died at the rear of the church from a self-inflicted wound, according to O'Hara, who said the weapons used in the attack had been purchased legally and recently.\n\nHow to correctly fly your flag at half-staff\n\nOn days when the flag is flown at half-staff, it should first be raised to the top of the pole for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position, according to the U.S. Flag Code.\n\nBefore lowering the flag, it should again be raised to the top before being lowered for the day.\n\nWhat is the difference between 'half-staff' and 'half-mast'?\n\nHalf-mast refers to flags lowered on a ship, while flagpoles are called staffs, according to Americanflags.com. Flags lowered on shore are called half-staff, as flagpoles on the ground or buildings are called staffs.\n\nHow do I know when Michigan flags are at half-staff?\n\nIn Michigan, you can sign up for alerts when flags should be flown at half-staff.\n\nThe Governor orders U.S. and Michigan flags to be lowered to half-staff throughout Michigan in accordance with Executive Order 2013 -10. Additionally, flags will be flown at half-staff as proclaimed by the president of the U.S.\n\nIn addition, the flag is always lowered to half-staff on the following days by Governor Whitmer:\n\u2022 None Peace Officers Memorial Day: May 15 \u2014 half-staff from sunrise to sunset; except when Peace Officers Memorial Day falls on Armed Forces Day (third Saturday in May)\n\u2022 None Memorial Day: Last Monday in May \u2014 the flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon, then raised to the top of the staff.\n\nFlag honor notifications are issued by governor and are posted in the governor's newsroom. To receive email notifications of flag honors, users can sign up for alerts via GovDelivery.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lansing State Journal: Flags at half-staff in Michigan after Minneapolis, Minnesota, shooting",

      "text": "'Absolutely breaks my heart': Minneapolis community mourns after deadly shooting: Updates\nEditor's note: This page summarizes news on the Minneapolis school shooting for Wednesday, Aug. 27. For the latest updates on the shooting at Annunciation Church, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Thursday, Aug. 28.\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2212 Two children were killed Wednesday and at least 17 people were injured when a shooter fired through the windows of a Minneapolis Catholic Church toward young students worshipping at Mass, authorities said.\nThe shooting occurred at Annunciation Church, which also houses a school, just before 8:30 a.m., authorities said. The shooter approached the outside of the church building and fired inside toward the children sitting in pews, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said.\nThe two children killed were ages 8 and 10. Fourteen of the 17 injured were children, and two of them are in critical condition, O'Hara said.\nThe assailant died at the rear of the church from a self-inflicted wound, according to O'Hara, who said the weapons used in the attack had been purchased legally and recently.\nAuthorities at an afternoon news conference identified the shooter as Robin Westman, 23. FBI Director Kash Patel said the attack is being investigated as \"an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics.''\nThe Mass was in celebration of the first week of school, authorities confirmed. \"The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,\" O'Hara said.\nDevelopments:\n\u220e In addition to the 14 injured children, three parishioners in their 80s were wounded in the shooting, O'Hara said.\n\u220e The school posted a message on Facebook sharing its grief and expressing gratitude to its \"heroic staff'' and law enforcement for their efforts to protect the students after the attack began.\n\u220e The shooting came after at least three other fatal shootings in the city in the last 24 hours that do not appear to be related to the Annunciation incident, O'Hara said.\n'Absolutely breaks my heart': Community gathers at vigil for victims\nTears dripped down Rosemary Andrade\u2019s cheeks as she picked up a marker and wrote a message on a cross. The cross is a memorial for the eight-year-old child who died in the shooting. Another cross for the 10-year-old child who died sat next to it.\nAndrade, 17, remembers sitting in the pews of Annunciation Church herself. She told the USA TODAY Network on Wednesday that she was a student there for nine years. She said the shooting hit home.\n\u201cKnowing I could have been in those benches, that I was once in those benches at that church, praying to God,\u201d Andrade said. \u201cKnowing what happened to those kids, who didn't deserve that, absolutely breaks my heart.\u201d\nAndrade is among the many Minnesotans who attended a prayer vigil for the two children. Attendees sat in folding plastic chairs, on bleachers, and stood along the sides to hear Archbishop Bernard Hebda speak in the Academy of Holy Angels High School gymnasium that night.\n\u201cI'm not usually that emotional, but I was genuinely shaking,\u201d said Elaina Polding, 17, who goes to youth group at Annunciation Church.\nHebda spoke with the USA TODAY Network after the vigil. As the FBI investigates the attack as \"an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics,\" he stressed the importance of holding onto faith.\n\"We really have no other choice than to stick to our faith,\" he said. \"That's who we are, and we hope that we're always going to be a community of love that welcomes, but we have to be faithful to who we are.\"\nFirst lady calls for 'pre-emptive intervention' to identify potential shooters\nIn a rare statement on X, first lady Melania Trump called for \"pre-emptive intervention\" to identify \"potential school shooters.\"\n\"Early warning signs are often evident, with many individuals exhibiting concerning behaviors and making violent threats online prior to their actions,\" Melania Trump wrote, adding that being aware of those signs and \"acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer.\"\n\"To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioral threat assessments across all levels of society\u2014beginning in our homes, extending through school districts and of course, social media platforms,\" she said.\nThe first lady also called the shooting a \u201csenseless and depraved violent act,\u201d and shared her condolences for the victims' families and friends.\n\"There is nothing that anyone can say to make your grief go away, but please know that you are not alone. My thoughts, love, and deepest sympathy are with you during this dreadful time,\" she added.\nChildren as young as 6 injured\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Center said it received 10 of the most seriously injured victims. Earlier, the hospital reported that it had 11 patients.\nMost of the patients were children who ranged in age from 6 to 14, according to Dr. Thomas Wyatt, chair of emergency medicine. Four of the patients required surgery, he said, adding that the area children's hospitals treated some of the other, less critical pediatric patients.\nIn a later update, the hospital said one adult and five children remained in critical condition. Three other children and another adult were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.\nSocial media statement taken down\nAt an afternoon news conference, O'Hara referenced online messages from the shooter released Wednesday that were timed to publish during the attack. He said the FBI ordered the YouTube clips to be taken down and was reviewing them.\n\"This manifesto appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings,\" said O'Hara, adding that police have not ascertained a motive.\nAsked whether the assailant had attended Annunciation school, O'Hara said investigators haven't confirmed that but are looking into it. According to public records cited by Reuters, Westman's mother, Mary Westman, had been an administrative assistant at Annunciation Church.\nArchived versions of the videos from the now-deleted YouTube page show the shooter displaying a handwritten journal and an arsenal of firearms and ammunition. The footage, posted hours before the shooting, alluded to a handwritten note that includes the name Robin Westman. The videos included a handwritten map of the interior of Annunciation Church. The note references severe depression and suicidal thoughts.\nThe shooter\u2019s firearms were marked with a variety of political slogans in silver marker in both English and Russian. O'Hara said police were processing four search warrants seeking the shooter's motive and had seized other firearms.\nShooter had messages on rifle magazine, DHS chief says\nIn a post on social media, Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the shooter had the words, \"\u2018For the Children\u2019 and \u2018Where is your God?\u2019 and \u2018Kill Donald Trump\u2019 on a rifle magazine.\"\n\"This level of violence is unthinkable,'' she wrote. \"Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere.\"\nLongtime neighbor vouches for Westman family as 'great people'\nThe Westman family home is about half a mile southwest of Annunciation Catholic School. Terry Cole has lived in that same Windom neighborhood for more than 20 years.\u201cWe walk around the neighborhood and we can tell you who lives in every house,\u201d Cole said, expressing surprise a member of the Westman family would be involved in such a brutal attack. \u201cThey\u2019re great people,\u201d Cole said.As Cole and the neighborhood move forward, the impacted families are top of mind. \u201cIt just feels so bad for both of (the victims) and for the families,\u201d Cole said.\nPope Leo sends his condolences to the Twin Cities\nPope Leo XIV sent his \u201cheartfelt condolences\u201d to church leadership in the Twin Cities, according to Archbishop Bernard Hebda of Minneapolis and St. Paul.\nHebda said he received a telegram in which the first American leader of the Catholic Church also expressed \"the assurance of spiritual closeness to all those affected by this terrible tragedy, especially the families now grieving the loss of a child.\"\nThe Pontiff commends \"the souls of the deceased children to the love of Almighty God\" and \"prays for the wounded as well as the first responders, medical personnel and clergy who are caring for them and their loved ones,\u201d according to the telegram.\nPope Leo imparted his Apostolic blessing on those impacted by the tragedy as a \"pledge of peace, fortitude, and consolation in the Lord Jesus.\u201d\n\u2212 Amanda Myers\nShooter fired from outside the church\nThe shooter, who was not immediately identified, fired through church windows from the outside of the building. The attacker may have also gone inside the church, but investigators haven't determined whether the person also fired from inside the building.\nThe number of rounds fired was \"in the dozens,\" O'Hara said. The shooter is believed to have used three firearms: a rifle, a shotgun, and a pistol.\n\"Children are dead,\" Mayor Jacob Frey said. \"Those families are suffering immense pain right now. Think of this as if it were your own. Every one of us needs to be wrapping our arms around these families, giving them every ounce that we can muster.\"\nLocal business went into lockdown, says shooting hits close to home\nHours after Kowalski\u2019s Markets in south Minneapolis opened for the day, Johna Green was standing outside the store when she heard gunshots ring out down the block at Annunciation Catholic School.\n\u201cIt was very rapid fire, probably like 20 to 30 shots total,\u201d Green told USA TODAY, adding that she hustled her customers inside and the store went on lockdown.\nGreen said the shooting has hit close to home, particularly because store employees recently lost a loved one to gun violence and have a close relationship with the school. \u201cThose kids come in here every day and get our donuts, we do donations to the school all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis really hits hard for us.\u201d\nBen Olson, who works down the street at Fixt Rite Auto Repair & Tire Center, said he noticed a handful of squad cars on his way into work, and by 9 a.m. a heavy law enforcement presence had engulfed the area. From his position about a block southwest of the school, he could see crowds of students and parents leaving and hear a helicopter circling overhead.\n\u201cWe're very concerned. A lot of us here are parents and have young children that are either just about to enter school or are already in school,\u201d Olson said. \u201cAnd us being kind of a staple in the community here, it\u2019s very concerning because we\u2019re very close with a lot of the neighborhood residents here and have been for quite some time.\u201d\n\u2212N'dea Yancey-Bragg\nGovernor decries 'horrific act of violence'\n\"I\u2019m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence,\" Minnesota Gov. Walz said.\n\"There is no active threat to the community at this time,\" the Minneapolis Police Department said in an update earlier Wednesday.\n\"A man dressed in all black and armed with a rifle was reported at the scene,\" neighboring Richfield Police said in a social media post.\nStudents were in their first week of school\nStudents at Annunciation Catholic School were in their first week back from summer break, according to Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith.\n\"These kids should not be fearing for their lives,\" Smith said.\nThe Annunciation Catholic School has students from preschool through eighth grade, according to its website.\nParents rush to the site of the shooting\nParents were seen rushing to the school amid the chaos. Both parents and students trickled down West Diamond Lake Road as law enforcement officers blocked the street roughly half a mile from the church.\nMany law enforcement agencies were on the scene, including the Minneapolis Police Department, State Patrol and the FBI.\nNeighbor recalls hearing gunshots\nResident David Gartner texted his neighbor when he first heard what seemed like roughly four spurts of gunfire. \u201cIt sounded like a nail gun at first,\u201d Gartner said.\nThe street was initially calm, and he said the only sign a shooting took place was moments later when police arrived.\nGartner has lived near the border of Minneapolis\u2019 Windom and Tangletown neighborhoods for more than 25 years. He said nothing like this has happened in the immediate area before.\nNow he and his neighbors are outside waiting to learn more. \u201cThe neighbors are all out checking on each other,\u201d he said.\nInterfaith chaplain to parents: 'God is always with you'\nInterfaith Chaplain Howard Dotson met with parents and students at the reunification point. Dotson said he arrived at the school around 9:15 a.m. and saw students coloring pictures of hearts.\n\"I told the children and parents, \u2018God\u2019s hedge of protection is around you. God protects your heart and mind. God is always with you,'\" Dotson said.\nThe chaplain said his favorite interaction was with the music teacher, who he said told him students sang songs like \u201cLord Prepare Me to be a Sanctuary.\u201d Dotson said music and art can help students cope with the shooting. He would like Minneapolis to bolster its use of chaplains in crisis response.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough chaplains,\u201d Dotson said. \u201cWe need more chaplains, psychological first aid, because these traumatic incidents keep happening, and people need that emotional, spiritual support immediately.\u201d\nFlags at half-staff to honor shooting victims\nPresident Donald Trump ordered all flags on government property to be flown at half-staff as \u201ca mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated,\u201d the White House said on X.\nThe proclamation, which orders flags to be lowered at public buildings, on naval ships and at military posts nationwide and abroad, will be in effect until sunset on Sunday.\n\u2212 Christopher Cann\nReligious leaders express shock and sadness\nLocal religious leaders were quick to condemn the bloodshed.\n\"Our hearts are shattered by the horrific act of violence that occurred at Annunciation Catholic Church and School in Minneapolis,\" Patrick M. Neary, the bishop of The Diocese of Saint Cloud, said in a statement.\nHe added: \"As Catholics, we believe in the dignity of every human life. That dignity is destroyed when violence becomes routine.\"\nThe Sisters of the Order of Saint Benedict reacted to the shooting in a Facebook post.\n\"Our hearts grieve with Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis and with the two families who have lost a child,\" it said. \"These acts of violence are horrific, senseless and far too frequent. Lord, have mercy on our world, and be with the students, families, staff and community in this tragic time.\"\n\u2212 Teagan King\nAnnunciation Church rampage is the latest mass shooting in the US\nThe deadly shooting at Annunciation Church was the 286th mass shooting in the United States, and the latest to rock the city of Minneapolis, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive.\nThe organization defines a mass shooting as an incident in which at least four people are struck by gunfire, not including the shooter. This year, mass shootings have broken out in 43 states and Washington, D.C., the nonprofit says.\nMinneapolis has experienced at least six mass shootings this year, data shows, including an incident on Tuesday in which a gunman opened fire on a group of people standing on a sidewalk across the street from a high school, killing one person and injuring six others.\n\u2212 Christopher Cann\nShooting erupts after at least 3 others in the past 24 hours\nThe school attack followed within 24 hours at least three other fatal gunfire incidents in Minneapolis, including a mass shooting on Tuesday afternoon in which one person died and six were injured when a gunman opened fire in broad daylight at people standing on a sidewalk.\nTwo other people were killed in two other shootings in the last day, according to the Minneapolis Police Department. Police said it was unclear whether the first three shootings were related.\n\"The level of gun violence across the city within the last day is deeply unsettling,\" O'Hara said in a statement after the third reported shooting early Wednesday."

      "text": "What we know about Minneapolis shooting suspect Robin Westman\nCryptic writings are at the forefront of a domestic terror investigation into Robin Westman, who authorities say killed 2 kids and injured 17 others.\nThe writings left behind by the shooter in Wednesday's deadly attack at a Minnesota church have many of the underpinnings of a troubled person - and just as much confusion over why the mass shooting occurred.\nThe suspect, Robin Westman, 23, appears to have posted at least two videos on YouTube. The first showed a multiple-page document written in English but in Cyrillic characters. The second showed a four-page document in which the shooter apologizes to family and friends and writes about feeling pain and suffering.\nThe rest of the video shows the shooter displaying an arsenal of weapons including a rifle, a handgun, a shotgun and several magazines of ammunition, scrawled on with a mishmash of political messages and in-jokes.\nAuthorities say the cryptic writings are at the forefront of a domestic terror investigation into Westman and what FBI Director Kash Patel said was anti-Catholic attack that killed two children and injured 17 others during a Catholic school Mass before committing suicide in the rear of the church.\nBut like with many mass shooters, Westman's motives - even with the detailed writings - will be hard to decipher into anything meaningful that could prevent future attacks. Westman is believed to have been a former student at the Annunciation Church and Catholic School in Minneapolis, but authorities say it's unclear what role that may have played.\nThere are clues the shooter was active in hateful online communities. The word \u201cSkibidi\u201d was written on one magazine of ammunition found at the scene of the attack, a possible reference to a short-lived online extremist message board taken down a few weeks ago.\nThe writings also reference two other mass shooters. The name \u201cRupnow\u201d is written on a rifle, a possible reference to Natalie Rupnow, who killed three students at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, last December and injured six others, and \u201cBreivik,\u201d an apparent reference to Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in an attack in Norway in 2011.\n\"It's very early to fully assess what may have brought about this horrific violence,\" said Rachel Carroll-Rivas, interim director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center. \"But early indications show a young person expressing a mix of ideologies, politics and inspirations. It may not fit neatly in a box.\"\nMinneapolis police and other law enforcement agencies responded to the scene of a shooting near Annunciation Church and Catholic School in Minneapolis on Aug. 27.\nA mixture of hate, directed at several groups\nPublic records show Westman's last known address was an apartment in the city's South St. Paul neighborhood.\nCourt records show Mary Westman, the mother of the suspected shooter, signed a petition to change her child's name in 2019. A handwritten filing said the \"minor child identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.\" A district judge approved the change in 2020 when Robin Westman was 17.\nAn analysis from the Anti-Defamation League noted that Westman's writings contain clear antisemitic messages as well as other racist content targeting Christians, Jews, Black people, LGBTQ+ individuals, Muslims and Hispanics.\nIn a post on social media, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the shooter had the words \"\u2018For the Children\u2019 and \u2018Where is your God?\u2019 and \u2018Kill Donald Trump\u2019 on a rifle magazine.\"\n\"This level of violence is unthinkable. Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere,\" Noem wrote. \"We mourn with them, we pray for healing, and we will never forget them.\"\nOfficials believe the shooter used three legally purchased firearms \u2212 a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol \u2212 and fired from outside the building through the church's windows.\nA video, a handwritten journal and an arsenal of firearms\nPolice officials referenced online messages from Westman released Aug. 27 that were timed to publish during the shooting. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the FBI ordered the YouTube clips to be taken down and was reviewing them for a possible motive, but USA TODAY was able to review archived postings.\nArchived versions of the videos from the now-deleted YouTube page show the shooter displaying a handwritten journal and a cache of weapons.\nThe videos included a handwritten map of the interior of Annunciation Church. Westman's firearms were marked with a variety of political slogans in silver marker in both English and Russian.\nFBI Director Patel said the attack is being investigated as \"an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics.''\nWhere is Annunciation Church and Catholic School?\nThe school is at 525 W 54th St. in Minnesota, about six miles south of downtown near the city's Windham neighborhood, about four miles northeast of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport.\nWhat happened in the Minnesota Catholic school shooting?\nThe shooting took place about 8:30 a.m. at the church, which also has a school on site, Police Chief O'Hara said.\nAccording to a preliminary investigation, O'Hara said the shooter approached the church building from the outside and fired inside toward children sitting in pews.\nThe Mass was in celebration of the first week of school, O'Hara said.\nThe children were worshiping God when gunfire rang out.\n\"Teachers were beginning a new school year. Families were entrusting their loved ones to the care of the church,\" Bishop of the Diocese of Saint Cloud Patrick M. Neary told USA TODAY. \"I grieve with every person who now carries the trauma of this senseless violence. As Catholics, we believe in the dignity of every human life. That dignity is destroyed.\"\nWho died in the Catholic school shooting?\nPolice reported that two children, an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, died in the shooting.\nFourteen of the 17 people injured were children and two of those children were in critical condition, O'Hara said.\nO'Hara said three church parishioners, in their 80s, were hit by gunfire and were being treated.\nInformation about the extent of their injuries was not immediately released by law enforcement.\nIt was not immediately known whether any police officers suffered injuries in the shooting.\nThis story was updated to add additional information.\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci and Corey Schmidt\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "The terms half-staff and half-mast are often used in dictionaries to describe lowering the United States flag on a flagpole, but did you know the two terms don't actually mean the same thing? There are subtle but significant differences, and it's important to understand what they are to show the proper respect. Let's explore the origins, significance, and correct usage of these common terms. To stay informed about when to lower your flag, download our free half-staff calendar. If your flagpole doesn\u2019t allow for lowering the flag, consider adding a mourning bow atop the pole as a respectful alternative. For a flag that\u2019s as durable as it is vibrant, consider our Beacon\u00ae Nylon American Flags \u2014 crafted to last while maintaining their bold colors. Shop now to find the perfect size for your display! What's the Difference Between Half-Staff vs Half-Mast? The term half-staff is uniquely American, with most countries, including the United Kingdom, using half-mast exclusively. So, how do you know when to use half-mast or half-staff? A simple guideline is whether or not you're on a ship. A flagpole on a ship is referred to as a mast. Lowering the flag on the ship's mast to honor the death of a government official is called lowering it to half-mast. On the other hand, if the flagpole is secured on the ground or to the side of a building, it's called a staff. Lowering the U.S. flag from the top of the staff is called half-staff. Both acts are done as a symbol of mourning. As stated in the U.S. Flag Code, only the President of the United States can issue a nationwide call to lower the flag. This act is generally reserved for a national tragedy or for the death of a member of the United States government, such as the Vice President, Chief Justice, or a member of Congress. State Governors can also order a statewide lowering of the flag for a person of note, like a police officer or firefighter. Why are Flags Lowered to Half-Staff During Times of Mourning? While the origins of lowering the flag in mourning aren't known, it's commonly accepted that it has Naval roots. Crews would lower the flag a short way to make room for an invisible flag, the flag of death, to fly. The first documented use of this tradition was for the death of John Hall, an English explorer. In 1612, he was killed by a Native Inuit who attacked him with a spear, likely in response to a Scottish explorer imprisoning four Inuits seven years earlier. On its trip back to England, the ship named the Heart's Ease flew its flags at half-mast to honor its fallen captain. How to Lower Your Flag to Half-Staff When the British took over the tradition of lowering the flag, they created a flag protocol to follow regarding the position of the flag. The person lowering the flag must first hoist it to the top of the flagpole before lowering it. Before taking it down for the night, the flag must first be raised to the top of the flagpole, then lowered and removed. Since America began as a British colony, we hold many of its traditions to this day, including guidelines on lowering the flag. When are Flags Flown at Half-Staff? There are numerous days throughout the year when the national flag is flown at half-staff, including: May 5 - National Firefighters Memorial Day May 15 - Peace Officers Memorial Day May 27 - Memorial Day September 11 - Patriot Day December 7 - National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day These official observances honor the lives and sacrifices of those who have served our nation, from fallen firefighters to military heroes. Flying your flag at half-staff is a meaningful way for individuals to express respect, unity, and shared grief during these occasions. While only governmental properties are required to lower their flags to half-staff on these days, individuals are encouraged to participate as well to foster a sense of community and solidarity.
