      "summary": "Apple is set to unveil its iPhone 17 lineup on September 9, 2025, with rumors pointing to a new ultra‑thin iPhone 17 Air, a redesigned Pro with an aluminum frame and full‑width camera island, and a new orange color for the Pro models. Speculated pricing includes a $50 hike across the range, potentially offset by a 256GB base storage for the Pro and Pro Max. Additional leaks hint at a vapor‑chamber cooling system, a single‑lens Air model, and new color options such as light blue for the Air. The event is expected to also showcase new Apple Watch models, AirPods Pro 3, and iOS 26 features like Liquid Glass and live translation. Overall, the rumors suggest Apple is balancing design refreshes with modest price increases amid tariff pressures and supply‑chain shifts.",
