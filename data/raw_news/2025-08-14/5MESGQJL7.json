  "content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Few things beat the heat like a couple of cold ones.\n\nLandon Dickerson strolled onto the field after Thursday\u2019s joint practice with a soft cooler slung over his shoulder. He set the bag down next to a circle of linemen and unzipped it. Soon enough, a small group of both Browns and Eagles offensive linemen were doing what any red-blooded soul might do on a sweltering afternoon after a few hours\u2019 work: chatting and grinning and sipping on icy beer.\n\nIt was the first time Dickerson, a three-time Pro Bowl left guard and all-time man\u2019s man, returned to the NovaCare Complex practice field since suffering a meniscus injury in Sunday night\u2019s practice at Lincoln Financial Field. Dickerson had minor surgery on his right knee on Wednesday and is aiming to return by the Sept. 4 regular-season opener. Dickerson stood at ease with the circle of linemen after Thursday\u2019s practice. He wore no brace \u2014 just a fabric sleeve on his right leg.\n\n\u201cI was very happy seeing him this morning when he walked into the locker room,\u201d said left tackle Jordan Mailata, who\u2019s started next to Dickerson for four seasons. \u201d I was kind of shocked that he was walking. You know, I was just very happy to see his bubbly face in the building and his energy. I\u2019m glad everything is OK.\u201d\n\nDickerson has earned the reputation of a tough player. He has a history of playing through pain. He played through a knee injury in Super Bowl LIX that had sidelined him for the second half of the NFC Championship Game. The difficulty associated with the Eagles playing without Dickerson for any amount of time can\u2019t be overstated. That the organization is targeting a Week 1 return speaks both to Dickerson\u2019s fortitude and his luck of sustaining minor damage.\n\n\u201cMan, he\u2019s just made of rubber,\u201d Mailata said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what injury he\u2019s going through during the game, he\u2019s just gonna keep pushing through. And it\u2019s inspiring, very inspiring, because then I hurt a finger, I hurt a toe, and I\u2019m saying. \u2018Aw, that hurt.\u2019 And he\u2019s playing out there with one leg, one knee, and I\u2019m just like, all right, I\u2019ve got to toughen up. And, man, I don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s something different about the mentality.\u201d\n\nMailata played through pain after going down on the field himself in Wednesday\u2019s practice. Mailata brushed the incident off, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been a very physical camp.\u201d Starting right tackle Lane Johnson, a two-time All-Pro, was given a rest day on Thursday. Now that Philadelphia\u2019s two-day joint practices with Cleveland are over, perhaps Mailata will soon be given one, too. The Eagles also practiced without wide receiver A.J. Brown (hamstring), offensive guard Kenyon Green (shoulder) and safety Lewis Cine (groin). Running back Saquon Barkley (rest) did not participate in team drills. Linebacker Zack Baun (shoulder) and wide receiver Elijah Cooks (shoulder) both practiced with limitations.\n\nHere\u2019s what The Athletic observed, with Zach Berman focusing on the defense and Brooks Kubena focusing on the offense:\n\n1. Keeping tabs on the cornerback competition: This was an Adoree\u2019 Jackson day with the first-team defense. He took almost all of the first-team reps while the Eagles try to determine who will start opposite Quinyon Mitchell. This was more of a run-heavy day for the Browns offense, so Jackson was not tested often. He allowed a completion to Jerry Jeudy down the left sideline when he tried to undercut the pass. There still is no separation at cornerback, and it will be interesting to see how much Jackson and Kelee Ringo play on Saturday. Jakorian Bennett is also in the mix.\n\n2. Sydney Brown took most of the snaps as the first-team safety in nickel. This practice showed Brown at his best. He was able to play downhill against the run, and he lived up to the \u201cheat-seeking missile\u201d description offered during his rookie season. Brown appeared quick, closing gaps in his run fits and finishing plays more aggressively than some of Cleveland\u2019s offensive players might have preferred. This competition is not finished yet, but if Brown\u2019s the starter, he\u2019s at his best when he can attack.\n\n3. It was a good Jeremiah Trotter Jr. day. He was all over the field making plays while taking the first-team snaps. Similar to Brown, you can see him fill gaps on running plays. In Year 2, Trotter knows the defense. It\u2019s still likely that Zack Baun and Jihaad Campbell are the top two linebackers, but Trotter is showing he can be effective \u2013 especially against the run.\n\n4. Drew Mukuba allowed a touchdown to Browns rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. down the seam on a play that might remind Eagles fans of April mock drafts when both were popular Eagles picks. On the ensuing two-point conversion, Mukuba intercepted a pass that bounced off the hands of a Browns receiver. The ball skills were impressive for Mukuba, and he bounced back quickly after allowing a touchdown.\n\n5. Even the Eagles\u2019 best defensive backs were vulnerable in coverage. Quinyon Mitchell, who\u2019s been a standout this summer, allowed a touchdown to Jeudy on a slant across the middle. Cooper DeJean allowed a touchdown to Jamari Thrash. Reed Blankenship trailed David Njoku in coverage on a touchdown. Joe Flacco made plays against the Eagles defense throughout the session.\n\n6. Nolan Smith came around the edge and back inside for a would-be sack against Joe Flacco. Jalyx Hunt also had a nice pressure on Flacco. The Eagles continue to rotate edge rushers with the first-team defense while trying to figure out who will be the third player in the rotation. Josh Uche, Azeez Ojulari, and Ogbo Okoronkwo are all candidates.\n\n7. Campbell rushed the passer from the overhang spot more than usual during this practice, and his athleticism was on display. (Campbell caught up with Myles Garrett after practice on Wednesday.) This won\u2019t be Campbell\u2019s chief responsibility, but it\u2019s clearly something the Eagles want to develop with the first-round pick.\n\n8. The Browns beat the Eagles on two trick plays: a halfback pass across the field and a hook-and-ladder on a two-point conversion. The Eagles were caught off guard both times. That\u2019s not something you typically see in joint practices \u2014 or in games, for that matter \u2014 but they\u2019re presumably examples that will come up in the film room.\n\n1. With Lane Johnson taking a scheduled rest day, Matt Pryor started at right tackle with the first-team offense. Brett Toth was again the first-team left guard in place of Dickerson. Johnson\u2019s day off gave position coach Jeff Stoutland more time to train his unit\u2019s depth. Darian Kinnard started out playing right tackle with the second-team unit with Kendall Lamm at left tackle. Three plays into the first of the second-team unit\u2019s team drills, rookie Cameron Williams subbed in at right tackle and rookie Myles Hinton subbed in at left tackle. Kinnard moved to right guard. The Eagles stuck with this arrangement in the second-team unit\u2019s two subsequent offensive series. Trevor Keegan was the second-team left guard. Keegan, a 2024 fifth-round pick, had been taking snaps as the third-team center. His focus has shifted to guard after Kenyon Green\u2019s shoulder injury.\n\n2. Jalen Hurts protected the ball more than he did Wednesday, when the Browns intercepted him three times, and the Eagles\u2019 passing game made gradual progress against a Browns defense that blitzed Hurts frequently on Thursday. In the first red-zone series, Hurts struggled to connect with receivers and flung a third-down pass incomplete after Browns edge rusher Alex White pushed past Pryor. The Eagles countered on the second series. Hurts quickly connected with Dallas Goedert in the flats while standing tall against Myles Garrett, who was unblocked by design. Two plays later, Hurts completed a third-down pass to DeVonta Smith over the middle, in heavy traffic, to move the sticks. In a later team drill, on third-down at Cleveland\u2019s 10, the Browns rushed six defenders, and Hurts struck Darius Cooper on a slant for a touchdown. The Eagles went up-tempo in their final red-zone series, but Hurts failed to connect with Smith on an end-zone fade against Denzel Ward near the back-right pylon.\n\n3. Since the Eagles held Saquon Barkley out of team drills on a rest day, Will Shipley received the lion\u2019s share of reps with the first-team offense. The 2024 fourth-round pick built on what\u2019s already been a promising summer for him. Shipley\u2019s prowess as a pass-catcher is most notable. During an up-tempo red-zone series, Shipley kept his balance along the left sideline while snagging a throw from Hurts. On the next play, a simulated third down, Shipley separated from his coverage defender with a hard cut towards the left sideline and caught a first-down reception from Hurts.\n\nThe 5-11, 209-pound Shipley is expected to be involved more after Kenneth Gainwell\u2019s offseason departure. On 65 offensive snaps as a rookie, Shipley had 30 carries for 82 yards and four catches for 35 yards. Barkley said, \u201cI think he\u2019s probably the best route-runner out of all the running backs on our team and has a great feel for seeing coverages, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Will,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cYou won\u2019t ever catch me having to say anything negative about Will Shipley. Just his preparation, the way he worked. My favorite thing about him, which people can\u2019t really see: He\u2019s super competitive. Super competitive. So, he keeps me young. Let\u2019s say that.\u201d\n\n4. Myles Garrett proved again why he\u2019s the highest-paid non-quarterback with a four-year, $160 million contract. The four-time All-Pro Browns edge rusher gave the Eagles problems throughout each of the first-team offense\u2019s five cycles of team drills. Garrett twice maneuvered past Mailata for minimum-contact sacks against Hurts. Garrett also provoked Mailata into being flagged for a false start. There was little Mailata could do post-practice than to tip his cap. Mailata, whom teammates believed was snubbed of a Pro Bowl selection in 2024, was ranked No. 69 among players on the top-100 players of 2025 list. He said Garrett supplied him with plenty of film to review, but the notes he takes won\u2019t apply to anyone else on the Eagles\u2019 schedule this season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one like Myles,\u201d Mailata said. \u201cSo, you can\u2019t apply what Myles does to anyone else. He\u2019s a freak.\u201d\n\nWhat will Mailata get out of reviewing the practice film?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a giggle,\u201d Mailata said. \u201cI\u2019ll get a giggle out of it, I\u2019ll be honest. I\u2019m just, you know, like, \u2018What the f\u2014? I did my f\u2014\u2014 job and yet I still got beat. How is that even possible? How is he still at below my knees and he\u2019s bending the corner?\u2019 He starts the rush in a four-point stance and by the time he\u2019s four yards upfield, he\u2019s still at that same point and it\u2019s kind of like, what am I supposed to do there? Just jump on him? None of that\u2019s possible. He\u2019ll just carry me to the QB. The guy\u2019s a freak. \u2026 When you go up against the best, you\u2019re able to learn from the next rep. It was kind of just like this lose-win, lose-lose-lose-win, lose-lose-lose. That\u2019s just how it felt like. I just kept on saying keep pushing for the next play, just do your job and then we\u2019ll fix it later.\u201d\n\n5. The Eagles deployed their fullback package for one play during a first-team offensive series that began at the Browns\u2019 40. Ben VanSumeren held onto a third-down throw from Hurts beyond the sticks, absorbing a big hit from Browns safety Grant Delpit. It was the biggest one-on-one collision of the day. Delpit, who tried to alter his body after flying full speed from the post, appeared to explain himself somewhat apologetically to VanSumeren afterward.\n\nIt was a notable sample of VanSumeren\u2019s progression as a pass-catcher. VanSumeren said he\u2019s worked with Eagles running backs coach Jemal Singleton to improve that part of his game. VanSumeren was not targeted in 2024.\n\nThe fullback package has been a rarity in training camp. The frequency itself is not strange. The Eagles only deployed a fullback on 23 plays in 2024, likely truncated due to VanSumeren\u2019s season-ending ACL tear in late November. VanSumeren also suffered an ankle injury during the first week of camp. Frequency is not indicative of whether the Eagles will carry VanSumeren on their 53-man roster. Both Eagles coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo have spoken in favor of carrying a fullback on the roster. VanSumeren also contributes on several of the special teams units.\n\nPatullo said on Wednesday that VanSumeren\u2019s ankle injury contributes \u201ca little bit\u201d to his training camp usage.\n\n\u201cA little bit of these are public practices, so I just got to be careful with how much you really want to do in those settings,\u201d Patullo added. \u201cSo a little bit of both.\u201d\n\n6. The Eagles opened the 2024 season with five wide receivers on their 53-man roster. Their bottom-end depth is noticeably improved this year. Could the Eagles carry six? Johnny Wilson, Ainias Smith and Terrace Marshall each got reps with the first-team offense on Wednesday. Smith dropped a third-down throw from Hurts during the unit\u2019s third series. When asked about the staff\u2019s upcoming decision, Sirianni said, \u201cWe love the competition part of it. I think, again, I think we talk about you can\u2019t be great without the greatness of others. Well, that doesn\u2019t just apply to Saquon running the football behind a great offensive line or A.J. and getting one-on-one looks because they\u2019re crowding in the box to stop the run game. That also applies to competition. You get better through competition. That\u2019s another form of you can\u2019t be great without the greatness of others. Terrace having a good camp is going to force Johnny to have a good camp and is going to force Ainias to have a good camp is going to force Darius Cooper to have a good camp, and that just elevates the entire room. I love that about him, that phrase is true in so many ways.\u201d",

      "text": "This article is part of our Rankings & Tiers series, an evaluation across sport about the key players, front offices, teams, franchises and much more.\nQuarterback Tiers results are in for 2025, with 50 NFL coaches and executives coronating two first-time Tier 1 QBs \u2014 including, finally, Lamar Jackson.\nAdvertisement\nThe panel combined to confer 46 top-tier votes on Jackson. That was twice his total from 2024, an indication the two-time MVP has proven his ability as a passer, including in the playoffs, at least to an extent.\nEvery 2025 QB Tiers ranking\nAnthony Richardson\nEagles\n- 2.18 Avg. tier\n- Retained tier Change from '24\nAmong the other highlights, Joe Burrow is a unanimous Tier 1 choice for the first time, Matthew Stafford makes his Tier 1 debut and Jayden Daniels sets a QB Tiers record for highest debut by a second-year QB.\nMeanwhile, Aaron Rodgers plummets to Tier 3, Caleb Williams checks in fourth among 2024 first-round QBs and Russell Wilson falls to Tier 4.\nDifference in overall rank year-over-year\nThe 2025 QB Tiers results are complete with commentary from the panel of 50 voters, who were granted anonymity to share candid evaluations. The panel comprised six general managers, six assistant GMs, six former GMs, five other executives, eight head coaches and 19 other coaches, including 15 coordinators.\nEach voter placed 34 veteran quarterbacks into five tiers, from best (Tier 1) to worst (Tier 5). Quarterbacks were then ranked by average vote and placed into tiers based on vote distribution. The survey excludes rookies because voters have not seen them play in the NFL.\nPatrick Mahomes\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n1 | Retained tier | 1 |\nVoters still consider Mahomes the best even though others have surpassed him statistically.\n\"I think Mahomes is the best quarterback to ever live,\" an offensive coordinator said, \"but the gap is smaller than it was a year ago.\"\nThis is Mahomes' fifth season as a unanimous Tier 1 selection. Only Aaron Rodgers, with six, has more unanimous selections since QB Tiers debuted in 2014.\n\"Mahomes is the best quarterback in the world,\" a GM said. \"Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson had better individual seasons. In fairness, the infrastructure around Patrick has eroded.\"\nMahomes led the league last season in game-winning drives (seven) and fourth-quarter comeback victories (five), per Pro Football Reference. Both were single-season career highs as Kansas City went 11-0 in games decided by eight or fewer points.\n\"Mahomes has the Brady seat now, until someone proves otherwise,\" an offensive coach said. \"Last year, I saw a headline saying something to the effect of, 'Mahomes' worst year to date, and the Chiefs are undefeated.' This is when this guy is too good for his own good.\"\nThe Chiefs' shrinking victory margins correlate with the shrinking gap between Mahomes, Burrow, Allen and Jackson.\n\"It would probably be Mahomes first just because he can beat you so many different ways,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He ain't fast, but he runs on you. He throws it from all over the place. I hate facing Lamar now that they have Derrick Henry. I hate to see Josh Allen, and then Joe (Burrow) has great targets, but you can get after him.\"\nMahomes ranked 10th in EPA per pass play, 17th in passer rating (93.5) and 26th in yards per attempt (6.8) last season.\n\"Patrick is obviously still a 1, but he is winning out of need at the end of games,\" a head coach said. \"That is what it's about, but Burrow, Lamar and Josh played better than him in quarters one through four.\"\nNo voters came close to placing Mahomes in any other tier.\n\"Criticizing him is like walking into the Sistine Chapel and saying, 'I like Michelangelo's drawings, but his sense of color is off,'\" a defensive coach with AFC West experience said.\nJoe Burrow\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n1 | Retained tier | 1(-0.1) |\nThis is Burrow's fourth consecutive season in Tier 1 and his first as a unanimous top-tier selection. Rodgers (six), Mahomes (five), Tom Brady (four) and Russell Wilson (one) are the only other unanimous Tier 1 selections in the survey's history.\n\"He is the closest thing to Joe Montana that I have seen,\" a head coach said. \"That is about as big a compliment I can give you as a quarterback.\"\nOne difference: Montana's San Francisco 49ers led the NFL in fewest points allowed during the 1980s, while Burrow's Cincinnati Bengals ranked 25th last season.\n\"To me, it's Mahomes and then Burrow if I had to rank them,\" a veteran offensive coach said. \"Burrow could be a 1 with a red cross on him. They don't protect him, and he gets the s--- knocked out of him constantly.\"\nBurrow played all 17 games last season, leading the NFL in attempts, completions, yards and touchdowns.\n\"He's a stud, particularly with those freaks he has out there at receiver,\" a defensive coach said. \"I respect the arm talent, don't get me wrong, but you have to be able to fool him presnap, and you have to be able to rush with four and get there.\"\nJosh Allen\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n1 | Retained tier | 1.1(-0.1) |\nAllen ranks a tick below Mahomes and Burrow even though some consider him the most challenging to defend. That's because a few voters valued pure passing over running strongly enough to place a line after Mahomes and Burrow.\n\"Josh Allen presents some issues that Mahomes doesn't present, just how strong he is and how good of a runner he is,\" one voter said. \"I watched him single-handedly beat us. It's just, God, you can't tackle him. And he's got a cannon.\"\nAllen set career bests in 2024 for EPA per pass play, sack rate and rate of pass plays gaining more than 15 yards.\n\"Josh Allen reminds me of (Brett) Favre when he was younger,\" an offensive coach said. \"He is like a bull in a china shop, trying to score 70 every week. Burrow does it like a surgeon.\"\nThe Favre comp seems less relevant after Allen suffered only eight turnovers last season. That was down from 22 in 2023, and a career low by far.\n\"Josh Allen is the toughest quarterback to defend,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He is a combination of Lamar and Burrow. Lamar is the better runner. Burrow is the better pure passer. Josh is right in the middle. He can sling the ball around for 400 yards. If you have that covered, he can run for 100 yards, too.\n\"The only thing that has been an issue for him is turnovers playing hero ball, and that was better last year.\"\nLamar Jackson\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n1 | Jumped 1 tier | 1.1(-0.5) |\nJackson has finally ascended into the top tier after two seasons of good health and great production in an offense showcasing his passing. He did so with 46 top-tier votes, twice his total from 2024 QB Tiers.\n\"Lamar has really done a great job, and I do not think it has been him that has let them down (in the playoffs),\" a defensive coordinator said. \"It has been other parts of their team. He has taken leaps and bounds in the last couple years.\"\nJackson set career bests last season for passing yards (4,172), yards per attempt (8.8), touchdown passes (41), interceptions (four), passer rating (119.6), sack rate (4.6 percent) and rate of passes gaining 15-plus yards (21.3 percent).\n\"There is a maturity of how he plays the game and when he turns on his magic,\" another voter said. \"We played them, and s---, he was almost perfect that day. He is definitely a 1.\"\nMost voters thought Jackson should have won MVP last season.\n\"It would have been his third,\" an offensive coordinator said. \"You can't win three MVPs, still be in your prime and not be a 1.\"\nOnly Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield made bigger year-over-year gains in average tier vote, remarkable considering Jackson already ranked in the top five a year ago.\n\"There was doubt before because it was off-schedule, it was running, it's not sustainable, they have a great defense, they have this, they have that,\" another voter said. \"The offense has put the ball in his hands more, to sling the ball around.\"\nVoters also thought the Ravens' improved skill players were a factor.\n\"I'm a firm 1 on Lamar now,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"Even last year's game in the playoffs, he brought them back. (Mark) Andrews drops the ball at the end. Lamar is the total package, a very unique player.\"\nMatthew Stafford\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n1 | Jumped 1 tier | 1.5(-0.1) |\nStafford is making his Tier 1 debut at age 37 after 11 consecutive seasons in Tier 2. His ability to work through a back injury that has sidelined him in camp will be key.\n\"I always had a high admiration for him as a competitor, arm talent and playmaker, but always thought he was a gunslinger,\" one voter said. \"He still has that in him, but his mind, his ability to process, think and communicate stand out.\"\nStafford's ability to process and play from the pocket has long endeared him to offensive coaches who prefer to play that way.\n\"I guarantee all your 1s for Stafford came from offensive coaches,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"Offensive coaches kiss this guy's ass all the time, especially guys from that system. He's really good, though. I would take him over (Justin) Herbert because he is a better passer, with better timing.\"\nIt wasn't just offensive coaches pushing Stafford into Tier 1. Far from it. Three GMs, one assistant GM, three former GMs, four other personnel execs and seven defensive coordinators accounted for the bulk of Stafford's 26 top-tier votes.\n\"That dude is something,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"Every time I watch him, I go, 'Whoa!' He is a high 2.\"\nThis coordinator reconsidered when asked what was keeping Stafford from Tier 1.\n\"There is really nothing,\" the coordinator replied. \"He's a 1. He's that good. They are a play away from (the NFC Championship Game) last year. He worries the s--- out of you.\"\nJayden Daniels\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | New to Tiers | 1.7 |\nNo second-year QB has made a higher Tiers debut than Daniels. His 1.71 average and 17 top-tier votes break the records C.J. Stroud set last year. Stroud had eclipsed 2021 Justin Herbert.\n\"What I respect most is it never seems too big for him,\" a defensive coordinator said of Daniels. \"He would stand in the pocket and deliver the ball. Once we saw him running around, it was, 'OK, he is going to be a problem.'\"\nDaniels became the only rookie starting quarterback in the Super Bowl era to reach a conference championship game without a top defense (Washington ranked 24th in defensive EPA per play, per TruMedia).\n\"He's a 2 with the arrow up,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"He can run, he can throw with accuracy and he's really calm \u2014 the s--- ain't too big for him, and it's easy to see when you are playing him. He doesn't get flustered.\"\nDaniels' 891 yards rushing last season ranked second to Jackson among quarterbacks. He is among 10 QBs in league history to average at least 50 yards rushing per game in 14-plus starts. The others: Jackson, Justin Fields, Bobby Douglass, Michael Vick, Randall Cunningham, Robert Griffin III, Russell Wilson, Jalen Hurts and Kyler Murray. Daniels might already be a better passer than most of those.\n\"He is probably the best passer in our division,\" a voter from one of Washington's NFC East rivals said. \"He is really good.\"\nDaniels commanded 13 more Tier 1 votes than the rest of the NFC East combined (Hurts got three, while Dak Prescott got one).\n\"This dude has got arm, legs and processing,\" another defensive coordinator said of Daniels. \"He just took his team to the championship game with a non-championship-caliber roster.\"\nCan Daniels sustain it? Stroud regressed after a stellar rookie season. Also, opponents seemed to figure out Washington offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury when he was in Arizona, where another dual-threat QB, Murray, failed to sustain early promise.\n\"I think he is tremendous,\" a head coach said of Daniels. \"I don't want to '1' him because I want to see another year. Get me halfway through that second year and I'll have a good feel. The defensive coordinators will have all had their shot.\"\nJustin Herbert\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 1.8(+0.2) |\nThe downward trend for Herbert among Tiers voters is clear. After peaking with 36 top-tier votes in 2022, the number has fallen to 29, 19 and now 13.\n\"A lot of people have him as an automatic 1,\" an offensive coordinator said. \"I want him to take it. It seems like he is almost there, but he hasn't really done it.\"\nThe talent is obvious.\n\"He is just a little bit robotic,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"You can tell, the way he processes everything, it is a click slower than some of the elites, but he is a stud \u2014 he is really good.\"\nShifting to a more run-oriented offense under coach Jim Harbaugh is another factor.\n\"He is probably like Joe Burrow lite,\" another voter said. \"Good player, can make all the throws, can decipher and operate. If they had more around him and he kept maturing, maybe there is some more there.\"\nThis voter thought the Chargers needed to add weaponry.\n\"They have like 18 running backs out there now,\" he said. \"They were so dependent on one receiver (Ladd McConkey) that we felt good matching up against everyone else.\"\nVoters wanted to see more from Herbert in critical moments.\n\"He's very smart and very competitive, but he lets little things distract him,\" an offensive coach said. \"He needs to forget about the little things. Jim (Harbaugh) will point that out to him and get it right. This will be a big year for him.\"\nJared Goff\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.1(-0.1) |\nGoff's standing in Tiers improved for a third consecutive year, resulting in career bests in ranking (eighth) and average vote (2.06).\n\"Goff and Burrow are probably the two best anticipation throwers that I have seen lately, so you have to put him at a 1,\" a head coach said. \"You might put him at a 2 from a pure quarterback standpoint \u2014 he struggles to extend plays \u2014 but the guy has played at a 1 level for three years.\"\nGoff has a league-high 96 touchdown passes over the past three seasons.\n\"You will see this year if it is the coordinator or the quarterback, but I think it has been more the quarterback than advertised,\" an exec said, noting that the Lions lost offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. \"Goff and Mayfield are legit guys who can get in a rhythm and dice you up. They are not as good as the top guys in Tier 1, but they deserve to be up there.\"\nEight voters placed Goff in Tier 3.\n\"He's a 3 because he needs the run game, he needs a defense, he needs all those things,\" one of these voters said.\nGoff's five top-tier votes this year are two more than he has commanded in eight previous QB Tiers appearances combined.\n\"He has definitely grown over the last couple years,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"Early in his career, if you got him to be just a dropback quarterback, he would make a lot more mistakes. He is better in that area as far as protecting the football. He has a good run game, they have a good team. I'm not going to hold that against him too much.\"\nC.J. Stroud\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.2(+0.4) |\nStroud remained solidly within Tier 2 despite suffering the fifth-largest year-over-year fall in average vote.\n\"He got rattled because of his offensive line, and you saw that in his play,\" one defensive coordinator said. \"When I watched them, I felt like he felt the rush. Because of that, I still think the talent is in there.\"\nStroud got one Tier 1 vote, down from 12 last year.\n\"Everybody wants to downgrade C.J.,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"His No. 1 receiver was out, the line did not play great, the run game wasn't there like it should have been.\"\nThis voter saw Stroud as a low 2.\n\"I read an article, they said it's time for him to take the next step,\" an offensive coach said. \"What is the next step? It's time for his team to take the next step. He's pretty damn productive.\"\nTwo voters compared Stroud to the Packers' Love.\n\"Very similar to Love in that some of the disguises, he'll hold the ball quite a bit, take some sacks, throw it into coverage at times,\" one of these voters said. \"The decision-making can be average.\"\nThe defensive coordinator who faced Stroud did raise concerns over the quarterback's 86-yard game against the Packers.\n\"He can carry the team,\" this coordinator said. \"He is special in my eyes because he can throw from the pocket, he can throw off-schedule, he has been really good with the game on the line. The one thing that would sway me to go to a 3 was his performance at Green Bay. I wasn't crazy about the play calls at the end, but if he had won that game, he would be a solid 2. He is a 2-3 to me.\"\nJalen Hurts\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.2(-0.1) |\nHurts' standing in Tiers barely changed after his Eagles won the Super Bowl with a run-oriented offense, a stacked roster and high-level production from Hurts on the biggest stage.\n\"Jalen does everything the right way for how they have been built,\" an offensive coordinator said. \"I see him as a really good player on a team with a bunch of really good players.\"\nThis is Hurts' third consecutive season in Tier 2.\n\"He has improved from the pocket, but when you play him, you still want him to beat you from there \u2014 that is the whole plan,\" a head coach said. \"If he can get out of the pocket in two-minute, he is effective as hell, and he has done it. But he has to do it with his legs in crunch time. The guys you want can do it with the arm and legs in crunch time.\"\nHurts has the lowest average tier vote for any quarterback coming off a Super Bowl victory since Eagles alum Nick Foles won as a backup after the 2017 season.\nThis speaks to the Eagles' ability to assemble top-notch rosters around their quarterbacks. Hurts also might be underrated.\n\"This is going to sound like I don't like him, but I do,\" a GM said. \"Just by the definition, I feel he is more of a 3. Am I on an island with that?\"\nNope: Eleven other voters also placed Hurts in Tier 3.\n\"Hurts is always a tough one for me,\" a former GM said. \"I think he is a 3. They are very talented around him, and he is not as consistent as a passer. They have a strong defense, great playmakers, great offensive line. He is able to function that way. But I don't know that he is the one that elevates them. That is not a slight.\n\"He is a good player. But putting him in that 2 category, I don't see that.\"\nHurts attempted 30 or more passes in each of the Eagles' first four games last season, but only once thereafter as Philadelphia leaned into its run game.\n\"They tried to throw it more early in the year,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He could not do that, so they said, 'Screw it, run the ball 40 times a game.' I still gave Hurts a 2. He is a winner, and he can do it sometimes.\"\nBaker Mayfield\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Jumped 1 tier | 2.3(-0.5) |\nAnother strong season in Tampa pushed Mayfield to career bests in ranking (11th) and average tier vote (2.30).\n\"He went from being a wild man to being a contained wild man now,\" an offensive coach said. \"He is still going to turn the ball over here and there, but he can elevate everyone around him through his style of play.\"\nMayfield's 33 votes in Tier 2 were one fewer than he commanded over the past five years combined.\n\"He has matured,\" a defensive coach said. \"Think of this: Same guy who was wearing a bath robe in a commercial when he played for the Browns?\"\nMayfield has gone from Dave Canales to Liam Coen to Josh Grizzard as his offensive coordinator in three years with the Buccaneers.\n\"To his credit, he has different coordinators the last few years, and he is getting progressively better,\" an exec said. \"His ability and playmaking has helped him get back to the place where he was drafted, first overall.\"\nCanales and Coen had never been primary play callers in the NFL. Both became head coaches after one season with Mayfield.\n\"You look at his path, s---, talk about playing your best ball with your back against the wall,\" a head coach said. \"Gotta give him a 2.\"\nDoes Mayfield's status as a No. 1 pick give him the benefit of the doubt over, say, Brock Purdy, who entered the NFL as Mr. Irrelevant?\n\"Baker has more playmaking ability \u2014 he can carry it a little bit more,\" one voter said.\nPurdy has benefited from playing in the same system.\n\"Purdy is a better, quicker decision-maker, and he sees it, and he has a little more touch on the passes, whereas Baker throws that b---- hard,\" another defensive coach said. \"He lacks some touch and may not get it out of there as quickly as the other guy.\"\nMayfield's ability to transcend systems works in his favor.\n\"You can see their design,\" a defensive coordinator said of the Bucs. \"You can see the play selection. More of the throws are going outside. I think they are opening his line of vision because he is a smaller guy. That is where I feel like Liam did a good job fitting the system around him.\"\nDak Prescott\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.4(+0.3) |\nPrescott slipped lower in Tiers than at any point since 2019 after missing nine games to injury last season. He still remained solidly within Tier 2.\n\"I'm not necessarily worried about anything when I play him, but he's just solid,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He will put the ball where it needs to be, he can scramble a little bit. If he has to carry it and throw it 50 times, you'll get him a few times. I think he is still good. I started to 2 slash 3 him, but I think he is a 2.\"\nEntering his 10th year, Prescott has as many seasons leading the league in average annual salary as he has playoff wins (two). Does any long-established QB need a deep postseason run more?\n\"He has proven when it comes to the big games, he can't win,\" another defensive coach said. \"I've had him as a 2 before, but over the years, it is the same thing over and over again.\"\nThe Cowboys infamously have not played in an NFC title game since the 1995 season, the longest drought in the conference. With six starts this season, Prescott will pass Tony Romo for the most by a Dallas quarterback during the drought.\n\"That place is so funny \u2014 it just teeters with disaster,\" an offensive coach said. \"They put the expectations so high, they can never reach them. Dak has been fantastic for what he is. He plays past his draft status all the time. He plays past his physical abilities most of the time. And then it catches up to him when it really matters the most.\"\nJordan Love\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.4(-0.1) |\nLove leveled off after his promising 2024 season, rising one spot in the rankings while his average tier vote improved by only four-hundredths of a point. Knee and groin injuries limited him at times last season.\n\"I do like his accuracy, his athleticism and his arm strength,\" one exec said. \"The vision and processing holds me back a little bit.\"\nOpinions surrounding Love were varied and fascinating.\n\"When we faced him last year, I felt like if you could get to him, you could rattle him,\" a defensive coach said. \"He distributes the ball, and they have big skill (players who are) tough to bring down. That is how he makes his hay. I do not watch him and think, 'Oh, he is f---ing people up.'\"\nAnother coach saw it the other way around, contending the Packers could do more for Love.\n\"Jordan does a great job,\" this coach said. \"He has a mastery of their offense, he handles multiple cadences and tempos well, and if anything, I think his growth is stifled a little by playing the coach's offense as opposed to doing more of what Jordan would excel doing.\"\nA defensive coach also found the Packers' offense interesting.\n\"When we played them, I was like, 'Man, this ball is going downfield \u2014 he don't give a s---,'\" this coach said. \"You don't see a lot of quarterbacks play like that these days. It's almost like they build it into their offense and see the benefits of making you defend the whole field and hitting a couple in exchange for a pick or two.\n\"It was interesting playing him. I came away thinking there is something different about this kid.\"\nLove led the NFL with 35 passes traveling 30 or more yards downfield. His 11 interceptions included throws traveling 34, 21, 14, 13, 13, 13 and 10 yards past the line of scrimmage.\n\"He is like what you wish Geno Smith was,\" an offensive coach said. \"He is a little bit of a gunslinger, and at times it gets him in trouble, but he is more consistently good than bad, where Geno is more toward the middle or back of that. Jordan has the physical talent to get away with it better.\"\nBrock Purdy\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.5(+0.2) |\nPurdy slid slightly, with seven fewer Tier 2 votes than in 2024, but opinions of him have not shifted fundamentally.\n\"He does more on tape than I think a lot of guys can do in terms of the anticipation and accuracy,\" an opposing coach said. \"Yes, it faltered at times. I also got the sense he was playing through some things. But when he is healthy and on, I don't think there are a lot of guys who are at the level he is at.\"\nPurdy leads the NFL in EPA per pass play over the past three seasons. He was fifth in 2024. Tua Tagovailoa also ranks among the top five. Some voters compared the two players as beneficiaries of their environments.\n\"When you play San Fran, you are thinking about (Christian) McCaffrey, you are thinking about (George) Kittle, you are thinking about (Brandon) Aiyuk,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"You know Purdy will get it to them, but you are not necessarily thinking about Purdy. You are facing their defense, all these skill guys, Kyle Shanahan.\"\nThe 49ers' defense fell off last season, and the offense wasn't the same without McCaffrey (Aiyuk also missed 10 games). Purdy could not save them from finishing 6-11.\n\"He's a facilitator for them,\" the defensive coordinator added.\nOne exec said Purdy possesses a conglomeration of winning skills and traits, with nothing special beyond his makeup.\n\"Purdy doesn't get enough credit,\" a head coach said. \"The draft is over, OK? The guy has played his ass off. Recognize that! He is not the last pick in the draft anymore. The guy is one win away from being a 1 for some people, if he won a Super Bowl.\"\nKyler Murray\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Retained tier | 2.7 |\nMurray has stood almost frozen in Tiers balloting since 2023. This year, Baker Mayfield passed him. Aaron Rodgers, Tua Tagovailoa and Trevor Lawrence slipped below him.\nIs treading water good for a highly paid quarterback stuck atop Tier 3?\n\"I've played him too much, and I still think he's a 3,\" a defensive coach said. \"I don't think he wins it for you in the two-minute drill. If you want to be in the top half of this league, you have to win in the two-minute drill and control it. He does not do that.\"\nAnother defensive coach who faced Murray saw things similarly.\n\"Creates the mismatch with his legs, not his arm,\" this coach said. \"He's Tier 3 with a good-looking baseball slide after his fourth scramble in a two-minute drill.\"\nMurray could use more help. He is one of 32 quarterbacks with at least 25 starts over the past three seasons. None of the 32 has gotten worse support from his defense/special teams on a per-start basis than Murray over that span.\n\"Kyler to me is a tough one,\" an offensive coach said. \"He is probably in that 3 category. You have to have a strong defense. He has not shown an ability to win it on his own.\"\nArizona owes its 14-22 record in Murray's last 36 starts to its defense (-110.4 EPA), not its offense (+41.6 EPA) or its special teams (+0.8 EPA, which is near average).\n\"I think he grew a lot last year,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He was a problem for sure when we played him. He cut down turnovers, used his legs a lot more, came into his own after the injury.\"\nMurray's efficiency fell off after Week 10.\n\"I still don't trust him,\" a GM said. \"He has 2 talent but is still a 3 to me. Is he committed to it? He always tends to tail off as the season goes on.\"\nAaron Rodgers\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Dropped 1 tier | 2.8(+1) |\nRodgers' average tier vote plummeted a full point from last year, a drop more than twice as large as for any other player (Daniel Jones fell by nearly one-half tier).\nIt's strange seeing him way down here.\n\"You are hoping for Brett Favre to the Minnesota Vikings, but they had Adrian Peterson, Percy Harvin and a bunch of dudes,\" one exec said.\nThe Steelers acquired receiver DK Metcalf.\n\"Aaron has had good route runners around him when he was at his best,\" a defensive coach said. \"I don't know who the route runner is on that team. Metcalf is like a bully, jump-ball, kill-you-in-the-red-zone guy. Truthfully, I have no idea how that works there.\"\nRodgers' age (41), late arrival to the team (June), lack of history with Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator (Arthur Smith) and recent injury history (torn Achilles in September 2023) are among the factors working against success in Pittsburgh.\n\"Too slow to consistently win with his legs, yet his mind and hard count will have your disguise broken and your D-line in the neutral zone multiple times a game,\" another defensive coach said.\nInitial reports suggest it'll take time for Rodgers and the offense to jell.\n\"They all have to be going into this with eyes wide open,\" an offensive coach said. \"Aaron obviously feels comfortable with Mike (Tomlin) and Arthur. He doesn't need to be No. 1 in the league in passing anymore. He needs to protect the football and throw touchdowns. He can still do that.\"\nThere's a good chance Rodgers will be healthier this year than last, when he was still working his way back from the Achilles injury.\n\"He can still see, and he can still fit balls in there,\" a former head coach said. \"He can't be dynamic like he was \u2014 scrambling, avoiding the rush and throwing it 60 yards down the field \u2014 but I still think he can play.\"\nTua Tagovailoa\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Retained tier | 2.8(+0.3) |\nThe Dolphins' offense averaged 24.1 points per game in 11 games with Tagovailoa in 2024, compared to 13.3 in six games without him.\n\"They literally cannot operate the offense when he is not out there, and then they are a top-10 offense when he is out there,\" an offensive coach said. \"I don't even like watching him play, but at this point, dude, I can't say you are not that guy.\"\nThat voter was among a dozen placing Tagovailoa in Tier 2, half as many as in 2024.\n\"He is probably a 2 on the production, but if the game is on the line, I'd be scared to death if he were my quarterback,\" an exec said.\nAnother voter called Tagovailoa \"damn near the most accurate quarterback\" in the NFL.\n\"It is the off-script plays that he doesn't have,\" a defensive coach said. \"And if it is not paired with the run game to draw the under coverage, then you don't get full utilization of his accuracy on the second and third level.\"\nThe result is a quarterback who can look really good or really bad, depending on the situation.\n\"He does a really good job of hitting these play-action windows and putting it on guys where it's catch-and-run and has good anticipation for it and can get it out of his hands,\" another defensive coach said. \"I have yet to see him carry his team when they are not clicking in other phases. Has Miami ever won where their run game is getting killed, they can't hit play-action stuff and it's just time for Tua to sling the ball?\"\nTrevor Lawrence\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Retained tier | 2.8(+0.2) |\nLawrence peaked in Tier 2 entering the 2023 season. He's fallen each of the past two years, with only flickering hope among voters that he'll ever challenge for Tier 1.\n\"I thought he would be better,\" a head coach said, \"but he just isn't naturally accurate.\"\nInjuries were a big factor last season.\n\"I always thought Lawrence was a unique talent from a body-type standpoint \u2014 so athletic for a guy that tall \u2014 and the way he played at Clemson was outstanding,\" another head coach said. \"But when I watched him this year (2024), the instinct wasn't as high there. He looked hesitant. He had some ugly tape.\"\nThe Jaguars are betting that improved health and new coach Liam Coen can help Lawrence get back to where he stood entering 2023, when he ranked eighth in Tiers voting and commanded 36 votes in the top two tiers. A coach impressed by Lawrence two years ago questioned how well the QB was seeing coverages after the snap in 2024.\n\"He hasn't proved that he can take the team up a level or make the team play better than they are,\" a former GM said. \"I definitely think Liam Coen can help him if he is able to be helped.\"\nA defensive coach who has faced Lawrence multiple times, including in 2024, didn't see anything special.\n\"He has missed a bunch of schemed-up shots (downfield),\" this coach said. \"There is nothing that scares you about the kid. How is he beating you unless he happens to hit on some of those deep ones? I don't know how much of that is scheme versus what he does and cannot do. There is nothing elite about him from a big-picture standpoint.\"\nGeno Smith\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Retained tier | 2.9(-0.1) |\nSmith, making his third consecutive appearance in Tier 3, inched up to a career-best 2.90 average. But this was more a case of Smith receiving fewer votes in Tier 4 than it was about him commanding more votes in Tier 2.\n\"Geno is pretty good at everything, but nothing stands out as an elite trait,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"There is not one X-Man power where you are like f---, this guy.\"\nFor a player whose average grade is in the middle, there's considerable variance in opinions on Smith.\n\"He has as good of arm talent as anyone, he is accurate and he has won games where he was the reason in some of those fourth-quarter victories and shootouts,\" an offensive coordinator said. \"He has had some struggles, too. What prevents him from being in that elite level? In the games that are really, really hard, he has not overcome those, although they did beat San Francisco this past year.\"\nAnother coordinator polled his staff, reporting that the room was split on whether Smith belonged in Tier 2 or 3. One person whose confidence in Smith has never wavered: Pete Carroll, the coach who revived Smith's career in Seattle and brought him to Las Vegas.\n\"I think he's a 2 because when the game is on the line, he can make the throws to win,\" a head coach said. \"He stands in there. Guys that can stand in there, take hits when the game is on the line, whether it's third down or two-minute, those guys are legit.\"\nThis coach placed Smith among the NFL's top 10 or 15 in two-minute proficiency, lauding him for his play over the years in shootouts against Detroit and Dallas.\nOthers see Smith as a quarterback whose team will always be looking to upgrade, with one defensive coordinator suggesting Smith doesn't solve post-snap coverage rotations quickly enough, leading to turnovers and negative plays.\n\"He is a game manager who is going to turn the ball over and can't carry it,\" a coach with multiple games against Smith said. \"Even when the team is good, you are always going to feel like we don't quite have the guy.\"\nBo Nix\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | New to Tiers | 3 |\nNix, the sixth quarterback selected in the 2024 draft, ranks second among them to Washington's Daniels heading into the group's second season.\n\"He looks pretty sharp, he knows where to go with the ball, he runs better than you think, he throws better than you think,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He looks like he is a good competitor who makes people around him better. That is what your quarterback has to do.\"\nOne GM whose team was not in the market to draft a quarterback said Nix was much better than he anticipated. He thought Nix would be a \"dink-and-dunk\" quarterback.\n\"I think the biggest strength is he is very mobile and can keep his eyes down the field when he's moving,\" an offensive coach said. \"He made big plays on the move. That being said, I'm being generous with the 2. Now you have people with tape on him. The one thing I know about Sean (Payton), he is no fool. He is going to get players in there. They should not have a shortage of playmakers.\"\nThe fit in Denver appears excellent.\n\"He was fortunate having a strong system and a strong defense,\" a former GM said. \"If he has a chance to be more, it is because that system really fits him well.\"\nAnother former GM said there's nothing surprising about Nix's early success.\n\"He's got processing, he's got vision and he's got accuracy,\" this ex-GM said. \"He is definitely going to win. He has a chance to elevate.\"\nOne coach predicted the hierarchy of the 2024 quarterback draft class would change over the next couple of years, like some other classes have recently. Could Nix overtake Daniels?\n\"What we are going to see is Sean Payton's ability to develop a quarterback relative to Kliff Kingsbury's ability to do that,\" this coach said. \"Both players appear to be dialed into the profession of quarterbacking \u2014 taking care of the body, coming in early, leaving late, being all about ball. I'm interested in seeing who is able to grow the most this coming year. I actually think Bo Nix is going to win out in that.\"\nSam Darnold\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Jumped 1 tier | 3(-1) |\nThe Seahawks swapped out Geno Smith for the younger, less expensive Darnold.\nDid they upgrade?\n\"I think Geno operates at a higher level, especially in critical moments,\" an offensive coach said. \"Sam's two-minute stuff versus Geno's two-minute stuff, that is where Geno separates himself.\"\nDarnold outdueled Smith in Seattle last season, tossing three touchdown passes, including the game-winner in the final four minutes, as Minnesota beat the Seahawks. Darnold had no interceptions. Smith had two.\n\"Sam, when you put the pieces around him, has as higher ceiling,\" another voter said. \"This is wild to say, but Geno is maybe better if your team is bad. Sam is better if your team is good.\"\nSmith could be the higher-variance player, by this way of thinking.\n\"Geno can look great, and you can win a game you should not win, but you are also going to lose two or three against teams that are the same as you because he throws a pick in the end zone, plays blind, doesn't see it,\" the voter added. \"Sam, when the team is bad, you are going to feel like, f---, this guy is limited, and we cannot overcome it. But when your team is good, you are going to operate really well.\"\nOthers think Darnold is well-suited to play in offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak's system, partly because of his familiarity with it. But there is no consensus yet that Seattle has found a long-term successor to Smith.\n\"I think Sam starts one year, and they go with the young kid,\" an exec said, referring to 2025 third-round pick Jalen Milroe.\nDarnold's poor finish with the Vikings lingered in the minds of voters.\n\"I like Darnold, but the end of the season killed me,\" one said.\nDrake Maye\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | New to Tiers | 3.1 |\nMaye, the third quarterback drafted in the 2024 class, checks in third among the group here, behind Daniels and Nix.\n\"Daniels and Nix went into a helluva lot better situations than Drake did,\" an offensive coach said. \"(Maye) is a big athlete that has good vision, can push the ball up the field, he can run, I think he's coachable. Josh (McDaniels) does a good job of eliminating negative plays with a quarterback, so I think that will help him.\"\nMaye took 32 sacks and suffered 10 interceptions in 12 starts. He barely played in two of the three starts that New England won, exiting one with an injury (the Patriots rested him after one series in Week 18).\n\"Drake turned the ball over a lot, he got injured and had a concussion,\" another coach said. \"But it was tough what they were doing offensively under Jerod Mayo.\"\nA defensive coach whose team faced Maye pushed back against some of the early excitement.\n\"I remember coming out of our game, and people were like, 'Oh, we saw the future,' and I'm like, 'I don't know about that; he made about three throws,'\" this coach said. \"Let's not Winston Wolf it yet.\"\nThe situation around Maye led some to punt on firm evaluations.\n\"His team was so bad,\" an offensive coordinator said. \"Vince Lombardi couldn't have gotten that team any more wins than they got. Maye has promise. There is talent. There is ability. I think he looked very natural at the position.\"\nA head coach said he thought Maye's physical stature made him a good fit for the weather in New England. Voters generally thought Maye could become a 2.\n\"The person and the leadership and the ability to run made him good as a rookie,\" another offensive coordinator said. \"He can ascend pretty quick if he can start to hit progressions.\"\nCaleb Williams\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | New to Tiers | 3.2 |\nWilliams entered the 2024 draft as the consensus No. 1 quarterback. He enters his second season facing questions about his ability to process and play quickly after taking 68 sacks, third-most in NFL history.\n\"I think that will come in time,\" a GM said. \"Maybe it is a little bit like Josh (Allen) early in his career, where he has so much good other stuff that you will live with some negative plays, and as he gets more snaps under his belt, that part will come.\"\nMost evaluations reflected some skepticism.\n\"He's got the talent to go up, but in terms of processing ability and getting the ball out of his hands, it was the worst we played against,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He just holds the ball forever. I'm thinking, 'The ball should go right there! Throw it! Throw it!' And he did not throw it.\"\nVoter after voter raised the same concerns.\n\"He is definitely a 1 talent,\" a head coach said. \"I just think it's going to take him longer than Jayden Daniels. He is not playing fast right now. There is something there. His processing to me was alarming watching the tape.\"\nSome thought new coach Ben Johnson would have to adjust expectations accordingly.\n\"You saw signs and ability, and I also think you saw signs and ability that scare you,\" another coach said. \"Nervousness in the pocket, inability to see and play on time. But I do not know yet if that was him or coaching. Parts of me wondered if you could get it done with this guy, but it's good enough to make you think you have a chance.\"\nVoters aren't necessarily betting against Williams, but they aren't betting on him, either.\n\"He's very talented,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"Ben is more under center. Caleb is more of a gun quarterback. That dynamic is going to be interesting to me. I would not be shocked if the kid plays well. Ben is good. He can adjust. I'm sure they will find a happy medium somewhere.\"\nBryce Young\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Jumped 1 tier | 3.4(-0.4) |\nThe Panthers ranked 14th in offensive points per game in the 10-game stretch after Young returned to the lineup in Week 8. They were 32nd across his 10 previous starts.\nThere was clearly improvement. What does it mean?\n\"Don't get fooled by the final games of a season when you are out of it and the teams you are playing are out of it,\" a veteran coach said. \"That is where his production came from. Everyone is excited about it. Now, you start the season over again, you are playing teams that are game-planning seriously, that have a lot to play for, and it's different.\"\nAn executive from an AFC team cast the lone Tier 2 vote for Young.\n\"I think he has taken that step,\" this exec said. \"He has learned to play at his size in the National Football League. He was a drop away from beating Philly. If he comes back in with that same type of play, which I think he will with the same coach and coordinator, you will see better, more consistent play.\"\nMost voters questioned how much better Young could get, suggesting the top of Tier 3 could be his ceiling.\n\"I was watching him in pregame, and I'm like, 'The ball does not jump off his hand very well, and he's small,'\" a defensive coordinator said. \"I just don't know if there's enough talent to really become a 2, to be honest.\"\nSome thought Carolina could get Tier 2 production from Young with a better supporting cast.\n\"The environment around him was better when he got reinserted to the starting lineup, which was huge, and then (Dave) Canales stopped calling the game with handcuffs,\" a GM said. \"He was super conservative, and then Bryce has to be in third-and-long the whole game. He's a great kid, so I want him to be successful. I'm optimistic. I would put him in 3, and then we'll see how far he can go from there.\"\nKirk Cousins\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Dropped 1 tier | 3.5(+1.1) |\nCousins is included in QB Tiers in case he lands elsewhere as the Falcons transition to Michael Penix Jr. as their starter.\n\"I look at Rodgers and Kirk Cousins similarly, as older players coming off the Achilles,\" an offensive coach said. \"If Cousins were starting in Atlanta, I would say Kirk would have a bounce-back year. I think Aaron will bounce back. Both will be healthier, and if that's the case, we will see the arm talent more.\"\nVoters suspected Falcons ownership was reluctant to trade Cousins after the team invested so much in him.\n\"He is probably in that 4 category right now, because where is he at physically?\" an offensive coach said. \"Is he starting to deteriorate so much? He should be a 2 if healthy. I just do not know if that is where he is at right now.\"\nVoters found Cousins' immobility striking last season.\n\"The things they did to keep him clean in the past, he could not do,\" a defensive coordinator said, referring to formations and plays putting the quarterback on the move.\nCousins peaked in QB Tiers last year with 31 Tier 2 votes and a 2.38 average, both career bests. He set career lows in 2025.\n\"His arm strength was not great and has fallen off a little more,\" a former GM said. \"I think that affected his confidence. Is that the injury, or is that him declining?\"\nRussell Wilson\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | Dropped 1 tier | 3.6(+0.4) |\nWilson, now on his third team in three seasons, has fallen in the Tiers rankings from tied for first (2020) to fourth (2021), eighth (2022), 16th (2023), 22nd (2024) and 26th (2025).\n\"If you are a quarterback who has to create time \u2014 instead of one who knows where everything is, hits his back foot and throws it \u2014 then this is what happens to you,\" a defensive coach said.\nGiants coach Brian Daboll has repeatedly said Wilson is the starter entering the season. The fact that Daboll needs to make such declarations reflects Wilson's tenuous status.\n\"He has pelts on the wall for two-minute offense, and you have to give him credit for that,\" a head coach said. \"I think he is a legitimate starter. I wish he would play better, but he's been in three offenses in the last three years. You know how that goes.\"\nPete Carroll, Sean Payton and Mike Tomlin all decided to move on from Wilson in recent years.\n\"What he had that was magical about him \u2014 the ability to create plays on the move \u2014 is gone,\" a defensive coordinator said.\nWilson's time as a full-season starter might be ending.\n\"He can still do some things, but I think he is just declining. Some of the throws he was good at are not there for him anymore,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"I did not feel like he was ripping throws. Even his deep throws were like airball stuff, hoping George Pickens makes a play.\"\nJustin Fields\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | Retained tier | 3.7(+0.1) |\nFields peaked among Tiers voters as a low 3 entering 2023. His average tier vote entering 2025 (3.74) is about what it was after his 2021 rookie season (3.72). The difference is that Fields has played enough to make it tougher for voters to envision meaningful growth.\n\"(The Jets) know who he is, what he is, and they are going to try to structure things for him,\" an offensive coach said. \"The problem is, the hardest thing to fix with a quarterback is keeping their eyes up the field, seeing the field and not being affected by the rush. And those are three of the worst things that he does.\"\nThe Steelers started 4-2 with Fields in the lineup last season. They ranked 20th in offensive EPA per play to that point in the season, while ranking fifth in combined EPA on defense and special teams.\nThat formula could work for the Jets.\n\"This is another guy who, in the pure-pass world, you say probably not,\" a head coach said, \"but you put him in Tier 3 because he is the run game, probably, and then on top of that, the Jets are hopefully going to play good defense. If they put together an RPO play-action system, this guy could easily be a really positive thing for them.\"\nFields' ability to run and his limitations as a passer lock in the Jets for one style of play.\n\"At the end of the third quarter, you will be down 8-10 points,\" another offensive coach said. \"Great, you kept it close. Now, what?\"\nMichael Penix Jr.\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | New to Tiers | 3.8 |\nPenix started three games late in his rookie season. It wasn't much to go on.\n\"I would make him a 3 because, small sample size, but I thought the guy played really well in that two-minute drill against Washington,\" an offensive coach said. \"How you play in two-minute is the X-factor for quarterbacks in the NFL. For a young guy, he went in there, and he was slinging it. I think you can win with him and a healthy run game.\"\nGetting the first-team reps this offseason should help.\n\"His poise, his arm strength made a difference,\" an exec said. \"He can make a lot more throws than Kirk (Cousins) could make (last season). His decision-making was really good. His accuracy was spotty at times, but outside of that, he finished strong. He gives you hope.\"\nA former GM thought Penix needed better vertical weapons.\n\"If he had that, and if he were playing for Bruce Arians, it would be awesome,\" this former GM said.\nJ.J. McCarthy\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | New to Tiers | 4 |\nMcCarthy drew all Tier 4 votes because he has yet to play in an NFL game, not because voters are necessarily down on him.\n\"I would have hope for him with that coach and that system if he can stay healthy,\" a former GM said. \"He has that slight build. He looked pretty good in the (2024) preseason, in a short period of time. I believe in the head coach and the system. He has the arm strength, he is athletic, he is smart, he has all those things.\"\nPlaying indoors could be another plus, a head coach said.\n\"I just hope he is not an (injury-prone) guy,\" this coach said.\nThere's a perception among some voters that Minnesota had reservations about McCarthy this offseason.\n\"I don't just hear slam dunk stuff out of there,\" the head coach said.\nMcCarthy was back on the field for Saturday's preseason opener after recovering from the torn meniscus he suffered in his right knee last preseason. He had surgery to repair the meniscus in August 2024 and another procedure in November to reduce swelling in the knee.\n\"How healthy is he going to be?\" another coach said. \"They are only doing one joint camp, with New England. He plays on Monday night at Chicago to open the season. I'm pretty interested to see what that looks like.\"\nDaniel Jones\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | Retained tier | 4(+0.4) |\nVoters overwhelmingly thought Jones would win the starting job in Indy. That said much about his primary competition, Anthony Richardson, who ranked ahead of only Spencer Rattler and Kenny Pickett in Tiers voting this year and then dislocated his pinkie finger in the preseason opener.\n\"I get nervous with Jones,\" an offensive coach said. \"I understand if you are not very good on offense and cannot protect, there will plays when you look bad, but there are too many times where he has a guy wide open and he throws it in the dirt or 10 feet over his head. I just don't think he is naturally accurate, and I did not think he was in college.\"\nJones had 10 touchdown passes and 13 interceptions over the past two seasons with the Giants. Richardson has 11 and 13 for Indy over the same span.\n\"A couple years ago, Jones was probably worthy of being a 3,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He still might be that. He has to show it.\"\nAn offensive coach with NFC East experience thought Jones, who carried the ball on designed runs a career-high 10 percent of the time last season, has been miscast.\n\"Why keep running this guy?\" the coach asked. \"He can do it, but he's f---ing 6-5. He takes hits. He doesn't have that slither at the end of those runs.\"\nA defensive coordinator said he thought Jones could be like the 2024 version of Darnold with a defense, running game and the right coordinator. But concerns over Jones' ability to process linger.\nJoe Flacco\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | New to Tiers | 4.1 |\nFlacco is making his first QB Tiers appearance since 2021. Voters are slightly higher on him now, at age 40, than they were back then, at 36.\n\"He's still playing?\" a defensive coordinator asked.\nFlacco is the favorite to start in Week 1, with Kenny Pickett limited by a hamstring injury and the two rookie draft choices, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders, working in the background.\n\"I respect him, particularly in that scheme,\" another defensive coordinator said of Flacco. \"He pairs well with what (Kevin) Stefanski wants to do.\"\nLittle-known fact: Flacco has a higher completion rate, yards per attempt and passer rating over the past two seasons than he had in his career previously.\n\"Flacco has no regard for ball security, so you don't know when he is going to throw into a crowd,\" an offensive coach said. \"He's going to make some throws because of that, but he's also going to have bad plays and turnovers.\"\nFlacco's two pick sixes for Cleveland in the playoffs after the 2023 season come to mind as examples.\n\"I think Joe is a good backup,\" a third defensive coordinator said.\nAnthony Richardson\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | Retained tier | 4.2(+0.4) |\nAn overwhelming majority of voters expected Daniel Jones to beat out Richardson for the job, well before Richardson dislocated his right pinkie finger on a sack in the preseason opener. Faith in Richardson's long-term development has cratered, with 11 voters placing him in Tier 5, reserved for players who should not start at all.\n\"I think it is a pipe dream right now, based on what I have seen, to say he is a starter in the NFL,\" an exec said. \"The accuracy is not there. If you want to do college football RPO-type stuff, that is your guy. But some of the stuff last year was not starter quality.\"\nVoters remain mystified by Richardson's decision to briefly exit a Week 8 game at Houston because he was too \"tired\" to stay on the field.\n\"That is a tough one to overcome,\" a head coach said. \"If you can, more power to ya.\"\nThe decision showed zero feel for the quarterback's leadership role on a team.\n\"He's a freaky athlete for his size, but he's been hurt every year because of it,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"Unless he is rearing back and throwing the ball as far as he can and somebody runs underneath it, he's not accurate and can't make any of those throws.\"\nRichardson has completed 50.6 percent of his career passes. He has completed more than 10 passes in a game seven times in 15 starts.\n\"They are not ready to say that they f---ed up, but they are hedging,\" a defensive coach said.\nThe manner in which Richardson injured his finger \u2014 turning to throw left when he had an unblocked rusher coming from the right \u2014 was telling for some.\n\"The Anthony Richardson experiment is over,\" one voter said.\nSpencer Rattler\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | New to Tiers | 4.3 |\nRattler, who started six games as a fifth-round rookie in 2024, appears in Tiers this year in case New Orleans does not go with second-round rookie Tyler Shough. (Jake Haener has also rotated in with the Saints' first-teamers but is not considered a serious contender to start.)\n\"You watch Rattler play against Tampa Bay in his first game, then watch him play against Tampa Bay in his last game, I mean, there was a lot to love there,\" the lone voter placing Rattler in Tier 3 said. \"He improved. I thought Rattler definitely had a chance to be a starter.\"\nThe Saints went 0-6 and averaged 10.8 points per game on offense with Rattler in the lineup last season. They were 5-5 with a 24.8-point average when Derek Carr started.\n\"I saw Rattler \u2014 he's up and down,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"Not real high on him.\"\nKenny Pickett\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n5 | New to Tiers | 4.6 |\nPickett and Ben Roethlisberger combined to start 38 games for the Steelers when Matt Canada was the team's offensive coordinator. The offense averaged slightly more yards per play (4.9 to 4.8) and EPA per play (-0.05 to -0.06) in the 22 games Pickett started than in the 16 games Roethlisberger started.\n\"Sometimes, guys just get into bad situations, so you really don't know what they are,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"That is why sometimes you see guys go somewhere else and you say, 'Hey, the guy can play a little bit.' They can all play if they are drafted in the first round. Do they get in the right system?\"\nPickett has made 22 of his 25 career starts so far with Canada as his offensive coordinator.

He's competing with Joe Flacco and rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders for the starting job in a Browns offense that ranked last in EPA per play over the past two seasons.\n\"I was never a big Pickett guy,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"When they had success against us, it was because of their run game and defense.\"\nThe Rankings and Tiers series is sponsored by E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.

      "text": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The Eagles may soon have a tough decision ahead of them that they haven\u2019t enjoyed since at least before the Doug Pederson era. It\u2019s been three years since general manager Howie Roseman ended the team\u2019s yearslong weakness at wide receiver in back-to-back draft-day deals that landed DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown. Still, the depth behind that duo has never quite proved consistent or reliable, let alone forced the Eagles to make any tough calls when it came time to trim their training camp roster to 53 players.\nAdvertisement\nThis year, it won\u2019t be so simple. The organization\u2019s refined efforts in scouting, signing and developing receivers has produced a pool of players who could add a distinct trait to the offensive identity of the 2025 system. The Eagles opened the 2024 season with five receivers on their 53-man roster. Could this year\u2019s initial roster include six? And what could that possibility offer first-time offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo?\nThe top end of the wide receiver room is self-evident. Brown and Smith are perennial 1,000-yard receivers who, together, have rewritten the Eagles\u2019 record book. Jahan Dotson has been the unit\u2019s No. 3 option since he arrived via trade two weeks before the Sao Paulo opener. Even Dotson\u2019s advancement is notable. The ball skills that made Dotson a 2022 first-round pick by the Washington Commanders are showing up more in his first full training camp in Philly. Among the signs, Dotson hauled in a contested catch on Tuesday against rookie cornerback Mac McWilliams along the right sideline. There\u2019s a growing sense that Dotson could contribute more than the 19 catches for 216 yards that he fielded on short notice last season.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a lot of confidence in Jahan,\u201d Eagles wide receiver coach Aaron Moorehead said. \u201cWe really liked him coming out (of the draft) and was super excited when Howie traded for him last year and just thought that he adds a great dimension to the offense as a third guy. You can\u2019t leave him over there and just expect that nothing\u2019s gonna happen. So he took advantage of his opportunities last year when he got them, and we\u2019re just hoping he gets more this year. And all that kinda depends on a lot of different factors going into the game plan each week, but Jahan\u2019s done a great job.\u201d\nThe difficulty of choosing two final names for a theoretical five-man rotation suggests the possibility of it being six.\nThe Eagles consistently compliment Johnny Wilson, a 2024 sixth-round pick whose 6-foot-6, 228-pound frame distinguishes him from the group. Nick Sirianni said Wilson\u2019s role as a run blocker in 2024 was \u201cunderrated.\u201d Wilson\u2019s three catches for 73 yards against the Bengals, which included two long passes he leaped for, further demonstrated his threat as a downfield option. The primary question ahead for Wilson, Moorehead said, involves his consistency.\nAdvertisement\nAinias Smith and Darius Cooper seemed to deepen their footholds in Philly with breakout games in the preseason opener. Smith, a 5-9, 176-pound slot receiver, paired a 6-yard touchdown reception with a 46-yard punt return that included what special teams coordinator Michael Clay called \u201ca heck of a one-cut\u201d to break into the open field. Cooper, a versatile receiver at 5-11, 210 pounds, justified why he\u2019s been a frequent target in training camp with a game-high six catches for 82 yards, which included hauling in a 20-yard touchdown reception between two defenders on a pass from Tanner McKee.\nCooper embodies the underdog story as an undrafted free agent out of Tarleton State. But he\u2019ll have to fend off Terrace Marshall, a fifth-year veteran and former second-round pick who had a strong Saturday practice returning from the knee injury that sidelined him for five practices and the preseason opener. Marshall, 6-2, 200 pounds, had five catches in team drills with the second-team unit that day. Marshall revealed that he can be both a downfield and midrange threat for the Eagles before suffering his injury. Clay complimented Marshall\u2019s willingness and involvement on special teams, which offers better positioning than his past indicates (he only has 14 career special teams snaps). Marshall\u2019s performance this week in joint practices with the Cleveland Browns will offer intriguing insight into whether he\u2019s found a fit after four seasons with the Panthers and Raiders.\nWho makes the cut? And how many? And what will that say about a system that proclaims itself as run-oriented?\nDrew Mukuba catching up with much-needed on-field reps\nEagles rookie safety Drew Mukuba said he\u2019s \u201ccaught up\u201d from the time he missed due to his shoulder injury. He hurt his shoulder on July 26 when he collided with Danny Gray while diving for a pass. Mukuba missed three practices, participated with limitations in four others and sat out the team\u2019s preseason opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. Mukuba was removed from the team\u2019s practice report Saturday, indicating he is now officially practicing without restrictions.\nMukuba said he is still \u201clooking to prove myself\u201d and \u201cshow that I belong here.\u201d On-field reps are highly valued by Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. Sydney Brown has established a lead in the position battle at safety by absorbing the majority share of first-team reps since Mukuba\u2019s injury. Brown started against the Bengals and logged 28 snaps while playing against Joe Burrow, Ja\u2019Marr Chase and the rest of the Bengals\u2019 starting offense. It\u2019s the sort of scenario that would have benefited Mukuba\u2019s development and evaluation.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWatching from the sideline was kinda hard, as bad as I wanna be out there,\u201d Mukuba said. \u201cBut I know my time gonna come. So, I just gotta be patient. And sooner or later, I\u2019ll be out there.\u201d\nMukuba will get his opportunity when the Cleveland Browns arrive at the NovaCare Complex Wednesday for the first of two joint practices ahead of Saturday\u2019s preseason game at Lincoln Financial Field. Fangio will likely test both Brown and Mukuba at safety against Cleveland\u2019s first-team squads. Mukuba has been featured as a slot defender opposite Cooper DeJean in dime packages throughout training camp. Mukuba also saw action at first-team safety opposite DeJean on Tuesday during a play in a base look.\nCleveland\u2019s influx of quarterbacks should afford the Eagles a fair training ground for their position battles at both safety and cornerback. Joe Flacco, the presumptive leader of a four-man competition, represents the biggest test as an 18-year veteran. Backups Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel have both been sidelined with hamstring injuries, but Browns coach Kevin Stefanski told reporters on Monday that Gabriel will return to 11-on-11 drills. Then there\u2019s Shedeur Sanders, the fifth-round pick who went 14 of 23 passing for 138 yards and two touchdowns in his preseason debut against the Carolina Panthers.\nApart from playing against Jalen Hurts in training camp, this week will be Mukuba\u2019s introduction to defending NFL-caliber quarterbacks on a professional stage. Diagnosing plays from the post is arguably Mukuba\u2019s greatest challenge in leveling up from the college ranks. The Eagles are counting on the qualities they liked in him as a cover safety at Clemson and Texas. This is why on-field reps are so important for Mukuba. Already, he\u2019s learning. He recalled a play from \u201ca while back ago\u201d in which he was closing quickly on a receiver McKee was targeting. McKee zipped the pass complete by placing it on the receiver\u2019s opposite shoulder.\n\u201cIn college, that would have been a pick or a PBU,\u201d Mukuba said. \u201cBut here, he put it completely on the other side of where I was coming from.\u201d\nConsider it a much-needed reminder of how narrow the margin of error is as an NFL safety.\n\u201cJust one little mistake, they\u2019re gonna make you pay for it,\u201d Mukuba said.\nJalen Hurts\nEagles\n- Tier 2\n- Rank T9\n- Vote Avg. 2.2\nQuick hits\n\u2022 Standing in for Dickerson: The Eagles held their first practice without starting left guard Landon Dickerson, who is undergoing minor surgery after injuring the meniscus in his right knee during Sunday\u2019s practice. The behind-the-scenes goal for Dickerson is for him to return for the regular-season opener on Sept. 4 at home against the Dallas Cowboys. Until then, the Eagles will be testing their depth at the position. Brett Toth was the first-team left guard in Tuesday\u2019s practice. Darian Kinnard played left guard with the second-team unit. Laekin Vakalahi, the third-team unit. Toth first joined the Eagles in 2019. He\u2019s a versatile backup who can play every position. Kinnard\u2019s inclusion is notable. A career offensive tackle, he joined the Eagles in 2024. Lane Johnson spoke highly of Kinnard\u2019s development during joint practices with the New England Patriots last year. Before Dickerson\u2019s injury, Eagles offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland was alternating Kinnard and Matt Pryor at right tackle and right guard. Vakalahi, born in Auckland, New Zealand, joined the Eagles in 2024 as part of the NFL\u2019s international development program. The 6-5, 320-pound lineman played 12 snaps at left guard against the Bengals.\nAdvertisement\n\u2022 Depth signing at defensive tackle: The Eagles signed defensive tackle Justin Rogers on Tuesday, a transaction enabled by releasing long-snapper Christian Johnstone. (Long-snapper Charley Hughlett returned from a neck injury.) The move comes a week after the Eagles traded Thomas Booker to the Raiders in exchange for cornerback Jakorian Bennett. Gabe Hall also exited Sunday\u2019s practice early with a shoulder injury. Hall did not practice Tuesday. Byron Young, who missed five practices with a groin injury, returned with limitations. Rogers, a 2024 seventh-round pick by the Dallas Cowboys, did not play as a rookie and was cut by the Seattle Seahawks on July 29. Ty Robinson, Joe Evans and Jacob Sykes saw snaps with the second-team unit on Tuesday.\n(Top photo of Drew Mukuba: Mitchell Leff / Getty Images)"

      "text": "By Brooks Kubena, Dianna Russini and Zach Berman\nPhiladelphia Eagles starting left guard Landon Dickerson will undergo minor knee surgery after sustaining a meniscus injury in Sunday\u2019s practice, league sources confirmed Monday. The team is considering Dickerson week to week, and is hoping the three-time Pro Bowler will be ready for their regular-season opener on Sept. 4 at home against the Dallas Cowboys.\nAdvertisement\nIt is favorable news considering the initial scene at Lincoln Financial Field, where an estimated crowd of 60,000 people fell silent as Dickerson hobbled with help off the field before he was carted inside.\nThe Eagles are hosting joint practices with the Cleveland Browns this week.\nWho could fill in for Dickerson?\nDickerson has a history of playing through pain \u2014 including in last season\u2019s Super Bowl, when he played through a knee injury that sidelined him for the second half of the NFC Championship Game and limited him in practice as late as the Wednesday before the Super Bowl. He sustained a season-ending knee injury during his final season at Alabama that sidelined him during the pre-draft process and during his first summer with the team.\nThe Eagles are still figuring out their guard depth. Tyler Steen is entering is first year as the full-time starter at right guard, although his primary reserve is veteran Matt Pryor, who has 25 career starts at right guard and has never started at left guard. Brett Toth has been Dickerson\u2019s primary backup this summer, but his value is more his versatility than his starting upside. Another depth option is 2024 fifth-round pick Trevor Keegan, who has practiced at both guard and center this summer.\nThe Eagles could also consider Kenyon Green, a 2022 first-round pick by the Houston Texans who was acquired in a trade for C.J. Gardner-Johnson in March. Green has 23 career starts at left guard, but he\u2019s been slowed by injuries this summer. He did not practice on Saturday or Sunday due to a shoulder injury. \u2014 Zach Berman, senior NFL writer\n(Photo: Andy Lewis / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"

      "text": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 When the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 training camp schedule drops each summer, joint practices are the annual August highlight. Since coach Nick Sirianni keeps most of his starters sidelined for preseason games, these sessions offer the most competitive work against a different team, and they\u2019ve historically helped signal the team\u2019s performance for the season.\nAdvertisement\nThe only joint practices this summer are this week\u2019s against the Cleveland Browns. The Eagles open the season on a Thursday night and Sirianni does not like joint practices before the first preseason game, so the Eagles limited their joint practices to one opponent instead of two opponents.\nThe joint practice gave the proceedings more buzz than a typical training camp session at the NovaCare Complex. Former Eagles standouts filed into their old practice facility, including Malcolm Jenkins, Brandon Graham, Jason Kelce and Fletcher Cox.\nThe Eagles practiced without wide receivers A.J. Brown (hamstring) and Elijah Cooks (shoulder), offensive linemen Landon Dickerson (knee) and Kenyon Green (shoulder)\nHere\u2019s what The Athletic observed, with Brooks Kubena focusing on the defense and Zach Berman focusing on the offense:\nEagles defense vs. Browns offense\nAny improvement the Eagles hoped to spur within their cornerback battle by trading for Jakorian Bennett didn\u2019t materialize on Wednesday.\nA rotation of Cleveland Browns quarterbacks bested the Eagles\u2019 secondary with regularity during the first of two joint practices. They exploited Bennett the most. It was the former Las Vegas Raiders cornerback\u2019s roughest outing since he began practicing with the Eagles on Saturday.\nBrowns wide receiver Gage Larvadain, an undrafted rookie, got ahead of Bennett on a deep crosser for a touchdown during team drills with the second-team units. Later, Bennett, working with the first-team defense, surrendered a long completion along the left sideline while a step behind Pro Bowler Jerry Jeudy. Bennett then drew a pass interference penalty with the third-team unit for knocking down Kisean Johnson, another undrafted rookie, in the middle of the field.\nWednesday was Bennett\u2019s most significant test yet. Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio deployed Bennett with the first-team unit for the first time. One bad practice doesn\u2019t supply a definitive verdict, but it\u2019s a concerning development for the Eagles as they search for someone to strengthen their secondary.\nAdvertisement\nKelee Ringo and Adoree\u2019 Jackson, who split first-team reps in Wednesday practice, struggled against the Browns, too. Ringo lost twice in one-on-one drills to Diontae Johnson (a free agent addition), and he later surrendered a deep catch during team drills when Jeudy gained separation along the left sideline on a comeback route. Jeudy got ahead of Jackson during a first-team rep by curling back toward the left side of the end zone, but Joe Flacco\u2019s errant throw missed the mark. Jackson raised both hands to his helmet after the play with dismay.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Browns even bested Quinyon Mitchell, No. 49 on the NFL\u2019s Top 100 players list, at times. Diontae Johnson got ahead of Mitchell on a play-action crosser for a touchdown during a goal-to-go sequence with the first-team units. It\u2019s not favorable for the Eagles that the Browns and their four-man quarterback competition exploited a secondary that was a strength in 2024. Pair that with Philly\u2019s preseason opener, when Joe Burrow went 9-of-10 passing for 123 yards and two touchdowns in two drives, and there\u2019s a growing sense that there are problems ahead for the Eagles\u2019 passing defense.\nBennett will have the opportunity to bounce back, as he\u2019s only a week into digesting a new playbook. Mitchell called Bennett \u201ca sponge\u201d and said he\u2019s been constantly asking everyone in the secondary questions. The Eagles will monitor Bennett\u2019s progress in Thursday\u2019s practice and during his preseason debut on Saturday, but they must start considering alternatives if his onboarding requires more time, especially if Ringo and Jackson fail to distinguish themselves.\nCooper DeJean is arguably the team\u2019s second-best cornerback. The sensibility of DeJean playing cornerback is well\u2013documented. Fangio clearly values DeJean at nickel and is pleased with DeJean\u2019s play as a base-package safety during training camp. However, Fangio may not have the luxury to keep DeJean in a flexible role from the nickel slot.\nA year ago, Fangio said he eventually wanted to see DeJean play snaps at cornerback, the position Philadelphia drafted him at, and DeJean did play corner during OTAs within base packages. Christian Parker, the team\u2019s defensive passing game coordinator, said last week that the Eagles still plan on getting DeJean snaps at outside cornerback. That move may soon be necessary.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m prepared. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll let me know and make sure that I\u2019m ready if that happens,\u201d DeJean said.\nHe hasn\u2019t played any outside cornerback during training camp, but said his individual drills and team reps at nickel involve \u201cthe same man-to-man progressions as a corner.\u201d Rookie Mac McWilliams would be a potential replacement at nickel. McWilliams, a fifth-round pick, saw first-team reps during team drills on Wednesday.\n(My main takeaway: The Eagles need to start thinking about Cooper DeJean at cornerback.)\nQuick hits\n\u2022 Baun is gradually returning: Eagles starting linebacker Zack Baun participated in seven-on-seven drills on Wednesday. He nearly intercepted the first pass from former Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett, but couldn\u2019t secure the catch. It was Baun\u2019s first seven-on-seven action since suffering a back contusion that sidelined him for seven practices. Baun returned to practice on Saturday with limitations. The Eagles officially listed him as limited in Wednesday\u2019s practice report. He did not participate in team drills. \u201cSlow progress,\u201d Baun said. \u201cGet back on the field eventually.\u201d\n\u2022 Campbell still needs work in coverage: Eagles rookie linebacker Jihaad Campbell continued a promising training camp with a strong outing against the Browns, especially while playing against the run. The No. 31 pick sniffed out a running lane while facing Cleveland\u2019s first-team offense and swallowed running back Dylan Sampson before a hole emerged. Campbell later dislodged a pass in the flats by striking Pierre Strong Jr. when the ball arrived.\nCampbell still needs to improve in coverage, however. He and second-team cornerback Mac McWilliams seemed to experience a mix-up that left Browns running back Trayveon Williams uncovered for an easy touchdown reception. Nakobe Dean, sidelined with a torn patellar tendon, spoke with Campbell for a few minutes after the play.\n\u2022 Hunt included in pass-rush package: The Eagles deployed Jalyx Hunt as the third edge rusher in a four-man front that also included Nolan Smith and Azeez Ojulari. Hunt ranged pre-snap before lining up as a stand-up rusher outside Ojulari on the right side.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI mean, whatever is brought to my table, you know, I\u2019m gonna try to do it at the best of my ability,\u201d Hunt said of the potential role. \u201cI feel comfortable in anything that I\u2019m able to be put in.\u201d\nHunt, a 2024 third-round pick, had a breakout postseason in which he recorded 1.5 sacks and a tackle for loss. Hunt and Smith opened training camp as the first-team edge rushers. Ojulari signed a one-year, $3 million deal with the Eagles after recording 22 sacks in four injury-limited seasons with the New York Giants. He sacked Flacco during team drills on Wednesday, the defense\u2019s only sack of the day.\n\u2014 Brooks Kubena\nEagles offense vs. Browns defense\n1. It was an inconsistent day for Jalen Hurts. His efficiency from Tuesday\u2019s session waned against Jim Schwartz\u2019s defense. The Browns intercepted Hurts three times, including once in one-on-one drills. That\u2019s something you do not typically see. Another interception came after Hurts was nearly sacked and threw the ball up for grabs, so that\u2019s more of a practice interception than a concern.\nHe was effective in situational work, especially red zone and goal line, finding DeVonta Smith and A.J. Dillon for touchdowns. Hurts was also under duress on a few occasions, so he had to use his legs and extend plays. The Eagles relied on quick-hitting plays and put players in motion against Cleveland\u2019s strong defensive front.\n\u201cYou learn a lot about where you are and learn about where you have an opportunity to go,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cI thought today was very competitive. \u2026 We got a lot of guys not practicing as well, so being able to put a lot of guys in different situations and build and learn.\u201d\nJalen Hurts\nEagles\n- Tier 2\n- Rank T9\n- Vote Avg. 2.2\n2. Brett Toth remained the first-team left guard in place of Landon Dickerson, who underwent a procedure to repair his meniscus on Wednesday. This was an up-and-down session for Toth, which he admitted. There appeared to be a missed blitz in his gap, and the Browns were able to get interior pressure and push him back in the pocket. Toth looked better on running plays, but there\u2019s still concern about how the Eagles would perform without Dickerson.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAs for me today, I did not perform as well,\u201d Toth said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be better. It was a good day for the Browns. \u2026 I got beat too much. Dumb mistake. There\u2019s a lot of plays in football. Huge quote from Brandon Brooks that really puts it in perspective: \u2018They get paid, too.\u2019 These are generational athletes you go against on a daily basis \u2026 But it\u2019s the mistakes that you do to yourself to get them an easy win, you can\u2019t have that. This game is too hard to have any sort of mistakes, whether it\u2019s technique-based, mental-based.\u201d\nThe Eagles are not rotating at guard and are trusting Toth while they wait for Dickerson. The hope remains that Dickerson returns by the season opener, and Toth made sure to recognize Dickerson on Wednesday.\n\u201cI mean, as a bunch of brothers in that room, obviously we\u2019re there for him as much as possible, not just physically \u2014 mentally, emotionally,\u201d Toth said. \u201c(Because) it\u2019s a strain, man. You work so hard to get where you\u2019re at, and injury sets you back, and now you\u2019re on an uphill battle. It\u2019s the adversity that you don\u2019t see coming that can be the hardest, especially mentally. But if anyone can do it, it\u2019s definitely Landon.\n\u201cAs for us as a group, again, me stepping up. Reality of it, I\u2019ve been in this for seven years, always been the backup, always been the swing, bubble guy. Nothing\u2019s guaranteed that it\u2019s even mine. We have a lot of guys that can step up. We have a lot of depth as well. We\u2019re just excited to perform to the best that we can as a unit and it\u2019s an opportunity for us, but again, we love Landon.\u201d\n3. One player who stood out? Johnny Wilson. He used his 6-foot-6 frame to high-point a ball in seven-on-seven and make a contested catch. These jump-ball situations are where Wilson is best, and he showed it. His blocking was also on display during a bubble screen to DeVonta Smith.\n\u201cJohnny made a big-time catch today, always good to see that \u2014 just seeing him show up,\u201d Hurts said. \u201c\u2026 For Johnny, it\u2019s not hard for him to use his body. It\u2019s more so, just finishing and taking advantage of those good-position plays where he\u2019s in position to make a play.\u201d\n4. Speaking of Smith, he made catches all over the field. His smooth footwork was on display when he caught a touchdown in the front corner of the end zone in a tight red zone period. Practice is different for Smith without A.J. Brown. There\u2019s more volume in his direction, although there\u2019s more defensive attention toward him, too.\nAdvertisement\n5. Dallas Goedert was a key target for Hurts. Similar to Smith, he was a high-volume receiver. The best play was a downfield pass when Hurts rolled to his right and pinpointed the ball for the top tight end.\n6. Training camp observations tend to favor the passing game because there\u2019s no tackling, but I thought the Eagles ran the ball effectively on Wednesday. You could tell by the rushers reaching the second level, whether it was Saquon Barkley, Will Shipley or Dillon. The blocking was better in those situations. The offensive linemen are used to seeing odd-man fronts. Playing against Schwartz\u2019s even front was a new look.\n7. Dillon\u2019s physical running was apparent, especially the way he finishes runs. He also caught a touchdown. The Eagles\u2019 top three running backs look entrenched, and Dillon is in line for a role on the team. The Eagles are going to rely on his size, and Lane Johnson suggested that defenses won\u2019t want to see Dillon coming downhill late in games.\n8. Myles Garrett is as advertised. He gave the Eagles\u2019 elite tackles more trouble than you typically see. Players on the Eagles, including Campbell and Hunt, made a point to go see Garrett after practice. There\u2019s a reason there was trade speculation during the spring (and why he signed a $40 million per year contract). Garrett is that good.\n\u201cAny time you can go against one of the best guys, maybe ever, on the edge, you definitely have your work cut out,\u201d Johnson said. \u201c\u2026 You got to get off the ball or else it\u2019s going to be a long day for you.\u201d\n9. By design, the Eagles rotated on the first-team offensive line late in practice. Matt Pryor took work at right tackle in Johnson\u2019s place, a planned rotation for the Eagles to figure out who might be the swing tackle this season.\n10. On special teams, Avery Williams was the first one up at punt returner. There was also a scuffle on special teams late in practice. Andre\u2019 Sam appeared to be involved, although the fight quickly dissipated.\n\u2014 Zach Berman\n(Top photo of Quinyon Mitchell: Bill Streicher / Imagn Images)"
