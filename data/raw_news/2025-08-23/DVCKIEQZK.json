  "description": "Lowe's is continuing to battle an alarming consumer trend.",
  "content": "Like many other retailers nationwide, Lowe's (LOW) has been struggling to attract price-conscious customers who are concerned about inflation and tariffs. This has contributed to it facing lower-than-expected sales in the first three months of 2025.\n\nHowever, the home improvement retailer recently saw a glimmer of hope, as its latest earnings report revealed that its comparable sales during the second quarter of this year increased by 1.1% year-over-year.\n\nThe average amount of money customers spent per purchase increased by 2.9%, but the number of comparable transactions declined by 1.8%.\n\nDespite higher sales, customers are still avoiding stores. Recent data from Placer.ai revealed that overall customer visits to Lowe\u2019s stores decreased by 3.8% year-over-year during the quarter, while its top rival, Home Depot, saw its visits only decline by 2.2%.\n\nThe decrease in foot traffic comes during a time when the retail giant is facing a nationwide boycott from consumers over its business practices, which kicked off on Aug. 1 and will last until the end of the month.\n\nDuring an earnings call on Aug. 21, Lowe\u2019s flagged that the current state of the U.S. housing market is having an impact on sales, as it is causing consumers to delay tackling large home improvement projects and instead focus on smaller projects that involve repairs, remodeling, and maintenance.\n\n\u201cWe're still working through some short-term challenges, including elevated mortgage rates, cautious consumer affordability remains a pressure point that results in the lock-in effect that we've been seeing and also a depressed housing market,\u201d said Lowe\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Brandon Sink during the call.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate is has surpassed 6%, and consumers are purchasing new homes at a slow pace.\n\nIn July, existing-home sales increased by 2% month-over-month, while total housing inventory spiked by 0.6%, according to a recent report from the National Association of Realtors.\n\nThe report also found that the median existing-home sales price increased by 0.2% year-over-year, reaching $422,400.\n\n\u201cUnless mortgage rates move lower and stay there, the housing market will remain slow and regionally uneven, with locked-in sellers and rising inventory limiting both appreciation and the pace of home sale,\u201d said Keller Williams Chief Economist Ruben Gonzalez in a statement to TheStreet.\n\nAs Lowe\u2019s navigates the ripple effects of an uncertain housing market, it is also battling the growing threat of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on multiple countries. Tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for everyday goods, which is causing consumers to cut their spending.\n\nAccording to a recent survey from Harris Poll and Bloomberg News, 3 in 5 Americans said they are reducing their spending due to concerns about a potential recession.\n\u2022 Amazon pulls the plug on a free service for customers\n\nDuring the earnings call, Lowe\u2019s CEO Marvin Ellison said that the company has been managing tariffs by diversifying where it sources its products.\n\n\u201cWe have done, in my estimation, an excellent job of working cross-functionally relative to looking for diversification,\u201d said Ellison. \u201cI mean, right now, roughly 60% of the goods we source are coming out of the U.S. And it wasn't that way seven years ago.\u201d\n\nHe also said that Lowe\u2019s stores have been relying on \u201cdynamic\u201d pricing, where prices for products \u201cfluctuate up and down\u201d based on multiple factors, to help lessen the blow of higher costs associated with tariffs.\n\n\u201cPricing is incredibly dynamic,\u201d said Ellison. \u201cAnd it's driven a lot by a set of business rules that we have internally based on competitive pricing, and based on our own internal data on elasticity. And so we understand what our customers want (and) what they don't want, and we understand the breakpoint on units when you start to price in a way that you see demand go down. And so we're managing this literally real-time because this is uncharted waters.\u201d",

The Report provides the real estate ecosystem, including agents and homebuyers and sellers, with data on the level of home sales, price, and inventory.\nMonth-over-month sales increased in the Northeast, South, and West, and fell in the Midwest. Year-over-year, sales rose in the South, Northeast, and Midwest, and fell in the West.\n\"The ever-so-slight improvement in housing affordability is inching up home sales,\" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. \"Wage growth is now comfortably outpacing home price growth, and buyers have more choices. Condominium sales increased in the South region, where prices had been falling for the past year.\"\n\"Near-zero growth in home prices suggests that roughly half the country is experiencing price reductions. Overall, homeowners are doing well financially. Only 2% of sales were foreclosures or short sales \u2013 essentially a historic low. The market's health is supported by a cumulative 49% home price appreciation for a typical American homeowner from pre-COVID July 2019 to July this year,\" Dr. Yun continued.\n\"Homebuyers are in the best position in more than five years to find the right home and negotiate for a better price.

Local MLS data is the most accurate source of sales and price information in specific areas, although there may be differences in reporting methodology.\nNOTE: NAR's Pending Home Sales Index for July will be released August 28, and Existing-Home Sales for August will be released September 23. Release times are 10 a.m. Eastern. See NAR's statistical news release schedule.\n1 Existing-home sales, which include single-family, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, are based on transaction closings from Multiple Listing Services. Changes in sales trends outside of MLSs are not captured in the monthly series. NAR benchmarks home sales periodically using other sources to assess overall home sales trends, including sales not reported by MLSs.\nExisting-home sales, based on closings, differ from the U.S. Census Bureau's series on new single-family home sales, which are based on contracts or the acceptance of a deposit. Because of these differences, it is not uncommon for each series to move in different directions in the same month. In addition, existing-home sales, which account for more than 90% of total home sales, are based on a much larger data sample \u2013 about 40% of multiple listing service data each month \u2013 and typically are not subject to large prior-month revisions.\nThe annual rate for a particular month represents what the total number of actual sales for a year would be if the relative pace for that month were maintained for 12 consecutive months. Seasonally adjusted annual rates are used in reporting monthly data to factor out seasonal variations in resale activity. For example, home sales volume is normally higher in the summer than in the winter, primarily because of differences in the weather and family buying patterns. However, seasonal factors cannot compensate for abnormal weather patterns.\nSingle-family data collection began monthly in 1968, while condo data collection began quarterly in 1981; the series were combined in 1999 when monthly collection of condo data began. Prior to this period, single-family homes accounted for more than nine out of 10 purchases. Historic comparisons for total home sales prior to 1999 are based on monthly single-family sales, combined with the corresponding quarterly sales rate for condos.\n2 Total inventory and month's supply data are available back through 1999, while single-family inventory and month's supply are available back to 1982 (prior to 1999, single-family sales accounted for more than 90% of transactions and condos were measured only on a quarterly basis).\n3 The median price is where half sold for more and half sold for less; medians are more typical of market conditions than average prices, which are skewed higher by a relatively small share of upper-end transactions. The only valid comparisons for median prices are with the same period a year earlier due to seasonality in buying patterns. Month-to-month comparisons do not compensate for seasonal changes, especially for the timing of family buying patterns. Changes in the composition of sales can distort median price data. Year-ago median and mean prices sometimes are revised in an automated process if additional data is received.\nThe national median condo/co-op price often is higher than the median single-family home price because condos are concentrated in higher-cost housing markets. However, in a given area, single-family homes typically sell for more than condos as seen in NAR's quarterly metro area price reports.\n4 Distressed sales (foreclosures and short sales), days on market, first-time buyers, all-cash transactions and investors are from a monthly survey for the NAR's REALTORS\u00ae Confidence Index, posted at nar.realtor."

      "text": "The home improvement segment continues to face challenges in 2025, but a deeper look into the data for Home Depot and Lowe's reveals a nuanced story of sector-wide headwinds, divergent brand performances, and potential signs of recovery.\nHome Depot Visits Start to Stabilize\nExisting-home sales, which can often serve as a powerful indicator for how the home improvement retail sector may behave, are at some of their lowest rates in years. This housing market softness has translated into lowered consumer activity at project-driven stores like The Home Depot. Visits to the home improvement chain were down by -3.9% YoY in Q1 2025 before moderating to a 2.2% decline in Q2.\nMonthly visit data offers a more granular view of Home Depot's performance. Despite a sharp YoY decline of 9.2% in February \u2013 likely due to inclement weather and the leap year comparison \u2013 visits recovered quickly. By July, foot traffic was down by just 2.5% YoY.\nThese trends point to a cautious stabilization, perhaps driven by shifting economic realities. With home equities up roughly 6% YoY and over half of U.S. homes at least 40 years old, homeowners are undertaking necessary repairs \u2013 and Home Depot's status as a contractor hub may help boost visits as economic concerns cool. The company is also leaning into its strengths and driving sales through other channels, such as its B2B offerings, helping position it for growth as market conditions improve.\nLowe\u2019s Professional Pivot\nLowe's also faced a challenging first half of 2025, with foot traffic trends mirroring the broader home improvement sector's struggles. Quarterly visits declined by 3.7% in Q1 and 3.8% in Q2 on a year-over-year (YoY) basis, reflecting persistent pressure on consumer spending. But visit gaps narrowed by the end of Q2, and by July 2025 were just 1.1% lower than in July 2024.\nLike Home Depot, Lowe's was likely impacted by the economic uncertainties and a slower housing market. But unlike Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s still relies on DIYers for the majority of its business. Executives blamed unfavorable weather for pushing back the spring home improvement season, which led to softer DIY performance at Lowe\u2019s in their first fiscal quarter (ending May 2nd 2025) and may have contributed to Lowe's underperformance relative to Home Depot.\nA Midwest Opportunity\nDrilling down into regional foot traffic trends for Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s in July reveals that success in the home improvement sector in 2025 is highly localized. Even during the recent challenging period, both chains experienced pockets of YoY visit growth, particularly clustered in parts of the Midwest and Southeast. For Home Depot, traffic trends were strongest in North Dakota, where YoY visits grew by 7.6% \u2013 but visit growth was clustered throughout the region. Lowe\u2019s also enjoyed visit growth across several states, with its strongest performance centered in Midwestern states like Indiana (+4.4%) and Kentucky (+2.8%).\nThese geographic patterns highlight how demand in the home improvement segment shows significant variance by market, with both chains appearing to benefit in areas with steadier home sales. This is a reminder that, while nationwide visits are lower than in previous years, pockets of strong local demand can still provide a significant boost for each brand.\nStrategic Insights\nMoving forward, the home improvement segment has plenty of ways to adapt to a softening economic environment and slowing home sales. Will home improvement visits pick up? Or will housing market challenges continue to spill over to foot traffic?\nVisit Placer.ai/anchor for the latest data-driven retail insights."

  "argos_summary": "Lowe\u2019s Q2 comparable sales rose 1.1% YoY and average spend climbed 2.9%, yet transactions fell 1.8% and store visits dropped 3.8% amid a consumer boycott and a sluggish housing market.  The company attributes the slowdown to high mortgage rates, cautious affordability, and tariff\u2011induced price hikes, while its CEO highlights U.S. sourcing diversification and dynamic pricing as mitigation tactics.  Across the sector, Home Depot\u2019s foot traffic decline is less severe, and both chains see regional pockets of growth despite nationwide headwinds.  Overall, the home\u2011improvement market remains pressured by economic uncertainty, but localized demand and strategic adjustments offer potential for recovery.",
