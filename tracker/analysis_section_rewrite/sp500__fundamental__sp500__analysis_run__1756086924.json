      "feedback": "Overall, the draft hits the right macro topic and links policy shocks to asset pricing via Ford and corporate-pay signals, but it can reach world-class quality by (1) formalizing a multi-year regime map anchored in first principles, (2) tightening the causal chain from policy to market pricing, (3) lifting the scenario design with explicit catalysts/invalidation points and probabilistic weights, (4) inserting explicit, source-backed numbers with ranges, and (5) achieving tighter, source-aware citations and reconciling conflicting signals. Actionable edits: start with a concise regime framework (Regime A: tariff escalation and reshoring with strong US investment; Regime B: tariff plateau with diversified supply chains and tempered inflation; Regime C: policy pivot or easing with different capital flows) and state the transition conditions (tariff announcements, chip/EV capex milestones, alliance realignments) and the invariant anchors (first-principles like real rate differentials, terms-of-trade shifts via US‑China posture, BoP implications, and policy reaction functions). Build the causal chain in steps: tariffs (policy shock) -> import prices and inflation dynamics -> domestic capital allocation toward chips, EVs, AI data centers, and energy with baseload power advantages (Wyoming-like) -> sectoral pricing/policy incentives -> equity market pricing and executive pay signaling via stock-based compensation. Ground each step with explicit numbers from the sources: baseline 10% tariffs on many partners, 34% on China, 145% in a later framework, and 80% in a proposed peak (SGB2PAZGK; Source 12); China’s dominance in rare earths (60% mine output; 90% processing) and the US dependency risk (SGB2PAZGK); Ford’s EV losses (~$1.3B in Q2) and ROIC (~10%), 4.3% margin, 33% five-year total return vs S&P’s ~267% (65UUBU0OR); Ford’s YTD ~+17% in 2025 and its forward P/E ~10 with ~5% dividend (22PL3Q360); CEO pay rising 7.7% to median ~$19M, stock‑linked (O4ZEED2EB). Then present a base-case tied to these dynamics and a risk matrix: base-case tariff trajectory remains sticky but not explosive, domestic capex and AI/compute demand grow, AI/compute pricing power modestly improves profits for US incumbents, and traditional autos lag AI leaders; key catalysts include visible progress on US chip fabs and AI infrastructure, and tariff policy escalation/de-escalation; invalidation points include a rapid policy reversal, weaker than expected global growth, or a successful early diversification of supply chains that undercuts tariff leverage (SGB2PAZGK). Strengthen the Ford exemplar by clearly labeling it as a cyclical/transition stock within Regime A vs Regime B, and explicitly quantify the market implications: what a 10–15% regime shift in capex and a 4–6pp inflation impulse would imply for P/E multiples, ROIC discipline, and dividend yields across the names cited. Improve the cadence of citations by placing the exact IDs after each factual claim (e.g., tariff levels after the Basel/China statements; rare-earth shares after the 60/90% figures; Ford metrics after the EV loss and ROIC sections; CEO pay data after the compensation note). Finally, explicitly articulate a multi-year confidence band and watchlist: track tariff announcements, chip‑fab progress, EV profitability milestones, and CEO-pay/shares signals as early warning indicators (SGB2PAZGK; 65UUBU0OR; 22PL3Q360; O4ZEED2EB). This will yield a tighter,-invariant-anchored analysis with clear regimes, catalysts, invalidations, and a transparent, source-consistent thread.",
