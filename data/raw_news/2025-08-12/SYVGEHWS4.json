  "content": "Olympic Champion Mondo Duplantis has set the 13th pole vault world record of his career by clearing 6.29m at the Gyulai Istvan Memorial in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nDuplantis, 25, is the Olympic and World Champion. At the Continental Gold Tour meet, just under a month out from his World title defence in Tokyo, he added another centimetre to the 6.28m world record he had set in Stockholm, Sweden, this June.\n\nEmmanouil Karalis (6.02m) of Greece finished second to Duplantis, for the 12th time in his career. Australia\u2019s Kurtis Marschall was third with 5.82m.\n\nIt might be the first world record that the Gyulai Memorial stadium has seen, but it is Duplantis\u2019 third this calendar year, and his fourth since the Olympic final in Paris last August. There, he cleared 6.25m with a clutch (third and final attempt) jump, and became the first man since Bob Richards (in 1956) to successfully defend a pole vault Olympic title.\n\nHe first jumped a world record in February 2020 when he cleared 6.17m, bettering Renaud Lavillenie 6.16m which had stood for almost six years. All 13 of Duplantis\u2019 world records have been by one centimetre, with sponsor Red Bull paying him a bonus for every world record.\n\nHe accounts for 32 of the 44 competitions where an athlete has cleared at least 6.10m, and is currently on a winning streak of 36 meets, which date all the way back to August 2023 when he won the World title in Budapest.\n\nDuplantis is one of the most dominant sports in any track and field discipline ever, largely owning to his incredible sprint speed that he converts to height after he sprints along the runway. Last year, he clocked 10.37s for 100m at an exhibition race in Zurich, Switzerland, when racing 400m world-record holder Karsten Warholm.\n\nHe comes from a sporting and pole vault family, with his older brothers having competed in the sport, while father and coach Greg vaulted internationally for the U.S.. It meant Duplantis started vaulting from a young age in his backyard \u2014 he still holds age-group best jumps for ages seven through 12.\n\nDuplantis\u2019 younger sister, Johanna, is following in his footsteps, too. Like Mondo, she studies now at Louisiana State University, the state in which he and his siblings were born and grew up in (their mother is Swedish, which is why Mondo competes for them). Mondo and Johanna are scheduled to compete in a Diamond League together for the first time this weekend, in Silesia, Poland.",

      "text": "You don\u2019t get to choose your own nickname, but you do get to prove why you were given it.\nArmand Duplantis was nicknamed \u2018Mondo\u2019 \u2014 \u2018world\u2019 in Italian \u2014 at a young age by a family friend. It is easy to retrofit what was probably just a loving act of childhood innocence, but at 24, Duplantis has conquered the pole vault world numerous times.\nAdvertisement\nIn March, he claimed his fourth world title (2022 indoors and outdoors; 2023 outdoors; 2024 indoors) and in June, his fourth European title (outdoors in 2018, 2022 and 2024, and indoors in 2021).\nDuplantis is the overwhelming gold medal favourite in Paris. He won in Tokyo three years ago. Out-jump everyone and he will be the first man to retain the pole vault Olympic title since Bob Richards (the United States) in 1956.\nDuplantis is to pole vaulting what Usain Bolt was to sprinting; Michael Phelps to swimming; Simone Biles to gymnastics. It is a Duplantis dynasty.\nHis first world record was 6.17 metres (20ft 3in) in Poland in February 2020. A week later, he jumped one centimetre higher in Glasgow. Duplantis was lucky he was in Europe and not at home in Lafayette, Louisiana. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to pop any champagne corks there \u2014 Duplantis didn\u2019t turn 21 until that November.\nSix more world records have followed, each time by a centimetre. Most recently, Duplantis jumped 6.24m three months ago in China, his first outdoor competition of the season. That would raise eyebrows and spark doping-related questions in other events. No such thing happens in the pole vault. That is just what Mondo does.\nAfter all, Duplantis is responsible for 61 of the 189 jumps of at least six metres. Nine of the top 10 jumps in history are his, with only Renaud Lavillenie\u2019s 6.16m effort from 2014 interrupting the pattern. Duplantis keeps smashing the ceiling but prides himself on consistency, with such a high-performance floor. He has only lost three times since the start of 2022 and not at all since July 2023 \u2014 17 straight wins. He cleared six metres in 36 of his 50 competitions from 2022 onwards, including eight out of 11 this calendar year.\n| Athlete | Height | Date | Meet | Indoor/outdoor |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nDuplantis | 6.24m | April 2024 | Diamond League (Xiamen) | Outdoor |\nDuplantis | 6.23m | September 2023 | Diamond League (Eugene) | Outdoor |\nDuplantis | 6.22m | February 2023 | All Star Perche (France) | Indoor |\nDuplantis | 6.21m | July 2022 | World Championships (Oregon) | Outdoor |\nDuplantis | 6.20m | March 2022 | World Indoor Championships (Belgrade) | Outdoor |\nDuplantis | 6.19m | March 2022 | Belgrade Indoor Meeting | Indoor |\nDuplantis | 6.18m | February 2020 | World Indoor Tour (Glasgow) | Indoor |\nDuplantis | 6.17m | February 2020 | World Indoor Tour (Torun) | Indoor |\nLavillenie | 6.16m | February 2014 | Pole Vault Stars (Donetsk) | Indoor |\nDuplantis | 6.16m | June 2022 | Diamond League (Stockholm) | Outdoor |\nDuplantis featured on Tigers Win, a Louisiana State University (LSU, of which he is an alumnus) podcast, in April 2023. He was asked when he last failed. The answer: 2019, his final collegiate year. Duplantis finished second in the NCAA final in June, second in the Diamond League final in August, and was runner-up at the World Championships in October. The loss fuelled him. The next year, 2020, he improved his personal best by 13 centimetres (from 6.05m to 6.18m).\nIn 2000, academic Francoys Gagne updated his Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent. It theorised that those with natural abilities need a mix of luck, personal qualities and the right environment to develop and realise their talent.\nDuplantis could be the poster boy. He comes from a family of athletes: Greg, his father, was an elite vaulter for the U.S. Helena, his Swedish mother, was an international heptathlete and volleyball player. Duplantis\u2019 maternal roots are why he represents Sweden, not the U.S. His parents are still his coaches.\nAdvertisement\nMondo has two older brothers who vaulted at a decent level. He grew up pole vaulting in his backyard and still holds all age-group world records between seven and 12 years old. Certainly a sporting fairytale, but also an oversimplification for explaining Duplantis\u2019 success. This is where biomechanics provide answers.\nDavid Young, professor of physics at LSU, explains that elite pole vaulters need four component parts: \u201cThe speed of a world-class sprinter, the ability of a long jumper, the agility of a gymnast and the flexibility of a ballerina.\u201d\nChris Mills, a senior lecturer in biomechanics at the University of Portsmouth, breaks this down to The Athletic: \u201cA good vault involves mastery of each phase.\u201d For Duplantis, Mills says, \u201cIt is not just one element that he excels at.\u201d\nThrowback to the electrifying triumph of Armand Duplantis \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea at Tokyo 2020!\nWitnessing his golden leap in the men's pole vault was pure magic. Let's relive that exhilarating moment of sheer athleticism and determination. \ud83e\udd47\ud83c\udfc5#Tokyo2020 | #ArmandDuplantis | #GoldMedal |\u2026 pic.twitter.com/xXU8tmm9La\n\u2014 The Olympic Games (@Olympics) March 17, 2024\n\u201cA fast run-up is key as ultimately this will permit a greater grip height (of the pole). The higher you grip, the higher you vault,\u201d says Mills. \u201cMondo has one of the highest approach speeds on the run-up, he grips high.\u201d\nHis words echo what American pole vaulter KC Lightfoot said about Duplantis this summer: \u201cHe\u2019s just so fast down the runway. He\u2019s faster than all of us by quite a bit. Speed equals height in pole vault.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nChasing Mondo Duplantis: In Olympic pole vault, a trio of Americans try to topple a giant\nDuplantis (5ft 11in) is small by pole vault standards, built more like Lavillenie (5ft 10in) than the U.S.\u2019s Chris Nilsen (6ft 5in). As a high-schooler, he ran the 100m in 10.57s (wind-assisted by 0.1m/s) and long jumped 7.15m.\nIn a press conference for a Brussels Diamond League meet in 2022, Jamaican sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (who has the most global women\u2019s sprint titles in history) asked how fast he could run 100m. He looked her in the eyes and said he\u2019d beat her. Duplantis didn\u2019t give a time.\nMills says run-ups are \u201ctypically 14-20 strides\u201d. Duplantis runs from afar. His 20-stride run-up (pole vaulters count every other step, so it is a 10-step run-up) stretches 45 metres.\nMills explains \u201cthe plant phase\u201d, where Duplantis brings the pole down and plants it into the box, which is only \u201c20 centimetres deep and 60 centimetres wide\u201d. It is wider at the front and narrower at the bottom, where it slopes down.\nAdvertisement\nThe pole hits the strike plate and slides down to the back of the box where it reaches a \u2018cavity\u2019. This rectangle at the back of the box gives the pole space to move and bend when it hits the back wall. Duplantis says a big part of his success is reacting to how the pole moves.\nPole vaulters need to \u201censure they maximise their height at take-off by reaching up as high as possible from an accurate take-off position. The prep for the take-off and position are critical to converting run-up speed and that kinetic energy to the pole, and storing it as strain energy,\u201d says Mills.\nDuplantis is a right-handed vaulter, so that hand grips the top of the pole, palm facing the sky. The left hand is further down, palm facing the floor. Therefore, he jumps off his left leg (image one in the sequence above), which stays straight as he jumps (image two).\nNext, a lot of things happen in the blink of an eye. \u201cAfter take-off, the pole vaulter exerts force, via their hands, on the pole to aid the movement of the pole bend forward towards the bar,\u201d says Mills.\n\u201cOnce the pole vaulter has swung past the cord of the pole \u2014 an imaginary line between the top and bottom of the pole \u2014 the task becomes whole body rotation about the top hand (Duplantis\u2019 right),\u201d Mills explains. \u201cThe vaulter must swing upside down as quickly as possible (image three), to ensure they are in an optimal position as the pole starts to recoil.\u201d\nDuplantis, compared to other vaulters, gets into this inverted position much faster. It resembles how someone might \u2018cannonball\u2019 into a swimming pool. His left leg swings up, from straight. It follows the right knee (which was bent at take-off) and drives to the chest.\nMills says it is Duplantis\u2019 \u201ctiming on the pole and his ability to transfer the energy from the pole into himself that propels him to the heights that have never been achieved by any other athlete\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nImagine a coiled spring. \u201cThe strain energy in the pole is released and simultaneously the athlete pulls along the line of action to maximise vertical velocity, while maintaining sufficient horizontal velocity, to clear the bar,\u201d says Mills.\nThe legs shoot straight up as the pole straightens. If the events up until that point were explosive and sprinter-like, Duplantis now becomes half-gymnast, half-ballerina. Nilsen once said, \u201cMondo is the perfect mix between strength, finesse and speed.\u201d\nIn the extension phase, \u201cvaulters perform a half-turn followed by a pike position (upside-down V) over the bar\u201d, says Mills. There is detail. Duplantis\u2019 left hand comes off the pole as his feet clear the bar, then he pushes the pole away with his right hand just before the feet come down and the rest of the body follows. The chest and arms are whipped away from the bar as Duplantis falls.\nHis jumps never lack height, a testament to his speed. When his failures do come it is because his angles are slightly off and he comes down on the bar, clipping it with his legs or chest (see his 6.19m attempts at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021).\nThat happened at the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow early this year. Duplantis won, of course, but didn\u2019t manage any first-time clearances, needing three attempts at 5.85m, two at 5.95m, and three at 6.05m to win. He said it was the \u201chardest I have ever worked\u201d. On an off-day, by his standards, Duplantis still took gold and had three world-record attempts.\nDuplantis is so good that he now has to pass at heights. This creates a psychological endurance test. At the (outdoor) European Championships in June, which Duplantis won with a 6.10m championship record, he went in at 5.65m and cleared first-time through to and including 6.05m, his winning height. There were two hours and 27 minutes between his first and fifth jumps. Duplantis laid on his foam roller in between.\nAll this means he ends up in two competitions: having to beat everyone else first, then getting to target the world record. Whereas others might build up from their competition-winning height to the world record, Duplantis goes straight for it. This completely flips the physical and mental demands, as he then has to be prepared to jump higher in quick succession.\nAdvertisement\nBeing the best in the world means you have few athletes to look at for guidance and inspiration. Duplantis does sprint sessions four times a week and only jumps once, partly because his technical base is so good, mainly due to the physical tax of repeated jumps at these heights. When he does jump, he\u2019ll be at the track for hours, even if the session itself is only 45 minutes, but the warm-up and cool-down are long and complex. He still doesn\u2019t like lifting weights.\nDuplantis should be more arrogant. He acknowledges, rather than boasts, that he has won everything and broken every record. His support for fellow athletes in competitions belies his success. Duplantis wins graciously. There will be fewer more predictable events to watch in Paris, yet slightly paradoxically, few more watchable.\nMondo has a world stage to shine on again.\n(Top photo: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images)"
