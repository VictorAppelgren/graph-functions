      "feedback": "The draft is on solid footing in tying inflation normalization to higher discount rates and using Ford as a cash-flow anchor, and it rightly anchors the cross-asset view on Shopify-scale data, but it reads like a collection of observations rather than a tightly integrated, testable thesis; it also underdelivers on explicit scenario structuring, quantified sensitivities, and a decisive watch-list tied to observable signals. Actionable edits: (1) Rebuild into a single four‑pillar framework (macro/policy, platform/flows, valuation/technicals, regime signals) and map every claim to one or more IDs (W2622L6WW for Ford/Shopify, 5S9GJV2O3 for AI-capex/tech, UVEQ2SJ0W for governance/risk premia, HWGNUP2XG for consumer-price/margin dynamics); (2) formalize a clear causal chain from inflation normalization to discount-rate moves to valuation support, inserting a bounded, testable sequence: inflation prints and Fed/CB commentary drive yields up/down, which compresses/expands multiples, while platform breadth/AI monetization sustains GMV/revenue and cash flow; (3) add a medium-term scenario structure (base vs inflation‑surprise/inflation-stubborn) with explicit triggers and invalidation conditions; (4) quantify every core claim with the available numbers: Ford P/E ~10.3 and dividend yield ~5%; Shopify GMV 163B (+27%), revenue 5.0B (+29%), Q2 EV segment loss of 1.3B, 4.3% adj margin, 10.1% adj ROIC; link these to implied cash flow and margin paths; (5) deepen the cross‑asset logic by showing how the 10Y yield path and EURUSD regime shifts in the four-regime spine concretely feed the discount-rate and cash-flow dynamics, with explicit connections to the cited numbers; (6) expand the watch-list to 5–7 decisive signals (inflation prints vs target, central-bank communications, AI‑capex intensity indicators, regime shifts in EURUSD and 10Y yields, governance/frictions in large deals, and consumer-price discipline signals) and state what would trigger a recalibration; (7) tighten coherence and reduce redundancy by removing repeated tag-lines (W2622L6WW, etc.) and ensuring every assertion ties to at least one source; (8) explicitly acknowledge potential fragility points (inflation persistence, AI monetization failing to translate into GMV momentum) and specify which data would invalidate the base-case linkages; (9) ensure the conclusion clearly states the conditions under which the cross-asset view remains robust vs fragile, aligned with the four IDs.",
