She was 60, according to Sandra Jones, a family friend who is serving as the family's spokesperson.\n\n\"This untimely death is really hard to process right now,\" Jones told ABC News Tuesday. \"She is a sweet and gentle soul and she is going to be missed very, very much.\"\n\nSpencer starred in 65 episodes of \"What's Happening!!\", an ABC sitcom about three teenage boys growing up in the South Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, according to IMDb.\n\nSpencer played Dee Thomas, the boys' younger sister. She also appeared in 16 episodes of the show's sequel, \"What's Happening Now!\"\n\nIn 1977, Spencer survived a fatal car crash that killed her stepfather and manager, Tim Pelt, according to her biography on her website.\n\nAfter recovering from her injuries, Spencer went onto earn a doctorate degree in veterinary medicine in 1993.\n\nShe moved from California to the Richmond, Virginia, area in 2014. At the time of her death, she lived with her mom in an area outside of Richmond, according to Jones.\n\nIn addition to her mom, Cheryl Pelt, Spencer is also survived by her younger brother, jazz musician Jeremy Pelt.\n\nJeremy Pelt shared a tribute to his sister on Instagram Tuesday, writing, \"Many of you knew her as 'Dee,' but she was more than a child actress.\"\n\n\"She was a friend, an auntie to my three children who adored her, she was a daughter- and in many ways, my mother's best friend, she was a veterinarian, she was someone who always remained positive even during her darkest days fighting this disease,\" he continued. \"And she was MY sister and protector.\"\n\nHe added that he was \"thankful\" to be with his sister when she took her last breath and was \"gutted\" by her death, writing, \"I love you, forever.\"\n\nIn a 2016 interview with a local Richmond TV station, Spencer reflected on her acting career being featured at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I seriously can't even digest it,\" Spencer said. \"I mean, first of all, that the show is remembered from 40 years [ago], but then also to be featured in this museum along with other shows that have been trailblazers.\"\n\nSpencer said that her late stepfather brought her into the world of acting. At age 9, she said she got the call that she had won the role of Dee in \"What's Happening!!\"\n\n\"A month later I got a phone call, and they said, 'Fly out to California. You have the role.' And it was just like my life changed,\" she said.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. is the parent company of ABC and ABC News.",

There are 2,700 personnel in the D.C. National Guard.\nThe expectation is that if guardsmen are activated, it would be in a support role to local authorities.\nThe D.C. National Guard is unique in that, unlike other National Guards, it is not under the control of a governor or, in this case, the mayor of D.C., but the president.\nThat authority has been delegated to the defense secretary and the secretary of the Army.\n-ABC News\u2019 Luis Martinez\nAug 10, 2025, 3:40 PM EDT\nVance denies meeting at his residence on Epstein\nVice President JD Vance dismissed reports that a meeting took place at his residence with top administration officials Thursday that involved discussions about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\"There was no meeting at my house last night. There just wasn't,\" Vance told Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\"We did meet at the White House yesterday, but not at the time that they said that they -- that we were going to meet and not about the subject that we -- they said that we were going to meet about,\" Vance said in the interview that was taped on Friday.\n\"We actually didn't talk about the Epstein issue at all. That was never meant to be the subject of the meeting,\" he continued.\nVance said the reports came from someone leaking a calendar entry in which they assumed that it was about Epstein.\nVance reiterated that Trump has called for full transparency, and efforts are underway to compile documents.\n\"On the Epstein issue, what the president has said very clearly, because we have had other meetings about that, is that he wants us to be fully transparent and he wants the credible information out there. So, we're working to compile the thousands and thousands of documents that are out there for full transparency,\" Vance said.\nVance said he supported the decision by Rep. James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, to subpoena Bill and Hillary Clinton in its investigation of the Epstein files.\n-ABC News\u2019 Kelsey Walsh\nAug 10, 2025, 3:37 PM EDT\nTrump to hold Monday news conference on DC crime\nTrump announced on his social media platform that he\u2019ll hold a news conference at 10 a.m. Monday to discuss crime in Washington, D.C.\nThe president said that he has given D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser an opportunity to reduce crime rates but crime has gotten worse.\n\"The Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive. The American Public is not going to put up with it any longer,\" Trump said in his post.\nContrary to the president's claim, Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s preliminary year-to-date crime rate comparison shows that crime in D.C. has decreased by 7% since last year, with violent crime down 26% and property crime reduced by 5%.\n\u201cI will take care of our cherished Capital, and we will make it, truly, GREAT AGAIN! Before the tents, squalor, filth, and Crime, it was the most beautiful Capital in the World. It will soon be that again,\u201d Trump wrote.\n-ABC News\u2019 Kelsey Walsh\nAug 10, 2025, 1:35 PM EDT\nVance brushes off talk of 2028 ticket\nAfter Trump publicly suggested a Vance-Rubio ticket for 2028, the vice president shot down continued dialogue during an interview with Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo, saying that Rubio and he are not focused on politics right now.\n\"I saw Marco about a month ago. We just laughed at the whole thing, because neither one of us are focused on politics. We're focused on actually doing a good job for the American people,\" Vance said in the interview that aired on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\"If we do a good job, number one, that's the reward, in and of itself, that I will have made a big difference in the lives of our country for the last six months, the next 3.5 years. But if we do a good job, the politics will take care of itself,\" he continued.\nDespite Vance trying to navigate away from the topic, he did not dismiss the possibility of running for president in 2028 when asked.\n\"I'm not going to break that news today, Maria,\" he said. \"What I'm going to do is focus for the next year and a half on doing a really good job for the American people, winning the midterm elections in 2026. Then we can talk about politics after that.\""

      "text": "Supreme Court formally asked to overturn landmark same-sex marriage ruling\nKim Davis, a former clerk who refused gay couples, brought the appeal.\nTen years after the Supreme Court extended marriage rights to same-sex couples nationwide, the justices this fall will consider for the first time whether to take up a case that explicitly asks them to overturn that decision.\nKim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for six days in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to a gay couple on religious grounds, is appealing a $100,000 jury verdict for emotional damages plus $260,000 for attorneys fees.\nIn a petition for writ of certiorari filed last month, Davis argues First Amendment protection for free exercise of religion immunizes her from personal liability for the denial of marriage licenses.\nMore fundamentally, she claims the high court's decision in Obergefell v Hodges -- extending marriage rights for same-sex couples under the 14th Amendment's due process protections -- was \"egregiously wrong.\"\n\"The mistake must be corrected,\" wrote Davis' attorney Mathew Staver in the petition. He calls Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in Obergefell \"legal fiction.\"\nThe petition appears to mark the first time since 2015 that the court has been formally asked to overturn the landmark marriage decision. Davis is seen as one of the only Americans currently with legal standing to bring a challenge to the precedent.\n\"If there ever was a case of exceptional importance,\" Staver wrote, \"the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it.\"\nLower courts have dismissed Davis' claims and most legal experts consider her bid a long shot. A federal appeals court panel concluded earlier this year that the former clerk \"cannot raise the First Amendment as a defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect.\"\nDavis, as the Rowan County Clerk in 2015, was the sole authority tasked with issuing marriage licenses on behalf of the government under state law.\n\"Not a single judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals showed any interest in Davis's rehearing petition, and we are confident the Supreme Court will likewise agree that Davis's arguments do not merit further attention,\" said William Powell, attorney for David Ermold and David Moore, the now-married Kentucky couple that sued Davis for damages, in a statement to ABC News.\nA renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent\nDavis' appeal to the Supreme Court comes as conservative opponents of marriage rights for same-sex couples pursue a renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent and allow each state to set its own policy.\nAt the time Obergefell was decided in 2015, 35 states had statutory or constitutional bans on same-sex marriages, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Only eight states had enacted laws explicitly allowing the unions.\nSo far in 2025, at least nine states have either introduced legislation aimed at blocking new marriage licenses for LGBTQ people or passed resolutions urging the Supreme Court to reverse Obergefell at the earliest opportunity, according to the advocacy group Lambda Legal.\nIn June, the Southern Baptist Convention -- the nation's largest Protestant Christian denomination -- overwhelmingly voted to make \"overturning of laws and court rulings, including Obergefell v. Hodges, that defy God's design for marriage and family\" a top priority.\nSupport for equal marriage rights softening\nWhile a strong majority of Americans favor equal marriage rights, support appears to have softened in recent years, according to Gallup -- 60% of Americans supported same-sex marriages in 2015, rising to 70% support in 2025, but that level has plateaued since 2020.\nAmong Republicans, support has notably dipped over the past decade, down from 55% in 2021 to 41% this year, Gallup found.\nDavis' petition argues the issue of marriage should be treated the same way the court handled the issue of abortion in its 2022 decision to overturn Roe v Wade. She zeroes in on Justice Clarence Thomas' concurrence in that case, in which he explicitly called for revisiting Obergefell.\nThe justices \"should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,\" Thomas wrote at the time, referring to the landmark decisions dealing with a fundamental right to privacy, due process and equal protection rights.\n\"It is hard to say where things will go, but this will be a long slog considering how popular same-sex marriage is now,\" said Josh Blackman, a prominent conservative constitutional scholar and professor at South Texas College of Law.\nBlackman predicts many members of the Supreme Court's conservative majority would want prospective challenges to Obergefell to percolate in lower courts before revisiting the debate.\nThe court is expected to formally consider Davis' petition this fall during a private conference when the justices discuss which cases to add to their docket. If the case is accepted, it would likely be scheduled for oral argument next spring and decided by the end of June 2026. The court could also decline the case, allowing a lower court ruling to stand and avoid entirely the request to revisit Obergefell.\n\"Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett seem wildly uninterested. Maybe Justice Neil Gorsuch, too,\" said Sarah Isgur, an ABC News legal analyst and host of the legal podcast Advisory Opinions.\n\"There is no world in which the court takes the case as a straight gay marriage case,\" Isgur added. \"It would have to come up as a lower court holding that Obergefell binds judges to accept some other kind of non-traditional marital arrangement.\"\nRuling wouldn't invalidate existing marriages\nIf the ruling were to be overturned at some point in the future, it would not invalidate marriages already performed, legal experts have pointed out. The 2022 Respect for Marriage Act requires the federal government and all states to recognize legal marriages of same-sex and interracial couples performed in any state -- even if there is a future change in the law.\nDavis first appealed the Supreme Court in 2019 seeking to have the damages suit against her tossed out, but her petition was rejected. Conservative Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito concurred with the decision at the time.\n\"This petition implicates important questions about the scope of our decision in Obergefell, but it does not cleanly present them,\" Thomas wrote in a statement.\nMany LGBTQ advocates say they are apprehensive about the shifting legal and political landscape around marriage rights.\nThere are an estimated 823,000 married same-sex couples in the U.S., including 591,000 that wed after the Supreme Court decision in June 2015, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School. Nearly one in five of those married couples is parenting a child under 18.\nSince the Obergefell decision, the makeup of the Supreme Court has shifted rightward, now including three appointees of President Donald Trump and a 6-justice conservative supermajority.\nChief Justice John Roberts, among the current members of the court who dissented in Obergefell a decade ago, sharply criticized the ruling at the time as \"an act of will, not legal judgment\" with \"no basis in the Constitution.\" He also warned then that it \"creates serious questions about religious liberty.\"\nDavis invoked Roberts' words in her petition to the high court, hopeful that at least four justices will vote to accept her case and hear arguments next year."

And that's how Shannen felt, and that's how she lived her life,\" she said.\nRosa Doherty also reflected on the final weeks she was able to share with her daughter, calling them \"a gift.\"\n\"She moved me into a room next to her, closer to her, and then eventually... one night she said, 'Mom, will you come sleep with me,\" she said.\n\"That was such a gift for me, that I had in those final weeks,\"she said. \"It's like I could lay there, I could hear her breathing, and I could feel her.\u201d\n\"It was a gift. It's like a gift she gave to me,\" she said.\nShannen Doherty died at the age of 53 on July 13 after a years-long battle with cancer.\n\"The devoted daughter, sister, aunt and friend was surrounded by her loved ones as well as her dog, Bowie,\" a representative said in a statement at the time of her death.\nIn January, Doherty, who often shared updates on her cancer battle publicly, said on her podcast that she'd recently begin a new, unspecified cancer treatment infusion, saying it had begun \"breaking down the blood-brain barrier,\" enabling the treatment to get to her brain.\n\"I don't want to die,\" Doherty told People magazine in December 2023. \"I'm not done with living. I'm not done with loving. I'm not done with creating. I'm not done with hopefully changing things for the better. I'm just not -- I'm not done.\""

      "text": "Teacher arrested for Arkansas double murder admits to killing married couple: Police\nClinton and Cristen Brink were killed in a state park, police said.\nA 28-year-old teacher has admitted to murdering the married couple found stabbed to death on a walking trail in an Arkansas park over the weekend in what appears to be a \"completely random\" attack, police said.\nAndrew James McGann, 28, of Springdale, Arkansas, was charged with two counts of capital murder in the killings of 43-year-old Clinton David Brink and his wife, 41-year-old Cristen Amanda Brink, Arkansas State Police announced Wednesday evening.\nThe Brinks were \"fatally attacked\" while out hiking with their two daughters at Devil's Den State Park on July 26, police said. The \"horrific\" assault occurred about a half mile into the park, with the husband attacked first, police said.\nThe children, ages 7 and 9, were not harmed in the incident thanks to the actions of their mother, police said.\n\"We believe that the mother took them to safety, and then returned to help her husband,\" Maj. Stacie Rhoads with the Arkansas State Police said during a press briefing Thursday.\nFollowing a dayslong manhunt for the suspect, McGann was arrested shortly before 5 p.m. local time Wednesday at a barbershop in Springdale, about 30 miles north of the park, police said.\nDuring an interview with police, he admitted to killing the couple, Arkansas State Police Director Col. Mike Hagar said during Thursday's press briefing.\nDNA from blood recovered from the crime scene also matched McGann's DNA, Hagar said. The suspect had sustained cuts on his hands during a struggle with the victims, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation.\nItems recovered from his residence were \"consistent with being involved in this particular crime,\" Hagar said.\nMcGann had recently moved to the area from Oklahoma and had been hired to work at a local school, officials said.\nHe was hired to teach in the Springdale Public Schools district this upcoming school year but had not yet begun employment, according to the district's superintendent, Jared Cleveland.\n\"This individual has not at any time come into contact with Springdale students or the families we serve,\" Cleveland said in a statement, adding that no additional information is available at this time due to the ongoing investigation.\n\"Our entire team extends our deepest condolences to the Brink family. Their children are especially in our thoughts and prayers,\" he said.\nMcGann was a fifth grade teacher in Broken Arrows, Oklahoma, during the 2023-2024 school year, the school district said. He passed required background checks, a Broken Arrow Public Schools spokesperson said.\nThe prior school year, he was employed at an elementary school in Flower Mound, Texas, the Lewisville Independent School District confirmed. He was placed on administrative leave in the spring of 2023 \"following concerns related to classroom management, professional judgment, and student favoritism,\" and he ultimately resigned, the school district said.\n\"An internal investigation found no evidence of inappropriate behavior with students,\" the school district added.\nAsked about a motive in the double homicide, Hagar said it remains under investigation, though he did say it appeared to be a \"completely random event.\"\n\"We have no reason to believe that there was any known association between our suspects and our victims,\" Hagar said.\nThe victims died from stab wounds, and the murder weapon was a knife, Hagar said Thursday. Knives were recovered from the residence's home, but it is unclear if any was the murder weapon, Rhoads said.\nHagar said police received over 500 tips and credited the public's help with bringing the suspect into custody.\nArkansas State Police had also released a composite sketch and photo from behind of a man who was seen in Devil's Den State Park on Saturday, the day of the killings. Police asked for the public's help in identifying the man, who they said was wanted for questioning in connection with the double homicide.\nPolice previously said the suspect was seen leaving the area of the park in a black, four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda, with a license plate covered by tape, police said. The vehicle description was \"critical\" in identifying the suspect, Rhoads said.\nThough he took steps to conceal his identity, the suspect was \"very sloppy,\" Rhoads said.\nOnce they identified the suspect, McGann was arrested within an hour at the barbershop, she said.\nPolice do not believe the suspect was trying to alter his appearance in getting a haircut, according to Rhoads, saying, \"Could chalk that up to school starts next week.\"\nThe Brinks had recently moved to Prairie Grove from North Dakota, police said.\nThe children are safe and in the custody of relatives, according to police.\n\"Our entire state is grieving for the tragic loss and senseless and horrific crime that's taken place,\" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \"One of the worst experiences that certainly I've ever had was making a phone call to the Brink family earlier this week. Nothing like that should ever have taken place.\"\nHagar said the Brinks were a loving couple, and credited their two young daughters with helping in the case, saying they are \"in awe\" of them.\n\"The information that they were able to provide to start us down this path, to be able to make this arrest, it all started with those two little girls,\" he said. \"It's incredible.\"\nHagar said the couple has a third daughter who wasn't at the trail that day.\n\"It is my intention to use the full weight of my office to bring this defendant to justice for the Brinks family,\" Brandon Carter, the prosecuting attorney for Washington County, said at Thursday's press briefing.\nThe prosecutor's office will not be waiving the death penalty in the case, Carter said.\nMcGann is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Friday, with an arraignment expected next week.\nAll trails at Devil's Den State Park, which were closed following the killings, will remain closed for now, Arkansas Secretary of Parks Shay Lewis said.\nABC News' Sasha Pezenik contributed to this report."

It was the creative brainchild of producer Eric Monte(who also co-created and produced \"Good Times\"),and produced under Saul Turtletaub, Bernie Orenstein and Bud Yorkin(of \"Sanford and Son\",and \"All In The Family\"),\"What's Happening!\" premiered on ABC as a summer replacement for \"Barney Miller\" on August 5,1976 but returned on November 13,1976 as a regular series running three seasons and 65 episodes until April 28,1979.\nThis was one of my fondest memories of childhood back in the day,coming home and watching the antics of Roger,Dewayne,and Rerun getting into all sorts of trouble only to get Roger's smart-mouth sister Dee and Roger's mother get them out of unsuspected situations. Interesting note on \"What's Happening!!\",though.....it got the idea from a 1975 film \"Cooley High\"(on which the show was based)about three Chicago kids who were having fun and getting into all sorts of trouble......The show(getting back to \"What's Happening\"!!) was based in the residental section of Los Angeles where the mom was the single parent with two children in the household. The show itself was side-splitting hilarious indeed catching the gang down at the soda stop coming up with some crazy scheme or another,and catching Rerun and Shirley(the waitress) battling it out,or getting some girl to go out with them. The show was a major top ten hit for the ABC network(which started off as a trial run,but returned in the fall as a weekly series). The theme score to the show was done by the great Henry Mancini,and its a classic. Some of the cast members reunited for a spin off called \"What's Happening Now!!\",with Roger getting married off,and Rerun and Dewayne having a business of their own,and the waitress Shirley who brought Rob's Place and is the owner. Rumor has it that two of the cast members of that show Dewayne,(played by Haywood Nelson),and Dee(played by Danielle Spencer) are living in North Carolina now,and Roger(played by Ernest Thomas)is doing feature films(notably seen in Denzel Washington's movie \"The Hurricane\") nowadays. Great show,as it celebrates it Golden 40th Anniversary!!!

Great show,as it celebrates it Golden 40th Anniversary!!! Happy Anniversary Roger, Dewayne and Rerun!!!\nThis was one of my favorite tv shows growing up! as other users commented, it was the first thing i would turn on after school! it was not only the funniest show, but it dealt with a single parent home, and i was raised in a single parent home, so i related to it. i miss seeing Raj make a fool out of himself, by being so nerdy and Dee, with all the sarcasm, you never stopped laughing....and Shirley, anything she said, made you laugh. i think if more people posted their comments, than maybe it will impact someone to syndicate the show! as you can see, the cast of the show never really made it, perhaps this could help their careers, so bring us RERUNS of \"What's Happening\"! we miss Rerun and all his dance moves....\"Hey Hey Hey\"!\nI have to say that I grew up on these reruns. I was surprised to see and remember how much I enjoyed the show during the recent TV Land marathon. The show was still groundbreaking too. I never understood why Mabel King who played Mama so beautifully left. I still remember Rerun, Dwayne, Raj, Dee, and Shirley as a happy group of people in working class Los Angeles, California. I'm not black but I can relate to the financial struggles that they held despite maintaining a happy suburban life. They provided many memorable moments for me over the weekend. It was nice to see Irene Cara in a guest appearance and Alice Ghostley and others too many to mention. The sitcom was probably criticized in its day but today, I can see it as a brilliant piece of realistic comedy touching on subjects tactfully and carefully like teenage pregnancy, marriage, divorce, single-parent home and of course, financial problems like all families share. I believe it was the first sitcom in my memory to feature divorce in a positive light rather than negative. Enjoy it!\nBelieve me, WHATS HAPPENING came out on a perfect time. There was'nt a better TV show to grow up on! Who could ever forget 1)Raj, the wise, bird-cracklin nerdish dude who could never sit in a chair the right way! 2) Rerun, the round, always-in-step party mover 3) Dwayne, the not so smart, heckling nervous breakdown \"They cut off your fingers and your toes, man!\" 4) And good ol' bratty sister Dee, who reminded you of everyone's sister!\nWHATS HAPPENING is really missed by this commentator. Come on TVLAND, give us some RERUNs! RERUNs!\nWHATS HAPPENING is really missed by this commentator. Come on TVLAND, give us some RERUNs! RERUNs!\nWhat's Happening was loosely based on the movie \"Cooley High\". It is sometime shown in reruns along with its vastly inferior sequel, What's Happening Now.\nThe heart of the show was the relationship among the three high school buddies, studious Roger, dim bulb Dwayne, and clownish Rerun. The late Shirley Hemphill got off some good zingers as the surly waitress of the malt shop the guys hung out in. Dee was the perfect snide and bratty kid sister to Roger, and Mama dished out discipline and love.\nOne of the best episodes was a two-parter that is seldom shown in reruns. Roger, Rerun and Dwayne were forced into illegally taping a Doobie Brothers concert (the rock group appeared as themselves) by some criminals. The tape recorder is discovered when it falls out from underneath Rerun's coat, and one of the musicians sees it. The Doobie Brothers then work with the three buddies to catch the criminals.\nThe heart of the show was the relationship among the three high school buddies, studious Roger, dim bulb Dwayne, and clownish Rerun.

Shirley Hemphill, Haywood Nelson and Danielle Spencer carried the show through the duration of the walkout. Their demands were not met. After the third season, Berry and Thomas engaged in another walkout demanding more money. Even though the show ranked 29th in the 1978-79 season, ABC canceled it rather than deal with their demands.\n- GoofsThroughout the entire series, it is made very clear that neither Mama nor Raj have a car, as often indicated by Mama needing to ride the bus to work and Raj always needing rides from other people (or walking) to his many adventures and escapades. Yet, in the very first scene of the opening credits, Raj is seen exiting his house with two cars parked in the driveway.\n- Quotes\nFred 'Rerun' Stubbs: I can't help it if I'm fat! It runs in my family.\nDee Thomas: Nobody runs in your family... they all waddle!\n- Alternate versionsDuring its syndicated run, the tag sequences that were included in the original ABC network versions were removed.\n- ConnectionsFeatured in ABC's 50th Anniversary Celebration (2003)\n- How many seasons does What's Happening!! have?Powered by Alexa\nDetails\n- Release date\n- Country of origin\n- Language\n- Also known as\n- \u0427\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f!!\n- Filming locations\n- 1147 Tamarind Avenue, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA(The Thomas House - Opening Credits - Replaced by Apartments 2023)\n- Production companies\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content"
