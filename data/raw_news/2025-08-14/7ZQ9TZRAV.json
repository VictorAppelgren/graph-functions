  "title": "20 Island Vacations Where You Won't Need a Passport",
  "description": "If you\u2019re one of the (many) Americans without a passport, you still have a long list of options for an island vacation.",
  "content": "For a lot of people, the word vacation is synonymous with jetting off to an island paradise to stick your toes in the sand and sip a drink by the water. That may sound frivolous, but it's not\u2014research has shown that vacations are necessary, benefiting us in just about every way possible: mentally, emotionally, and physically.\n\nOne challenge to that dream: No passport. A little over half of Americans hold a valid passport, which means the other half's travel is restricted to the United States itself\u2014you even need a passport to travel to and from Canada and Mexico, these days. There are a lot of reasons for this, from cost (it can run about $500 just to get a family of four set up with passports) and the hassle of filling out the forms, getting the pictures, and waiting about six weeks to get it.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the millions of Americans without a passport, rejoice: The U.S. is so damn big you still have a lot of options for the island vacation of your dreams (you will probably need a Real ID, however). Here are 20 island vacations you can book right now, even if you don\u2019t have a valid passport.\n\nHawaii is probably the most obvious choice here\u2014it\u2019s a fully fledged U.S. state, so there\u2019s no barrier to getting there from just about anywhere else in the country (unless you consider spending hours on a plane to be a barrier). Hawaii feels like a separate tropical country in many ways, thanks to its incredible natural beauty and unique Indigenous culture. An archipelago, the main Hawaiian islands offer distinct experiences: The \u201cBig Island\u201d of Hawaii is filled with natural beauty and the vibrant history of the area; Lanai, the smallest island, is almost completely owned by billionaire Larry Ellison and offers a secluded, super private experience; Oahu, the state capital, is ideal if you want to mix an urban feel with your pristine beaches; Maui is the place to go if you want a super-luxe resort experience; and Kauai is ideal for anyone who wants to hike through unspoiled nature and have a bit of an adventure.\n\nPuerto Rico is a self-governing unincorporated territory of the United States, so you don\u2019t need a passport to travel there (and the residents are U.S. citizens). As a result, it\u2019s an almost ideal spot for an island vacation if you don\u2019t have a passport. Filled with gorgeous beaches, old cities, and a vibrant culture that translates into one of the most exciting nightlife scenes you can travel to, Puerto Rico has something for everyone. If you want to hit the nightlife and soak in old-world charm, check out San Juan (and Old San Juan). If you\u2019re looking for a beach-focused trip, look at Flamenco Beach on the island of Culebra, often ranked as one of the most beautiful in the world.\n\nPricey and with an exclusive feel, Nantucket is a terrific vacation spot if the tropical vibe isn\u2019t your thing. Accessible via ferry or plane (you can bring your car via the ferry, but there\u2019s not a lot of parking and it\u2019s really not necessary), the island offers gorgeous beaches, amazing food, luxury shopping, and a small-town vibe that\u2019s incredibly charming. It\u2019s an ideal place if your perfect vacation is renting some bikes, picnicking on the beach, and having a gourmet dinner at night. Keep in mind that Nantucket is pretty empty during the colder months, with a lot of businesses shut down, so it\u2019s more of a warm-weather destination.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think of Alabama as a vacation spot, you\u2019re probably not alone. But Dauphin Island is beautiful, situated on the Gulf and blessed with roomy, pristine white sand beaches that are ideal for sunset walks\u2014and are usually not very crowded. The vibe here is quiet and easygoing, more nap-focused than nightlife or water sports. If you\u2019re looking for an island where you can relax and de-stress, this is an ideal choice.\n\nA U.S. territory, Guam is very, very far away from the mainland (it can take 20 hours to get there from New York, and 17 to get there from Los Angeles) and offers a rich history, a distinctive culture, and plenty of amazing beaches. The tourist center, Tumon, offers terrific dining and shopping, but if you venture outside its borders you\u2019ll find beaches that feel private and infinite in natural beauty. The northern end of the same island chain, the Northern Mariana Islands, is a separate U.S. territory, offering more of a resort experience with the same level of spectacular natural beauty.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a peaceful, slow-paced getaway, consider Mackinac Island in Michigan. Located on Lake Huron, this pretty little island feels like a time portal. Cars aren\u2019t allowed, so you\u2019ll get around on bike, horse-drawn carriage, or by walking everywhere. This is a place you go when your goals are to gain five pounds, catch up on your sleep, and take in the incredible lake views as often as possible.\n\nYou might not think you can have a sun-soaked Mediterranean-style vacation just an hour away from Los Angeles, but that\u2019s because you\u2019ve never given Catalina Island a chance. Hop off the ferry and find yourself in a place where you can snorkel in pristine water, go shopping and dining in the picture-perfect town of Avalon, and hike through beautiful hills. If that\u2019s not enough of a challenge, try some zip-lining or a canyon excursion to add a little spice to your vacation.\n\nMost of Mount Desert Island is part of Acadia National Park, so if you\u2019re looking for untouched natural beauty in the Northeast, look no further. Rocky and mountainous, the island has a unique feel that you won\u2019t find anywhere else, and is an ideal spot for glamping, hiking, and just about any other outdoor activity you can imagine. The town of Bar Harbor offers some terrific restaurant and shopping options as well (you will eat so, so much lobster).\n\nWant brisk ocean breezes, more seafood than is probably wise, and a relaxed, weekend-ish attitude for your vacation? Block Island is your spot. Wander the gorgeous dunes, hit the beaches, check out the stunning cliffs\u2014and eat your weight in ice cream, which is everywhere. Known for its seafood restaurants, Block Island is a great place to exhaust yourself on the beaches during the day and then settle in for a delicious meal (with more ice cream, of course) while watching a spectacular sunset.\n\nIf you want your island vacation to be one big party, check out Fire Island. Just an hour or two from New York City, this island is like several vacations in one due to its uniquely divided population, organized into several distinct communities that each have their own vibe (including some of the oldest distinct LGBTQ+ communities in the country that have made Fire Island an iconic vacation spot for the queer community). The days can be filled with shopping and water activities, but the nights will be filled with music, dancing, and all-around revelry.\n\nAccessible from Seattle, San Juan Island is rustic, beautiful, and peaceful. While the town of Friday Harbor offers terrific food, nightlife, and shopping, the main draw here is the breathtaking beauty of the place, ideal for challenging hikes, kayaking excursions, and taking in a bit of American history in San Juan Island National Historical Park. You might even see an orca or two.\n\nLooking for an island filled with easy hiking, lakeside beauty, and a focus on local foodie culture? Orcas Island in Washington is your best bet. Cascade Lake offers a peaceful stillwater vibe (that you can paddle across if you\u2019re so inclined), and the farmer\u2019s market (held from May to September, and then indoors from October to Thanksgiving) is a chef\u2019s dream. This is a place where long walks turn into whole afternoons, and days end with drinks at the local pub.\n\nIsolated and remote, Isle Royale (a national park) is located on Lake Superior and can only be reached by boat or seaplane. It\u2019s a traditional Ojibwe land and features multiple archaeological sites, which requires some care be taken when on the island so you don\u2019t mess with the island\u2019s treasures. This is a vacation spot for folks who love camping, hiking, and kayaking\u2014there are no hotels or settlements here, just campsites (that you need a permit for) and wildlife\u2014so, so much wildlife. It will be a rough stay, but if that\u2019s your ideal travel setting, you will probably never forget Isle Royale.\n\nIf your island dreams are a bit more brisk than sun-soaked, Assateague Island is for you. Situated between Maryland and Virginia, this barrier island is ideal for camping out on the beach, doing a little kayaking, and enjoying the pure beauty of the place. That beauty includes the wild ponies that call the island home (there\u2019s an annual pony swim you can look into) as well as a thriving population of wild animals, largely protected from the modern world. There are zero hotels here, so this is perfect for folks who love camping out in the air on vacation.\n\nYou want a tropical vacation without the travel hassles? The U.S. Virgin Islands are for you. Territories of the United States, the islands of Saint Croix, Saint John, and Saint Thomas (plus about 50 smaller islands). Each island offers a slightly different vibe\u2014St. Thomas is great for shopping and tourist stuff, St. John is quieter and soaked in natural beauty, and St. Croix is perfect if you\u2019re a water-focused traveler who wants to dive, swim, and snorkel.\n\nIf your idea of a perfect island vacation involves golf, head for Amelia Island. Near Jacksonville, this Florida gem is quiet, pretty, and features the Amelia River Golf Club and The Golf Club of Amelia Island, so you can work on your handicap while you relax. If you need more than golf to fill your time, you can go horseback riding on the beach, go swimming in the ocean, or do the vacation thing and linger at a bar or cafe for hours.\n\nThe southernmost territory of the U.S., American Samoa is where you should go if you\u2019re looking for a truly unspoiled spot of natural beauty. This isn\u2019t where you go to party, it\u2019s where you go to detox from the party, reconnecting with nature and soaking in the proud Polynesian culture of the place. If your ideal vacation involves roughing it a bit, hiking a lot, and being unplugged from your normal life, American Samoa offers all of that without the hassle of a passport.\n\nNo cars, almost no streets\u2014Daufuskie Island is idyllic and quiet. And beautiful, filled with lush paths through mossy woods and beautiful beaches. It\u2019s also a unique and historic spot, awash in the West African Gullah culture brought there by slaves and kept alive today by their descendants. Between the guided tours and local artisan shops, a vacation on Daufuskie Island is more than just a beautifully relaxing experience, it will also broaden your appreciation of American history.\n\nIdeal for fishing enthusiasts (especially salmon and trout), Prince of Wales Island is huge for an island (about 130 miles long) and dotted with quirky, interesting towns. You\u2019ve got the best of both worlds here: In Craig, the largest village on the island, you can find comfortable hotels, fun restaurants, and other town staples. But you can also head out with your backpack and boots and vanish into lush, gorgeous wilderness for a long hike, a day spent fishing, or exploring the smaller villages.\n\nIf you like your vacations to have the same vibe as a Jimmy Buffett song, head south and don\u2019t stop until you hit Key Largo\u2014then just keep going until you hit Key West (you can drive the whole way). The keys offer everything you could want by way of beaches, water activities, and nightlife. They\u2019re also uniquely American, with a laid-back, informal lifestyle that leads to unexpected experiences. While you can definitely pick a spot and stay there, the Keys are also a terrific place to run around and explore, rewarding you with plenty of hidden spots, quirky towns, and unexpected moments of natural bliss.",

      "text": "The final (final) deadline for the Department of Homeland Security's REAL ID requirement is upon us, and unlike so many instances in the two decades since the new rules were passed, it doesn't appear that air travelers are getting another extension to obtain an identification that complies.\nThe 2005 REAL ID Act aimed to standardize state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards by 2008, though the rollout was delayed until 2020, then 2023, then 2025. Starting May 7, anyone age 18 and over passing airport security or entering certain federal buildings with their license will need a REAL ID.\nMany states have issued REAL IDs in recent years upon license renewal or upgrade, so if yours has a gold or black star in the corner, you are already good to go. However, if you've procrastinated this change, you may still be able to fly with an alternative ID.\nAlternatives to REAL ID for air travel\nIf you need to go through a TSA checkpoint after May 7 and don't have a REAL ID-compliant license, you can use one of the following alternative forms of identification:\nU.S. passport\nU.S passport card\nDHS Trusted Traveler card (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)\nState-issued Enhanced Driver's License (available to residents in Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, and Washington only)\nTSA will also accept IDs like Enhanced Tribal Cards, permanent resident and border crossing cards, Department of Defense IDs (and other federal worker credentials), and foreign passports. TSA does accept expired IDs up to a year after expiration, and you may still be allowed to clear security without a valid ID upon completion of an identity verification process.\nTo get a REAL ID, you'll need to check your state's requirements. Typically, these include proof of your legal name, date of birth, Social Security number, address, and residency status. You'll also need to go in person to have your photo taken and pay a fee. REAL ID is only required for clearing security at airports (and some federal buildings)\u2014you do not need one to drive or vote."

      "text": "Americans want to see the world, but only 51% took this important step to do it\nIf you got a passport recently, you\u2019re in good company.\nThe State Department announced Wednesday that it issued 24.5 million passport books and cards in fiscal year 2024, up by roughly 500,000 from the year before. That marked the third record-breaking year in a row.\n\u201cMore Americans now than ever before have passports, which means more Americans can travel abroad than at any time in our history,\u201d Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Rena Bitter told USA TODAY in an interview ahead of the announcement. \u201cIt's exciting for them, and it's really good for our country.\u201d\nThose numbers have increased significantly in recent years.\nHow many people have US passports?\nFifty-one percent of Americans now have passports, up from 46% in 2023 and 30% in 2008. There are more than 171 million valid U.S. passports in circulation, according to the State Department.\nHow long does it take to get a passport?\nAfter passport processing times dipped to their lowest since before the COVID-19 pandemic in December, they dropped again earlier this month. Travelers can now expect to wait between four and six weeks for routine service \u2013 excluding mailing times \u2013 while estimates for expedited service remain two to three weeks.\nWait times ballooned in the wake of the health crisis, but Bitter said the State Department has worked hard to bring them down, particularly since last summer. Those steps included bringing in efficiency experts, implementing new technology and improving messaging to applicants to encourage them to apply early.\n\u201cI mean, we have really, really turned everything around in just a year's time,\u201d said Bitter.\nThe State Department has also added team members to help meet demand, increasing staffing by 20% since December 2022. Bitter noted they will open new passport agencies in six U.S. cities \u201cin the coming years,\u201d as well.\n\u201cAnd the idea there is just, some people really do need to or want to renew their passport in person,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want that personal service, and we want to make sure that we bring that to people a little bit closer to where they live.\u201d\nCan I renew my passport online?\nOnline passport renewal became available nationwide last month after beta testing. More than 1 million people have used the service, according to Bitter, and 5 million are expected to do so each year going forward.\nThat will help both travelers and workers. \u201cWe're not going to have different standards for different kinds of products, but overall because such a large percentage of our work will be done online, we think it's going to really give us quite a bit more flexibility in our service commitments,\u201d said Bitter.\nNathan Diller is a consumer travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Nashville.
