  "description": "To help you find a tinted sunscreen that feels nice to apply and provides adequate coverage, we tested 12 popular products on different skin types and tones.",
  "content": "A great tinted sunscreen does double duty as a skin care essential and a seamless base for your complexion. These SPFs can go beyond your average face sunscreens and toe the line between makeup and sun protection.\n\nBut finding a tinted sunscreen that feels nice to apply, works for different skin tones and provides adequate coverage is tricky. That\u2019s why we found four CNN Underscored editors who were up to the task of testing 12 popular formulas to find the best tinted sunscreens for your routine. And while sunscreen is certainly top of mind during summer, I\u2019ll never miss an opportunity to remind you that it\u2019s a year-round essential, and these picks will benefit you throughout all seasons.\n\nSupergoop! is one of our go-to sunscreen brands, and this tinted SPF didn\u2019t disappoint. Digital content strategist Madison Yerke tested the Protec(tint) Daily Skin Tint and confirmed that it\u2019s a great finishing touch to her skin care routine.\n\n\u201cThis formula is lightweight and seamlessly blended into my skin,\u201d Yerke said. It stands apart from the other products we tested because it\u2019s a hybrid formula, using both chemical (homosalate and octisalate) and mineral (zinc oxide) filters to create a lighter, smoother texture. It also contains ectoin, a hydrating and soothing ingredient, as well as hyaluronic acid-infused clay to help with oil control.\n\nAnother highlight was the shade range that includes different undertones and 14 total options. Yerke felt like the 30W Medium Golden shade was spot-on for her skin, making it foolproof to blend and apply. With light coverage, it enhanced and evened her skin while adding a glowy finish. Yerke thought the $44 price point seemed high for the 1.18-ounce bottle, but its skin care-packed formula and gorgeous finish made it worth the value.\n\nBeauty of Joseon is a Korean skin care brand that went viral for its sunscreen. This year, it launched the Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen, its first 100% mineral-tinted SPF. For those prone to hyperpigmentation and melasma, a mineral-based sunscreen may be even more favorable, as some studies have shown that zinc oxide and titanium dioxide filters are better at blocking visible light, which worsens those conditions. Mineral sunscreen is generally the safest choice for sensitive skin types too.\n\nMade with zinc oxide, the Beauty of Joseon skin tint has a silky, fluid formula that gives sheer coverage. I prefer a natural finish when wearing foundation or tinted moisturizers, and I found this formula to give just that. It\u2019s in the sweet spot just between makeup and sunscreen. Because it\u2019s so light, it layers well both on top of my vitamin C serum and daytime moisturizer and underneath my other makeup, like blush and bronzer.\n\nThe Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen comes in 12 shades, which is a good start, but the range could be broader. As I got a bit of a tan during testing, I found myself between LN110 and LP110, so I\u2019d mix the two shades. Since the product is only $20 \u2014 less than half the price of Supergoop! and some others we tested \u2014 I can justify buying two shades to find or create the best fit.\n\nThe assortment of products we tested includes dermatologist-recommended formulas, internet-loved skin tints and drugstore standbys. We had four CNN Underscored staffers try at least two formulas each, evaluating each product after multiple uses over two weeks. Our testers have a range of skin types and differing familiarity with tinted sunscreens. Here are the criteria we took note of.\n\nKosas\u2019 DreamBeam earned top scores from senior lifestyle editor Tamara Kraus, but testing writer Michelle Rae Uy reviewed it for another story and found it to be incompatible with her sensitive skin. The zinc oxide-based SPF has a watery consistency that Kraus said \u201cwas super easy to blend, lightweight and it made me look like I just got back from the beach and like I didn\u2019t snooze my alarm three times.\u201d\n\nKraus tested it after getting a tan on a trip to Miami, Florida, and opted for the Sunlit shade, which was nearly an identical match to her current skin tone. \u201cI normally finish off my tinted SPF with bronzer and blush (and sometimes highlighter) but felt this formula covered all my steps in one swoop, so all I needed was mascara and I was ready for the day!\u201d she said. Kraus loved the glowy, bronzy finish of the tinted SPF, which lasted all day. Because it replaced multiple steps in her makeup routine, she felt the $40 price tag was worth it.\n\nColorescience\u2019s Face Shield Flex sunscreen is truly unlike other tinted SPFs. The serum-like formula comes out of the bottle white, and as you blend it in with your fingers, the iron oxide pigments change colors to create a flexible tinted shade with no white cast in sight. When I originally reviewed Face Shield Flex, I tested the Medium shade, which was the second lightest shade at the time. It wasn\u2019t a perfect match for my skin and erred more olive-toned after the formula was blended and oxidized. This time around, I tested the new Light shade, which is between the lightest Fair shade and Medium, and found it to be a much better match.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the lightest or most comfortable formula I\u2019ve tried, especially if you\u2019re applying the recommended nickel-sized amount to get enough SPF coverage, so it lost some points there. The tinted sunscreen provides foundation-like coverage, however, so it\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re looking for a buildable base for your makeup. Because it doubles as a foundation, it\u2019ll save you a step in your routine. This, along with the innovative formula, also justifies the higher price point.\n\nI tested this formula in Tinted and also enlisted my partner to try the Medium shade. As someone with medium to deep skin, my partner prefers tinted formulas if he\u2019s using a mineral SPF, since white cast easily shows on him. He liked that the La Roche-Posay tinted sunscreen didn\u2019t look or feel like wearing makeup. The fluid formula is oil-free, safe for sensitive skin and infused with additional antioxidant protection.\n\nWe both found our respective shades to be sheer, although the shade match could\u2019ve been a bit better for me. With my summer tan, I\u2019m somewhere in between Tinted and Medium, and I would sometimes mix the two. I also thought it felt a bit heavy after layering on the appropriate amount (two finger-lengths\u2019 worth) for adequate SPF coverage. Similar to the other formulas I tested, I always needed to wash my hands after applying the tinted sunscreen because a decent amount of pigment stayed on my fingers. While similar in consistency to the winning Beauty of Joseon formula, the limited shades and higher price point kept this SPF in the middle of the pack.\n\nUpdates writer Ellen McAlpine loved the radiant finish of this chemical SPF but noted that the three shades it comes in are just a choice between cool, warm or tan, rather than a correcting color to hide blemishes, redness or dark circles. This makes sense for the product, since it\u2019s described as a primer; you can easily layer a concealer, tinted moisturizer or foundation over it.\n\n\u201cI did like layering this under my concealer for a lighter coverage look that gave my skin a dewy, hydrated look,\u201d McAlpine said. \u201cThis is something I think I\u2019ll wear ahead of beach or pool days with friends, when I don\u2019t mind wearing minimal makeup but want just a touch of glow.\u201d She thought it was easy to reapply on those minimal product days, but it would be too messy to reapply on days when she wore more makeup on top.\n\nIn addition to its radiance, McAlpine appreciated that the formula included hyaluronic acid and squalane, which helped keep her skin stay moisturized throughout the day.\n\nTower 28\u2019s SunnyDays was the most makeup-like tinted SPF we tested, making it a great option for those looking for a multipurpose product. Best of all, the mineral formula is safe for sensitive skin and even has the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance. I found it easiest to apply it with my fingers, although I\u2019ve seen people online use a BeautyBlender or makeup brush too. At first, it has a shiny finish, but it dries down within a minute and leaves behind even coverage and a natural look, taking the place of foundation. One downside was that it oxidized after a couple of hours and appeared a bit darker than the shade I initially applied. Since it\u2019s summertime, I can get away with a more bronzed look, but I may try to opt for a slightly lighter shade than my natural skin tone next time.\n\nGiven that it looks and feels more like makeup than sunscreen, I\u2019d still recommend layering it over your daily moisturizer and even a regular face sunscreen for good measure. Oftentimes, with tinted sunscreens, you need to apply more than the standard recommended amount for adequate sun protection. As a reminder, two finger lengths or about a nickel-sized amount is the minimum dermatologists recommend. But a product as pigmented as SunnyDays can feel heavy-handed, so I prefer to layer it over another mineral SPF for the best look and for confidence in my sun protection.\n\nAs someone with fair skin, McAlpine liked that this sunscreen offered SPF 50 and that the formula was super light and provided a satin finish. However, she wouldn\u2019t consider the tint universal, as it only looked good if she applied self-tanner to the rest of her body. That said, the advanced formula is loaded with anti-aging skin benefits \u2014 peptides, antioxidants and sun-damage-repairing DNA Repairsomes \u2014 that make it a good option for mature skin looking for a sheer tint.\n\nAvailable in three flexible shades, this drugstore mineral SPF is safe for acne-prone skin, as it\u2019s free from fragrance and noncomedogenic. It also contains skin barrier-supporting ceramides, soothing niacinamide and hydrating hyaluronic acid. Kraus, who tested the Medium shade, found the formula to be generally pleasant.\n\nShe said it \u201ctook a little more elbow grease\u201d to blend in compared to Kosas\u2019 DreamBeam and looked oily at first but became more matte throughout the day. \u201cIf you want a tinted SPF that replaces your normal foundation or has heavier coverage, this is probably not for you,\u201d Kraus added.\n\nBack when beauty balm (aka BB cream) became mainstream in the US in the 2010s, Dr. Jart+\u2019s tinted moisturizer quickly gained popularity. It\u2019s a light-coverage product that delivers skin care benefits with niacinamide and glycerin, but we thought it fell short overall. Yerke tested it in Medium-Tan, and although it was a good shade match, she said she wouldn\u2019t replace her concealer or foundation with the BB cream. She thought it felt \u201cstiff to rub in,\u201d cakey to reapply and found the matte finish to look straight-up dull.\n\nAccording to the brand\u2019s website and Sephora, it contains mineral and chemical sunscreen filters, but we found it odd that no active ingredients are listed on the product pages. The SPF filters are present on the packaging itself, but for those shopping online, it\u2019s nearly impossible to discern, which can pose issues if you have sensitivity to UV filters.\n\nLightsaver is a dermatologist-founded brand, so this sunscreen is made to address various skin concerns and sensitivities. It has the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance and contains ingredients to help repair damage from the sun and blue light. Kraus said it didn\u2019t feel like she was wearing anything after she blended it in, but it also didn\u2019t look like she was wearing a tinted SPF either.\n\n\u201cThe only downside is that it doesn\u2019t offer multiple shades, so it\u2019s not really meant to replace foundation or other face makeup like Kosas did for me,\u201d Kraus said. She also noticed a \u201csmidge of a white cast\u201d on top of her summer tan, which was easy for her to camouflage with bronzer and blush but wouldn\u2019t be as compatible with darker skin.\n\nMcAlpine described this tinted SPF as having \u201csolid coverage\u201d that helped hide her rosacea. \u201cThe formula was thicker than I anticipated, but it still blended out easily while feeling lightweight on my skin,\u201d she said. She liked its radiant finish that fell between looking oily and matte. Like the Tower 28 SunnyDays tube, you only get 1 ounce of product, though, which McAlpine felt made the $42 price too steep for that amount. She would be more inclined to repurchase if it were $10 cheaper (which SunnyDays is, by the way).\n\nThe following FAQs have been answered by double board-certified dermatologists Dr. Brendan Camp and Dr. Madalyn Nguyen.\n\nTo help us decide which tinted sunscreen was best, we organized a testing panel consisting of four Underscored staffers with different skin types and tones.\n\nFor this article, we consulted the following experts to gain their professional insights on tinted sunscreen.\n\nCNN Underscored has a skilled team of writers and editors with many years of experience testing, researching and recommending products who ensure each article is carefully edited and products are properly vetted. We talk to top experts when it makes sense to make certain we are testing each product accurately, recommending only the best products and considering the pros and cons of each item.\n\nFor this story, four Underscored staff members, including beauty and fashion editor Sophie Shaw, personally tested each of the tinted sunscreens featured to find the very best options.",

  "summary": "The article discusses the importance of finding the best tinted sunscreens for your skin care routine and maintaining a seamless foundation for your complexion. The article tested 12 popular formulas from Supergoop!, including the Protec(tint) Daily Skin Tint, which uses both chemical (homosalate and octisalate) and mineral (zinc oxide) filters to create a lighter, smoother texture and contains ectoin, a hydrating ingredient, and hyaluronic acid-infused clay to help with oil control. The Korean skin care brand, Beauty of Joseon, launched the Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen, its first 100% mineral-tinted SPF this year. The 30W Medium Golden shade was found to be a great addition to her skin, enhancing and evening her skin while adding a glowy finish. However, testing writer Rae Uyyus found it difficult to blend and apply and was unsure about its compatibility with her sensitive skin. The product was reviewed by senior lifestyle editor Tamara Kraus, while testing writer Michelle Michelle Uyus for the zinc-based SPF was reviewed for its consistency. The selection includes dermatologist-recommended formulas and drugstore standbys.",

      "text": "Tinted sunscreens: Benefits beyond an attractive glow\nTinted sunscreens are having a moment. These mineral-based sunscreen formulations have an added color base that can help even out skin tone while protecting your skin. And thanks to their ability to block visible light, they may help certain skin conditions. Could the days of unsightly sunscreen residue be in your past?\nWhat is visible light, and how can it affect your skin?\nUltraviolet (UV) radiation and visible light are both part of the electromagnetic spectrum. UV radiation is composed of three different wavelengths: UVA, UVB, and UVC. UVC is mostly absorbed by the ozone layer, so UVA and UVB are the primary wavelengths that penetrate the skin\u2019s surface. The harmful effects of UV light on the skin have been well documented. UVA is primarily responsible for premature skin aging, and UVB has been implicated in sunburns and skin cancer. The primary source of UV radiation is sunlight.\nVisible light is also emitted by the sun. It is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be perceived by the human eye. Visible light may also come from artificial sources, including medical devices, screens, and light bulbs. Visible light has several skin-related therapeutic uses at specific wavelengths, including treatment of superficial blood vessels, removing unwanted hair, and treating acne and precancerous skin lesions.\nVisible light penetrates much deeper into the skin than UV radiation, and can also have negative consequences for your skin. For example, visible light has been implicated in exacerbating disorders of excess skin pigmentation, including melasma and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark spots). One study showed that visible light caused more noticeable, persistent hyperpigmentation that UVA alone, especially in people with deep skin tones. This may be especially true for blue light (the kind emitted by device screens), which seems to promote pigment production more than other wavelengths of the visible light spectrum.\nComponents of tinted sunscreens\nBroad-spectrum, non-tinted sunscreens contain filters that block UVA and UVB, but these preparations are not designed to block visible light. To block visible light, a sunscreen must be visible on skin. The problem? The particles in broad-spectrum, non-tinted sunscreens are \u201cnanosized\u201d (made smaller) to help reduce the white appearance of sunscreen. Thus, non-tinted sunscreens are formulated to be invisible on skin, and therefore cannot block visible light.\nTinted sunscreens combine broad-spectrum mineral UV filters, like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, with added pigments \u2014 pigmentary titanium dioxides and iron oxides \u2014 that create the visible, skin-tone color that can reflect away visible light. The colored base of tinted sunscreens is created by mixing different amounts of black, red, and yellow iron oxides with pigmentary titanium dioxide, resulting in a tinted sunscreen that can be matched to any skin tone.\nWhile these pigments are considered inactive, there have been two reports of allergic reactions to iron oxides contained in mascara products. Otherwise, these ingredients appear to be well tolerated.\nTinted sunscreens may help certain skin conditions\nTinted sunscreens can provide anyone an instant, skin-evening glow, while simultaneously helping to protect your skin from both sunlight and artificial light.\nGrowing evidence suggests that tinted sunscreens may be particularly important for people who are prone to hyperpigmentation or melasma. That\u2019s due to their ability to block visible light, which is known to exacerbate these conditions. Tinted sunscreens have been found to reduce relapses of melasma more than non-tinted, broad-spectrum sunscreens. Tinted sunscreens have also been shown to reduce hyperpigmentation, both on the skin surface and under a microscope. Iron oxide, in particular, appears to be particularly effective at blocking blue light.\nWhat should I look for in a tinted sunscreen?\nChoosing a broad-spectrum, tinted sunscreen may help prevent age-related skin damage (thanks to UVA filters), may help to prevent cancer-inducing skin changes (thanks to UVB filters), and may help protect against excess pigmentation (thanks to the color base that blocks visible light).\nTinted sunscreens are now widely available to purchase online or in retail stores. If you are prone to hyperpigmentation or melasma, choose a tinted sunscreen that contains iron oxide (you\u2019ll see it on the ingredient list).\nFollow me on Twitter @NeeraNathanMD.\nAbout the Authors\nNeera Nathan, MD, MSHS, Contributor\nDieter Manstein, MD, PhD, Contributor\nDisclaimer:\nAs a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.
