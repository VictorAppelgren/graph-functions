He's now only married to Robyn Brown, whom he legally wed in 2014 after their spiritual marriage occurred in 2010. Kody's relationship with his 18 children have also been a topic of debate amongst fans of the show.\n\nBut the fans weren't the only people that reacted negatively to Kody's casting. His fellow season 4 castmate, Brianna \u201cChickenfry\u201d LaPaglia, also weighed in and revealed she experienced tension with the Sister Wives star while filming.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t know who he was while filming,\u201d she wrote in a since-expired Instagram Story, according to US Weekly. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t necessarily ~get along well~ lmao you will see.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpecial Forces follows a group of celebrities who are shipped off to a foreign country and participate in various challenges that mimic military training.\n\nIn addition to Gia, Kody and Brianna, the cast includes Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice, Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson East and her husband, former NFL athlete Andrew East; and singer Jessie James Decker and her husband, former NFL athlete Eric Decker.\n\nRounding out the cast is Empire alum Jussie Smollett, The Valley star Brittany Cartwright, The Real Housewives of Atlanta alum Eva Marcille, model Chanel Iman, Transformers actor Ravi V. Patel and Montana Boyz TikToker Mark Estes.\n\nSpeaking about her experience, Gia said, \u201cThe rest of the cast was really amazing. Everyone was so strong, so motivating. And I think we all motivated each other in some way. I would say we were a really strong team.\u201d\n\nGia also raved about starring on the show opposite her mom. \"It\u2019s not every day that you get to say that you have done some of the craziest tasks and challenges with your mom,\" she said.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely an experience that I will hold very close to my heart and remember forever, that I was able to do this with her,\" she added.\n\n\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n\n\nSpecial Forces: World's Toughest Test season 4 premieres on Thursday, Sept. 25 at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Fox.",

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2016. People Editorial Guidelines Published on July 16, 2025 02:39PM EDT 28 Comments Jax Taylor. Credit : Charles Sykes/Bravo via Getty NEED TO KNOW A source tells PEOPLE that The Valley cast was \"absolutely blindsided by the news\" of Jax Taylor's departure from the show Taylor said in a statement on July 16 that he'd be \"stepping away\" to focus on his sobriety The source says the cast was \"not given any advance notifications about his exit\" and that the news came as \"a huge surprise\" The Valley cast was just as shocked as fans to learn about Jax Taylor's exit from the show. On Wednesday, July 16, Taylor, 46, revealed in a statement that he would be \"stepping away from the next season of The Valley\" to focus on his sobriety, and a source tells PEOPLE the \"cast was absolutely blindsided by this news.\" \"They were not given any advance notifications about his exit,\" says the source. \"Most of the cast were notified that filming was going to begin at the end of the summer, and they expected Jax would be a part of the new season because \u2014 even as lately as yesterday \u2014 he hadn't said otherwise. This is a huge surprise.\" Bravo has not commented on Taylor's departure. In his statement, Taylor said that his decision to leave the show came \"after an incredibly challenging year,\" as well as \"many honest conversations with my team and producers.\" Taylor entered an in-patient facility for mental health and addiction struggles in August 2024, six months after announcing his separation from his estranged wife and fellow The Valley castmate Brittany Cartwright, with whom he shares Cruz, 4. While in the facility, Cartwright, 36, filed for divorce. \"Right now, my focus needs to be on my sobriety, my mental health, and coparenting,\" Taylor said in his statement. \"Taking this time is necessary for me to become the best version of myself \u2014 especially for our son, Cruz.\" Jax Taylor, Brittany Cartwright and their son Cruz. Gabe Ginsberg/Getty During a March podcast appearance, Taylor revealed his longtime struggles with cocaine addiction. Taylor admitted that it was \"hard\" to reveal his substance abuse issues \"out loud.\" \"I\u2019ve been dealing with this on and off since I was 23 and now I\u2019m 45,\" he said. \"There was times where I would stop doing it but then there were times where I\u2019d go heavy on it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never said this in my life,\" he continued. \"So to come out and say that I have an addiction [and] that I have a sickness that I have to work on the rest of my life is a really big deal for me. Obviously, it\u2019s a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.\u201d Related Stories Jax Taylor Announces He Is 'Stepping Away' from 'The Valley' to Focus on His Sobriety: 'This Time Is Necessary' Jax Taylor Says He Is 'Feeling Great' amid Sobriety and 'Will Not Touch Drugs and Alcohol Again' (Exclusive) Cartwright told PEOPLE in April that she\u2019d had \u201cenough\u201d of Taylor\u2019s \u201ccome downs\u201d related to his substance abuse issues leading up to their separation. Cartwright said things with Taylor \"got so bad\" that she \"had to take Cruz out of the house.\" \"He was just so aggressive and horrible to me, yelling at me in front of our son,\u201d she said. After they split, \u201che just spiraled out of control,\u201d she said. \"There was no possible way that we were going to meet back in the middle again.\" Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright. Noam Galai/Bravo via Getty Images Cartwright's decision to file for divorce while Taylor was in the facility was depicted in the current second season of The Valley. In the June 10 episode of the show, Cartwright met with a divorce lawyer and said she was \"terrified\" she was going to allow Taylor \"to slowly make his way back into my life.\" \"I need to go ahead and rip the Band-Aid off, get this process started and never look back,\" she said. \"I know deep down this is the right next step.\" In the June 17 episode of the show, Taylor said during a confessional that being served divorce papers upon his return from the facility was \"f------ hard.\" \"Imagine coming out of a facility, dealing with your mental health issues and then being slammed with divorce papers,\" he said. \"And then, on top of it, it going public before you've even had the time to digest it. It's hard.\" \"Getting those divorce papers, it's devastating,\" he continued. \"We're both so hurt. We both hurt each other so much in the last couple of years. We don't have anything left.\" Along with Taylor and Cartwright, The Valley also stars Kristen Doute, Luke Broderick, Jesse Lally, Michelle Saniei, Daniel Booko, Nia Sanchez, Jasmine Goode, Zack Wickham and Janet and Jason Caperna.

The Barstool Sports personality took to Instagram that same day to answer fan questions, and one user asked if it was awkward filming with Brown.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t know who he was while filming,\u201d she wrote via her Instagram Story. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t necessarily ~get along well~ lmao you will see.\u201d\nSpecial Forces: World\u2019s Toughest Test puts celebrity contestants through grueling challenges that real United States Special Forces hopefuls must complete if they want to join the military. (Previous winners include season 1\u2019s Hannah Brown and Carli Lloyd, season 2\u2019s Nick Viall, Tyler Cameron and Erin Jackson and season 3\u2019s Kayla Nicole and Brody Jenner.)\nBrown is stepping out of the Sister Wives shadow to take on the challenge just months after saying his ex-wives, Meri Brown, Janelle Brown and Christine Brown, have painted him as a villain on the TLC reality hit. He has been married to fourth wife Robyn Brown since 2014.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about being the villain,\u201d he said in a May episode of Sister Wives: One-on-One. \u201cIt\u2019s about being villainized.\u201d\n\u201cMy mouth runs fluidly.

Bryan, 29, posted a video of a Barstool Sports \u201cSaturdays are for the Boys\u201d flag on fire via his Instagram Story on Monday, August 4 as an apparent swipe at his ex, as Tyler Childers\u2019 song \u201cBitin\u2019 List\u201d played in the background.\nChickenfry appeared to respond on Monday by posting \u201cNurse, he\u2019s loose again\u201d to her story.\nDuring her Q&A on Wednesday, Chickenfry spoke more about her emotions while filming Special Forces, saying she cried \u201cevery day\u201d and that viewers will see her experience \u201cpanic attack after panic attack.\u201d It appeared, however, that she found the experience worthwhile, saying she learned \u201cso much.\u201d\n\u201cI learned how mentally strong I am and I now have such a deepened respect and love for our special forces military,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe things they sacrifice so we can sit on our couches at home are unfathomable.\u201d\nSpecial Forces season 4 premieres on Fox Thursday, September 25, at 9 p.m. ET."

She has over nine years of editorial experience covering entertainment, beauty, and lifestyle, and has been working at PEOPLE since 2022. People Editorial Guidelines and Nicole Pomarico Published on April 20, 2025 08:00AM EDT Leave a Comment Janelle Brown, Christine Brown, Kody Brown, Meri Brown and Robyn Brown. Credit : Joe Pugliese / \u00a9 TLC / Courtesy Everett Collection A lot has changed since TLC's hit series Sister Wives introduced fans to Kody Brown and his plural family for the first time in 2010. Now that the reality show is in its 19th season, with its midseason premiering on April 20, there have been a lot of ups and downs for Kody, his four wives and 18 children. When the series premiered in 2010, Kody was legally married to his first wife, Meri Brown, and \"spiritually married\" to his two other wives, Janelle Brown and Christine Brown. However, viewers were quickly introduced to Kody's fourth wife, Robyn Brown, whom he spiritually married in 2010 and later legally married in 2014 after first divorcing Meri. The group faced obstacles \u2014 including a shocking catfishing scandal involving Meri in 2016 and a move from Las Vegas to Flagstaff, Ariz. in 2018 \u2014 that were captured by TLC cameras, but there were plenty of moments of joy as well as their children grew up and started families of their own. Where Are the Sister Wives Now? A Look at Their Lives After 19 Seasons of the TLC Series \u2014 and Where They Stand with Kody Today In November 2021, Kody and Christine announced their split after more than 25 years of marriage. A little over a year later, Kody and Janelle officially confirmed they were separated in December 2022. And just a few days after the news of Kody and Janelle's news, PEOPLE confirmed that Kody's 32-year marriage with his first wife Meri was also over. From where his four marriages stand today to his 18 children, here's everything to know about Kody Brown and his plural family. Kody and Meri Brown Kody Brown and Meri Brown. Ida Mae Astute/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images After growing up in a polygamous family of her own (she's one of 25 siblings), Meri first met Kody in 1989 and married him the following year. Though Meri was Kody's only legal wife for many years, the pair divorced in 2014 so that he could legally marry his new wife, Robyn, while he and Meri remained spiritually married. At the time, the Browns said in a statement that they had chosen to \"legally restructure\" their family and that the decision was made as a unit. However, the choice was still an emotional one for Meri, as she explained in a 2015 Sister Wives Tell All special. In 2016, Meri become embroiled in a catfishing scandal after she entered into an online relationship with a person she thought was another man, but was later revealed to be a woman. Though Kody and Meri started therapy to deal with the emotional fallout from the situation, their relationship became more platonic than romantic in the aftermath. In April 2021, Meri explained on Sister Wives that she and Kody were \"celebrating our non-anniversary, 'cause we're not a couple, but we're in a family.\" The pair's relationship seemingly hit a breaking point in December 2022, and Meri announced that her marriage to Kody was over. In January 2024, Meri introduced fans to her boyfriend, Amos, whom she had been dating since October 2023. Just over a month after Meri shared her new relationship with the world, she announced that they had gone their separate ways in an Instagram post, admitting that \"a life long relationship isn't in the cards\" for her and Amos.

Leon Brown/ Instagram After five years of marriage, the pair welcomed their child, Leon Brown, in July 1995. Meri would later suffer a miscarriage in 2008. She spoke candidly about the loss on Instagram more than a decade later. \"I don't know for sure that my baby was even a boy, but my gut tells me it was. He'd be 15 now, and I often wonder what life would be like with him here,\" Meri wrote on Instagram. Although she was raised in polygamy and was part of a plural marriage herself, Meri tried to create a different culture for Leon, who came out as transgender and queer in June 2022. In July 2022, Meri celebrated Leon turning 27 with a touching tribute on Instagram. \"Happiest of birthdays to my miracle, my always amazing, Leo the Lion,\" she wrote, in part. \"Know you are forever loved by me @leointhemountains,\" she continued, \"and I am honored and blessed to be your mom! I love you!!\" Leon quietly married their partner, Audrey Kriss, in October 2022. Kody and Janelle Brown Janelle and Kody Brown. Gabe Ginsberg/FilmMagic Three years after Kody and Meri wed, their family officially became plural when Kody \"spiritually married\" Janelle. Kody and Janelle went on to welcome six children together: sons Logan, Hunter, Garrison and Gabriel as well as daughters Madison and Savanah. Kody and Janelle's relationship made headlines in 2021 after she revealed she was living in an RV parked on the Browns' Coyote Pass property in Flagstaff, Ariz. She later explained that she was having doubts about whether plural marriage was still for her. Though Meri said she felt \"betrayed\" by Christine's decision to leave the family, Janelle was \"supportive from the get-go,\" as Christine told PEOPLE in August 2022. \"Janelle and I have stayed close through the whole thing,\" she explained. \"She's wonderful.\" Janelle's reaction to Christine's departure from the plural family was perhaps foreshadowing her own decision to leave, which Kody confirmed in December 2022. \"I am separated from Janelle,\" he said in a sneak peek for Sister Wives: One on One. \"And I'm divorced from Christine [Brown].\" Janelle Brown's Kids: All About Her Family with Sister Wives Costar and Ex-Husband Kody Brown Just one day after her split from Kody was announced, Janelle shared an optimistic note on Instagram, writing that she's looking forward to health and happiness in the new year. \"I'm ready for you 2023!\" she captioned a video chronicling her progress on her \"health journey.\" In 2024, Janelle relocated to Raleigh, N.C., with her daughter Madison and her family to open Taeda Farms. Kody and Janelle Brown's Kids Logan Brown, 30 Janelle and Logan Brown. Janelle Brown/Instagram Janelle and Kody welcomed their first child, son Logan, on May 21, 1994. After growing up in Utah, he moved with his family to Nevada, where he enrolled in the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and obtained a bachelor's degree in kinesiology and exercise science. He currently works as the director of strategic operations at TravelWealth, according to his LinkedIn. In September 2017, Logan announced his engagement to his girlfriend of three years, Michelle Petty. The couple said \"I do\" in October 2022 in Arizona. Madison Brush, 29 Madison Brush. Madison Brush Instagram The couple's second child and first daughter, Madison \u2014 who goes by Maddie \u2014 was born on Nov. 3, 1995. Maddie attended Utah State University after high school, but later dropped out after getting engaged to her boyfriend Caleb Brush, whom she married in June 2016. The pair welcomed their first child, son Axel James, in May 2017, followed by their daughter Evangalynn Kodi, whom they welcomed in August 2019. Before Evangalynn was born, she was diagnosed with oligodactyly, a congenital anomaly defined as the presence of fewer than five fingers on a hand. When she was born, she was also missing a thumb and a toe, and one leg was missing a fibula. She also had a bowed tibia (shinbone) and two of her fingers were fused together. Evangalynn was later diagnosed with fibular aplasia, tibial campomelia and oligosyndactyly (FATCO) syndrome, an extremely rare genetic disorder that affects bone formation in utero. In August 2020, Maddie shared that Evangalynn had her foot amputated but had returned home from the hospital and was \"recovering beautifully.\" On Feb. 10, 2023, Maddie gave birth to her second daughter. The next day, the reality star posted a photo of the newborn in a pink onesie. \"Welcome to the world Josephine Lee Brush!\ud83d\udc9a\" she wrote on Instagram. The couple's fourth child, a baby girl named Emilia Estelle, arrived in March 2025. Just before adding another baby to the family, Maddie and Caleb made the move to N.C. to open Taeda Farms with Janelle. Hunter Brown, 28 Hunter Brown. Janelle Brown Instagram Two years after welcoming Maddie, Janelle gave birth to her and Kody's third child, son Hunter, on Feb. 9, 1997. After growing up in his plural family, Hunter enrolled at the United States Air Force Academy, graduating in April 2020. He later moved to Baltimore to attend nursing school, announcing he had obtained his master's degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in May 2022. In July 2022, Janelle revealed that Hunter had returned to Arizona to live near his family. \"This mommas heart is bursting \u2764\ufe0f,\" Janelle captioned a selfie of the two. \"My son Hunter is 'local-ish' for the first time in 7 years.\" Garrison Brown Garrison Brown. Janelle Brown Instagram Janelle and Kody's fourth child, son Garrison, was born on April 10, 1998. Garrison died by suicide in March 2024. He was 25. \"Kody and I are deeply saddened to announce the loss of our beautiful boy Robert Garrison Brown. He was a bright spot in the lives of all who knew him,\" Janelle wrote in a statement on Instagram. \"Our loss will leave such a big hole in our lives, that it takes our breath away.\" Gabriel Brown, 23 Gabriel Brown. Janelle Brown Instagram The pair welcomed their fifth child, son Gabriel, who goes by Gabe, on Oct. 11, 2001. In a December 2022 episode of Sister Wives, Gabe got emotional during a confessional as he recalled when Kody forgot his birthday during a phone call they had in October. \"I shouldn't have done this but I did anyway \u2014 I didn't remind him that it was my birthday because I wanted to see if he remembered. And he didn't,\" Gabe said before breaking down in tears. \"A couple hours after that he tried to call me back and tell me happy birthday and make up for it. And that's the last time I ever talked to my dad,\" he added. For her part, Janelle celebrated her youngest son's 21st birthday with a sweet Instagram post. \"My Gabe is 21! Where does the time go!\" she captioned the post. Savanah Brown, 20 Savanah Brown. Janelle Brown Instagram Janelle and Kody's sixth and youngest kid, Savanah, was born on Dec. 7, 2004. She is very close with her mom, and Janelle regularly shares photos on Instagram of the two during their mother-daughter excursions. Savanah also regularly spends time with her larger blended family, including her half-sister Truely, the daughter of Kody and Christine. Kody and Christine Brown Kody Brown and Christine Brown. Christine Brown/INSTAGRAM Kody met Christine in 1990, though the pair didn't go on their first date until Valentine's Day in 1994. The following month, they entered a spiritual marriage and Christine became the third wife to join their polygamous family. After their union, Kody and Christine welcomed six children of their own: daughters Aspyn, Mykelti, Gwendlyn, Ysabel, Truely and son Paedon. Christine became the first of Kody's wives to leave the plural family in November 2021, a decision she later revealed was partially the result of Kody's relationship with their children. During a December 2022 appearance on the Reality Life with Kate Casey podcast, Christine explained that their kids were disappointed with Kody for years after he allegedly failed to spend meaningful time with them. While Christine and Kody's split initially appeared amicable, with Christine saying in a statement that the former couple \"will continue to be a strong presence in each other's lives,\" Kody later revealed in an episode of Sister Wives that his feelings differed. Christine, however, appears to be focused on the future. On Feb. 7, 2023, over a year since her split from Kody, she revealed that she was \"exclusively\" dating someone, later revealed to be Utah grandfather, David Woolley. \"He's wonderful and romantic and so kind, and everything I've been looking for,\" Christine said in her Instagram Story. The following month, the mother of six revealed that she and Woolley were engaged. \"David treats me like a queen and tells me I'm beautiful everyday,\" Christine told PEOPLE. \"I've never been in love like this before and the world seems like a brighter place with him in it.\" The reality star added that he's \"incredible\" with her youngest daughter, Truley. Christine married Woolley in October 2023. Just before their wedding, she told PEOPLE that, despite her split from the family, she doesn't regret the life she and her former sister wives built with Kody. \u201cJust because I left, it doesn\u2019t mean we failed,\u201d Christine said, adding, \"Our goal was to raise incredible children, and we did. It was a success for us.\u201d Kody and Christine Brown's Kids Aspyn Brown, 30 Aspyn Brown and Christine Brown. Christine Brown Instagram Christine and Kody welcomed their first daughter, Aspyn, on March 14, 1995. Like her half-brother Logan, Aspyn later attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. After announcing her engagement to boyfriend Mitch Thompson in January 2018, the pair tied the knot that June in front of 120 guests. As a nod to Thompson's Scottish heritage, his mother made hats for Aspyn's mom Christine as well as her three sister wives, Meri, Janelle and Robyn. In March 2023, Christine helped celebrate her oldest's 28th birthday by dressing up for high tea. Mitch, Ysabel and Mykelti also joined the festivities at The Grand American Hotel in Salt Lake City, Utah. The proud mom posted photos and a video from the outing, including a photo of the group smiling at their table. \"Had a lovely time during High Tea to celebrate Aspyn's birthday,\" Christine wrote in the caption. \"She's such an amazing strong and independent woman. I'm so proud of everything she's accomplished. I love sharing in her life moments.\" Mykelti Brown, 28 Mykelti Brown. Mykelti Padron Instagram Christine gave birth to her and Kody's second daughter, Mykelti, on June 9, 1996. She became the third Brown child to enroll at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, following her half-brother Logan and her sister Aspyn. In 2016, Mykelti married Antonio Padron in front of 400 guests \u2014 including all 23 members of her blended family. Mykelti and Padron welcomed their first child, daughter Avalon Asa, in April 2021, making Christine a grandmother for the first time. In November 2022, the couple expanded their family again with the addition of their twin sons, Archer Banks and Ace McCord. In January 2023, Mykelti weighed in on the Sister Wives drama, sharing her opinion on the end of her father's marriage with Meri. Paedon Brown, 26 Paedon Brown. Paedon Brown Instagram Christine and Kody's third child and only son together, Paedon, was born on Aug. 7, 1998. After high school, he joined the National Guard, as Christine announced on Instagram in 2019. Like his half-brothers Garrison and Gabe, Paedon seemingly disagreed with his father Kody's strict rules during the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2022, he posted a TikTok that appeared to throw shade at Kody's wife Robyn. In the video, he wore a shirt that said \"What. Does. The Nanny. Do?\" seemingly referencing an earlier comment from his mom Christine, who questioned why Robyn was able to hire a nanny during the pandemic when Kody's protocols prevented the family from seeing each other frequently. Gwendlyn Brown, 23 Gwendlyn Brown. Gwendlyn Brown Instagram Christine welcomed her fourth child, daughter Gwendlyn, on Oct. 15, 2001. In December 2022, she announced her engagement to her girlfriend of almost nine months, Beatriz Queiroz. The couple wed in July 2023 during an intimate ceremony in Flagstaff, Ariz. In an episode of Sister Wives, Christine shared that after Meri's child Leon came out as transgender, she realized that Gwendlyn identified as LGBTQ+. \"When [Leon] told us [they were] gay. Immediately I thought oh so is Gwendlyn. I knew immediately,\" Christine said. \"We've had just great conversations about it.\" Gwendlyn spoke about her relationship with her father in a YouTube video posted on Dec. 31, 2022. \"It's very flip-floppy for me. In person, my dad's sweet to me now,\" she said. \"We had our differences in the past, but we're getting better and since we're not around each other as much, we can't be angry with each other as much.\" Ysabel Brown, 22 Ysabel Brown. Christine Brown Instagram Christine and Kody's fifth child, daughter Ysabel, was born on March 7, 2003. In September 2020, she underwent major surgery to correct her scoliosis, which Christine later revealed was the final straw that made her leave her marriage after Kody declined to join them for the operation. \"I think his priorities are a little screwed up,\" Ysabel told the Sister Wives cameras through tears of her father's decision. \"And l don't want to disrespect him because he is my dad and I understand, I do. I do understand why he's doing it, it's just really frustrating and really, really hard.\" She later added, \"I think I'm a little upset that he can't go because he's always talking about how family comes first. But when it comes down to it, I need him there, and he's not putting his daughter above the fear that he has of the pandemic.\" Truely Brown, 15 Truely Brown. Christine Brown Instagram Truely, Christine and Kody's sixth child, was born on April 13, 2010. When she was just 3 years old, Truely was rushed to the hospital due to acute kidney failure and dehydration, and her road to recovery was documented on the TLC show. In a later episode of Sister Wives, Kody attributed some of his tension with Christine to Truely's health scare. \"I think Christine hates me partly because Truely almost died, and she thought that I had been negligent,\" he said. Christine Brown's 6 Children: All About Her Son and Daughters with Sister Wives Costar and Ex Kody Brown In December 2022, Christine shared a proud mom moment with her followers on Instagram, explaining how Truely stood up to a bully at school who was bothering her friend. \"I'm obsessed,\" Christine said of her daughter's courageous actions. Kody and Robyn Brown Kody and Robyn Brown. TLC Robyn became the fourth and final wife to join the plural family after meeting Kody at church in 2009. Though she and Kody were initially only \"spiritually married,\" they made their union legal in 2014 so that Kody could adopt her three children from her previous marriage \u2014 son Dayton and daughters Aurora and Breanna. They've also since welcomed two more children together, son Solomon and daughter Ariella. Throughout the years, Robyn and Kody have seemingly had one of the closest relationships among the other marriages in the family, which at times led to tension in their home. Christine admitted that one of the reasons she chose to leave was because Kody had a \"favorite wife.\" As of April 2025, Robyn remains the only wife still in a relationship with Kody, though she's admitted that his issues with the other women had put a strain on their own marriage. \"Right now, I am living right through that because Kody is having issues with some of his other relationships,\" Robyn said on an episode of Sister Wives in 2022. \"And it is making our relationship really, really hard.\" Kody and Robyn Brown's Kids Dayton Brown, 25 Robyn Brown with son Dayton. Robyn Brown/instagram Robyn welcomed her first child, son David, who goes by Dayton, with her ex-husband on Jan. 16, 2000. Robyn later spoke about giving birth to Dayton on her blog, revealing that her son \"didn't walk or really talk until he was over a year old.\" She shared that when Dayton was in second grade, his teachers asked if she wanted to run some tests. \"This was when I was told that Dayton has Asperger Syndrome,\" wrote Robyn. In 2018, Robyn revealed her firstborn was off to college with a sweet Instagram post. \"Dayton's first day of college was this week! I cannot believe my baby is going to college! I am so proud of him,\" she wrote in part, adding that Dayton had spent the summer traveling on solo road trips to explore the National Parks. Aurora Brown, 22 Robyn Brown and Aurora Brown. Robyn Brown Instagram Robyn gave birth to her second child and first daughter, Aurora, on June 4, 2002. In 2018, Robyn shared how Aurora was all grown up in a sweet post on her Instagram. \"Joy is having a kid who can drive so you can shop for Christmas online and visit without stressing about driving! Hehe!\" she captioned a photo of Aurora in the driver's seat. In a January 2022 episode of Sister Wives, Aurora expressed her disappointment that her mom's fellow sister wives were not abiding by Kody's COVID-19 protocols and therefore would not be able to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with them. Breanna Brown, 19 Breanna Brown. Robyn Brown Instagram Robyn welcomed her third child, daughter Breanna, with her ex on July 10, 2005. Like her two older siblings, Breanna joined the larger Sister Wives family after her mom married Kody, who later adopted all three children in 2015. \"My kids now have three moms and a father who loves them and is involved with them,\" Robyn said during a 2012 episode of the show. \"They are adjusting and learning a lot about sharing and being in a big family. All in all, there have been growing pains, but they have enjoyed it.\" In 2018, Robyn shared on Instagram that Breanna overcame her \"paralyzing stage fright\" to try out for a solo in her school choir. \"Every time I hear her voice I am absolutely moved. You can see her soul when she sings. I am so proud of her!\" she wrote in the caption. Solomon Brown, 13 Solomon Brown. Robyn Brown Instagram Robyn gave birth to her and Kody's first child together, son Solomon, on Oct. 26, 2011. \"He's perfect and we couldn't be happier,\" Kody told PEOPLE shortly after his birth. \"We are so thrilled.\" Robyn also touched on the experience of welcoming a baby into a family with sister wives and several other children. \"Having everyone come in and fall in love with him was just heartwarming,\" she said. \"Who doesn't want to know that their child is loved by a whole big family? I had all these kids come in and moms falling in love with him. He has a list 21 deep of people loving him. There is not a lack of love.\" In addition to the love, Solomon has also had to deal with the small annoyances that come with living with so many siblings. In 2019, Robyn posted a photo of a note Solomon left on his door for his older half-brother Dayton. \"Solomon is mad at Dayton for beating him on a video game so he is taking a stand! Dayton is no longer allowed in his room! So there Dayton! \ud83d\ude0f,\" she captioned the funny snap. Ariella Brown, 9 Ariella Brown. Robyn Brown Instagram Ariella, Robyn and Kody's second child and the youngest of the plural family, was born on Jan. 10, 2016. Shortly after welcoming their new arrival, Robyn spoke to PEOPLE about how the newborn was fitting into the family. \"'Baby Sister' is already opening her eyes and seems to love listening to all the voices of her big family talk around her,\" she said. \"It was such a beautiful moment when the family was all gathered together to meet our newest sweet addition!\" In October 2018, Robyn posted a few snaps of Ariella smiling with Kody on Instagram. \"These two are peas in a pod. They pretty much ADORE one another and follow each other everywhere,\" she wrote of the father-daughter pair. Close Leave a Comment Read more: Entertainment TV Reality TV"

Because for years, I'd say you know, your dad loves you. He loves you, he wanted to spend time with you,\u201d she explained. \u201cI would tell my kids that all the time \u2014 that he's going to come over, we're going to have a great time, blah, blah, blah.

On the Sunday, Dec. 29 episode of Sister Wives, Robyn, as well as Kody's ex-wives Meri Brown, Janelle Brown and Christine Brown, discussed the decision Meri, 53, made to divorce Kody, 55, so that he could legally marry Robyn, 46.

Noting how \"the legal marriage really seemed very important to Meri,\" Janelle, 55, told the cameras how she suspected it wasn't Meri's idea to legally divorce Kody. \"I was actually sort of speechless when she told us that she was actually doing it, because I thought Meri would never do this.

The former Empire star shared a lengthy statement to Instagram on Friday, May 23, explaining how this resolution came to be, why he chose the charity he donated to and his thoughts on his future now that this chapter is behind him. \"Over six years ago, after it was reported I had been jumped, City Officials in Chicago set out to convince the public that I willfully set an assault against myself. This false narrative has left a stain on my character that will not soon disappear,\" he began. \"These officials wanted my money and wanted my confession for something I did not do. Today, it should be clear\u2026.They have received neither.\" Smollett went on to say the decision to settle the civil lawsuit with the city \"was not the most difficult one to make.\" \"After repeatedly refusing to pay the City, I was presented with an opportunity to make a charitable donation in exchange for the case being dismissed,\" he continued. \"Despite what happened there politically, Chicago was my home for over 5 years and the people became my family. Therefore, making a donation to benefit Chicago communities that are too often neglected by those in power will always be something I support.\" Smollett then announced he'd made a $50,000 donation to Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts, which he described as \"a local nonprofit doing incredible work nurturing self expression, creativity and exploration of the arts for Chicago youth.\" \"This organization was of my choosing and I'm comforted that there will be at least one winner from this experience,\" he added.

Scott Olson/Getty Following an investigation conducted by law enforcement, prosecutors alleged that Smollett staged the attack to get media attention and paid two brothers, Abimbola \"Bola\" and Olabinjo \"Ola\" Osundairo, to help him pull it off. Smollett was found guilty of five felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing false police reports following a jury trial in 2021. He was sentenced to 150 days in jail in March 2022 as well as hit with a $25,000 fine and ordered to pay more than $120,000 in restitution to the Chicago Police Department.

Smollett has maintained his innocence over the years, opening up to PEOPLE in September 2024 \u2014 about a month before the Supreme Court of Illinios overturned his conviction \u2014 about how he was dealing with being at the center of the high-profile case. \"People can say what they want about you, but they have no control,\" he said at the time. \"They can do whatever they want, they can even put you behind bars. They can control your physical, but they can't control my mind. They can't control my spirit.

Special Forces: World's Toughest Test is returning for a fourth season with a new cast. The Fox show follows a group of celebrities who are shipped off to a foreign country and participate in various challenges that mimic military training. In past seasons, the show featured celebrities who may or may not have known each other before. However, Special Forces switched things up for season 4 and cast a few pairs that enter as families but competed individually. Season 4 takes place in Morocco, where contestants \"must learn the art of getting comfortable with being uncomfortable,\" per the show's description. Season 4 will star Teresa Giudice and Gia Giudice, Jussie Smollett, Eva Marcille and Brittany Cartwright, among others.

Season 3 premiere of 'Special Forces: World's Toughest Test.'. Pete Dadds/FOX Special Forces: World's Toughest Test is one of the most physically strenuous reality competition shows. In the Fox series, over a dozen celebrities, reality TV stars and athletes volunteer to be shipped away to a foreign country and participate in rigorous, psychological and daunting challenges. Different from other competition shows, in Special Forces, the goal is for celebrities to pass tasks, rather than compete against one another to win. The main way that someone leaves the show is by volunteering to, but they may also be forced to leave due to injury or at the request of one of the directing staff members. The celebrities work with former special forces operatives Rudy Reyes, Mark \u201cBilly\u201d Billingham, Jason \u201cFoxy\u201d Fox and Jovon \u201cQ\u201d Quarles. While they push themselves to the furthest physical extent, the agents also challenge contestants to take the time to dig deep both mentally and emotionally. \"Viewers see the recruits face the harshest of environments that simulate the highly classified selection process, pushing themselves in the ultimate test of their physical, mental and emotional resilience and revealing the celebrities' deepest and truest character,\" the show's synopsis reads. While every season is different depending on the location, some of the past challenges have included walking across a tightrope over a cliff, rescuing themselves from a sinking car and invading a crate filled with poisonous gases and chemicals. Is there a trailer for Special Forces season 4? Brittany Cartwright in 'Special Forces: World's Toughest Test.'. PETE DADDS/FOX There is no trailer for Special Forces season 4 as of early August.

The contestants who arrived as pairs include The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice and her daughter, Gia Giudice; Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson East and her husband, former NFL athlete Andrew East; and singer Jessie James Decker and her husband, former NFL athlete Eric Decker.

Pete Dadds/FOX The fourth season of Special Forces took contestants to Morocco to \"endure the extreme circumstances of urban warfare,\" per the season's description. \"All recruits must learn the art of getting comfortable with being uncomfortable as they are faced with training challenges across the country\u2019s expansive desert terrain, including a supply search in an abandoned village where they must race to extraction, a treacherous rat-run through dark and narrow tunnels, a plane shell dunk drill where pairs of recruits will be submerged underwater and must escape, a death-defying urban ladder crossing between buildings 50 ft above the urban streets, and much more,\" the show teased. The past three seasons have taken place in different countries across the world \u2014 including Jordan, New Zealand and Wales. Where can I watch past seasons of Special Forces? Denise Richards in 'Special Forces: World's Toughest Test.'.

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2022. Her work has previously been featured in Cosmopolitan, Woman\u2019s Day and Good Housekeeping. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on February 3, 2025 09:37AM EST Leave a Comment Teresa Giudice with her daughters. Credit : Manny Carabel/Getty Teresa Giudice's kids have grown up on camera. The Real Housewives of New Jersey star shares four daughters with her ex-husband Joe Giudice: Gia, 23, Gabriella, 20, Milania, 19, and Audriana, 15. All four girls have appeared on the Bravo series alongside their mother \u2014 Teresa's youngest, Audriana, was even born on camera. In 2013, Teresa and Joe were indicted for tax fraud and both served time in federal prison. During Joe's 41-month prison sentence, a court ordered his deportation (Joe was born in Italy and never obtained United States citizenship, despite moving to the U.S. as a child) and he moved to Italy in October 2019. The former couple split a few months later and their divorce was finalized the following year. In August 2022, Teresa married Luis Ruelas in a lavish New Jersey ceremony and all four of her daughters were a part of her bridal party. \"The girls embrace Louie, and it's beautiful,\" Teresa later told PEOPLE of her children's relationship with her new husband. Earlier that year, Teresa received praise from then-pregnant Rihanna, who said in an interview with ELLE that she admired the RHONJ star's parenting style. \"Teresa from New Jersey does not play about her kids,\" Rihanna said. \"She will flatten you about those kids. And that resonates with me a lot because I feel like that's the type of mom I'm going to be.\" Teresa reacted to Rihanna's comments on Bravo's The Daily Dish, saying, \"It shows that, you know, people see that I am a good mom,\" Teresa said. \"Because sometimes you don't know if you're doing a good job as a mom. But then when I look at my daughters, I'm like, 'Yes, I'm doing a good job.' \" Here's everything to know about Teresa Giudice's four daughters. Gia Giudice, 24 Charles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank Teresa's eldest daughter, Gia, was born on Jan. 8, 2001. Gia was 8 years old when RHONJ premiered and has been in front of the cameras ever since. In season 3, a then-10-year-old Gia tearfully performed an original song for her family about the issues her mother and uncle were facing at the time. Years later, the clip resurfaced on TikTok and the lyrics, \"waking up in the morning, thinking about so many things,\" turned into a viral trend. \"This is gonna haunt me my whole life,\" Gia joked in one comment. Now 24 years old, Gia is a graduate of Rutgers University, where she studied criminal justice with plans to become a lawyer. Ahead of Gia's junior year in 2021, Teresa spoke with PEOPLE about her daughter, saying, \"I really try to encourage Gia. Encouraging your kids is important. Being there for them and supporting them is important, too. Anytime Rutgers had something for the parents, I went. Parents weekend. Tailgates. I went to her football games. It was fun.\" Teresa Giudice/instagram Following Gia's graduation from Rutgers in May 2023, Teresa posted about the milestone on Instagram. \"I am so proud of my devoted and intelligent daughter, Gia, for graduating a stellar university, a huge milestone to accomplish in life. Seeing you graduate college is one of the most special moments in my life,\" the reality star captioned a photo of her and Gia. In February 2023, Gia landed a job with attorney Kathleen Martinez, who specializes in immigration law. \"She wants to help immigrants more than people realize,\" Martinez commented on a TikTok announcing Gia's post-undergraduate plans. \"Her heart is so big for that.\" Gia Giudice Instagram When Teresa joined Dancing With the Stars in September 2022, Gia was quick to celebrate her mother on Instagram, writing, \"I grew up watching this show with my family and it is so surreal that my mom is now going to be on it. I am so proud of you, you're going to kill it.. can't wait to watch you this season! everyone go vote\u2764\ufe0f.\" Gia has continued to appear on RHONJ alongside her mother and sisters. When Teresa began dating Ruelas, Gia expressed her initial reservations during a confessional, saying, \"Do I think my mom might be moving too fast? Yeah. Any relationship you're gonna be in the honeymoon stage for the beginning. It's very easy to only see the good when you're in la la land.\" During the same season, she got into a fight with her uncle, Joe Gorga, over comments he had made about her father. The pair later talked it out, and in a confessional Gia added she would \"try to move on.\" Gia has also been in a relationship with her boyfriend Christian Carmichael since 2020. Gabriella Giudice, 20 Teresa Giudice/Instagram Gabriella Giudice was born on Oct. 4, 2004. Teresa's second daughter seems to be more private than the rest of her family, as she doesn't appear to have any public social media profiles. In 2016, Teresa told PEOPLE that the then-11-year-old would love to be a professional soccer player or a model. Years later, Teresa told The Daily Dish that Gabriella was starting to look at colleges ahead of her senior year of high school. \"At first, she wanted to be a CIA agent, and then she saw how much money they made, and now she's changed her mind,\" Teresa said in May 2022. \"I can't wait to see what college she goes to, because she is my smartest kid. I can't wait to start looking at colleges with her and see where she ends up.\" Dave Kotinsky/Getty In June 2022, Teresa congratulated Gabriella on her academic achievements, posting a picture of awards that Gabriella received in multiple subjects. \"My beautiful Gabriella \u2764\ufe0f you never cease to amaze me,\" Teresa wrote. \"I'm so proud of what you've accomplished. We all see the amount of effort and hard [work] you put you put into everything you do! I'm a super proud mom today and everyday \u2764\ufe0f Love you beyond words.\" After graduating high school, Gabriella committed to the University of Michigan where she began classes in September 2023. For Gabriella's 19th birthday, Teresa celebrated her daughter on Instagram, writing, \"This is my first birthday away from you, but don\u2019t worry I will see you very soon to celebrate and give you the biggest hug! You amaze me every day with your accomplishments and hard work.\" The RHONJ star continued, \"As a mom, all I want is for you to be happy and I am so thankful that the university of Michigan was the perfect fit for you; the school was made for you. I hope this year brings you nothing but joy and happiness.\" Milania Giudice, 19 Milania Giudice Instagram Teresa's third daughter, Milania Giudice, was born on Feb. 2, 2006. Though she is widely known as Teresa's daughter, Milania has big aspirations of her own. In 2016, PEOPLE interviewed then-10-year-old Milania about her YouTube channel. \"My friend and I always wanted to be actresses and stuff,\" she said. \"We always wanted to do fun things on YouTube, 'cause we would always watch videos, so we put a video together and we edited it. It was really cool.\" The same year, Milania walked the runway at New York Fashion Week. Two years later, Teresa reiterated her daughter's acting dreams. \"Milania keeps telling me, 'Mah, I wanna be in movies. You did it with Gia, you won't do it with me,' \" Teresa said. \"The reason why I don't do it [is] 'cause I'm so busy and I don't know, I want to but it's like, you don't want to be on TV. Look what happened to me.\" Milania Giudice Instagram In 2019, Milania released her single \"I Just Can't Wait to Grow Up.\" The song made its official debut during an episode of RHONJ, in which Teresa declared, \"I think the song is so catchy! I really think it's going to be a No. 1!\" Milania also supported her mom as she prepared for her stint on DWTS in 2022. \"She's watched Audriana at every dance competition,\" Milania told PEOPLE. \"She's watched a million dancers. I think she's got it. I believe in her. I think my mom could win anything.\" Before Teresa and Ruelas' wedding, Milania shared a photo from her mom's bridal shower. \"The most beautiful bride to be\u2026 i love you mommy,\" Milania wrote. Teresa shared the same photo and wrote, \"Built in best friends ... To the moon & back I love you girls!\" Like her siblings, Milania often appears RHONJ and got involved in some drama during season 12. While her uncle Joe and older sister Gia (mostly) made up, Milania wasn't so quick to forgive her uncle. During a party at Ruelas' house, the family brought up the incident. \"Obviously, I'm hurt over what happened,\" Milania said. \"Just seeing someone scream at my mom and saying things about my dad, I've never seen someone scream at someone like that. I cannot watch that.\" Joe apologized to Milania after hearing how she was affected by the incident. \"Listen, I apologize. I don't want to argue anymore,\" he said. \"This family's been through a lot and we can all be angry because we've all hurt but then we love. Let's love. Let's not ruin our family.\" In May 2024, Teresa and Milania shared that she had decided to attend the University of Tampa in the fall with an Instagram post that showed the mother and daughter sitting together on a bed, totally decked out in the school's gear. \"Congratulations on the University of Tampa! I love you so much and I am so proud of you! I can\u2019t wait to see what you accomplish within your four years, make mommy proud\u2764\ufe0f ,\" Teresa wrote. Audriana Giudice, 15 Audriana Giudice Instagram The youngest of Teresa's four daughters, Audriana Giudice, was born on Sept. 14, 2009. Audriana had a particularly difficult time when her father was imprisoned and later deported to Italy. In 2019, Teresa and Gia shared that then-9-year-old Audriana was bullied at school because of her father. The same year, however, the Giudice sisters and Teresa were able to visit Joe in Italy. The youngest Giudice is also a competitive dancer and gave her mom advice before DWTS. \"She's like 'Mommy, don't be scared. Have fun, most important, have fun. Feel your partner's energy, and dance like it's your last time dancing,' \" Teresa shared. Teresa Giudice Instagram In addition to dance, Audriana has also modeled with her sister Milania. In 2016, the sisters both walked at NYFW, according to Bravo. \"That was her first time doing anything like that and she loved it, she was so good,\" Teresa said of her youngest. \"She likes the cameras too. And Audriana was really born in front of the cameras.\" In September 2023, Teresa celebrated Audriana's 14th birthday by sharing an Instagram Reel featuring photos of her daughter throughout the years. \"You impress me everyday! Keep being your authentic self. I hope this year brings you nothing but joy and happiness. I love you to the moon and back\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf19 \ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf88\ud83d\ude18,\" the reality star wrote in the caption.
