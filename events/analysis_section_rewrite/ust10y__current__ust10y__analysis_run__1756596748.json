      "feedback": "The draft is on‑target for the 0–3‑week horizon and correctly maps to the canonical handle **ust10y** (positive sign, 5–10 bp rise).  It also cites a clear catalyst window (September FOMC).  Minor tightening is needed:\n\n1. **Add inline citations** for every factual claim.  \n   - UST 10‑year at 4.23 % → (ID:97MD1FHW8).  \n   - 2‑year fell 32 bps → (ID:97MD1FHW8).  \n   - Fed rate‑cut odds 89 % → (ID:97MD1FHW8).  \n   - Fed rate‑cut odds 85 % → (ID:U21K4ALYQ).  \n   - Waller’s 25‑bp cut hint → (ID:3YAQ8JUPL).  \n\n2. **State the magnitude explicitly**: “UST 10‑year is currently at 4.23 % and is expected to rise 5–10 bp over the next 1–2 weeks.”  \n\n3. **Keep the focus tight**: remove any extraneous discussion of the 2‑year curve or global risk sentiment unless it directly informs the 10‑year move.  \n\n4. **Clarify the causal chain** in one sentence: inflation data → Fed dovish signal → market pricing of a September cut → 10‑year yield adjustment.  \n\n5. **Mention the key risk** that would invalidate the view: an unexpectedly lower core PCE or an early Fed cut would compress the 10‑year; a higher‑than‑expected PCE or fiscal tightening would push it higher.  \n\nWith these edits, the analysis will satisfy the acceptance gate and remain concise, actionable, and fully sourced.",
