      "feedback": "The draft offers a credible cross‑topic read and uses the cited IDs, but the causal chain is not tight enough, the scenario set is underdeveloped, and the quantification and signal-tracking are insufficiently precise for world-class quality. Strengthen the macro-to-market transmission by 1) tying CPI at 2.7% to an explicit, first‑principles price‑level-to-discount-rate channel (and then to S&P 500 multiple implications), with a concrete near‑term range for multiple compression if inflation/surprise reads persist; 2) detailing how the 90‑day U.S.–China tariff truce affects specific flows (input costs, inventories, pricing power) and contrasting with the longer‑term policy risk implied by the retreat on competition regulation; 3) reconciling policy signals (deregulation/antitrust tensions vs platform dynamics) and their margin/competition implications for tech names; 4) integrating Intel’s government‑stake talks and >20% 2025 workforce cut with Ohio fab delays into a clear semiconductor policy and capex risk layer; 5) embedding AI‑infra bottlenecks and the GPT‑5 cycle into capex/margin tradeoffs with explicit bottleneck linkages; and 6) situating Perplexity/Chrome and Apple antitrust dynamics within a coherent competition-risk trajectory. Elevate specificity by inserting the concrete numbers already in sources (CPI 2.7%; 90‑day tariff window; Chrome bid $34.5B; CarParts.com −13% YoY sales, $10M loss; Intel >20% headcount reduction; Chrome/Perplexity antitrust context) and, for each, attach a crisp trigger and invalidation point (e.g., next CPI print, tariff window expiry, Intel Ohio update date, Chrome/Perplexity outcome or ruling). Introduce a compact, probability‑weighted base/bull/bear scenario suite with time‑bound catalysts and thresholds (e.g., CPI print crosses a defined bound; tariff escalation post-window; Intel/OH fab updates exceeding cost targets; antitrust rulings or bids closing) so readers can gauge fragility. Ensure every assertion maps to one or more of the IDs, reconcile any conflicts (e.g., deregulation tone vs ongoing antitrust scrutiny) in a single lines‑and‑arrows logic, and deliver the synthesis as a single tight paragraph that preserves the cross‑topic focus (macro, policy, flows/positioning, valuation/technicals) and ends with a crisp watch-list of decisive signals.",
