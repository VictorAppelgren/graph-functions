  "description": "S4 Capital Executive Founder & Executive Chairman Martin Sorrell offers insights on  China's consumer demand outlook. He speaks with Paul Allen on \"Insight with Haslinda Amin.\" (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Martin, thanks so much for joining us today. I just want to pick up on some of those points that binman was making there. So we've got China grappling with a bunch of issues right now deflation, U.S. tariffs, an uncertain trade environment. Never mind all that. The the markets rallying hard. Do you think this has got legs or is there some risk of a correction here? No, not a stock market expert on China, but do I think the Chinese economy has got legs? Certainly I do. I mean, they're not doing too badly. If you're with the or you believe the the the government statistics are still growing at around 5% a year, which we in the UK would give our right arm for us obviously has been strong but not not as strong as China and China. China's economy is about $18 trillion in terms of GDP in the US about 28 trillion. So those two two engines actually, despite the stock market issues, despite the real estate problems, despite the sui borrowing at a local level, not at federal level in China, despite those three problems, the Chinese economy is fine. Despite tariffs. The Chinese, to my mind, are already sort of flipping their trade policy. When we were in Beijing just before the American election talking to government officials, it was clear, although they weren't were clear at that time, whether Trump would be elected in the way that he was and was going to impose tariffs in the way that he has. Certainly they were talking about the the change in Chinese outbound exports and shifting from a US directed effort to a more fragmented effort around the world. I mean, if you look at that, those GDP statistics of the US and China account for about 46 trillion out of 106 of their 60 trillion. Outside those two markets, which China is very much focused on, that's Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the rest of Asia. So I think the Chinese economy will remain strong. You know, there is that Chinese meme on social media that said Trump is making China great again, so that the Chinese, I think, have got the between their teeth. It's what I call the Weiwei strategy. If you remember, Weiwei was next in the U.S. and the UK. So what did they do? They shifted their approach to looking at those developing markets that I mentioned. The other thing to bear in mind is the the G7 in terms of GDP is bigger than the G7. You exclude China from the G7 and the US from the G7. The six is still bigger than the G6 from a GDP point of view. So what you're seeing is a change in the world order, which America obviously finds difficult to accommodate and accept, particularly on the the right side of the political spectrum. And that's what I think we're seeing, is a BRICS next 11 Global South are becoming relatively more important. America will remain a dominant economy for a number of years, but the Chinese are certainly catching up. MM You mentioned that the Huawei moment and maybe we're seeing a deep sneak one as well when it comes to Asia. And I want to talk about AI in a moment. Yeah, but you mentioned the strength of China's economy, despite despite despite I want to throw another respite in there, and that's the consumer as well. Who's the sentiment? Somewhat weak. And it's sparking a pretty fierce price war among a number of China's consumer facing businesses as well. What kind of pressures do you anticipating building up here? Well, consumption has always been an issue in really in relation to the Chinese economy. It's always been an export driven economy and consumption versus savings. I mean, you save for the future, you save for health, you save for the family. And that's always been a big issue in the Chinese context. So I wouldn't say it's an issue that is a new one. And really the Chinese economy is export driven. And I think the basic point for us in the West to understand is they will change their trade flows. You already see it actually in the May and June numbers after Liberation Day after President Trump imposed these tariffs. You're already starting to see Chinese outbound shift. And the Chinese are very, very adept at shifting their supply chain patterns to accommodate changes in policy, very agile. You know, the West and Western companies often talk about agility. Chinese companies practice it. It's an art in relation to Chinese and what we're seeing. We have a operation in Shanghai, very successful last year in the ad industry in China. But what we're seeing is a tremendous emphasis and drive on outbound Chinese. I was in Seoul, in Korea just a week before last, and same thing there. I mean, you're seeing Korean companies start to look at the world in a different way. I mean, we've gone into a new era. Growth is going to be more difficult to find. Worldwide growth rates are going to be less than 3% rather than above 3%. Inflation is stubborn, you know, despite the chairman of the Fed announcing that rates are likely to to fall the level of rates because inflation UK is still 3.8%. The US is still 3% because inflation is still up there, certainly above the level that the the Fed, the banks, the central banks would like to see of around 2%. Despite that, what we're seeing is higher interest rates we be used to in higher inflation. We used to in that world, growth is going to be more difficult to come by and therefore people are looking at the world in a very different way and the growth areas will remain. The US, Latin America, the Middle East and APAC. Africa is too volatile, Europe is too slow growth. Can I talk about another growth area as well, which is more sector specific? And, you know, I promise we will get to I mean, you're bullish on air development, but there's questions about how all of this gets monetized because we've seen a huge amount of investment, not a great deal of return on investment. Where's this heading? Well, you're starting to see in our industry, we're seeing very significant developments around visualization and copywriting, and that's compressing the time it makes, it takes to make ads and the cost of those ads. Secondly, we're seeing very significant growth in personalization of advertising at huge scale driven by AI. We're seeing media planning and buying. We're $1,000,000,000,000 industry, 700 billion in digital, 300 billion traditional. We're seeing media planning, buying, beginning, becoming fully algorithmic, very similar to the investing industry. You know, you don't choose to distribute an investment portfolio between property, between equity, private equity, crypto gold, whatever, other than through algorithmic analysis. Same thing applies to us. Fourth area is general efficiency, and the fifth area is the democratization of knowledge. So air is starting to have a huge effect. But going back to our clients, they are very focused on the geopolitical risks around US-China relations or lack of them very focused around what's happening with Russia and Ukraine and Russia's territorial ambitions, very focused on Iran and its proxies in the Middle East that is causing significant turbulence. You leg tariffs on top of that, a lot of uncertainty. Once we know where the level of tariffs plays out. I think what you're then going to see is in that world, which is growing more slowly, a huge focus on finding where the growth is and a huge focus on efficiency is very interesting. Since the terrorists have been imposed, what we've seen is client margins be maintained. I mean, it's early days, but in Q2 and going into Q3, the projections for client margins remain pretty strong for the S & P 500 where they have been and the forecast for margins to actually improve into 26. For that to happen, you have to implement technology at scale. So whilst in our own case, the only big client that we've seen implement AI at huge scale from a marketing point of view would be General Motors. I think what you'll start to see is companies start to implement quite aggressively because going into 26 in order to maintain growth and more importantly growth in margins and profitability, they're going to have to be more efficient in that slow growth world. Yeah.",
