  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. has carried out a strike in the southern Caribbean against a drug-carrying vessel that departed from Venezuela.\n\nThe president offered scant details on the operation.\n\n\u201cWhen you leave the room, you\u2019ll see that we just, over the last few minutes, literally, shot a boat - a drug-carrying boat,\u201d Trump told reporters during an unrelated Oval Office event. He added there were \u201ca lot of drugs\u201d on the vessel.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said on X that the vessel was being operated by a \u201cdesignated narco-terrorist organization.\u201d He described the operation as a lethal strike.\n\nThe U.S. had recently announced plans to boost its maritime force in the waters off Venezuela to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels.\n\nThe U.S. has not signaled any planned land incursion by the thousands of personnel being deployed. Still, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government has responded by deploying troops along Venezuela\u2019s coast and border with neighboring Colombia, as well as by urging Venezuelans to enlist in a civilian militia.\n\nMaduro has insisted that the U.S. is building a false drug-trafficking narrative to try to force him out of office. He and other government officials have repeatedly cited a United Nations report that they say shows traffickers attempt to move only 5% of the cocaine produced in Colombia through Venezuela. Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific and Caribbean, are the world\u2019s top cocaine producers.\n\nThe press office of Venezuela\u2019s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\nThe Pentagon did not offer any immediate comment on the reported incident.",
