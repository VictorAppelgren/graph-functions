  "title": "What A Workvivo Study Reveals About The \u2018Frontline Gap\u2019",
  "description": "Frontline workers across diverse industries form the backbone of organizations, yet many still feel overlooked and disconnected from the companies they serve.",
  "content": "Frontline workers are the foundation of organizations, industries and communities, yet many still feel overlooked and disconnected from the companies they serve. According to Workvivo, an employee engagement platform owned by Zoom, ineffective communication and engagement drive a \u201cfrontline gap,\u201d which makes employees feel undervalued, alienated from company culture and less motivated. The costs can be high, including lower morale, increased turnover and negative impacts on brand reputation and customer experience. across key sectors to better understand this challenge. For this study, \u201cfrontline employees\u201d include workers in customer-facing roles across retail, healthcare, manufacturing, food service and other essential industries who operate primarily outside traditional office environments.\n\nThe findings reveal five distinct gaps spanning culture, recognition, communication, technology and career growth that organizations must bridge to empower and retain their frontline teams. To address these gaps and maintain a competitive edge, organizations must rethink their strategies as new technologies emerge. From real-time safety alerts to integrated team communications and flexible scheduling, the ability to effectively support and engage frontline workers is becoming a key differentiator.\n\nThe global Workvivo study reveals a significant cultural and professional divide between frontline workers and their desk-based peers. Half of the respondents believe their organizations prioritize office staff, despite nearly as many feeling that their roles have a greater business impact. A sense of alienation is widespread: almost half can\u2019t name their CEO, 87% aren\u2019t sure their company culture applies to them and 37% say that company culture is something they hear about but don\u2019t feel.\n\nCommunication tools are a major friction point, with two-thirds of workers finding their current solutions unfit for purpose, and almost half perceiving them as designed exclusively for office staff. Career development is similarly unclear; only 13% see a clear path for advancement, and most feel limited in their growth compared to their office-based colleagues. These factors often lead to the formation of local \u201cmicrocultures\u201d within teams, which can create a disconnect from the broader company mission.\n\nAlmost half of the workers cited poor communication from leadership, and only 10% believe managers fully understand their daily realities. Furthermore, 70% want greater insight into company decision making, emphasizing a clear demand for more transparency and engagement from leadership. The study\u2019s data suggests that these deficits in communication and career opportunities directly impact worker motivation and engagement. In my view, this highlights the need for organizations to reconsider how they recognize and incentivize their most valuable asset.\n\nFrontline employees are not just the operational backbone of a company; they are its most visible representatives. The data highlights their profound influence. Roughly 80% of the global workforce is considered frontline, yet these individuals are often the least recognized. Despite this, they have the most frequent and direct interactions with customers, making them the primary voices and faces of the business.\n\nInvestment in frontline engagement has a measurable business impact. A Harvard Business Review Analytic Services study revealed that , a factor correlated with a 10% increase in customer ratings and up to 23% higher profitability . This high engagement is also linked to increased customer loyalty. Research has shown that roughly 70% of consumers make purchasing decisions based on customer service alone .\n\nUnsurprisingly, companies that empower their frontline teams with effective communication tools see a direct correlation between improved internal communication and higher customer satisfaction scores. The consensus among executives is that frontline teams possess a unique understanding of the brand, influencing satisfaction and long-term brand perception.\n\nThe Workvivo study found that a lack of recognition is the number-one factor compromising frontline workers\u2019 sense of belonging. The report also found that 39% of frontline workers say that being praised in front of their peers makes them feel more valued than getting a bonus, underscoring that while financial rewards are a good way to reinforce behavior, non-monetary recognition is just as critical. Yet traditional incentive programs often fall short; found that while 91% of organizations have rewards programs, only 31% rate their effectiveness as high, suggesting that many traditional programs are not generating the full value they could.\n\nPlatforms such as Whistle Rewards offer alternative models to traditional rewards with the premise that linking incentives to behaviors rather than just outcomes can yield stronger results. In one case study, to drive a 50% increase in adoption of safety reporting best practices, which suggests the positive impact of this approach in industrial settings. The increasing use of token-based systems, which allow workers to redeem rewards for tangible benefits like extra time off, also gives frontline employees greater control over how their contributions are recognized.\n\nTechnology vendors, including Workvivo, are responding to the realities of this \u201cfrontline gap\u201d (whether they call it that or use other terms) with a new generation of tools.\n\u2022 Microsoft has focused on unifying communications and digitizing workflows through . This includes Teams for messaging and collaboration, AI-powered chat, integrated scheduling and targeted mobile notifications. , Microsoft 365 for frontline workers showed improved productivity, communication and job satisfaction, leading to measurable financial benefits. To calculate the potential value the solutions could deliver, Microsoft used a composite retail organization \u2014 a model company created by combining and aggregating data from multiple real organizations that participated in the research. This organization, a fictional global retail chain with $10 billion in revenue and 20,000 employees (including 12,000 frontline employees and 2,000 frontline supervisors), showed $12 million in increased frontline productivity and $2.3 million saved through enhanced supervisor efficiency. The company also saw a reduction in costs associated with attrition ($3.7 million), errors ($1.7 million) and avoided security losses ($590,000). Additional benefits include accelerated innovation, improved information flow to management and better customer experiences.\n\u2022 provides push-to-talk voice messaging, mobile shift swapping, task management, real-time activity feeds and shift-based chat, addressing the need for instant, location-agnostic communication by frontline workers. ExxonMobil equipped its frontline workers with designed for hands-free use in harsh environments, enabling real-time remote collaboration with experts and reducing equipment downtime from days to minutes.\n\u2022 provides a mobile-first communications platform for frontline teams, including push-to-talk, AI-powered video and noise reduction. It integrates with existing mobile devices to simplify deployment. In one example, to enable instant team communication and faster coordination across locations. The platform\u2019s real-time communication capabilities allow a team leader to communicate with a customer while checking on inventory, for example.\n\nThe integration between ServiceNow and UKG is another example of the platform consolidation trend. UKG People Fabric integrates with ServiceNow\u2019s new to connect their HR and workforce management platforms, allowing frontline employees to use a single interface for tasks such as requesting time off, checking payroll or managing schedules. This approach should reduce administrative friction, enabling workers to handle HR-related needs efficiently without switching between disconnected systems.\n\nSafety and wellness for frontline workers are paramount, particularly in high-risk sectors. The National Safety Council estimates that , or about $1,080 per worker. This highlights the critical need for proactive safety measures, which can deliver a return of $4 to $6 for every $1 invested , according to OSHA estimates. To take one example, Samsara\u2019s suite of advanced wearables enables real-time incident response with features such as one-touch SOS alerts and automatic fall detection. Another example comes from Samsara\u2019s vehicle monitoring platform, which provides real-time GPS tracking, AI-powered dash cameras that detect risky driving behaviors, driver safety scoring and automated incident reporting. Implementing this solution helped Ireland-based Midland Tyre to reduce road traffic accidents by 54% in two years . This improvement led to a renegotiation of its insurance premiums. Additionally, instantly sharing audio, video, and location data allows managers to respond to incidents with complete context.\n\nIn the bigger picture, organizations are consolidating communication, workflow and training tools into integrated platforms. The adoption of wearable technology and AI, including augmented reality and collaborative robotics, is also rising, offering hands-free functionality and enhanced safety.\n\nGoing beyond the tools, engagement programs extend past basic safety to include mental health, belonging and emotional support, which companies now recognize as critical for retention and performance. The expansion of hybrid and gig work models also drives demand for intuitive, self-service systems for scheduling and development. Integrating AI and data analytics enables a more proactive culture of safety, compliance and continuous improvement among frontline workers.\n\nThe Workvivo study \u2014 backed by what we know about broader industry trends \u2014 indicates a clear strategic imperative: companies must address the frontline gap. Doing so requires a complete shift from viewing the frontline workforce as a cost center to seeing it as a strategic asset. By doing so, organizations can foster a sense of belonging and bridge the divides in recognition, culture and communication. In turn, that builds more resilient and innovative organizations, driving measurable improvements in morale, retention and customer experience, which fuels long-term profitability and brand strength.",

      "text": "The American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) is suggesting that businesses invest now in workplace safety, as part of their business strategy. In response to a recent job report released by the U.S. Department of Labor showing little change in the employment rate, the ASSE is suggesting that investment in workplace safety to decrease injuries and illness will in turn increase profits and help create jobs.\nThe ASSE believes that the cost of preventing work-related injuries and illnesses is usually far less than the cost of incurring the injuries and illnesses. Companies that invest consistently in safety realize positive bottom line results, reduced absenteeism, lower turnover rates, higher productivity, increased employee morale and a positive brand image. Additionally, as illnesses, injuries and fatalities decline so to do health care and workers compensation costs.\nStudies on the direct cost of injuries and illnesses show that for every $1 invested in an effective workplace safety program, $4 to $6 may be saved. However, other studies have shown that the indirect cost of an incident can be up to 10 times that of the direct costs.\n- training replacement workers;\n- compensating replacement workers;\n- repairing damaged property;\n- accident investigation;\n- implementation of corrective action;\n- scheduling delays and need to re-plan/reschedule;\n- lost productivity;\n- administrative expenses;\n- low employee morale;\n- increased absenteeism;\n- poor customer relations; and\n- poor community relations.\nSee full article from ASSE at the ASSE web site: http://www.asse.org/ Look for article entitled: Investment in Workplace Safety Triggers Positive Bottom Line Results for Businesses, Economy, Safety Official Notes, and dated 3/23/2004.\nFor more information on safety's return on investment check and other business cases supporting the value added by safety, see the ASSE's web site at http://www.asse.org/businessofsafety.html and www.asse.org under ASSE News 'Business of Safety' highlight section."

Highly engaged employees are emotionally connected and committed to their work, and they perform better.\nEngaged employees are more likely to:\n- take initiative and go beyond what's expected of them\n- stay with their company longer\n- deliver better customer outcomes\n- collaborate effectively with others\n- show resilience under stress or change\nMeasuring employee engagement offers leaders insight into the employee experience, showing them whether employees are deeply invested in their work or just going through the motions.\nMeasurement reveals whether an organization's team-building efforts and HR strategies are driving results or need improvement. Using Gallup's approach to employee engagement, leaders can strengthen employees' connection to their work, build a more resilient culture and prevent burnout before it takes hold.\nWhy Is Employee Engagement Important?\nEmployee engagement is a performance strategy that distinguishes high-performing cultures from struggling ones. Gallup's workplace engagement data show that engaged employees drive stronger business outcomes across every industry, regardless of company size or economic conditions.\nEngaging employees leads to:\n- higher productivity and profitability\n- lower absenteeism and turnover\n- fewer safety incidents and quality defects\n- stronger customer loyalty\nThese outcomes are based on decades of research across industries and organizations worldwide. When comparing the most engaged teams to the least engaged, Gallup research reveals the clear benefits of employee engagement:\nWhat highly engaged employees achieve more of:\n10% higher customer loyalty/engagement\n14% higher productivity (production records and evaluations)\n18% higher productivity (sales)\n23% higher profitability\n70% higher wellbeing (net thriving employees)\n22% higher organizational citizenship (participation)\nWhat highly engaged employees achieve less of:\n78% less absenteeism\n21% less turnover for high-turnover organizations\n51% less turnover for low-turnover organizations\n28% less shrinkage (theft)\n63% fewer safety incidents (accidents)\n32% fewer quality defects\n*The above figures are median percent differences across companies in Gallup's database. High-turnover organizations are those with more than 40% annualized turnover. Low-turnover organizations are those with 40% or lower annualized turnover.\nEmployees make decisions and take actions every day that can affect both the workforce and organizational effectiveness. The way a company treats employees and how employees treat one another can positively affect their actions or can place an organization at risk.\nBased on decades of employee engagement research, Gallup knows that engaged employees produce better business outcomes than other employees, regardless of industry, company size or nationality, and in good economic times and bad.\nSo, what can companies do better to engage employees?\nWhen leaders use a science-backed employee engagement tool like the Gallup Q12\u00ae as a framework, they yield clear results.\nHow Are Engaged Employees Different From Other Employees?\nGallup identifies three types of employees, each with distinct behaviors, mindsets and business impact. The most successful organizations understand these personas and work to move people into the \u201cengaged\u201d category.\nThe three personas of engagement:\nEngaged Employees\nEngaged employees are highly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \"owners,\" drive high performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\nExample: An employee who logs in for a few hours longer to get a project over the finish line or who spends more time on the phone with a client who needs help because they're committed to their organization's \"client first\" values. They build up their coworkers and have strong relationships within the organization.\nNot Engaged Employees\nNot engaged employees are psychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they're putting time, but not energy or passion, into their work.\nExample: An employee who completes their work but is fueled by duty rather than passion or personal interest. This employee may prefer to fly under the radar and might back down from more intense or high-profile work.\nActively Disengaged Employees\nActively disengaged employees aren't just unhappy at work. They are resentful that their needs aren't being met and are acting out their unhappiness. Every day, these workers potentially undermine what their engaged coworkers accomplish.\nExample: An employee who spends their time talking negatively about coworkers, current projects, leaders, etc. They may be searching for other employment opportunities in their spare time and do not plan to stay at their current job much longer.\nWhose Job Is Employee Engagement?\nImproving employee engagement is a shared responsibility within an organization. Leaders set the tone, and managers make it real for employees, who live out engagement every day.\nWho is responsible for engagement?\n- Executives create the vision and model engagement from the top.\n- Managers drive 70% of the variance in team engagement and make or break the employee experience.\n- Employees take responsibility for and communicate their engagement needs.\nEffective employee engagement strategies start at the top of an organization. Highly engaged workplaces have executive leaders who buy into, communicate and model engagement, creating the conditions for managers and employees to adopt an engagement mindset.\nHow Leaders Can Increase Employee Engagement\n- Align engagement efforts with the organization\u2019s broader employee experience strategy.\n- Communicate the importance of employee engagement.\n- Build trust in the benefits of engagement.\n- Model engaging behaviors.\n- Redefine managers' roles and expectations.\n- Provide employee engagement tools, resources and development that managers need to coach team members and meet those expectations.\n- Create evaluation practices that help managers accurately measure performance and hold employees accountable.\nOnce executives are committed, managers are essential to engagement. In fact, 70% of the variance in team-level engagement is determined solely by the manager.\nEmployee engagement should be a manager's primary responsibility.\nManagers ensure that employees know what work needs to be done, supporting and advocating for them when necessary and explaining how their workplace engagement connects to organizational success.\nTo succeed in that responsibility, managers need to know how to engage employees by having powerful coaching conversations.\nUnfortunately, most managers don't know how to make frequent conversations meaningful, so their actions are more likely to be interpreted as micromanaging without providing the right tools and direction.\nSo, it's not enough for leaders to simply tell managers to own engagement and coach their teams.\nWhat Are the Drivers of Employee Engagement?\nEmployee engagement grows when people feel connected to their work, valued for their strengths and supported by great managers. Gallup identifies five essential elements that consistently drive engagement.\nKey drivers of employee engagement include:\n- Purpose \u2014 Doing work that feels meaningful and mission-driven\n- Development \u2014 Having opportunities to learn and grow\n- Caring managers \u2014 Feeling supported by someone who genuinely cares\n- Ongoing conversations \u2014 Receiving consistent feedback and coaching\n- Focus on strengths \u2014 Being encouraged to use what you do best every day\nEmployee Engagement: Deeper Than Temporary Satisfaction\nOne of the most common mistakes companies make is to approach engagement as a sporadic exercise in making their employees feel happy, usually around the time when a survey is coming up.\nIt's true that we describe engaged employees as \"enthusiastic.\" And employee engagement surveys play a big role in measuring staff engagement. But it's not that simple.\nEmployees need more than a fleeting, warm-fuzzy feeling and a good paycheck (even if it helps them respond positively on employee engagement survey questions) to invest in their work and achieve more for their company.\nPeople want purpose and meaning from their work. They want to be known for what makes them unique. This is what drives employee engagement.\nOne of Gallup's biggest discoveries: The manager or team leader alone accounts for 70% of the variance in team engagement.\nAnd they want relationships, particularly with a manager who can coach them to the next level. This is who drives employee engagement.\nWhen engaging employees, leaders need to know a key fact about today\u2019s workplace: It has evolved. Gallup research reveals that to perform at their highest, employees need something different from their work than they used to.\n- My Paycheck\n- My Satisfaction\n- My Boss\n- My Annual Review\n- My Weaknesses\n- My Job\n- My Purpose\n- My Development\n- My Coach\n- My Ongoing Conversations\n- My Strengths\n- My Life\nWhat Causes an Employee Engagement Strategy to Fail?\nMost engagement strategies fail because they aren\u2019t treated as core business priorities. When engagement is siloed in HR or reduced to survey scores, organizations miss the deeper drivers of performance and culture.\nCommon reasons employee engagement efforts fail:\n- Lack of executive ownership \u2014 Leaders don\u2019t model or prioritize engagement.\n- Overcomplicated strategies \u2014 Focus drifts from core employee needs.\n- Misleading metrics \u2014 Using \u201cpercent favorable\u201d scores inflates results.\n- Action gaps \u2014 Surveys are overused, and follow-through is inconsistent.\nNearly 80% of employees worldwide are still not engaged or are actively disengaged at work, despite increased effort from companies.\nThe greatest cause of a workplace engagement program's failure is this: Employee engagement is widely considered \"an HR thing.\"\nEngagement needs buy-in from leaders and managers to succeed.\nMany executive-level leaders have not embraced engagement in a way that communicates its importance as a shared responsibility to employees and holds managers accountable for its deployment.\nThe result is that some leaders believe they have exhausted \"engagement\" as a performance lever before they truly explore its full potential to change their business.\nThese leaders consistently experience low engagement, or they plateau and eventually decline, despite repeated attempts to boost scores. Other times, they have high engagement numbers, but their business results tell a different story.\nAt a loss for explanations, leaders may blame the tool, the measurement, the philosophy or environmental factors that they believe make their problems unique.\nBut the apparent failure of employee engagement efforts is likely due to the ineffective implementation of employee engagement programs.\nWhat Makes Employee Engagement Programs Likely to Fail?\nThey\u2019re too complicated. Leaders make engagement metrics far too complicated by focusing on predictors that are often outside managers' control and typically don't relate to meeting employees' core psychological needs at work.\nThey use incorrect employee engagement metrics. Leaders use a low-bar \"percent favorable\" metric that inflates scores and creates blind spots, resulting in the appearance of high engagement without strong business performance outcomes.\nThey overuse the employee pulse survey and underdeliver on follow-through. Leaders overuse pulse surveys to get immediate feedback and rarely take action on the results.\nIn contrast, leaders who craft employee engagement initiatives using the following framework see significant gains year after year.\nHow Should Organizations Measure Employee Engagement?\nMeasuring engagement effectively starts with asking the right questions. Through decades of research, Gallup has identified 12 elements of employee engagement that link directly to performance. These 12 elements make up the Q12 survey.\nThe best employee engagement measurement:\n- helps managers structure coaching conversations and performance reviews\n- tracks what matters \u2014 like clarity, resources, recognition and individual strengths\n- drives follow-up action, not just data collection\nManagers can take charge of engagement by asking Gallup\u2019s 12 employee engagement questions to create a structure for their interactions with employees: casual conversations, meeting agendas, performance evaluations and team goal-setting.\nThe 12 Elements of Employee Engagement\nSome of the 12 elements might seem simple. But Gallup's employee engagement research finds that each element effectively separates high-performing employees from their lower-performing counterparts, predicting performance for teams and organizations.\nHere are the first three elements of employee engagement and ideas to help managers approach each one:\nQ01\nI know what is expected of me at work.\nHelping employees understand what their organization, leaders and managers expect from them requires more than someone telling them what to do. The most effective managers define and discuss each employee's explicit and implicit expectations. They paint a picture of outstanding performance and help employees recognize how their work leads to success for their coworkers, their business area and the entire organization.\nQ02\nI have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right.\n\"Materials and equipment\" is not just a checklist of tools. It includes both tangible and intangible resources \u2014 office supplies, software, knowledge sharing and permissions, to name a few \u2014 that employees need to do their job. The most effective managers don't assume what their team needs. They ask for and listen to their employees' needs and advocate for them when necessary. They also find ways to make the most of their team's ingenuity and talents when they cannot fully fund requests.\nQ03\nAt work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.\nWhen people get to do what they do best every day at work, the organization they work for gets a boost in employee participation, attraction, engagement and retention. Successful managers get to know their employees as individuals and give them opportunities to apply the best of their natural selves \u2014 their talents. They talk to each employee about their unique value and make adjustments to align work, when possible, with team members' talents. The best managers know where their employees excel and position them so they are engaged and provide maximum value to the organization.\nWhat Is Gallup\u2019s Employee Engagement Model?\nGallup\u2019s model outlines four levels of employee needs, from foundational expectations to personal growth. Each level builds on the previous one, offering a framework for meaningful performance development.\nThe four levels of employee needs are:\nBasic Needs\nIndividual Contribution\nTeamwork\nGrowth\nMeeting the needs in the first three foundational levels creates an environment of trust and support that enables managers and employees to get the most out of the fourth level \u2014 personal growth.\nThese levels provide a road map for managers to motivate and develop their team members and improve team members' performance, with each one building on the last.\n- Challenge me\n- Help me review my contributions\n- Help me build mutual trust\n- Help me feel proud\n- Help me see my importance\n- Hear me\n- Help me grow\n- Care about me\n- Help me see my value\n- Know me\n- Free me from unnecessary stress\n- Focus me\nThese levels do not represent phases. Managers do not \"finish\" the first level and then move on to the second. They must ensure that employees know what is expected of them and have the right materials and equipment to do their work while meeting needs on the second, third and fourth levels.\nWith their team members, managers should identify needs and obstacles on an ongoing basis and ideally take action before challenges inhibit their employees' performance.\nSucceed despite disruption with the Gallup Q12.\nContact us to develop an engagement strategy that reduces burnout, cuts turnover and creates high performance as the workplace evolves.\nWhat Can Managers Do With Their Teams to Improve Employee Engagement?\nTeams build employee engagement through trust, clarity and shared effort. Strong engagement grows when managers and team members commit to regular, meaningful conversations about how they work together.\nTo improve team engagement, managers should:\n- create space for open, ongoing dialogue\n- recognize individual contributions in visible, personal ways\n- adapt leadership for hybrid and remote work environments\n- support each person\u2019s unique needs and strengths\n- invite feedback and act on it\nThere are no quick fixes when it comes to human relationships. Simple employee engagement activities won't transform your culture.\nBut since the value of the Q12 items lies in helping managers and teams start conversations and approach workplace issues authentically and meaningfully, there are many ways in which the framework helps managers and leaders build team engagement.\nExample Areas of Focus for Engaging Conversations\nAddressing Discord\nA new manager has inherited a low-performing team of diverse generations and personalities. After a few months of private conversations and tense team meetings, she can tell that disunity and a lack of cooperation are at the heart of the team's insufficient collaboration and low performance outcomes.\nAddressing Hybrid Work Arrangements\nLeaders wondering how to engage remote employees or build a successful hybrid strategy must acknowledge how the world of work is changing. Those looking to engage remote employees or develop a successful hybrid strategy can no longer rely on familiar management practices designed for an on-site workforce. Instead, they must evolve those practices to reflect their ongoing commitment to supporting hybrid and remote teams.\nExamples of How Managers Can Take Action With the Q12\nQ04\nRecognition\nMake recognition a regular agenda item to demonstrate appreciation for individuals' unique contributions to the team and organization. Foster a culture of recognition that transcends location by tracking excellence and regularly celebrating employees\u2019 contributions \u2014 small or large \u2014 to boost morale, motivation and engagement.\nQ05\nSomeone Cares\nAsk employees: \u201cWhat makes you feel like a valued team member?\u201d Individualize your approach to leading team members based on how they say they want to be treated.\nQ07\nOpinions Count\nBecome an advocate for employees' ideas. Solicit them during meetings, and take action on them.\nHow to Increase Employee Engagement After a Survey\nAn engagement survey is only the first step in motivating employees. If leadership implements a survey with no follow-up, engagement will likely decrease.\nTo gain positive momentum and increase engagement, leaders must ask for feedback, do something about it and continually share results.\nUsing employee engagement platforms like Gallup Access is a great place to start. Employee engagement software offers helpful action items and advice for leaders and managers looking to increase team engagement and build accountability.\nIncreasing Employee Engagement Begins Here\nYour culture is unique. Your engagement strategy should be too.\nGallup works with organizations to design employee engagement solutions that reflect their values, goals and people. Our experts help you build a strategy that drives performance and fits your culture."

      "text": "HR initiatives have become more employee-focused than ever. Recognition and Rewards (R&R) programs have emerged as a great way to boost workplace engagement, morale, and performance. HR.com's new \"State of Rewards and Recognition 2024\" research report, created in partnership with WorkTango, delves into the effectiveness of these programs across a wide spectrum of industries and global regions. The new research revealed that the true impact of these initiatives often falls short of their full potential.\nThe six key employee recognition statistics below are derived from the research study. Consider whether your program contains any of these flaws as you refine your program strategy to deliver tangible ROI better. Let\u2019s take a look at what the research says:\n1. R&R program prevalence does not equal program effectiveness\nWhile a staggering 91% of organizations have rewards programs and 94% have recognition programs, only 31% rate their program\u2019s effectiveness as \"high\" or \"very high.\" The primary hurdles? Cost and inconsistent application, with 38% pointing to a lack of leadership involvement as a hindrance to their program\u2019s effectiveness.\n2. Most R&R program structures contain pitfalls\nThe majority - 61% - of organizations take a flexible approach to their employee recognition program by implementing a mix of formal and informal recognition. Despite this structure, the majority of organizations only allow employee reward nominations to be made by managers or peers. Only 41% emphasize results-based nominations. Limitations around who can give recognition, and a lack of focus on results, means many programs do not optimally support employee success or incentivize key employee behaviors.3. R&R program impact is underestimated by employers\nEmployers say that making employees feel valued (65%) and increasing satisfaction/morale (49%) are the top strategic advantages of recognition programs.\nHowever, other major employee recognition program advantages, such as enhancing performance or helping employees identify their strengths, are undervalued by employers. This highlights a need for recognition programs to be revamped to better support employee performance and development. Tailoring your recognition and rewards program to not only foster employee sentiment - but also growth and development - is key to unlocking its full potential.\n4. R&R program effectiveness measurement techniques are lagging\nOnly 43% of organizations regularly review their recognition programs' effectiveness, and only 33% take employee feedback into high consideration. The research shows a clear trend towards being reactive when it comes to creating and measuring the impact of employee R&R programs. To enhance these initiatives, it\u2019s important to shift towards a proactive, regular program evaluation strategy to stay ahead of employee recognition and rewards needs, rather than create a program purely based on what HR thinks is best. Ask employees what types of recognition and rewards would be most meaningful to them, and then design a program that meets their needs.5. 46% of organizations plan to improve employee recognition programs\nLooking ahead, 46% of organizations plan to enhance program effectiveness by fostering a continuous culture of recognition, while about 50% of organizations anticipate leveraging technology for better program analytics, performance tracking, and predictive modeling. Using comprehensive recognition and rewards software is one way organizations can streamline processes, access new data-driven insights, and enhance the precision and impact of their programs.6. Effective R&R Programs share common characteristics\nIn contrast to organizations who have less effective employee recognition and rewards programs, organizations who have more effective programs are:\n|\n|"

      "text": "\u201cThe health and safety of our staff and customers is number one, and Samsara has become a massive part of us continuing to meet and exceed this goal.\u201d Chris Parle, Chief Commercial Officer, Midland Tyre Services\n50% reduction in time spent managing the fleet\n20 minutes saved on every call-out, equivalent to 140,000 minutes or 2,333 hours per year\n54% reduction in road accidents in two years\n96% average driver score\u2014a metric that tracks, measures, and reports on individual driver performance\nMidland Tyre Services is Ireland\u2019s largest independently owned supplier of truck, agricultural, and off-the-road (OTR) tyres. Alongside equipping some of the country's largest blue-chip companies with fresh sets of wheels, the company attends over 10,500 breakdowns every year.\nA change of ownership however saw health and safety fall under the management microscope.\n\u201cWe were experiencing a high accident rate and as a result, sky-high insurance premiums. It wasn\u2019t sustainable, we knew we had to change our approach,\u201d said Chief Commercial Officer, Chris Parle. \u201cOur existing tracking system couldn\u2019t see in or outside of the cab, so it lacked the functionality we needed to prevent risky behaviour, exonerate innocent drivers, or guide targeted coaching.\u201d\nWithout insights into safety events or driver behaviour, coaching drivers and demonstrating safety improvements was nigh on impossible. As a result, fleet managers were left in the dark, and insurance premiums continued to climb.\nMidland Tyre Services turned to Samsara for a comprehensive view of safety through integrated telematics, fleet tracking, and dual-facing dash cams.\n\u201cSamsara gives us a powerful pair of eyes across our entire fleet,\u201d said Parle.\u201c It\u2019s helped us resolve issues and respond to callouts much faster. We can share tracking data through dispatch links so our customers and technicians have a clear view of the nearest vehicle responding. It\u2019s great for transparency and having complete visibility over our drivers is a massive benefit.\u201d\nWhen drivers are out on the road, Samsara\u2019s AI Dash Cameras capture footage of risky behaviours like tailgating or distracted driving, and upload it automatically to a centralised inbox for review. For Midland Tyre Services, this has helped them put safety first, and provide targeted coaching to drivers that need it most.\nHowever, driving a new culture of safety wasn\u2019t without its roadblocks. Initially, there was some pushback from drivers, as they weren\u2019t completely sold on the benefits.\n\u201cA few of our drivers were reluctant at first; there was a pretty significant amount of backlash we had to contend with,\u201d said Parle. Thankfully, once drivers realised the cameras were there to protect them, not police them, Midland Tyre Services were able to win them over. \u201cIt took a little bit of training, but our drivers quickly realised that the cameras are there for their benefit, and if an accident occurs that isn\u2019t their fault, they\u2019re protected.\u201d\nThanks to vastly improved driver tracking and fleet management, Midland Tyre Services has saved an average of 20 minutes on each call-out\u2014totalling 140,000 minutes or 2333 hours across the year. Driver manager, Eddie Burns, said: \u201cBefore, I\u2019d be asking \u2014 are you finished? Have you completed your hours? Now, I can just check Samsara and see who's moving, who's nearest. That visibility alone saves me twenty minutes on every single breakdown I attend. I couldn't function without it.\u201d\nMidland Tyre Services has also set a new standard of safety awareness with Samsara\u2019s Safety Score, which tracks, measures, and reports on individual driver performance. The average score across all drivers is an impressive 96%, which is indicative of the great progress the team has made in terms of safety, coaching, and personal growth. \u201cThe safety score has been a runaway success,\u201d says Burns. \u201cIt\u2019s given myself and other drivers something to compete over, I can\u2019t count the number of times we\u2019ve joked about beating each other\u2019s score, it\u2019s a fantastic system.\u201d\nCritically, Samsara has helped Midland Tyre Services reduce road traffic accidents by 54% in two years and helped them renegotiate insurance premiums to keep costs low.\nMidland Tyre Services plans to continue developing its partnership with Samsara. By introducing the technology to more vans, training new drivers, and continually looking for ways to improve, the tyre giant hopes to nurture a culture of safety that sticks around for the foreseeable future.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just scratching the surface of what we can achieve with Samsara \u2013 so watch this space!\u201d said Parle.\nThe Samsara platform enables Petit Forestier to offer its customers high value-added services and to manage the preventive maintenance ..."
