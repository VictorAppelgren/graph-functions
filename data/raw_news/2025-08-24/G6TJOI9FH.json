He has previously labeled both networks \u201cpolitical pawns\u201d of the Democrats.\n\nIn June, ABC dismissed veteran correspondent Terry Moran after he referred to senior Trump aide Stephen Miller as a \u201cworld-class hater.\u201d In 2024, the network agreed to pay $15 million to Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over inaccurate comments about his sexual assault and defamation trial involving columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n\nLast month, Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, agreed to pay $16 million as part of another settlement. Trump alleged the company deceptively edited a 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was at the time running against him in the presidential election.\n\nIn July, Trump filed a lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal\u2019s parent company Dow Jones and its owner Rupert Murdoch over a report claiming he had sent a birthday letter to financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in the early 2000s.",

      "text": "Melania Trump threatens to sue Hunter Biden for $1bn\nUS First Lady Melania Trump has threatened a $1 billion lawsuit against Hunter Biden over his \u201cextremely salacious\u201d remarks linking her to late disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe son of former US President Joe Biden made the comments during a YouTube interview with Channel 5 host Andrew Callaghan earlier this month. Biden alleged that Epstein had introduced Melania to her husband, Donald Trump, citing a book by American journalist Michael Wolff. According to Biden, the connections between the late sex trafficker and the Trumps \u201care, like, so wide and deep.\u201d\nShortly after the explosive interview, the first lady\u2019s attorney,Alejandro Brito, sent Biden a letter threatening him with a $1 billion lawsuit. Dated August 6 and circulated by the US media this week, the letter demanded that Biden \u201cimmediately retract the false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements made about Mrs. Trump\u201d or face the massive suit needed to \u201crecover the overwhelming financial and reputational harm that you have caused her to suffer.\u201d\nDonald Trump, who himself is no stranger to filing substantial litigation lawsuits, has backed the looming legal action against Biden.\n\u201cI said go forward. You know, I\u2019ve done pretty well on these lawsuits lately \u2026 and Jeffrey Epstein had nothing to do with Melania and introducing,\u201d Trump told Fox News Radio host Brian Kilmeade on Thursday. Previously, the US president accused Wolff of making up stories to sell books and dismissed him as a \u201cthird-rate reporter.\u201d\nBiden reappeared on Callaghan\u2019s show on Thursday, being offered an opportunity to apologize. He refused to do so, however, and stood by his original remarks.\n\u201cF**k that, that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201c[Epstein and Trump] knew each other well, they spent an enormous amount of time together.\u201d Biden once again referenced Wolff\u2019s claims, as well as cited several other publications alleging the link between Melania Trump and Epstein.\nAccording to the first lady\u2019s best-selling memoir, \u2018Melania\u2019, she met her future husband at a 1998 Fashion Week party in New York, where the two were introduced by a modeling agent."
