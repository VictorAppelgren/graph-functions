  "title": "Escape from Tarkov is finally coming to Steam 'soon,' developer says",
  "description": "After eight years of beta with its own proprietary launcher, Battlestate Games' influential FPS will get a Steam release.",
  "content": "Following news that Escape from Tarkov is escaping its perpetual beta, the pioneering extraction shooter is also about to make its debut on Steam. Nikita Buyanov, head of the Battlestate Games studio that developed Escape from Tarkov, confirmed on X that the game's Steam page \"will be available soon,\" only teasing that the full details will come later.\n\nBuyanov's confirmation comes less than a day after the developer posted a GIF on X of a man spraying steam from an iron. Earlier this month, Buyanov revealed on X that the looter shooter will get its 1.0 release on November 15, 2025, more than eight years after the beta opened up to players in July 2017, and that the studio has plans to port it to consoles. The Steam page for Escape from Tarkov isn't live yet, and with only vague details to go off of, longtime fans already have burning questions. Most importantly, existing players are eager to know if they will have to buy the game again on Steam and how this change will affect the ongoing cheating problem.\n\nWhile we don't have any answers yet, Battlestate Games recently went into damage control mode when it revealed the Unheard Edition of the game that costs $250 and includes a new PvE mode. This move irked longstanding players who previously purchased another premium edition of the game, called the Edge of Darkness, which promised access to all future DLCs. The controversy boiled down to owners of the Edge of Darkness edition claiming they should have access to the new content, but the studio argued that it isn't classified as DLC. In the end, Buyanov apologized for the debacle and promised the PvE mode would be available for anyone who purchased the Edge of Darkness package.",

      "text": "Battlestate Games\u2019 Nikita Buyanov has taken to social media to praise the actions of the team in ridding Escape from Tarkov of more than 2,000 cheaters in just over a week. He stressed how difficult \u2018the fight\u2019 against cheaters can be, a statement that earned him a mixed response in the comments section.\nEscape from Tarkov has been the spearhead of the extraction shooter genre for almost a decade, but the biggest problem the platform has to deal with is the constant presence of cheaters spoiling the fun for everyone else.\n\u2018The Number One Issue\u2019\nEscape from Tarkov\u2019s cheater problem has been dubbed the \u2018number one issue\u2019 for the title, which would otherwise be in a much better place as it storms inevitably towards a 1.0 release.\nNikita\u2019s recent post on social media reflects the challenges the team faces in battling the influx of malicious operators:\nthis fight is hard and neverending. My props to our team related to that!\nFans were quick to criticize Buyanov when he posted that a kernel-level anti-cheat system is in \u2018RnD\u2019 at Battlestate Games. The criticism here comes from BSG already using a kernel-level anti-cheat in Battleye. The comment did prompt some fans to assume that Battlestate is working on a proprietary kernel-level anti-cheat function, which comes with its own challenges and concerns.\nAs always, Battlestate Games named and shamed the accounts banned for cheating, posting a simple Google Doc on social media with lines and lines of data.\nFor some, 2,000 cheaters being banned only scratches the surface of what\u2019s out there. As Escape from Tarkov moves inexorably towards the much-debated 1.0 release, fans are worried that it won\u2019t be the momentous event everyone is hoping for.\nHow long has it been since a cheater impacted you in Escape from Tarkov? Let me know on the Insider Gaming forum.\nFor more Insider Gaming coverage, check out the news about GTA 5\u2019s release in Saudi Arabia"

      "text": "Escape From Tarkov developer Battlestate Games has been called \"shameless\" and \"tone deaf\" over its response to controversy caused by a $250 expansion, with fans and even its esports associate calling out the studio.\nThe community behind Escape From Tarkov \u2014 a hardcore and realistic online first-person shooter currently in beta \u2014 erupted on April 26 after Battlestate announced the $250 Unheard Edition upgrade, which added an exclusive player-versus-everyone mode amid other extras, and notably wasn't deemed downloadable content by the developer. This meant those who'd bought the $150 Edge of Darkness edition of Escape From Tarkov, which came with a Season Pass and thus \"free access to all subsequent DLCs\", wouldn't obtain this new content without spending another $250.\nMany players therefore deemed the Unheard Edition \"pay-to-win\", \"unacceptable\", \"disrespectful\", and more, but immense backlash has now arisen in response to the developer's official comment on the matter, which was seemingly intended to rectify the situation.\nNik Buyanov, Battlestate COO and studio head, posted on Reddit to announce owners of the Edge of Darkness edition would get access to the mode upon Escape From Tarkov's full launch but couldn't yet because of server capacity issues.\nPlayers would \"have the opportunity to test this mode by purchasing the Unheard edition of the game\", Buyanov said, announcing a 50% discount for owners of the Edge of Darkness edition. These players would therefore be paying $275 in total to access this part of the Escape From Tarkov beta.\nAnother Reddit post came from Buyanov after this one didn't go well. \"I would like to say that I am very sorry that fans and the game community in general are experiencing these feelings,\" he said, the wording of which further upset many Escape From Tarkov players.\n\"Fake apology,\" said redamid. \"'I'm sorry you feel this way' does not equal 'I'm sorry I betrayed you'.\" ZeroPointZero_ chimed in too: \"'I'm sorry you feel this way' is really not how an apology should sound,\" they said. \"I don't really expect much better than this, however, considering all that has happened. The corrective actions are now on the right track, but hardly enough. Introducing pay-to-win features that are infinitely more potent than the ones in Edge of Darkness is just tone deaf.\"\nBuyanov said the reaction, \"which he did not foresee\", will affect future decisions and announced a handful of other changes to these editions. PvE will be made available to those who own the Edge of Darkness edition but only \"in waves\" because of the server capacity issues, though it's unclear how far apart these waves will come.\nHe also promised to balance the items and perks in this addition but provide more to those who already bought it for $250, and said Battlestate will continue to work on other patches and content for Escape From Tarkov, among other things. \"Thank you for your time, love and hate, and thank you for your increased attention to the current situation,\" Buyanov said.\nThese changes aren't enough for many, however. \"Saying you're 'sorry about the feeling we are experiencing' is such as BS statement,\" said broken-cactus. \"Clearly you're not sorry for what you did. While this is a good step, honestly you guys have shown your true colors with this whole fiasco. I'm just very disappointed, and I hope you guys will take some time to build back the trust you lost with this community.\"\nA comment from paulfunyan suggested Battlestate had made false promises in the past, and said the company is asking for too much money for a game currently in beta. \"You've had the privilege of us testing your game for the past seven years, and this is the product you're delivering. If you expect anyone to pay more money to test this then you're bats**t insane,\" they said. \"Shameless.\"\nEscape From Tarkov's Reddit is currently full of fans sharing similar thoughts, though Battlestate's recent actions appear to be a step too far for many. A post from WebFirm4870 with a screenshot of them uninstalling the game has 3,500 upvotes. Mleeimlele's post telling other players not to fall for the apology has 6,700 upvotes. A screenshot of the Wikipedia page for a \"non-apology apology\" has 5,100 upvotes.\nBut the backlash took a step further when Evasion GG, the first Escape From Tarkov esports team and a host of more than 200 tournaments for the game, posted on X/Twitter to claim Battlestate is a bad company to work with as a result of \"control issues, blatant nepotism\" and more.\n\"We have produced over 200 Tarkov shows but if you\u2019ve wondered why we haven\u2019t been as active as we once were it\u2019s because we will not be railroaded into doing events that we don\u2019t believe in,\" Evasion said.\n\"What happened to the Tarkov community over the past week is what\u2019s been happening to us for the last two years dealing with Battlestate. Promises not kept, gaslighting, event cancelations, control issues, blatant nepotism, [and] all while wasting our time, money, and efforts. This year we found out how terribly they have been treating the smaller event orgs as well. Now this treatment has spread to the player base.\n\"We\u2019ve held back sharing this information but seeing how the community was treated as a whole recently was too much. We will not create Tarkov events until we see things truly change.\"\nIGN has asked Battlestate for comment regarding these allegations and the community backlash.\nEscape From Tarkov was released in closed alpha in August 2016 before its closed beta was released in July 2017. It has stayed in this form ever since despite regular updates and paid add-ons, with no word on a proper launch date as of yet.\nRyan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter. He'll talk about The Witcher all day."
