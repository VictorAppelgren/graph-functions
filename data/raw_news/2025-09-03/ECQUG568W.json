  "description": "Fed\u2019s Musalem Says Balanced Policy Approach Is Important",
  "content": "The current modestly restrictive setting of the policy rate is consistent with today's full employment labour market and a core inflation and core inflation nearly one percentage point above the Fed's 2% target. Multiple tailor rule specifications currently prescribe a policy rate around today's level of the federal funds rate and above estimates of the long run neutral rate. From the starting point, policy must be forward looking and based on the evolving economic outlook and balance of risks. When the maximum employment and price stability goals are not complementary, it is important to take a balanced approach. This means appropriately weighing the probability of minutes of missing on each goal, the potential size of each mess, and the different time horizons needed to return employment and inflation to levels consistent with the Fed's dual mandate. Pursuing a balanced approach requires careful. For example, putting most of the weight on the labor market goal runs the risk of unwarranted or excessive policy easing, causing a further steepening of the yield curve, a rise in the term premium or an increase in inflation expectations. Any of those potential outcomes could do more harm than good to labor market and contribute to more persistent above target inflation. Although longer term inflation expectations are anchored today. Markets are sensitive to these risks, as evidenced by increases in the term premium and in some measures of long term inflation expectations. At the same time, putting most of the weight on the inflation goal runs the risk of not providing enough support to maintain a full employment labour market at a time when downside risks have risen again. Balance is key.",

  "summary": "The US Federal Reserve has a relatively modest policy setting, consistent with the current full employment and core inflation levels. The goal of achieving maximum employment and maintaining a stable balance requires a balanced approach. This could result in unwarranted or excessive policy easing, a steepening of the yield curve, a rise in inflation expectations, or a decrease in the inflation rate. The Fed's goal is to restore the level of economic stability and maintain the full employment of the workforce.",
  "shortSummary": "The Fed's policymaker, economist and former employee, emphasized that a balanced approach was crucial to maintaining a stable employment market and tackling inflation.",
