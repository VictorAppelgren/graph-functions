      "feedback": "The draft does a solid job threading macro, policy, and fundamentals around cash‑flow anchors (Microsoft and Shopify), but to reach world‑class quality it needs a tighter, first-principles causal chain, a formal scenario framework, and explicit, sourced catalysts/invalidation points. Actionable edits: rebuild as a three‑lens transmission (macro/inflation path and Fed policy; flows/positioning and dollar/credit dynamics; valuation/technicals anchored to durable cash generation) with explicit links, e.g., CPI 2.7% YoY in July drives sticky services inflation and reinforces Fed easing pricing (V7GV8YBQU); the Fed funds rate around 4.5% versus euro‑area real rates ~0.5% implies roughly 70% odds of a 50bp September cut, which would push the dollar down ~2–3% and compress spreads by ~300–350bp (C3ODMIQKZ; GX057ADL7); show how that policy impulse translates into valuation via MSFT and Shopify cash‑flow strength (MSFT: FY25 Q4 rev $76.4B, EPS $3.65, Azure +39% YoY, payout 33.6%, forward yield ~0.7%; Shopify: revenue $2.7B, net income $906m, FCF margin 16%; all 0G3A676BP) and yields a floor to multiples even as inflation uncertainty weighs on a broader tech mix; introduce a concrete base/bull/bear scenario with quantified outputs for multiples and dividend returns over a 1–2 year horizon, and attach explicit catalysts and invalidation triggers: the September decision and dot plot, the next CPI print, dollar moves beyond key thresholds, and credit‑spread or S&P 500 reactions, with stated thresholds (e.g., >±2–3% dollar move, 300–350bp spread compression, or CPI surprise deviations) to recalibrate. Ensure every factual claim ties to a source ID (0G3A676BP for MSFT/Shopify data; V7GV8YBQU for CPI; C3ODMIQKZ for policy/dollar/spreads; GX057ADL7 for dollar/spreads) and remove the truncated Rivian reference to avoid source integrity issues.",
