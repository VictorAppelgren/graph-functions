It was also such a vulnerable time.

      "text": "'We've got her hidden,' says the elegant brunette who greets patrons of the secluded patio of the Beverly Hills Hotel. A hotel security man of large dimensions nods pleasantly as we head back to a table shielded by a semicircular grotto. There sits Jennifer Aniston. She is in conversation with another woman, but looks up and makes an amiable gesture to reel us in.\nAniston, 35, was recently listed by Forbes magazine as America's ultimate celebrity, based on her visibility and her sheer avalanche of income. Between her soon-to-be-concluded series Friends and a busy spate of moonlighting in feature films, she earnt some $35m in 2002. Her companion is Kristin Hahn, a writer and filmmaker and a key executrix of Aniston and husband Brad Pitt's company Plan B. These two fledgling moguls give off an air of happy innocence. Sitting under a striped awning, pert, stylish and wide-eyed, they resemble a couple of kids waiting for an aunt to arrive with ice cream.\nThey manage to keep their upbeat mien even as the interviewer places his tape recorder on the table, then introductions are made, establishing that their friendship of 15 years reaches back to what Aniston has described as her Laurel Canyon gang. Aniston is happy to discuss Along Came Polly, in which she plays the title role of a flighty Manhattanite, opposite Ben Stiller as the neurotic risk analyst who's fallen for her. But for a few more moments they're squarely planted in Plan B mode.\n'So how this all happened,' explains Aniston, 'we basically said, \"Let's start to make a movie,\" and started with one little baby step, right? What's the saying about the longest journey starts with one...?'\nKristin: 'The road to hell is paved with good intentions?'\nJennifer: 'The road to - no, that's a different one. No, the big - what is it? - oh, it's what Mariane says in the beginning of her book...'\nFor a moment, it's as if the patio has been cast into shadow. Aniston is referring to Mariane Pearl's memoir A Mighty Heart, which tells of losing her journalist husband Daniel to terrorist kidnappers. Spurred by the couple's, and Hahn's, early interest, Plan B (and Warner Bros, which bankrolled the deal) acquired the book over stiff competition. Aniston finishes the phrase: '... starts with one step. So Brad and I did this under the radar for a while, and we called ourselves Bloc - the dictionary definition is a group of people coming together, uniting under a common cause.'\nKristin: 'Jen played the word in Scrabble, and we thought, oh, that's good. We started calling ourselves Blocheads.'\nJennifer: 'Yeah, Blocheads, Bloc Productions. Bloc Products. Bloc Party. It sort of snowballed and we're having a blast. In fact, we've got 17 movies in development. We started this little company underground, didn't really talk about it because we didn't want to be accused of being actors who have vanity deals where you don't do anything. We wanted to do something first. And then about a year later, [\u00fcber agent/producer] Brad Grey approached us. Then it sort of grew into this huge machine in corporate Warner America world.'\n'Brad and Jen and Brad provide a sort of gravitational pull that allows us to really be attracted to material that isn't, quote unquote, studio, middle-of-the-road material,' says Hahn.\nNot the least of these is the first one set to shoot, a production of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp.\nThe earliest project Hahn and Aniston dreamt up, years ago (though it was never embarked on), was a memoir of sorts. 'Yeah,' says Aniston, 'As the Hill Turns. All the dramas that go on, and the incestuous relationships that went on among our friends. It was just like, well, Friends.'\n'A whole amalgamation of people just helping each other stay sane,' says Hahn.\n'And some of us succeeded at that,' adds Aniston. 'Others went crazy.'\nAnd those would be?\n'We don't name the names of the crazy people,' she says.\nWhen Brad Grey turned up on the set of Along Came Polly last winter, he was bringing words of encouragement to his female partner. Aniston had broken her toe on an ottoman while rushing for the phone at home. 'She and Ben Stiller are on a boat,' says Grey, who saw Aniston standing with her wounded, wrapped foot just below the camera's view, 'and they were basically flipping the thing around. I was nauseous just watching it.'\nThe scene takes place near the midpoint of the story, which was written by John Hamburg much in the vein of earlier scripts he'd worked on: 2000's Meet the Parents and 2001's Zoolander, both starring Stiller. This time Hamburg would direct his own screenplay. Hamburg, whose directorial debut was the darkly funny Safe Men, immediately knew his Polly co-stars had comic chemistry: 'This movie flip-flops between the two of them reacting to each other... When you work with Ben, you need to keep up with him. Not many people can, and she managed to, perfectly. And he managed to keep up with her.'\nStiller's obsessive-compulsive Reuben and Aniston's title character, an author of such volumes as The Boy With a Nub for an Arm, are old schoolmates who meet up as adults. 'Ben's character plans his entire life out the way that a lot of us do,' says Hamburg. 'We say, \"At this age I want this, I want to be married, I want to have kids at this age.\" The rug gets pulled out from under him [wife Debra Messing cheats on him with a St Bart's scuba instructor played by Hank Azaria] and Polly comes into his life. She's a big force of change in his life, and the role needed a really strong actress.'\nUniversal executive Mary Parent, who oversaw Polly, recalls the furore caused by Aniston doing a scene with Stiller in midtown Manhattan - a noisy pack of paparazzi was shouting to the actors even as they played an important early moment - 'because, you know, they want to see her. She's a bona fide movie star. I'll never forget, I walked into my office one day and there were a bunch of assistants looking out the window. I said, \"What's so exciting in my office?\"And they said, \"Jennifer Aniston is down there.\" You know, there are big movie stars on our lot every day, but I don't have a crowd of assistants in my office every day looking out the window.\n'She's got it all: the talent and the range. She's got comic timing like nobody's business. She's extraordinarily beautiful, but at the same time I think she's just as appealing to women as she is to men, and - how do I say this? - women don't punish her for the fact that men think she's hot.\n'Her character in The Good Girl was the antithesis of all that. And it wasn't like you had to take a minute to see her that way. She just was that character. I think that it says a lot about her ability as an actress to transcend an iconic part like Rachel. I think she's going to traverse the independent and the major studio worlds effortlessly.'\nFor Polly producer Stacey Sher, gutsiness is a trait Polly shares with the woman who plays her. 'She sort of has all of her technique in her back pocket and so what you get is a person who is fearless in their performance. Combine that with her extraordinary comedic timing... It's really fun to watch her and Ben together. She always wanted to make sure that she never fell into Rachel, because she was working two jobs, and she was vigilant about that, and in making sure that John Hamburg never let her get away with it.'\nAt one point in November 2002, Aniston was juggling three jobs - the next-to-last season of Friends, the last shooting days of Bruce Almighty and Polly. 'We just figured out all the permutations and made it work,' says Sher, 'and she was always so prepared that there was never a bleed-over of any character into any of the others.'\nWith Friends ending its 10-year run, Aniston should be able to concentrate on films. Though some of her fellow Friends have taken a thrashing for their excursions into film, she's transcended everything from Leprechaun ('Oh, we never discussed that? That's because we don't') to a second-fiddle role in Bruce Almighty ('That was a Jim Carrey movie,' she says equably).\nAniston discusses the warm critical reception she earnt playing a frustrated supermarket worker in The Good Girl with the pragmatism her years in the business have given her: 'I think it allowed me a little more time. It's like I said, I just want to be around for a while. I just don't want to fade away and wash up - because I didn't take chances, you know. I wanted to know. I was getting very comfortable in my comedy mode and I wanted to scare myself a little bit. And that was good, because I didn't know if I could pull it off. I thought I would be a laughing stock. And one of my greatest fears is being laughed at.'\nIf Aniston has many film execs and others in Hollywood high places touting her acting chops and her future, the comments about her more personal virtues add up to almost a din of steady praise. The extreme solicitude she shows in social or work settings seems to be generated from her own vulnerabilities. The rift that opened between her and her mother after Nancy Aniston discussed her in a TV interview and, later, in a memoir has seemed to abate in recent years and periods of estrangement from her dad, John - for more than two decades a soap opera star (most notably as the somewhat villainous Victor Kiriakis in Days of Our Lives) - are in the past.\nHer parents divorced when she was nine, but she spent parts of her fifth and sixth years in the area of Crete where her dad, born Anastassakis, is from. 'My dad decided he wasn't making it as an actor, so he went to go to medical school in Greece. We moved there, and stayed almost a year.'\nShe remembers their apartment in Athens and later living in Crete on 'a beautiful old farm with goats running around. And I remember going to a lot of ruins and loving just getting lost, going into all these little, like, nooks and openings that no one could fit in, but I could.'\nWhen her dad was cast in a soap opera in New York, they returned. John Aniston, perhaps not so surprisingly, discouraged his daughter's interest in acting. 'He never let me go to the set. I remember visiting once or twice. I wasn't allowed to watch TV till I was a teenager. I remember when I wanted to go to Performing Arts, the high school, and he just said, \"Don't. Don't do it, don't do it. Be a doctor, be a lawyer.\"'\nAniston's features are still but her eyes are more shielded than usual: 'I feel like I didn't have any choice. I don't - didn't have a lot of confidence in myself to do anything else but pretend. And act. And entertain. I like making people happy. It kind of works being a people-pleaser; it's the ultimate job, to get to work doing things that allow people to escape for a half hour or two hours or whatever and be entertained. It's so necessary, too, to have those moments, especially right now - this is a weird time.'\nA short while after this meeting, Aniston will reach a $550,000 settlement with an entrepreneur who allegedly sold photos of her sunbathing topless in her own back yard (earlier, she reached settlements with two magazines that published them). And although she's only intermittently political, there's one piece of legislation she'd like to see passed - an anti-paparazzi bill. 'I don't expect people to have sympathy for me. It's not even what I'm asking for. I'm just thinking, how can we do something about it? There's no protection. You don't know how crazy these people are.'\nShe grows a bit flinty recalling the days when she and Stiller were driven nuts by mobbing photographers: 'Like weird vultures, just the bottom of the food chain.' Almost worse, the Beverly Hills mansion she and Pitt moved into in July is a regular stop for gawkers, who stand in the street outside their property. 'It's embarrassing, wondering what our neighbours are thinking. It's a wall, it's a gate, what are you people looking at? Why are you ringing my doorbell all day long? And they put you in this star map thing, and these tour buses go around every hour. Then there's walking tours now that are, like, 20 people. It's like they're at a zoo.'\nAnd yet life in the zoo - she and Pitt were married on 29 July 2000, in what she calls a 'pretty normal, straight-arrow, beautiful ceremony' - is clearly sweet. As Pitt worked on the historical epic Troy, Aniston got away to visit him in Malta and in Cabo San Lucas. (The couple love Mexico; Aniston says the best use she's found for what she seems to regard as a nervous-making oversupply of money is flying friends down to Mexico and sharing a large villa for a few days.)\nThey found their house - a six-bedroom, $14m Normandy-style gem built by architect Wallace Neff in 1934 for two-time Oscar winner Fredric March - after an 18-month search. But the purchase was the easy part. Refurbishment was something of a trial. 'I love my house. Love it. It feels very symbolic to me - it was two years in the making, in the redoing of it. Something about creating a foundation with someone. It is a fascinating process and I really do believe it's such a test to a relationship that it's the same thing as the stories you hear about having babies. It is hard doing a house together. And if you make it through that, man, you can make it through anything. And I mean... luckily he was gone for five months of the time and I got to move in and do that. We really probably would have hung each other from trees.'\nIt has to be said on behalf of houses that they don't wake up crying at 4am. So, with six bedrooms and Friends wrapping up, perhaps it's time for the blessed event that's had an eager public and overeager press interested for a while now?\n'Yeah,' says Aniston, with a directness that's surprising for someone under such scrutiny. 'It's time. It's time. You know, I think you can work with a baby, I think you can work pregnant, I think you can do all of it. So I'm just truly looking forward to slowing down.'\nAniston declines to set a timetable for babymaking, but she co-operates in doing the maths for the couple's year: 'I'll have finished Friends by end of January, he'll be finishing [Mr and Mrs Smith, opposite Angelina Jolie] at the end of February. Then he starts Ocean's Twelve. So I, thankfully, will be able to go and travel with him while he's doing that.'\nAnd that Friends finale - what kind of summing up has she foreseen?\n'I'm going to miss the whole thing. You know, Danny DeVito just did our show, and he was saying, like, a year later it hits... The most consistent thing I've had in my entire life has been this television show and these people, and they're my heart and soul and I can't even imagine... It's just an amazing, beautiful thing that we got to have.'\nShe knows the day will come when she rolls up her Moroccan rugs and unplugs the fax machine in her dressing room. There will be travel, during shared breaks from films - 'I've never been to Ireland, I've never been to Italy. I want to go to Spain. Brad's never been to Greece, to meet some of my relatives over there.' The script beckoning most strongly to her is an untitled one by Ted Griffin, who wrote Ocean's Eleven and Matchstick Men.\n'I wouldn't call it a comedy or a drama; I think it's a little slice of life that has a little bit of everything. Life is funny. Life isn't categorised into drama, comedy, action, is it? So I don't know why they try to categorise everything. It drives me crazy - why it would have to be just a romantic comedy or... I want to have a little integrity, a little story, you know. That's why I don't like slapstick comedy. I don't like big, balls-out comedies.'\nWell, the trailer for Along Came Polly does show Polly gaping at Ben Stiller as he stands on the toilet with a plunger and water gushing out, and isn't there a crazed ferret in there somewhere?\n'The ferret,' says Aniston. 'Ooh, hated the ferret. Of course, I get a ferret of all things to have to hold and cuddle with. The trainer says, \"Look, you can switch it from hand to hand and just look how he's so docile, he's so docile.\" And then Ben gets him and it's just like...' Aniston mimes some rapid-fire biting motions with a crisp, gnashing sound. 'He did get a shot after that.\n'This movie makes me laugh. I think it's worth seeing,' says Aniston. 'I think it's going to be a great date movie.'\nAnd where will those daters head when they emerge?\n'They'll probably go to a restaurant they've never dared go into before, take a chance on Thai food. Or Ethiopian food, if they don't eat that. And maybe ask out that quirky person they've been thinking about but wasn't really their type. Because I don't know if we're always the best judge of what's right for us and what's good for us. Let's take some of the rules away. Living has so many rules. Ugh.'\nIt is mentioned to Aniston that a recent network show on 'keeping the love in your marriage' flashed a picture of her and her spouse on the screen.\n'Yeah, like we're the prototype.' She grins at the thought. 'We're all out there doing the best we can, you know. We're all doing the best we can. There's nothing different. That's all it is. Talking to each other. Being honest with each other and trusting each other. It's all you need.'\nThat, and a certain ingredient she prescribed for the Along Came Polly wrap party? Aniston nods emphatically. 'Don't stop having fun. That is important. Go out on dates, you know. Go be romantic and stupid together and just have fun. Don't lose the fun.'\n\u00b7 Along Came Polly is released this Friday."

      "text": "Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have been making headlines lately for how they've become \"breakup couple goals.\"\nThe actors, who split in 2005, ran into each other backstage at the 2020 Screen Actors Guild Awards in January and sent shockwaves through the Internet when they embraced.\nPitt, 56, won outstanding performance by a male actor in a supporting role in a motion picture for his role in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" and Aniston, 50, took home the statue for outstanding female in a drama series for \"The Morning Show.\"\nEXES JENNIFER ANISTON AND BRAD PITT REUNITE BACKSTAGE AT SAG AWARDS 2020\nAniston was caught laughing during Pitt's acceptance speech and then when she won he watched her backstage on a monitor, which sent hearts into a flutter on Twitter.\nWhen asked about his reaction to her win, Aniston admitted to Extra, \"That\u2019s so sweet. ... It\u2019s just, we\u2019ve all grown up together, we really have and it just feels like a really fun night to celebrate and, you know, cheer each other on and keep working.\u201d\nAt the 2020 Golden Globes, which both stars appeared at, Pitt told Entertainment Tonight, \"I'll run into Jen, she's a good friend. Yeah.\" He won best actor in a supporting role for \"OUATH\" and Aniston was snapped smiling as he made the following joke:\n\"I want to say hi to my folks, because hey! They're back in the Ozarks,\" Pitt said onstage. \"I wanted to bring my mom, but I couldn't, because anyone I stand next to, they say I'm dating. ... It would just be awkward.\"\nJENNIFER ANISTON LAUGHS OFF BRAD PITT'S GOLDEN GLOBES JOKE ABOUT HIS DATING LIFE\nThe couple was married from 2000 to 2005. Pitt moved on with actress Angelina Jolie after they fell for each other on the set of the movie \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith.\"\nAniston told Vanity Fair in 2006 that the alleged cheating scandal shocked her. \"The world was shocked, and I was shocked,\" she revealed. \"I can't say it was one of the highlights of my year. Who would deal with that and say, 'Isn't that sweet! That looks like fun!'? But sh*t happens. You joke and say, 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'\"\n\"I would be a robot if I said I didn't feel moments of anger, of hurt, of embarrassment,\" she added.\nAniston tried to rise above all the drama and never publicly bad-mouthed him. \"I'm not interested in taking public potshots,\" she explained. \"It's not my concern anymore. What happened to him after the separation -- it's his life now. I've made a conscious effort not to add to the toxicity of this situation. I haven't retaliated. I don't want to be a part of it. I don't have a halo that I'm polishing here; everyone has their personal thoughts. But I would much rather everyone move on.\"\nBRAD PITT CALLS JENNIFER ANISTON 'A GOOD FRIEND' AT GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS\nAniston went on marry actor Justin Theroux in 2015, but they announced they were separating in February 2018.\nPitt eventually married Jolie in 2014, but she filed for divorce from him in September 2016. Their split was followed by intense drama surrounding a custody battle over their six kids -- Maddox, 18, Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 13, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 11.\nThe \"Fight Club\" actor also got sober after the split. Pitt told the New York Times in September that he started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings after having \u201ctaken things as far as I could take\u201d them -- \u201cI removed my drinking privilege.\"\nBRAD PITT JOINED ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS AFTER ANGELINA JOLIE SPLIT: 'I REMOVED MY DRINKING PRIVILEGES'\nHe admitted to GQ in 2017, \"Truthfully I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional. I was good.\u201d\nNow at calmer points in their lives, Aniston and Pitt have become friends. He even went to her 50th birthday party in February 2019 at the Sunset Tower Hotel in Los Angeles, Calif. and also reportedly attended her star-studded holiday party in December at her Bel-Air home."

He grew up in Springfield, Missouri and went to the University of Missouri where he was just short of graduating before he packed up and moved to California to pursue acting.\nPitt got the ball rolling on his acting career by acting in a few different soap operas, \u201cAnother World\u201d and \u201cDallas.\u201d He spent time guest appearing on shows before he landed a role in \u201cThelma & Louise\u201d in 1991, where he played a cowboy.\nThings started to take off for Pitt after that and he grew to be one of the most well-known actors in Hollywood. Over the years, he has been in \u201cA River Runs Through It,\u201d \u201cInterview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles,\u201d and \u201cLegends of the Fall.\u201d\nIn 1995, the movie \u201c12 Monkeys\u201d came out which earned Pitt his first Golden Globe win.

      "text": "To get to Jennifer Aniston\u2019s sanctuary, you climb up, up, up, into the hills of Los Angeles. Past mansions shielded by millions of dollars in manicured privacy hedges. Past the gate an alleged stalker crashed into in May, which is now being surveilled by a police cruiser and a private 24/7 detail. Past the security guard handing out NDAs to visitors, aside from this journalist. And through the towering front doors of her $21 million home.\nThe world is a burning hellscape, a fact explored through fictional reporters trying to chase it down in Aniston\u2019s Apple TV+ series, The Morning Show. But the actor has learned in her many years of stardom, and all its attendant bumps, how to block out the noise and calm the nervous system. Or how to try, at least.\nThis midcentury home, designed by A. Quincy Jones and Frederick Emmons, is an oasis. There are soft cream couches, white peonies, and white taper candles accenting the living room. One wall is nothing but a panoramic window overlooking Los Angeles, with a view stretching from Downtown to the Pacific. There are no screens or ambient sound. Whether it is this blanket of silence or the accoutrements on her coffee table\u2014a raw amethyst (known for spiritual growth or inner peace), a white crystal (purity, clarity), an incense holder decorated with crows (knowledge, transformation) amid design books\u2014her home has the anxiety-suppressing effect of a spa.\nAnd Aniston looks like she lives in one. The exquisitely maintained 56-year-old is a monument to self-care. Her long hair is down and her eyes are bright blue. She wears a version of the outfit she\u2019s been wearing for years in the millions of paparazzi photos we\u2019ve all seen: a slim-fitting long-sleeve black shirt, low-slung Rag & Bone blue jeans, black flip-flops, and jade bracelets (good fortune). When I say how calm I feel a few minutes into my visit, she reacts with warmth: \u201cGood! That\u2019s the whole point.\u201d She gestures outside: \u201cOut there, it causes nerves. In here,\u201d she says, motioning around her, \u201cthere should be no nerves.\u201d\nThirty-one years ago Aniston first endeared herself to us as runaway bride\u2013slash\u2013coffeehouse server Rachel Green in Friends. Her easy charm and comedic delivery were just as magnetic on movie screens\u2014Bruce Almighty (2003) and Along Came Polly (2004). And she proved her dramatic depth in The Good Girl (2002) and Cake (2014). But it is The Morning Show, which she executive-produces and stars in, alongside her Friends sister (and real friend) Reese Witherspoon, that is her most fascinating showcase.\nOn it, Aniston channels Alex Levy, a morning news anchor making the boldest leaps and power grabs of her career in her 50s. This woman is so famous that her personal life makes headlines and her private heartbreak is plastered across multiple mediums for strangers\u2019 entertainment.\nAfter one public humiliation too many in The Morning Show\u2019s second season, Levy says, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize\u2026that the thing people would find most entertaining is not even the thing that\u2026I have risen to the highest levels of. I didn\u2019t realize that the most entertaining thing about me would be just batting me around like a freaking pi\u00f1ata while digging around asking questions about my sex life.\u201d\nLevy and Aniston alike have emerged from the era of Hollywood when there could be only one female star in the room: The Morning Show depicts how Levy embraces her younger coanchor; Witherspoon and Aniston are, as stars, coequals. Diane Sawyer, who inspired Aniston\u2019s performance, loves that the women have shared center stage, onscreen and off. \u201cAn alliance of women who have great energy and resilience is a wonderful thing,\u201d Sawyer tells me.\nIn 2004, Sawyer was the TV host asking Aniston hard-hitting questions about some of the most vulnerable areas of her life. About how her soap opera actor father, John, left her mother, Nancy, an actor and model, so suddenly that her mom broke the news to Aniston when she got home from a birthday party. \u201cIt was pretty quick,\u201d Aniston laughs to Sawyer on ABC\u2019s Primetime Thursday broadcast, making light of the heartbreak. About her mother\u2019s criticisms of Aniston as a child\u2014that her nose was too big and her eyes too close together. Aniston explains from her perspective: \u201chelpful beauty tips.\u201d About how many kids she and her then husband, Brad Pitt, wanted to have. \u201cWe\u2019d definitely love to have two, at least,\u201d Aniston answers.\nWhile Levy has developed a self-protective steeliness after her decades in the public eye, Aniston hasn\u2019t\u2014not even after nearly four decades, two divorces, approximately two thousand tabloid covers, and years of overly personal questions from strangers.\n\u201cI think her superpower is that she could very easily be hard, but she\u2019s incredibly open,\u201d says Sandra Bullock, a close friend. \u201cPeople want to know about her and understand where she is in life and want her to be happy.\u201d\nFame was never Aniston\u2019s goal\u2014and it still knocks her sideways sometimes. (She views paparazzi when she\u2019s working as \u201calmost an embarrassment, to be honest.\u201d) Growing up, she recalls, people looked to actors like Shirley MacLaine and Mary Tyler Moore not because they were gorgeous and on magazine covers, but because they had made movies and television that moved them. Aniston\u2019s celebrity, as gravity-pulling as it can be, has never defined her: \u201cI\u2019ve always been more into metaphysical things and \u2018What if there\u2019s something bigger out there than all of us?\u2019 \u201d She\u2019s learned not to put everything at the altar of fame. \u201cIt\u2019s not real,\u201d she tells me. \u201cMy interests are other than that.\u201d During her 20s, she began joining women\u2019s circles with her female friends. She says, \u201cThat opened me up to the importance of women in each other\u2019s lives and how important it is to support and hold each other up when so many want to tear each other down.\u201d\nAbout 15 years ago, Aniston and Bullock were attending a mutual friend\u2019s wedding when they locked eyes across the aisle. (Bullock doesn\u2019t know why they were sitting on separate sides, given they were both friends of the groom, but it is her memory and a better visual.) They spent the night trading shots and notes. \u201cWe were just like, \u2018Oh my God, we need to meet and cut loose,\u2019 \u201d says Bullock. \u201cAnd we did.\u201d The hangover, Bullock notes, was epic. Aniston recalls, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was sending her, but it was definitely stronger than what she was sending me.\u201d\nTheir rapport was so easy that they wondered why they hadn\u2019t spent time together before. They both love interior design, dated the actor Tate Donovan, and appreciate a practical joke: Bullock later crashed a junket interview to surprise her with tequila and limes. They shared something else too: \u201cWe were from that time in the business where no one wanted the ladies to be friends\u2014it was about pitting everyone against each other,\u201d Bullock says. \u201cWe were told we weren\u2019t supposed to do that\u2014meaning like and respect and honor each other.\u201d\nAniston has brought Bullock into her inner circle\u2014inviting her to holiday get-togethers, on spring break trips, to numerology readings. \u201cYou write down your birth date and, whether you believe in it or not, we\u2019re all scribbling down our thoughts and in it together,\u201d says Bullock. \u201cNothing is for her alone ever. Everything she does is for everyone else included.\u201d\nGwyneth Paltrow is another close friend, whom Aniston met decades ago when her Friends costar David Schwimmer was filming The Pallbearer. Their love interests overlapped off-screen as well as on. While discussing the genesis of her and Paltrow\u2019s relationship, Aniston says, \u201cIronically, I went to her and Brad\u2019s engagement party,\u201d meaning Pitt, the man who proposed to them both. Aniston and Paltrow\u2019s friendship outlasted both women\u2019s Pitt chapters, but I can\u2019t help but ask, do they ever talk about Pitt?\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Aniston says, waving her hand and sounding everything like Rachel Green. \u201cHow can we not? We\u2019re girls.\u201d But they trade wellness intel more than gossip. \u201cWe\u2019re always swapping advice\u2014\u2018What are you doing for this? What are you doing for that? Do you have a new doctor for that?\u2019 \u201d\nJason Bateman, whom Aniston met when he was starring with her friend on a \u201990s sitcom, is also an Aniston intimate. He\u2019s part of the chosen family, Aniston says. \u201cSometimes you look back at the person you were in your 20s, and you don\u2019t recognize that person or those people around you\u2026. But we\u2019ve grown up together.\u201d Adam Sandler is another \u201clifer\u201d whom Aniston met in her early 20s, through a mutual friend. \u201cAnything that happens in my life that he hears about, he\u2019s one of the first people that I hear from. He would lay down on the tracks for me.\u201d Aniston has gravitated back to both men onscreen\u2014with Bateman on five films, including Horrible Bosses, and with Sandler on both Murder Mystery movies for Netflix. \u201cAs we\u2019re getting older, I think we\u2019re realizing that quality of time spent is probably at the top of the what\u2019s-important list for us.\u201d\nEvery Sunday, Aniston gathers 10 to 15 people for dinner, often including Bateman; his wife, Amanda Anka (who is also close to Aniston); their daughters; and Jimmy Kimmel and his wife, Molly McNearney. Everyone sits at the same seat, with Aniston at the head. Bateman said that the group had to gently coax Aniston, a lover of Mexican cuisine, to broaden her menus. \u201cShe stumbled upon a burger that is almost identical to the In-N-Out burger,\u201d says Bateman, referring to the California chain. \u201cShe actually found some company to print up a bunch of the papers that are wrapped around the burgers with \u2018Jen-N-Out\u2019 on it. It looks exactly like the logo. You can either have the beef or chicken, the lettuce or a bun around it. Then usually one of us will bring dessert.\u201d\nAniston\u2019s in tune with her friends\u2019 kids too. \u201cShe almost makes us parents look bad because she\u2019s so incredibly attentive and consistent with her curiosity and warmth,\u201d says Bateman, referring to Aniston\u2019s relationship with Francesca, 18, and Maple, 13. \u201cShe\u2019s the first one to call or text about big dates in the girls\u2019 lives. She has questions about boyfriends.\u201d Asked if she\u2019d qualify as an aunt, Bateman says, \u201cAunts you might not see all the time. She\u2019s almost closer to a co-mom with Amanda. She\u2019s been a part of their lives from the moment they were born.\u201d He adds, \u201cIt is odd for them to even understand the public Jennifer Aniston.\u201d\nFrancesca has also been the lucky recipient of some of Aniston\u2019s wardrobe: Now when the families go on vacation, she says she\u2019ll realize Francesca is in one of her hand-me-downs. \u201cWell, there\u2019s my bikini. Your child is now wearing my bikinis. Whoa. We\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d\nThis is not the first time Aniston has allowed Vanity Fair into her inner sanctum. Twenty years ago, ahead of the release of her sexy Clive Owen collaboration, Derailed, she invited Leslie Bennetts into her Malibu beach house. It happened to be for Aniston\u2019s first interview following her split from Pitt. The 2005 story, \u201cThe Unsinkable Jennifer Aniston,\u201d featured an eat-your-heart-out photo shoot: She reclined in a white men\u2019s button-down, black panties, and thigh-highs.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t looked at that article in forever. I just remember the experience of doing it\u2014which was kind of jarring. It was also such a vulnerable time. But yeah, that was one for the memoirs.\u201d (She\u2019ll write a memoir, she says, \u201cwhen I have more to memoir.\u201d) \u201cJournalism back then felt more like a form of a sport,\u201d she continues. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously some PTSD we all have, which is why these scare me\u201d\u2014she means interviews\u2014\u201cHow are they going to misinterpret my words or take something out of context? And one line nowadays\u2026\u201d\nThough Aniston\u2019s positivity and resilience are threaded through the old Vanity Fair piece, her candid statements about her breakup\u2014and Pitt\u2019s relationship with Angelina Jolie\u2014made tabloid tidal waves and arguably launched the celebrity-gossip corner of the internet. Snarky blogs like Dlisted and Perez Hilton made a meal out of it all. Aniston calls that era of her tabloid life \u201cthe love triangle\u201d and details her survival approach: \u201cJust pick yourself up by the bootstraps and keep on walking, girl.\u201d\n\u201cIt was such juicy reading for people. If they didn\u2019t have their soap operas, they had their tabloids.\u201d Of the media frenzy, Aniston says, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that it had to happen, but it happened. And boy did I take it personally.\u201d\n\u201cThey were sort of building us up and then tearing you down,\u201d she says before comparing herself to a pi\u00f1ata. Almost immediately she recognizes the line as one of her own\u2014Alex Levy deriding an invasion of privacy. Aniston puts her hands over her eyes monkey-emoji-style and asks, \u201cOh God, did I just quote The Morning Show?\u201d And then gets back on track: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a strong enough constitution to not get affected by it. We\u2019re human beings, even though some people don\u2019t want to believe we are,\u201d she says. \u201cThey think, You signed up for it, so you take it. But we really didn\u2019t sign up for that.\u201d\nSince the media crucible of her 2005 divorce, Aniston has developed an extrasensory awareness of any conversation subject that is adjacent to SEO clickbait territory. Alex Levy makes a power grab in season four, so I ask Aniston to tell me about a business negotiation that was a turning point for her. She tries to describe a professional moment without giving away any identifying intel. \u201cSorry to be cagey,\u201d she says. \u201cWe asked for something that was very reasonable based on what we would be bringing to the table. It allowed me to really understand the power of no. That was also in the day when [pay] equality was still a struggle.\u201d There are two women in the entertainment realm whose names she asks me to keep out of this piece after they come up. Considering The Morning Show\u2019s coverage of recent real-life political news, I ask about Donald Trump\u2013related storylines. Witherspoon\u2019s journalist character reports on the storming of the Capitol in season three, and season four begins in 2024, as Trump mounts his return to office. As such, he plays a role in the new episodes. \u201cMaking a TV show about political coverage in a deeply divisive time can be tricky,\u201d Aniston says diplomatically. \u201cYou want to appeal to all audiences.\u201d When I note that her character\u2019s love interest, a billionaire played by Jon Hamm, seems reminiscent of Elon Musk\u2014they\u2019re both daredevil rocket builders\u2014she swats away the comparison, in part because \u201cI don\u2019t find him desirable in any way or shape.\u201d\nThere are points in our conversation when Aniston seems to be less cautious about choosing her words. Like when I begin speaking her love language\u2014interior design\u2014and ask about the pair of men\u2019s hands sculpted in bronze on either side of her fireplace. \u201cWhen people are like, \u2018Are you an ass man? Are you a leg girl?\u2019 I like hands,\u201d she says, noting that she found the andirons in one of her favorite design stores, Blackman Cruz. \u201cHands are everything. My father had the most beautiful hands.\u201d These pieces were the first big purchase for the first home she decorated by herself, for herself.\nThe \u201990s are having a bit of a revival, but Aniston is surprised to hear that her Rachel Green wardrobe has been christened a nostalgic fashion ideal by Vogue, WWD, and many a Gen Z\u2019er. In 2019, Ralph Lauren released a tribute Friends collection inspired by Rachel, who worked for the designer according to canon. Hailey Bieber even seems to have emerged from Rachel\u2019s closet most days\u2014wearing plaid skirts, denim overalls, and loafers\u2014and even channeled the style of the Friends character for Halloween in 2023.\n\u201cI celebrate the \u201990s coming back. Except for those narrow sunglasses and the really thin eyebrows,\u201d says Aniston. \u201cI love vintage clothes from the decade. They fit me so well.\u201d\nRachel Green is reverberating through the culture for another reason: She, along with Carrie Bradshaw, is an obvious influence on the \u201cWest Village Girl,\u201d the archetype that Brock Colyar took viral in New York magazine: a young woman enjoying life in Manhattan\u2019s gougingly expensive, maximally Instagrammable neighborhood.\nRachel was from a rich family. But Aniston makes a point of noting in our conversation that she was not. Her father did not find steady onscreen success until the \u201980s. At times he couldn\u2019t pay the mortgage without help, according to the 1999 memoir by Aniston\u2019s mother. While discussing her good fortune, Aniston says, \u201cListen, I am so grateful. I came from nothing. We were broke. There\u2019s no nepo baby here.\u201d\nGrowing up in New York, Aniston lived with her mom in a modest Upper West Side apartment\u2014and eventually attended the LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, the public school of Fame fame. Her escape hatch from the household\u2019s postdivorce gloom were Laverne & Shirley, Happy Days, and One Day at a Time. Because she didn\u2019t have a VCR, Aniston recorded audio from her beloved shows and listened to episodes again and again on her Radio Shack tape player, learning the shows by heart. \u201cI was going to be Laverne or Shirley,\u201d she says. She partly manifested her future as a sitcom star\u2014Bullock refers to her as \u201cthe manifester\u201d\u2014and to some degree hoped her acting success would impress her father. \u201cAlways wanting to get Pop\u2019s approval\u2014it was the thing that drove me and was also my biggest heartbreak: trying to impress and prove your value to a man who\u2019s only capable of so much,\u201d Aniston says. She felt that if she made it as an actor, \u201cthen he will love me as much as I love him.\u201d Before he died in 2022, Aniston says that her dad expressed his pride in her: \u201cWe had a few of those moments.\u201d\nWith Friends, she did for others what Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams had done for her. While Aniston always knew Friends was a miracle of casting and cosmic kismet, she didn\u2019t realize the personal impact the show had until 2021\u2019s Friends reunion. During one segment, international fans relayed how they learned English by watching the show or found relief from dark personal times with it. Of acting, Aniston says, \u201cWhat helped raise me is something I got to put into the world and help other people. If [Friends] was the only thing on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, I would be very happy and blessed.\u201d\nThe reunion was also a final curtain call for the cast of six. In 2023 Aniston\u2019s costar Matthew Perry was found dead from \u201cthe acute effects\u201d of ketamine, with drowning a contributing factor. \u201cWe did everything we could when we could,\u201d Aniston says of trying to help the actor during his long struggle with addiction\u2014Perry described his friends\u2019 efforts in his memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing. \u201cBut it almost felt like we\u2019d been mourning Matthew for a long time because his battle with that disease was a really hard one for him to fight. As hard as it was for all of us and for the fans, there\u2019s a part of me that thinks this is better,\u201d Aniston says, looking solemn and out toward the ocean. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s out of that pain.\u201d\nSince Aniston\u2019s amicable split from actor Justin Theroux in 2018, she has not been publicly linked to any legitimate love interests. When I ask Bateman if he\u2019s ever set Aniston up on a date\u2014he can\u2019t recall that he has\u2014he says, \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to me that she\u2019s not some serial dater, not because she\u2019s overly picky or snobby. You don\u2019t need to be some superhero to grab her attention. If you are comfortable in your skin, she gravitates to you. The challenge is for a guy to see past her fame and charisma and presence and beauty\u2014to not be distracted by that\u2014and tune into the stuff at the deep core.\u201d\nTabloid fanfic has recently linked her to Pedro Pascal after he and Aniston were photographed outside a West Hollywood restaurant, and to Barack Obama, after\u2026no one is quite sure. Some version of the rumor\u2014that the Friends star was dating the former president\u2014spread so prolifically that Aniston appeared on Kimmel\u2019s late-night show to formally shut it down. \u201cOf all the calls you get from your publicist\u2026and then it\u2019s that,\u201d Aniston said as Kimmel showed the cover of In Touch with the line \u201cThe Truth About Jen & Barack!\u201d (The magazine stopped short of claiming a romance.) Aniston says she knows Michelle Obama better than she does the former president and even saw her somewhat recently. \u201cI was lucky enough to have dinner with Michelle a month ago,\u201d she says, declining to share any additional detail aside from the fact that the rumor \u201cwasn\u2019t even brought up\u201d during their time together. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really pays attention to reports like that if you\u2019re the subject of them.\u201d\nBullock says she and Aniston have hypothesized about some of the crazier reports. \u201cWe try to figure out the genesis of where some of these stories come from\u2026but 75 percent of the time, we just cannot. They\u2019re literally pulled out of the ether.\u201d Bullock understands the world\u2019s perpetual interest in Aniston\u2019s love life, though: \u201cShe\u2019s so beloved that you go, \u2018I want that person to have their person\u2019 even if that person doesn\u2019t want a person.\u201d\nSeveral weeks after we\u2019d last spoken, Aniston is linked in the tabloids to a new love interest\u2014this time, it\u2019s a handsome wellness guru and hypnotherapist named Jim Curtis. The two vacationed over the summer on Mallorca and in Big Sur, according to the reports\u2014in April, Aniston told Travel + Leisure that she had tried hypnosis to help overcome her fear of flying. Aniston\u2019s rep declined to comment on the rumor to VF, but the Morning Show star follows Curtis on social media and has liked his posts. In May, Aniston posted a picture of his book Shift: Quantum Manifestation Guide: A Workbook for Coding a New Consciousness. During our first conversation Aniston had told me, \u201cI have a real struggle, truthfully, about what to and not to share\u2026and also, social media is a constant struggle for me.\u201d It isn\u2019t that surprising she wouldn\u2019t want to go there: Within days after the first paparazzi photos are published (the Mallorca trip included Bateman and Anka), Curtis\u2019s name is linked with Aniston\u2019s in thousands of web stories.\nThis May, while Aniston was home, a 48-year-old man from Mississippi allegedly rammed his car into her gate. The accused stalker, whom prosecutors say had been flooding Aniston with emails, voicemails, and social media messages, was reportedly apprehended by Aniston\u2019s security until police arrived. (He has pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and felony vandalism but at press time was not standing trial; a judge found him mentally incompetent.) This is another subject that Aniston doesn\u2019t really want to discuss: \u201cPeople are out of their minds. Who wants to put that energy out there.\u201d Her security team, says Aniston, is \u201cnot glamorous in any way. It\u2019s a necessity.\u201d\nBullock says she and Aniston have talked about these concerns; Bullock had her own frightening experience in 2014 when a mentally ill stalker broke into her home while she was there.\nSometimes, Bullock says, \u201cIt makes me think, Do I really have to go outside and navigate the world? There\u2019s the cases where they got into the house, the cases where they\u2019re outside the house, the cases where you\u2019re on a film set and they figured out where you are, and the cases that no one hears about. It\u2019s ongoing. It\u2019s not a one-off. And it does create a mindset where your home also unfortunately becomes your fortress.\u201d\nBullock says she and Aniston push each other out of their houses: \u201cThere\u2019s a motivation of going, \u2018Okay, we need to go somewhere. Where are we going?\u2019 \u201d Says Aniston, \u201cI\u2019m desperately trying not to Howard Hughes myself.\u201d\nFor a while Bullock and Aniston shared a fear of flying. \u201cThe two of us on a plane\u2014it\u2019s the most pathetic thing to look at,\u201d Bullock says. \u201cUsually it\u2019s us grabbing each other\u2019s arms from across the table with our heads down.\u201d\nBut two spring breaks ago, when Bullock was \u201cnot in a great place,\u201d Aniston summoned strength for her friend. \u201cShe just held onto my hand and goes, \u2018This is just a bump\u2019 \u201d\u2014and talked her through the flight. \u201cI was like, \u2018Who the fuck are you right now?\u2019 \u201d\nAniston says she can still feel afraid of flying\u2014the hypnotherapy was to help curb it, as were the calm apps she tried. But sometimes when her friends are really scared, \u201cAll of a sudden, my fear falls away and I get to take care of them. When there\u2019s someone in need of being calmed, I have such empathy for it that all of a sudden my fear goes out the window.\u201d\nAt 56, Aniston has elegantly navigated all kinds of turbulence. She is now trying to slow down her fast-paced work schedule to live more life. Aside from The Morning Show, Aniston is producing a 9 to 5 remake scripted by Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody that will explore generational issues. (Aniston was slated to join the cast at one point but currently won\u2019t be; offers are out to other actors.) She will also costar as the narcissistic mother in a series inspired by Jennette McCurdy\u2019s best-selling book, I\u2019m Glad My Mom Died, which chronicles McCurdy\u2019s journey as a child star and her complicated relationship with her mother, and which resonated with Aniston. And she still fosters a dream of appearing on Broadway: \u201cGrowing up in New York City and seeing Annie, you just get swept into a fantasy world. I want to do that.\u201d\nShe approaches her career much differently now. \u201cAs a young actor, you can forget that you are the one who\u2019s earning income for the people around you,\u201d she says, crediting her manager Aleen Keshishian with helping her assert herself. \u201cShe would say, \u2018You\u2019re the boss. You pay us. Don\u2019t lose sight of your power in that. Don\u2019t become an asshole or bitch, but don\u2019t lose your voice.\u2019 \u201d Aniston adds, \u201cIf there\u2019s an area in my life where I have no fear, it\u2019s in my career\u2014of speaking up for what I want. I don\u2019t do it in a scary or mean way. I just know my value.\u201d\nThough Alex Levy thrives on adrenaline in the newsroom, Aniston has had to take a step back from the 24/7 panic cycles of real-world news. \u201cI could feel my anxiety and cortisol levels reaching a height that was not working. We weren\u2019t designed as human beings to digest this much information from all over the world in the split second when it happens. I\u2019d rather keep a somewhat naive perspective than be in fear and negativity and rage and anger.\u201d She tries to block out cynicism and ego. Even though she\u2019s been a public figure for at least 35 years, the awareness of who she is \u201cstill hits me sideways sometimes.\u201d Aniston prefers to look at that discomfort with fame as a good thing, presumably because it means she isn\u2019t grounded in it. \u201cYou have to manage it and put it in its proper place and into its proper size. Because otherwise, if you don\u2019t\u2026I\u2019ve gone through many\u2026.\u201d She takes a split-second pause before deciding to keep the specifics to herself. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure it out.\u201d\nA follow-up phone call with Aniston ends when her Pvolve trainer knocks on the door for another workout session. As we say goodbye, I tell the actor that I\u2019m not a crystal person but I\u2019m going to try amethyst to see if it has the same calming effect on me.\n\u201cIf my home can bring your nervous system into the parasympathetic nervous system, then I should open up a business. Because God knows we need that at this time.\u201d For now, though, the familiar star offers a recommendation with warmth and well-wishes.\n\u201cI think you should get some rose quartz\u201d\u2014unconditional love\u2014\u201cand amethyst. And also for this year, the year of the snake\u2014now this is where I start to sound like a crazy person\u2014white jade.\u201d For grounding.\nThen she tosses off one more self-deprecatory line in wry, easy, Aniston fashion: \u201cI\u2019ve basically incorporated all of the healing modalities in order to create a calm environment in the chaos of the wonderful industry and the world at large.\u201d\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\nWeapons Ending Explained\nCan And Just Like That\u2026 Actually Stick the Landing This Time?\nThe Real Problem With Sydney Sweeney\u2019s American Eagle Ad\nThe Heartbreaking Love Story of Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson\nInside the Celebrity Boat Trip That Was All Over Your Feeds\nInside King Charles\u2019s Lesser-Known Castle\nThe Hidden Case of the Transgender Baronet\nFrom the Archive: Dating Jeffrey Epstein"

      "text": "A seeming fairy-tale romance involving America's sweetheart came to an end in 2005. Then, she quickly became the target of tabloids in a nightmare pursuit.\nJennifer Aniston\u2019s journey from sitcom darling to A-list star and how her love life became a favorite for gossip hounds to publicly dissect is the subject of a new book, \"Toxic: Women, Fame, and the Tabloid 2000s.\"\nIt tells the story of nine women who \"defied the hell of celebrity\" and how they were \"devoured by fame.\"\n\"This kind of portrayal of her [as] a desperately baby-hungry woman. It doesn\u2019t really stand up to scrutiny,\" author Sarah Ditum told Fox News Digital. \"The tabloid version of her was exaggerated and gussied up basically so everybody could feel their feelings about what women were deciding to do with their lives in general.\"\n\"She became the sort of stand-in for that whole debate,\" Ditum added.\nA spokesperson for Aniston told Fox News Digital, \"We have not read Ms. Ditum\u2019s book and have no comment to offer.\"\nThe \"Friends\" star catapulted to a new level of fame when she married actor Brad Pitt in 2000. They were quickly crowned Hollywood\u2019s golden couple before scandal plagued their split.\nIn 2003, Pitt crossed paths with Angelina Jolie while filming their spy thriller \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" in which they played married assassins. At the time, Jolie had recently separated from her ex-husband, Billy Bob Thorton. It wouldn\u2019t be until 2005 when Pitt and Aniston announced their separation after seven years together. Their divorce was finalized that year.\nPitt and Jolie, known as \"Brangelina,\" were together 12 years. The pair adopted children from Cambodia, Vietnam and Ethiopia and formed the Jolie-Pitt Foundation in 2006. They married privately in 2014 at their French ch\u00e2teau. But the union ultimately broke down, and Jolie filed for divorce in 2016.\nAniston went on to marry actor/writer Justin Theroux in 2015. In 2017, the couple announced they had separated after nearly three years of marriage, calling their decision a \"mutual and lovingly made\" one. They\u2019ve not only remained supportive of each other over the years, they\u2019re known for staying in touch.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\nUnlike Pitt, Aniston has been scrutinized by the press, Ditum argued. She pointed out that, over the years, the 54-year-old has been unfairly questioned about motherhood and was even the subject of \"bump watch.\" That scrutiny began after Aniston and Pitt called it quits, said Ditum.\nIn 2022, Aniston admitted to Allure that while she was the subject of painful speculation over the years, she struggled to get pregnant.\n\"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it,\" Aniston told the outlet. \"I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So, here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\"The narrative that I was just selfish,\" she shared. \"God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child. And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn't give him a kid. It was absolute lies. I don't have anything to hide at this point.\"\nDitum described the scrutiny Aniston endured as \"absolutely brutal.\"\n\"I found it really painful going back over and reading some of the interviews and seeing how aggressively people pursued her about whether she was having children or not,\" Ditum explained. \"It\u2019s like the nightmare scenario of being at a family Christmas dinner and your relatives keep asking you when you\u2019re going to have kids. Only it\u2019s happened to you in the mass media every time you go out to have an interview.\n\u2018It was quite difficult to read that and see it from her perspective,\" Ditum added. \"And it\u2019s for two reasons. No. 1, it\u2019s because she\u2019s a woman, and there has always been more focus on women and their fertility than there is on men and their fertility.\n\"But, also, because of the \u2026 global fandom investment in her and Brad Pitt\u2019s relationship and this expectation that they were going to go from being the golden couple to being the golden family. People wanted that for her, and when it didn\u2019t happen, they were damn well going to ask her questions about why it didn\u2019t happen, which was very unpleasant for her.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nUnlike some of the other celebs Ditum studied, she noted that Aniston has persevered over the years.\n\"One of the things that I thought about a lot while I was writing this book was about the different ways that people can deal with celebrity,\" said Ditum. \"There are some people who get consumed by that image.\n\"Jennifer Aniston \u2026 she\u2019s interested in acting, in comedy more than she\u2019s interested in being a celebrity, I think. So, she doesn\u2019t do a lot of the \u2018celebrity\u2019 stuff. She always says that she\u2019s kind of baffled by social media and doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would be on it.\"\n\"One of the things that\u2019s \u2026 protected her is that she\u2019s always had a bit of reserve and distance between Jennifer Aniston herself, the person, and Jennifer Aniston, the character that was being invented and knocked around in the press. It surprised me how much dignity she\u2019s managed to maintain.\n\"While she was dealing with incredibly intrusive questions, it surprised me that she didn\u2019t necessarily avoid the implications of fertility and relationships in the movie choices she was making. And partly that\u2019s because if you\u2019re a woman in Hollywood, you are going to get offered romantic roles. You\u2019re going to get the wife, the girlfriend, whatever.\n\"But looking over the stuff she did, there were some [projects} she chose to do that put, front and center, the idea of wanting a family and those things,\" Ditum continued. \"But I think that\u2019s just a function of what roles you are offered. And you can see there\u2019s just a dearth of good roles for someone who comes out of network television in that era. And it\u2019s only when you get to the streaming explosion that you suddenly have good roles for women on TV again.\"\nDitum said that while the press previously depicted Aniston as \"eternally broody and a bit tragic,\" or \"Sad Jen,\" the actress has proven she\u2019s anything but.\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\"She\u2019s not spending her life mooning over her ex,\" said Ditum. \"She had a series of relationships with incredibly attractive, talented men. She\u2019s had a successful career in comedy and is now obviously at the peak of her game.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
