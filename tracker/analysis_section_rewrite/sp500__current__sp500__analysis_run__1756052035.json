      "feedback": "Strong draft overall, but to reach world‑class level you should: 1) shift to a explicit 0–3 week, three‑scenario framework (base/base‑case, upside/bull case, downside/bear case) with clearly stated triggers and explicit invalidation points (e.g., Beasley signs for a non‑Pistons MLE above $7.2M or Beasley’s probe status shifts from “not a target” to “charged/charged risk”; Shopify GMV/revenue miss vs. beat; Moscow risk‑off escalation) and show how each would reprice the two core tickers. 2) tighten the causal chain and anchor every near‑term driver in the sources: Shopify’s Q2 print (GMV up 27% YoY, revenue up 29% YoY) drives near‑term upside but is tempered by an extreme multiple (P/E ~70, P/S ~18); Moscow gas‑cylinder blast (energy/security risk premia, potential flight‑to‑safety) provides a parallel risk signal; Malik Beasley’s status and cap dynamics (Pistons’ non‑taxpayer MLE lock at $7.2M, Nets/Wizards/Kings/Bulls with full MLE or cap space; cap framework around a 2025–26 cap near $154.6M; Early Bird rights if Beasley stays) anchor the likely 0–3 week bid/offer dynamics; cite these explicitly as (QGXA2WQJ3), (NBX9RA9WX), and (XB5ZRN1VP). 3) embed concrete catalysts and invalidation points with numeric or rule‑based thresholds: track Shopify GMV/revenue trajectory and next earnings print; monitor Beasley’s status and cap‑space movements (especially if Nets/Wizards reopen talks or Detroit loses Early Bird leverage); watch cap‑space signals and in‑season trade exceptions that could drive bids above ~$7.2M; and monitor Moscow headlines for a clear risk‑off response. 4) enrich the monitoring checklist with crisp, source‑backed levels, such as “Beasley re‑signing at or above $7.2M triggers Pistons’ cap rigidity and a likely bid pivot by Nets/Wizards,” or “GMV growth accelerates beyond 30% QoQ or misses by >5–7% alters Shopify’s multiple‑re‑rating risk.” 5) improve reconciliation of conflicts by explicitly stating where the bull case rests (growth cadence, AI/No‑code ecosystem) versus the bear case (high multiples, macro/geopolitical risk, potential clone‑like competition). 6) elevate the quantification density: keep the exact figures (GMV 27%, Rev 29%, P/E ~70, P/S ~18, cap framework around $154.6M; Beasley’s $7.2M non‑Bird cap) and attach them to the corresponding catalysts, triggers, and invalidations with precise parentheses references (QGXA2WQJ3; NBX9RA9WX; XB5ZRN1VP). 7) prune extraneous cross‑references (avoid non‑ID citations) and ensure every factual claim ties to the named sources. 8) convert the prose into a tighter, reader‑friendly causal map: immediate news → market reaction functions → key thresholds → monitoring list, with a single line after each bullet point citing the relevant source ID. End state: a compact 0–3 week framework that (a) names explicit catalysts and invalidations, (b) uses precise, source‑backed numbers, (c) presents a coherent, testable transmission mechanism for Shopify and Beasley within a Moscow‑risk backdrop, and (d) leaves no critical source unanchored.",
