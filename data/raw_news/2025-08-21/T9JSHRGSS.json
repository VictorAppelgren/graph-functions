  "description": "As aid fails to reach civilians in Gaza, Israel slams misleading figures. The U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, using armed security, continues to feed millions despite a U.N. boycott.",
  "content": "As the debate heats up over the delivery of aid into Gaza, Israeli officials have once again questioned the United Nations over its data, specifically, aid getting stolen or intercepted, and the number of trucks entering the enclave from Israel.\n\nAs of August 12, the U.N. Office for Project Services showed that 3,140 trucks have been intercepted en route to their destinations since May 19. Only 412 trucks, 11.6% of the total sent into the region, reached their targeted location. The U.N. said the aid was taken \"either peacefully by hungry people or forcefully armed actors.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a review conducted by the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) claimed to have found that the U.N. figures have failed to account for the entry of around 6,000 additional trucks since May. COGAT said that Israel has allowed about 9,200 trucks to deliver aid to Gaza in the last three months, a figure 2.5 times higher than the around 3,500 trucks counted by the U.N.\n\nGAZA HUMANITARIAN FOUNDATION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE US-BACKED AID GROUP\n\n\"The fact that the U.N. presents only part of the aid actually transferred misleads the international community and creates a false picture of the situation, directly influencing global media coverage and shaping the positions of international decision-makers regarding the humanitarian situation in Gaza,\" a COGAT statement read.\n\nMeanwhile, the often-maligned U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's (GHF) out-of-the-box aid delivery mechanisms continue to show success, according to the group. Theft and looting have not been an issue for the GHF - which continues to provide between one and two million meals per day through distribution sites secured by armed guards. GHF has provided over 130 million meals since the start of its operations on May 27.\n\n\"The presence of armed security is one of the reasons why GHF has been able to deliver aid successfully without a single truck being looted,\" noting that \"in one of the most volatile and complex operating environments in the world, that security is the only reason food consistently reaches civilians without interference from Hamas.\"\n\nThough a group of about 230 NGOs initially rejected the organization on account of what they called \"militarized distribution sites,\" Fay said things might be changing as over 200 international organizations, \"sent a letter calling on the U.N. to collaborate with us.\"\n\n\"This is not the militarization of aid \u2026 It is the only way to make sure food actually reaches civilians. Every decision we make is guided by protecting lives.\"\n\nHe said \"more aid is the solution to many of the problems in Gaza today\" and that GHF is \"willing to work with any organization that wants to help feed the people of Gaza.\"\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Fay toured the vast lots in Kerem Shalom crossing, where pallets of U.N. aid await pickup by drivers. \"I saw about a dozen [trucks] sitting roasting, fully laden with dozens of pallets of food in each truck. I saw flour rotting on the side of the road. There were medical supplies that had already expired.\"\n\nSpeaking with the drivers who deliver aid to Gaza, he was told they had been in the loading area for five days, living out of their trucks. The drivers said that on the fourth day, they attempted to enter Gaza from Kerem Shalom but were shot at by unknown gunmen in Gaza. He reported that the drivers are now in \"fear for their lives,\" and asked if GHF would provide security for their trucks.\n\nA U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) spokesperson told Fox News Digital that \"the use of armed escorts can undermine perceptions of humanitarians\u2019 neutrality and independence, in turn jeopardizing community acceptance and staff security, and hindering access to civilians in need.\" The spokesperson called for armed escorts to \"only be used in exceptional circumstances as a last resort.\"\n\n\"Everyone working in Gaza is operating under extremely dangerous circumstances \u2026 what is clear is that conditions are not in place for humanitarians or those who support them to deliver aid at scale safely, rapidly and efficiently. We have consistently called for civilians to always be protected and for us to be enabled to reach people in need.\n\n\"In order to reach people in Gaza facing starvation, we need a predictable lifeline of aid via all available crossings and through all available corridors. We also need removal of the impediments we continue to face: delays at checkpoints; impassable, dangerous or congested routes; and restrictions on what can enter and on who is allowed to bring supplies.\"\n\nThe spokesperson did not respond to questions about the fate of aid that has not reached its destination, or about whether drivers\u2019 fear of kidnap, death, and looting is hindering aid dispersion. The spokesperson did claim that \"the U.N. and our partners have strict monitoring in place with oversight on deliveries when enabled to do so,\" and said that \"we do not have evidence of systematic aid diversion from the U.N. to Hamas.\"\n\nDespite statements to the contrary, there continues to be growing evidence that Hamas is diverting and benefitting from humanitarian aid.\n\nA State Department public assessment provided to Fox News Digital stated that the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s Office of the Inspector General \"has received and is actively investigating credible allegations of systematic interference by Hamas in Gaza. These allegations can come from aid workers, whistleblowers, and other parties, rather than sanitized disclosures sent by U.N. agencies which refuse to name Hamas as the party responsible for the interference. Whistleblowers, including U.N. staff, may fear political retaliation or violent retribution for sharing information and outing Hamas.\"\n\nAn Israeli military official told Fox News Digital that of the aid that is diverted from U.N. trucks, he estimates about 40% percent is taken by local communities, and about 60% taken by armed looters. He said that it is difficult to assess how much aid is being diverted by Hamas. \"Hamas is not a force wearing a uniform and identifying themselves,\" he said.\n\nAn Israeli military official told Fox News Digital that, of the aid diverted from U.N. trucks, about 40% is taken by local communities and 60% by armed looters. He said it's difficult to assess how much aid is stolen by Hamas, as \"Hamas is not a force wearing a uniform and identifying themselves.\"\n\nThe Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) shared a video X of Hamas looting aid packages on July 29, explaining that \"even when aid is delivered into Gaza - Hamas loots it for its own use, blatantly disregarding the needs of the population.\"\n\nOn Aug. 12, COGAT showed another video on X of armed members of Hamas attempting to avoid targeting by affixing a World Central Kitchen emblem to their vehicle and donning yellow vests. The NGO confirmed that the vehicle was not affiliated with the organization.\n\nAS ISRAEL FACES BLAME FOR THE HUNGER CRISIS IN GAZA, UN\u2019S OWN DATA SHOWS MOST OF ITS AID IS LOOTED\n\nOrde Kittrie, a law professor at Arizona State University and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that Hamas\u2019 obstruction of aid violates international law.\n\n\"Intentionally obstruct[ing] the passage of humanitarian relief, including food, to civilians in need\" is a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. He said Hamas is violating \"the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 11 of which recognizes \u2018the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger,\u2019 because it is \"starving its own people.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"What Hamas is doing represents an unusual, if not altogether new, type of violation of the prohibition on 'starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.\u2019 This prohibition is typically violated by a military intentionally starving enemy civilians in order to pressure the enemy to surrender or to abandon positions or to divert limited resources to the enemy's own civilians. In contrast, Hamas appears to be intentionally starving their own civilians in order to leverage their suffering as a strategic information weapon against Israel,\" he added.",

      "text": "As the world discusses the reality of the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Fox News' Bill Hemmer got a look inside a distribution site operated by the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).\nFox News was the first outlet to witness a newly established distribution center operated mostly by former U.S. forces who coordinate with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Hemmer said that the sites are not without their problems or controversy, but that the Americans working with GHF are proud of what they have accomplished.\nIn terms of the status of Gaza, Hemmer said that Rafah was clearly decimated by the IDF. The southern Gazan city is where Israel believes Hamas had its headquarters and where the terror group held hostages taken nearly two years ago, on Oct. 7, 2023.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be considering a full occupation of Gaza. If Israel makes this move, it would be a complete reversal of its policy dating back to 2005 when it pulled out of the enclave. Hostages' loved ones have expressed opposition to the plan out of fear that it would put those still held captive in even more danger.\nPalestinians who spoke with Hemmer said they were hungry, and tired of the war and of Hamas.\nHAMAS LOSING IRON GRIP ON GAZA AS US-BACKED GROUP GETS AID TO PALESTINIANS IN NEED\n\"All this food here will be gone in about 15 minutes,\" a GHF worker told Hemmer as the two stood in the middle of several palettes of food. \"They\u2019ll all come in, they flood in here, they have bags they\u2019ll stuff the food into, throw the big bag over their shoulder and they\u2019ll head out.\"\nThe worker also told Hemmer that the organization allows Palestinians to remain on the GHF site for about an hour after it opens.\nHemmer\u2019s visit comes as the organization faces international condemnation and a call from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for its \"immediate dismantling.\"\n\"Palestinians are paying the ultimate price of the international community\u2019s legal, political and moral failure,\" a UNHRC statement read, citing the opinions of several U.N. experts. One such expert named in the statement is Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, who has been repeatedly condemned by multiple governments, including the U.S., the U.K. and France, for making antisemitic statements.\nAlbanese and the other experts also say that GHF is \"an utterly disturbing example of how humanitarian relief can be exploited for covert military and geopolitical agendas in serious breach of international law.\"\nGAZA HUMANITARIAN FOUNDATION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE US-BACKED AID GROUP\nU.N. experts also claimed that Israeli forces and foreign military contractors indiscriminately fire at Palestinians seeking aid at GHF sites. However, GHF has consistently denied the use of force against civilians at its sites. On several occasions, the organization has sounded the alarm over threats emanating from Hamas against aid workers and seekers.\nThis aligns with a request GHF had for Fox News, which was to blur the faces of the Palestinians working with the organization out of fear of Hamas retribution.\nTRUMP OFFICIALS VISIT GAZA AID SITES AS INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PRESSURES ISRAEL\nGHF says it has distributed over \"106 million meals efficiently and directly\" since May while pushing back on criticism and claims that its sites are dangerous. The organization insists that its goal is to feed Palestinians in need while bypassing Hamas, the terror group governing the war-torn enclave.\nThe aid organization recently received $30M from the Trump administration in addition to millions coming from donornations in the region.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nRecently, the U.N. released its monthly infographic on UN2720 Mechanism for Gaza. In June 2025, the U.N. reported that out of its 1,090 aid trucks, only 47 arrived at an \"intended civilian destination inside Gaza.\" Meanwhile, the other 1,043 trucks were allegedly intercepted \"either peacefully by hungry people or forcefully by armed actors\" in Gaza.\nAt the request of the U.N., Israel will let limited commercial goods enter the enclave, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst. This strategy is apparently aimed at getting more goods into Gaza markets, allowing those in need of free aid to get to it first."

      "text": "New data published last week by the U.N. agency UNOPS shows that most of its aid entering the war-torn Gaza Strip has been looted inside the Palestinian territory. UNOPS provides management services for the world body's own humanitarian operations.\nDespite this, condemnation of Israel over the hunger crisis in Gaza has been ramping up, prompting an increasing number of Western governments to declare intentions to recognize a Palestinian state as punishment, and leading some media outlets to totally tune out the role both international humanitarian organizations and Hamas, whose October 2023 mass terror attack in Israel started the nearly two-year-old war, have played in this catastrophe.\n\"Nobody is able to have nuance in this conflict or hold multiple truths and that\u2019s part of why everybody from journalists to NGOs to U.N. officials, the pro-Palestine people, activists and advocates, parrot the same talking points that there's no aid theft and that everything is Israel\u2019s fault,\" Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told Fox News Digital.\nUS REPORT URGES UN AGENCY'S SHUTDOWN OVER HAMAS TIES, OCT 7 TERROR LINKS\nAlkhatib, a Gaza-born American, said that while the U.N. and other NGOs were \"playing politics\" by ignoring their own failures so as not to jeopardize funding and because they are terrified of Hamas, Israeli leaders were also \"exaggerating\" claims about Hamas being the only ones to loot the aid. A close observer of events in Gaza, he described a chain of thievery and extreme price hikes perpetrated by civilians and merchants that have all contributed to the misery there.\nHe added that statements by some Israeli government ministers about cutting off aid to force Gazans out of the territory have not helped either.\n\"Their statements have become the story under which nothing else will fit\u2026 no amount of evidence, no amount of clarification, no amount of nuance is going to come anywhere near to grabbing that much attention,\" Alkhatib said.\nFarhan Aziz Haq, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, confirmed to Fox News Digital that some aid had been stolen but said it was because so few supplies had entered Gaza in recent months that \"people facing hunger have resorted to offloading supplies directly from our convoys,\" he said.\n\"We understand the frustration, but let\u2019s be clear: this isn\u2019t our system. It\u2019s what happens when aid is squeezed through too few routes after months of deprivation,\" he claimed, adding \"only a steady, reliable flow of aid and commercial supplies can restore people\u2019s belief that aid will arrive and allow for safe, orderly distributions,\" he claimed.\nInformation posted on the website of UNOPS, the U.N. Office for Project Services, shows that around 87%, or 1,753 of the 2,013 aid trucks that entered Gaza since May 19 did not reach their final destinations, with the aid being stolen either \"peacefully by hungry people or forcefully by armed actors,\" as first reported by Israel's news agency, TPS-IL.\nISRAEL ANNOUNCES IMMEDIATE RESUMPTION OF GAZA AID AIRDROPS AMID GROWING HUNGER CRSIS\nThe data, which showed that a record 90 trucks carrying some 1,695 tons of aid were looted on May 31 alone, comes as shocking photos of emaciated Palestinian children \u2013 some of which were later proven to be children with pre-existing health conditions used as propaganda by Hamas \u2013 have gone viral.\nThe revelations about the U.N.\u2019s faulty aid system also come amid worldwide condemnation of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a new U.S. and Israel-backed aid distribution mechanism, devised, in part, to prevent aid from falling into Hamas\u2019 hands. The U.N. has refused to cooperate with the GHF. The aid group announced on Sunday that it had delivered nearly 105 million meals to Gazans since it started operations in May.\nIt also comes in sharp contrast to reports by some media outlets who chose to ignore evidence of Hamas stealing and reselling aid in order to fund its ongoing war \u2013 seemingly as a way to suggest that Israel is using starvation as a tactic of war or committing \"genocide.\" Israel has emphatically denied both claims.\nA recent article in the New York Times even went as far as reporting that there was \"no proof\" that Hamas had stolen U.N. aid, despite countless documented accounts, including from freed Israeli hostages who reported seeing stockpiles of U.N.-branded products inside Hamas tunnels.\nKobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said that not only did human rights organizations and many media outlets base their faulty reports on information published by Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, which is run by Hamas, they also did not \"take the nature of Hamas seriously.\"\n\"Hamas is not the most reliable source in the world,\" he said, adding that \"the international media and other sources do not consider the interests of Hamas, or its strategy, and they do not seem to acknowledge that Hamas wants a chaotic situation in the Gaza Strip. Hamas wants there to be many casualties among Palestinian civilians, because it serves their interests.\"\nGAZA HUMANITARIAN FOUNDATION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE US-BACKED AID GROUP\n\"Just to listen to what Hamas leaders have been saying since October 7,\" Michael continued. \"They have promised to repeat October 7 again and again, they have called on the Arab world to join the armed resistance against Israel and on the Arab public to pressure their regimes.\n\"They have also said publicly, and loudly, that they have no problem sacrificing another 100,000 Palestinian civilians for the sake of the victory,\" he said.\nYet the GHF has faced scrutiny and blame for the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Gaza amid daily reports by Hamas-backed bodies of civilian deaths at or near their aid distribution points and following chaotic images of people fighting over the food packages or sheltering from gunfire. The new agency has hit back, saying that Hamas, the U.N. and other international aid agencies, are just hoping the initiative fails so they can control all aid operations in Gaza.\nOn Friday, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, together with U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, visited southern Gaza to inspect one of GHF\u2019s aid distribution sites.\n\"Went into Gaza today & observed humanitarian food program by U.S. launched GHF. Hamas hates GHF b/c it gets food to ppl w/o it being looted by Hamas. Over 100 MILLION meals served in 2 months,\" Huckabee wrote in a post on X.\nDavid Makovsky, director of the Koret Project on Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said blame for the crisis should not be placed on one party but that \"by bringing the U.N.\u2019s own records to bear we can level-set the conversation.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"There is a whole debate about GHF, which will not be settled today,\" he noted. \"Yet, in a humanitarian emergency crisis, feeding people should take absolute top priority and I think it is incumbent for the U.N. and GHF to work together to feed people.\n\"I hope that by bringing in lots of food into Gaza you can help innocent suffering people and also dramatically bring down black market rates exploited by Hamas which they use to control their people,\" said Makovsky."

It is home to many holy sites and has deep religious roots dating back to biblical times. Bordered by Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, Israel is roughly the size of New Jersey.\nBenjamin Netanyahu, from the right-wing Likud party, is the longest-serving prime minister of Israel. He previously served as prime minister from 1996 to 1999 and later from 2009 to 2021, before returning to the role in 2022.\nThe State of Israel was established in 1948 and was officially admitted to the United Nations (UN) in 1949. Israel has a long-standing conflict with Arab states and the Palestinians, characterized by years of violence and terrorist attacks against the Jewish state.\nOn Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a deadly attack on Israel, prompting Israel to formally declare war on Hamas. In June 2025, Israel launched strikes aimed at Iran's nuclear facilities and top military leaders. On June 13, 2025, Israel initiated strikes targeting nuclear sites in Iran, marking the beginning of fire exchanges between the two nations and the start of the Israel-Iran war. In retaliation for U.S. strikes against its nuclear program, Iran launched at least 14 missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. According to President Donald Trump, the United States carried out strikes on three of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Operation Midnight Hammer on June 22, 2025."

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE - An international aid worker operating in Gaza has filed a formal whistleblower complaint to the Inspector General of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), alleging \"gross misconduct and misuse of humanitarian funds by the World Food Programme and other U.N. Agencies,\" according to a copy of the complaint obtained by Fox News Digital.\nDetails of alleged United Nations interference in the delivery of aid to Gazans have been revealed by the whistleblower who was in Gaza in July. The whistleblower confirmed to Fox News Digital the content of the complaint.\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint claims \"A firsthand eyewitnessing of senior Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officials offering any support necessary, including security protection and coordination, to representatives from the World Food Programme (WFP) and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) only to have WFP and OCHA respond that they were not prepared to discuss such coordination.\"\nHAMAS LOSING IRON GRIP ON GAZA AS US-BACKED GROUP GETS AID TO PALESTINIANS IN NEED\nAccording to the whistleblower complaint, this \"raises serious questions as to why WFP and OCHA were unprepared to discuss or accept the assistance offered by the IDF, thereby preventing aid from getting to the people of Gaza.\"\nThe whistleblower confirmed to Fox News Digital during an interview the allegations outlined in the complaint. The whistleblower said in the complaint that \"the IDF is actively helping the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) get food into the hands of civilians while U.N. agencies, including WFP and OCHA, through their unwillingness to coordinate with the IDF, are inhibiting the distribution of such aid.\"\nThe whistleblower continued, \"As has been recently shown through openly available imagery, the IDF has provided clearance for thousands of tons of U.N. humanitarian goods that are now sitting inside of Gaza, awaiting distribution. The U.N. must be held accountable to pick up and distribute such aid. I urge you to launch an independent investigation into this matter to determine the extent to which U.N. agencies, by refusing to coordinate with the IDF on essential issues, including security, are abusing U.S. taxpayer funds rather than using them to deliver the aid the American people are donating \u2013 and whether such actions are being taken independently by U.N. officials in Gaza or at the direction of the U.N. Secretary General or other senior U.N. officials in New York. \"\nThe GHF, with support from the U.S. and Israel, has distributed 127 million meals to Gazans since May. However, its aid distribution system has been under consistent attack from Hamas and from some unlikely quarters \u2014 the world's leading aid groups.\nGAZA HUMANITARIAN FOUNDATION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE US-BACKED AID GROUP\nThe whistleblower told Fox News Digital \"There is a concerted effort to discredit GHF and any attempts to provide aid out of [the] U.N.\"\nA senior U.S. State Department official sent Fox News Digital a lengthy response. The official said, \"The fact of the matter remains that GHF is a threat to how Hamas functions and enriches itself because GHF provides meals to those in need with safeguards to minimize Hamas from stealing. This is why Hamas continues to attack GHF aid sites.\"\nGHF Executive Chair, Reverend Johnnie Moore, told Fox News Sunday that the U.N. would rather aid Hamas, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, than help the charity.\nAccording to the State Department official, \"Aid diversion to terrorists frequently occurs in conflict zones under Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) control. It is a moral and legal obligation, and our duty to the American taxpayer, to work with our partners to ensure this ends immediately. There is endless video evidence of Hamas looting, not to mention members of the aid-industrial complex who have admitted that looting exists by reporting it as 'self-distribution,' in a poor attempt at an aid corruption coverup.\"\nThe State Department official continued that \"During the Biden Administration, USAID OIG published concerns related to the vetting of NGO personnel in Gaza. USAID OIG identified serious shortcomings and vulnerabilities in oversight mechanisms to prevent diversion of aid to Hamas terrorists. As a result of investigations, numerous UNRWA personnel affiliated with Hamas have been referred to the State Department for suspension or debarment proceedings.\"\nFox News Digital reported on August 1 that the U.S. State Department urged in a report that the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that provides aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip needs to be abolished and is beyond reform.\nAccording to a U.S. State Department public assessment to Congress that was independently obtained by Fox News Digital, \"The Administration has determined UNRWA is irredeemably compromised and now seeks its full dismantlement.\"\nDOSSIER REVEALS INFORMATION USED TO EXPLAIN UN AGENCY'S DEEP TIES TO HAMAS IN GAZA\nThe State Department officials said that \"USAID OIG investigations into UNRWA officials associated with Hamas, as well as other credible reports of Hamas interference in the delivery of aid, are active and ongoing. USAID OIG has received and is actively investigating credible allegations of systematic interference by Hamas in Gaza. These allegations can come from aid workers, whistleblowers, and other parties, rather than sanitized disclosures sent by U.N. agencies which refuse to name Hamas as the party responsible for the interference. Whistleblowers, including U.N. staff, may fear political retaliation or violent retribution for sharing information and outing Hamas.\"\nAn Israeli security official told Fox News Digital, \"In recent months, Israeli security officials have several times proposed to U.N. representatives that they hire the services of a security company. However, the U.N. has categorically refused and opposed the Israeli proposal.\"\nThe Israeli official added, \"It should be emphasized that despite this opposition by the U.N. to armed security for the organizations\u2019 convoys in the Gaza Strip, the U.N. does agree to receive security and escort for its convoys in other countries around the world where it provides humanitarian services to civilians, such as South Sudan or Congo.\"\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint has caught the attention of congressional lawmakers. A senior Republican congressional staffer confirmed to Fox News that several offices have seen the whistleblower report and that it has been discussed between the Hill and USAID oversight and State Department officials.\n\"This report is just the latest in a long line of investigations and evidence in showing that Hamas worked with the U.N., NGO and officials within the Biden USAID to divert aid and cover it up. However, it is one of the more compelling accounts to come out yet,\" said the senior congressional Republican staffer.\nA second congressional staffer weighed in on the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. According to the senate aide, the complaint was received, and they \"conveyed their interest in this issue to the executive branch. We hope that they will do their job and look at it.\"\nSt\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for the United Nations secretary general, told Fox News Digital, \"We are not aware of this complaint by a whistleblower as nothing has been passed on to us by USAID.\"\nHe added, \"On the basic accusation that we refuse to coordinate with the IDF in Gaza, the only thing that I can tell you is that such an accusation is delusional. There is not a single day that goes by that my colleagues on the ground are not in contact with the IDF, or more specifically COGAT, in an effort to coordinate the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza. On the issue of hunger in Gaza we firmly stand by the reporting of various U.N. agencies on the dramatic humanitarian situation.\"\nAccording to the whistleblower, who was on the ground in Gaza, they \"found no evidence of \u2018starvation\u2019 or \u2018famine\u2019 in Gaza. There are pockets of severe hunger, but they are not systematic or pervasive.\"\nThe whistleblower also based the analysis of hunger on input from other aid workers in Gaza.\nISRAEL RELEASES CONVERSATIONS OF GAZA RESIDENTS AMID CRITICISMS OF AID DELIVERY SYSTEM\nA WFP spokesperson told Fox News Digital in response to the whistleblower\u2019s allegations about WFP disrupting aid delivery and impeding IDF help \"that any such claim is untrue.\"\nThe WFP spokesperson added, \"GHF\u2019s four sites in Gaza are in specific areas and the routes used to deliver aid to the sites are different from other humanitarian organizations delivering aid into Gaza. The U.N. is 100% transparent with the Israel authorities - for all coordination and if incidents occur.\"\nRichard Goldberg, a senior advisor to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former White House and National Security Council official during both Trump administrations, told Fox News Digital, \"The U.N. is playing hunger games with the people of Gaza to drive a crisis, try to get the GHF to fail and resuscitate UNRWA as the dominant aid facilitator. We are talking about an enormous amount of taxpayer money being provided to WFP and the U.N. writ large with an expectation that aid be delivered in coordination with Israel.\n\"The allegations here suggest a directive from the Secretary General himself across the U.N. system to cause aid disruptions for the benefit of Hamas, which would be the biggest U.N. scandal since oil for food.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHe added, \"Secretary Rubio would be more than justified in calling the Secretary General and telling him that the U.N. won\u2019t get another dime from U.S. taxpayers unless he submits to an independent investigation and orders all agencies to cooperate with Israel.\"\nFox News' Beth Bailey contributed to this article."

      "text": "President Donald Trump addressed the ongoing hunger crisis in Gaza on Monday in Scotland, where he addressed the urgency of getting food into the enclave immediately, while doing it safely and securely.\n\"The United States recently, just a couple of weeks ago, we gave $60 million \u2026 No other nation gave money,\" as he urged other nations \"to step up.\"\n$30 million in U.S. contributions to Gaza have been channeled through the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.\nSince the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began its operations on May 27, the organization has partnered with local Palestinian aid workers and non-governmental organizations to deliver 97 million meals to date to Gazans.\nISRAEL ANNOUNCES IMMEDIATE RESUMPTION OF GAZA AID AIRDROPS AMID GROWING HUNGER CRISIS\nGHF spokesperson Chapin Fay told Fox News Digital that GHF \"has one exclusive mission: to feed the people of Gaza in a way that prevents Hamas from being able to steal or loot or divert the aid.\" In addition to having \"zero diversion,\" Fay said GHF has \"put [aid] directly into the hands of the people who need it the most.\"\nWhat is GHF providing the local population?\nAt its four distribution sites in Gaza, it provides boxes of aid sufficient to provide 2,400 daily calories for 5.5 people over a total of 3.5 days. GHF\u2019s sites are able to distribute, on average, 2 million total meals per day.\nFay said GHF has also started a potato pilot program which has seen \"hundreds of tons of potatoes\" delivered into Gaza.\nAnother new pilot program in association with local Gazan NGO Al-Amal has allowed GHF to deliver 2,000 boxes of food to families in Gaza. Fay said that GHF is in the process of scaling up the operation, vetting hundreds of inquiries received since the program\u2019s announcement and working on establishing additional local NGO partnerships.\nAttacks on GHF's aid model\nThe U.N. has lambasted GHF\u2019s distributions, with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini calling the organization an \"abomination\" that \"provides nothing but starvation and gunfire to the people of Gaza.\"\nThough media headlines are thick with accusations of violence at GHF sites, Fay said that the reality of GHF distributions \"is almost the opposite of what you read about, what you see on TV.\"\nThough he admitted that \"there\u2019s some chaos when thousands of desperate, hungry people are trying to get aid,\" he claims that only two violent incidents have transpired at GHF distributions. A stampede and a grenade attack that harmed two American veteran employees were \"Hamas-fomented terrorist attacks,\" he said.\nThe U.N. and many NGOs have also opposed GHF\u2019s use of armed security to protect aid-seekers. However, U.N. data shows that only 8% of U.N. aid had reached its destination without being looted in the last 10 weeks, according to a Reuters report.\nFay says that GHF is ready and willing to provide security support for U.N. aid. \"We need to stop pretending that there\u2019s only one way to get aid into Gaza,\" he explained.\nGHF\u2019s adaptations and improvements on the ground\nAs GHF continues to assist Gazans, Fay says the organization has \"adapt[ed] in a dynamic environment, and our distributions seem to be going more smoothly every day.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNew adaptations include a red-light, green-light system to indicate whether distribution sites are open and a suggestion from aid-seekers. GHF has also added more shelf-stable onions to its aid boxes.\nFay said that workers are also holding back some aid to ensure that women and children receive needed assistance. Because of this change, Fay says he recently \"saw women leaving and smiling at our personnel with their onions on their way home.\"\nGHF is set to deliver its 100 millionth meal to Gazans later this week.\nReuters contributed to this report."

      "text": "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), with support from the U.S. and Israel, has distributed some 70 million meals to Gazans since May. But its aid distribution system has been under consistent attack from Hamas and from some unlikely quarters \u2014 the world's leading aid groups.\nEarlier this month, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini called for the \"end to the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) since it provides nothing but starvation and gunfire to the people of Gaza.\" He went on to call it an \"abomination.\"\nHis statement noted that 230 NGOs, including Amnesty International, Oxfam International, Norwegian Refugee Council and Save the Children signed their names to an open letter criticizing GHF while urging a return to the U.N.-led aid distribution model.\nUS-BACKED GAZA AID GROUP LAUNCHES BOLD NEW SYSTEM TO DELIVER FOOD DIRECTLY TO FAMILIES\nCritics say UNRWA's ties to Hamas have put its very existence at risk, especially given the success of the GHF operation.\nGerald Steinberg, the founder and president of NGO Monitor, told Fox News Digital these groups include \"anti-Israel superpowers\" with \"massive PR budgets and dedicated staffs and are able to promote their attacks on GHF widely.\"\nSteinberg claimed that GHF has already demonstrated \"that aid to Gaza can be provided without relying on the old corrupt billion-dollar aid industry led by U.N. agencies like UNRWA and the NGOs that are allied with Hamas.\"\nSteinberg said the number of signatories to the letter has grown to more than 230 as the \"powerful NGO network is fighting back and making false accusations in an all-out political effort to force Israel and other donors to end the GHF operation.\"\nAMERICAN VETERANS ATTACKED, INJURED WHILE DISTRIBUTING AID IN GAZA WITH US-BACKED GROUP\nGHF interim Executive Director John Acree said he has no enmity for the NGO signatories of the letter.\n\"They write papers and letters and sign documents, and yet we\u2019re doing it,\" Acree said. He implored the groups to \"please, come. Come and help us.\"\nAcree says GHF reached out to other aid groups \"daily\" to ask for support. In some cases, humanitarian workers have entered discussions that \"we\u2019re hoping will eventually lead to partnerships and implementation.\"\nSince May, GHF has faced numerous criticisms about its operations, including accusations that Gazans have been killed and injured at distribution sites.\nIn response to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions about Lazzarini\u2019s remarks, an UNRWA spokesperson emphasized that \"UNRWA, like the rest of the U.N., has repeatedly condemned the current aid distribution system in Gaza,\" which it says \"is costing more lives than it saves.\"\nUNRWA alleged that \"800 starving people have been reported killed since this scheme started operating on the 28th of May,\" adding that \"instead of \u2018orderly food distribution,\u2019 this system brings dehumanization, chaos and death.\"\nLazzarini once again went on X to condemn the U.S.-backed aid mechanism, claiming that \"a functioning system was replaced with a deadly scam to force the displacement of people+ deepen the collective punishment of the Palestinians in Gaza.\"\nAMERICAN VICTIMS OF TERRORISM COULD SOON SUE INTERNATIONAL ORGS IF CRUZ'S BILL PASSES\nGHF released a statement Friday as the war of words continued.\n\"These false and misleading stats come directly from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry,\" the statement said. \"The U.N.\u2019s reliance and coordination with a terrorist organization to falsely smear our effort is not only disturbing but should be investigated by the international community.\"\nHamas has responded violently to GHF\u2019s arrival on the aid scene. Acree said that GHF\u2019s operation \"is going against [Hamas\u2019] system of stealing foreign aid, of controlling the market prices, of basically robbing the Palestinians that live in Gaza of their livelihoods and their economic welfare, and we\u2019re breaking that.\"\nSo far, 12 Palestinian GHF staff members have been killed and possibly submitted to \"summary execution\" on June 11. On July 5, two \"highly decorated\" U.S. veterans working with GHF were harmed in a grenade attack at a GHF distribution site.\nAcree said that GHF is evolving. The organization \"did not expect the desperation\" it encountered.\n\"We\u2019ve been told by the Gazans this is the first time they\u2019ve ever received free aid or food, and they\u2019ve had to pay for it up til now,\" he said. To counter that desperation, Acree said that GHF is \"taking measures now to help tap that tension and to help them understand that we\u2019re there to help and relieve that hunger.\"\nHe said the group still needs \"more aid. We still need a lot more help,\" which includes partnerships with the U.N. and NGOs.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe U.S. Agency for Infrastructure and Development has given $30 million to the GHF. Two sources who spoke to Reuters said the U.S. may approve $30 million per month in grants to the GHF in the future."

  "argos_summary": "Israeli officials have challenged United Nations data, arguing that the UN underreports the number of aid trucks entering Gaza and that many trucks are intercepted or looted, while the UN claims only about 11.6% of trucks reach their intended destinations. Israeli COGAT asserts that Israel has allowed roughly 9,200 trucks to deliver aid, far more than the 3,500 counted by the UN. The U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) touts its armed\u2011security model as preventing theft, claiming it has delivered over 100 million meals, but it faces criticism from the UN, NGOs, and allegations of violence at its distribution sites. Amid accusations of Hamas diverting aid and disputes over coordination, U.S. and Israeli officials continue to support GHF, while U.S. agencies and the UN investigate potential misuse of humanitarian funds and the role of Hamas in the crisis.",
