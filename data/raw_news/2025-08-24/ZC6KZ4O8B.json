  "content": "Identity management company Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) will be reporting results this Tuesday after the bell. Here\u2019s what to expect.\n\nOkta beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 1.2% last quarter, reporting revenues of $688 million, up 11.5% year on year. It was a satisfactory quarter for the company, with EPS guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations but a miss of analysts\u2019 billings estimates.\n\nIs Okta a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Okta\u2019s revenue to grow 10.2% year on year to $711.6 million, slowing from the 16.2% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.85 per share.\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Okta has only missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 2.2% on average.\n\nLooking at Okta\u2019s peers in the cybersecurity segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Varonis Systems delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 16.7%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.8%, and Qualys reported revenues up 10.3%, topping estimates by 1.7%. Varonis Systems traded up 5.3% following the results while Qualys\u2019s stock price was unchanged.\n\nRead our full analysis of Varonis Systems\u2019s results here and Qualys\u2019s results here.\n\nDebates over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments have raised questions about economic stability in 2025. While some of the cybersecurity stocks have shown solid performance in this choppy environment, the group has generally underperformed, with share prices down 4.3% on average over the last month. Okta is down 5.6% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $120.26 (compared to the current share price of $92.34).\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

      "text": "Okta (OKTA)\nOkta doesn\u2019t excite us. The demand for its offerings is expected to be weak over the next year, a tough backdrop for its returns.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy Okta Is Not Exciting\nNamed after the meteorological measurement for cloud cover, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) provides cloud-based identity management solutions that help organizations securely connect their employees, partners, and customers to the right applications and services.\n- Estimated sales growth of 9% for the next 12 months implies demand will slow from its three-year trend\n- Average billings growth of 9.9% over the last year was subpar, suggesting it struggled to push its software and might have to lower prices to stimulate demand\n- A silver lining is that its robust free cash flow profile gives it the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives or return capital to shareholders\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Okta\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Okta\nOkta\u2019s stock price of $92.34 implies a valuation ratio of 5.7x forward price-to-sales. Okta\u2019s valuation may seem like a bargain, especially when stacked up against other software companies. We remind you that you often get what you pay for, though.\nIt\u2019s better to pay up for high-quality businesses with higher long-term earnings potential rather than to buy lower-quality stocks because they appear cheap. These challenged businesses often don\u2019t re-rate, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. Okta (OKTA) Research Report: Q1 CY2025 Update\nIdentity management software maker Okta (OKTA) announced better-than-expected revenue in Q1 CY2025, with sales up 11.5% year on year to $688 million. The company expects next quarter\u2019s revenue to be around $711 million, close to analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.86 per share was 11.5% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nOkta (OKTA) Q1 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $688 million vs analyst estimates of $680.1 million (11.5% year-on-year growth, 1.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.86 vs analyst estimates of $0.77 (11.5% beat)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $184 million vs analyst estimates of $169.4 million (26.7% margin, 8.6% beat)\n- The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $2.86 billion at the midpoint\n- Adjusted EPS guidance for the full year is $3.26 at the midpoint, beating analyst estimates by 1.6%\n- \"Additionally, we\u2019re now factoring in potential risks related to the uncertain economic environment for the remainder of\" the fiscal year\n- Operating Margin: 5.7%, up from -7.6% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 34.6%, down from 41.6% in the previous quarter\n- Market Capitalization: $21.66 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded during the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) is a cloud-based software-as-a-service platform that helps companies manage identity for their employees and customers.\nThe founders Todd McKinnon and Frederic Kerrest were working at Salesforce at that time and saw how cloud was changing the world of enterprise software but also how companies struggled to keep track of all the logins for the new services they just subscribed to.\nInstead of having to manage separate login details for each of the many software tools that an employee uses, Okta provides them with a single account (Single Sign-On) which employees then use to login into any service. That makes it a lot easier for companies to then, through a centralized system, manage who has access to what, set up automated rules to make sure that when employees leave access is withdrawn, and enforce policies around passwords and account security. Okta also provides companies with software that, in similar fashion, handles authentication and account details storage of their customers.\n4. Identity Management\nAs software penetrates corporate life, employees are using more apps every day, on more devices, in more locations. This drives the need for identity and access management software that help companies efficiently manage who has access to what, and ensure that access privileges are secure from cyber criminals.\nOkta has built a robust integration network with most of the popular software apps. This makes is a competitive player in a market which includes Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and Ping Identity.\n5. Sales Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Luckily, Okta\u2019s sales grew at a decent 22.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. Its growth was slightly above the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nThis quarter, Okta reported year-on-year revenue growth of 11.5%, and its $688 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.2%. Company management is currently guiding for a 10.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 9.3% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. This projection is underwhelming and suggests its products and services will face some demand challenges.\n6. Billings\nBillings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called \u201ccash revenue\u201d because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract.\nOkta\u2019s billings came in at $552 million in Q1, and over the last four quarters, its growth slightly lagged the sector as it averaged 9.9% year-on-year increases. This alternate topline metric grew slower than total sales, meaning the company recognizes revenue faster than it collects cash - a headwind for its liquidity that could also signal a slowdown in future revenue growth.\n7. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it\u2019s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability.\nIt\u2019s relatively expensive for Okta to acquire new customers as its CAC payback period checked in at 72.9 months this quarter. The company\u2019s slow recovery of its sales and marketing expenses indicates it operates in a highly competitive market and must invest to stand out, even if the return on that investment is low.\n8. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like Okta, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nOkta\u2019s robust unit economics are better than the broader software industry, an output of its asset-lite business model and pricing power. They also enable the company to fund large investments in new products and sales during periods of rapid growth to achieve outsized profits at scale. As you can see below, it averaged an excellent 76.7% gross margin over the last year. Said differently, roughly $76.69 was left to spend on selling, marketing, and R&D for every $100 in revenue.\nIn Q1, Okta produced a 77.5% gross profit margin, marking a 1.5 percentage point increase from 76% in the same quarter last year. Okta\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending up over the past 12 months, increasing by 1.5 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest better unit economics due to more leverage from its growing sales on the fixed portion of its cost of goods sold (such as servers).\n9. Operating Margin\nMany software businesses adjust their profits for stock-based compensation (SBC), but we prioritize GAAP operating margin because SBC is a real expense used to attract and retain engineering and sales talent. This metric shows how much revenue remains after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to sales and R&D.\nOkta was roughly breakeven when averaging the last year of quarterly operating profits, decent for a software business.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Okta\u2019s operating margin rose by 17.5 percentage points over the last year, as its sales growth gave it immense operating leverage.\nIn Q1, Okta generated an operating profit margin of 5.7%, up 13.3 percentage points year on year. The increase was solid, and because its operating margin rose more than its gross margin, we can infer it was more efficient with expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead.\n10. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nOkta has shown terrific cash profitability, driven by its lucrative business model that enables it to reinvest, return capital to investors, and stay ahead of the competition while maintaining an ample cushion. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the software sector, averaging 28.1% over the last year.\nOkta\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $238 million in Q1, equivalent to a 34.6% margin. This cash profitability was in line with the comparable period last year and above its one-year average.\nOver the next year, analysts predict Okta\u2019s cash conversion will slightly fall. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 28.1% for the last 12 months will decrease to 26.8%.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nCompanies with more cash than debt have lower bankruptcy risk.\nOkta is a profitable, well-capitalized company with $2.73 billion of cash and $947 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $1.78 billion net cash position is 8.1% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from Okta\u2019s Q1 Results\nRevenue and adjusted EPS both beat, which is a good start. Despite the beat, Okta only reconfirmed full-year revenue guidance, which was in line with Wall Street's estimates. Typically, beats are flowed through to an increase in the full-year guidance. The company also stated that they are \"now factoring in potential risks related to the uncertain economic environment for the remainder of\" the year. Cybersecurity has been a strong performer as of late as the market sees the market as recession resistant and largely unaffected by tariffs. This print puts a dent in that. Shares traded down 11% to $111.77 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Okta?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:01 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Okta.\nThere are some bright spots in Okta\u2019s fundamentals, but its business quality ultimately falls short. To kick things off, its revenue growth was solid over the last three years. On top of that, Okta\u2019s expanding operating margin shows it\u2019s becoming more efficient at building and selling its software, and its bountiful generation of free cash flow empowers it to invest in growth initiatives.\nOkta\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 5.7x. This valuation is reasonable, but the company\u2019s shakier fundamentals present too much downside risk. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $120.26 on the company (compared to the current share price of $92.34)."

      "text": "A Profitable Growth Stock Benefitting From The Rise of AI\nLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ: LSCC) has long been one of the most exciting stocks on our watchlist because we think the company is benefitting from the rise of artificial intelligence.\nAs you can see from the chart below, the Lattice Semiconductor stock price dropped suddenly in October 2023. Just days later on 3 November 2023, we chose Lattice Semiconductor as the StockStory Edge stock of the month for November and emailed our detailed buy recommendation to members.\nAs our way of welcoming you aboard our free membership tier, we hope you enjoy this abridged version of our full recommendation, which is only available to members of StockStory Edge.\nWhat Does Lattice Semiconductor Do?\nLattice is a leading designer of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).\nField Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs, are like a special kind of computer chip. You could think of them as like a LEGO set for building complex electronic systems. They are used for a variety of complex products like robots that work in distribution centers and cars with self-driving technology.\nNormally, computer chips are set to do one job and can't be changed. But FPGAs are different. After you buy them, you can change how they work to do different jobs. It's like having a LEGO set where you can first build a tiger, then take it apart and build a red panda, then take it apart and build a goldfish, all using the same pieces.\nFPGAs have emerged as a preferred solution for customers in rapidly evolving technological fields because their flexibility gives them significant cost and time advantages over legacy chips that can\u2019t be changed once manufactured. In AI research, for example, FPGAs\u2019 reprogrammable nature allows engineers to quickly change their algorithms without buying a new batch of chips that can cost millions of dollars.\nGiven its chips\u2019 customization abilities, Lattice collaborates intimately with customers to implement designs. The company achieves this through its team of field applications engineers and proprietary software solutions that allow for more user-friendly experiences. We like that it has a software solution because essential software can often earn very high profit margins.\nWe believe the demand for LSCC\u2019s FPGAs is durable. Its chips are critical components for dynamic, high-growth industries such as AI, industrial robotics, autonomous vehicles (i.e., self-driving technology), and 5G wireless infrastructure. We see a bigger role for these technologies in the future, and that means more demand for Lattice Semiconductor\u2019s products.\nRisks\nThe first risk is a potential semiconductor downturn. The industry is cyclical due to the interplay of global economic growth, inventories, and technological obsolescence. We believe Lattice is partially insulated from obsolescence because of the re-programmability of FPGAs, but there\u2019s no denying it\u2019s tethered to the macro, which is sometimes good, sometimes bad, and sometimes somewhere in between. Investing over the long term by holding high-quality companies over three to five years, however, can meaningfully negate this roller coaster.\nLike many semiconductor companies, Lattice is a \u201cfabless\u201d chip designer, meaning it doesn\u2019t manufacture, assemble, or test its chips in-house. Instead, it outsources these functions to partners like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) so that the company can focus on innovation. This means LSCC\u2019s supply chain could be disrupted if China blockaded Taiwan (or worse).\nFinally, there is competition. The company has a strong grip over the small-range FPGA market. The mid-range market is currently up for grabs, and we think Avant is a strong contender. On the other hand, AMD and Intel could also attack the mid-range market by providing customers with more tailored solutions. Thus far, the two giants have mostly set their sights on large-range FPGAs, which are mostly used for the highest-intensity applications.\nWhy We Like Lattice Semiconductors\nLattice is an exceptionally high-quality business and its best-in-class profit margins have always kept it near the top of our list. Semiconductors are cyclical businesses, so demand fluctuations are normal and temporary. We think Lattice can easily outlast any lulls in demand, thanks to strong free cash flow margins.\nOur view is that LSCC is the leader in a high-growth market, and its total addressable market is about to double.\n1. Lattice is benefitting from the rise of AI\nLattice is well-positioned to benefit from the rise of AI because its silicon is on almost every new AI server shipped globally today. That rate should increase as servers steadily consume more chips and the total number of servers grows with more businesses, organizations, and people using generative AI and large language models (like ChatGPT).\nAI will also bring an explosion in edge computing. Edge computing describes processing done on a server or device closer to the data source rather than in centralized data centers. Massive amounts of data must be analyzed at low latencies for AI to work at scale, and LSCC\u2019s FPGAs\u2013with their parallel processing capabilities that boost analytical speed and re-programmability that allows for easy adjustments to constantly changing AI algorithms\u2013are must-haves.\n2. Lattice has strong revenue and earnings per share growth\nLSCC is a 40-year-old company that has consistently done one thing well: designing FPGAs. Over the last five years, its revenue has grown from about $400 million to what will be $740+ million this year (13% annualized growth rate), and its EPS rose by almost 500% over the same period.\nAdditionally, Lattice\u2019s unique chips and intellectual property have enabled it to generate a robust 70% gross margin and 40% adjusted operating margin. This has led to heaps of free cash flow that the company has reinvested into product innovation. As of late, LSCC has even had excess cash to return to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. In 2022, it repurchased $110 million of stock, the highest annual total in its history.\n3. New Product Platform\nFor most of its history, LSCC has focused on the small-range, power-efficient FPGA market for applications requiring simple logic functions. The company\u2019s Nexus product line, released in late 2019, made Lattice the #1 player in the global FPGA market by volume. These chips were so popular because they featured the smallest chip sizes and lowest power consumption in the industry (75% less power consumption than comparable products from AMD and Intel).\nDespite its success, Lattice is not standing still. Less than a year ago, the company entered the mid-range FPGA market with its Avant product line. These chips are leveraged in more rigorous use cases requiring edge computing (the \u201cE\u201d in Avant-E, see below) such as industrial robotics, autonomous vehicle networking, and machine vision (using cameras and computers to inspect and measure).\nWe think Avant is a game-changing development because its FPGAs boast 2x the bandwidth capabilities, 2.5x better power efficiency, and are up to 6x smaller than competing products from AMD and Intel. They are simply superior products.\n4. Experienced Leadership\nLattice is led by CEO James Anderson, who joined the company in September 2018. Luckily for investors, his prior two roles were in key leadership positions at AMD and Intel. Anderson\u2019s hiring was part of the complete turnover of Lattice\u2019s old management team, and seven executives were recruited to join him.\nTwo individuals worth calling out are Stephen Douglass (Chief Technology Officer) and Mark Nelson (SVP of Sales). Douglass joined from Xilinx, which was the largest FPGA company before being acquired by AMD in 2022, while Nelson joined from Intel. We believe the management team\u2019s deep knowledge of the industry and its closest competitors gives it an advantage.\nSumming it all up, our research suggests that LSCC\u2019s $660 million of revenue in 2022 can nearly double to about $1.2 billion in five years, a 13% annualized growth rate. With higher margins from Avant sales, efficiency from selling to existing customers, and continued share buybacks, that revenue growth can translate into nearly 20% EPS growth per annum. We believe this kind of growth should see the stock will reach $90 by the end of 2026.\nWith a bit of luck\u2013and the optimism of a bull market\u2013shareholders may well see a higher price.\nIf you enjoyed this abridged version of our Stock of the Month for November 2023 you\u2019ll love the full version.

      "text": "Varonis Systems (VRNS)\nVaronis Systems doesn\u2019t excite us. Its underwhelming sales growth and operating losses make us question the sustainability of its business model.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy Varonis Systems Is Not Exciting\nBeginning with protecting Windows file shares in 2005 and evolving into a comprehensive security platform, Varonis Systems (NASDAQ:VRNS) provides data security software that helps organizations protect sensitive information, detect threats, and comply with privacy regulations.\n- Revenue increased by 11% annually over the last three years, acceptable on an absolute basis but tepid for a software company enjoying secular tailwinds\n- Historical operating margin losses point to an inefficient cost structure\n- On the bright side, its user-friendly software enables clients to ramp up spending quickly, leading to the speedy recovery of customer acquisition costs\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Varonis Systems\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Varonis Systems\nVaronis Systems is trading at $59.11 per share, or 9.7x forward price-to-sales. Not only is Varonis Systems\u2019s multiple richer than most software peers, but it\u2019s also expensive for its revenue characteristics.\nThere are stocks out there similarly priced with better business quality. We prefer owning these.\n3. Varonis Systems (VRNS) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nData protection and security software company Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 16.7% year on year to $152.2 million. Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was optimistic at $165.5 million at the midpoint, 2.5% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.03 per share was $0.02 above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nVaronis (VRNS) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $152.2 million vs analyst estimates of $148 million (16.7% year-on-year growth, 2.8% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.03 vs analyst estimates of $0.01 ($0.02 beat)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $1.9 million vs analyst estimates of -$3.13 million (1.2% margin, significant beat)\n- The company slightly lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $622 million at the midpoint from $617.5 million\n- Management raised its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $0.17 at the midpoint, a 9.7% increase\n- Operating Margin: -24%, down from -22.1% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 11.4%, down from 47.9% in the previous quarter\n- Annual Recurring Revenue: $693.2 million at quarter end, up 18.7% year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $6.09 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded by a duo of former Israeli Defense Forces cyber warfare engineers, Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS) offers software-as-service that helps customers protect data from cyber threats and gain visibility into how enterprise data is being used.\nThe company's key product is the Varonis Data Security platform. It provides features including real-time threat detection, data classification/governance, and compliance reporting. Threat detection tells an organization if a rogue employee is moving large amounts of data. Data classification/governance helps organize data by levels of sensitivity and can automatically apply access and security measures based on this. Compliance reporting ensures that an organization\u2019s data practices comply with regulations that may govern where consumer demographic data is stored, for example.\nWithout proper tools, organizations are generally better equipped to create data than protect it, and data breaches can have significant financial and reputational consequences. For example, international email marketing company Epsilon suffered a database hack in 2011 that affected 75 clients and was estimated to cost the company $3-4bn when factoring in direct costs, forensic audits, litigation, and lost business.\nThe company\u2019s customers are of various industries but tend to be larger enterprises rather than small or medium-sized businesses with few employees and simple IT architectures. Varonis generates revenue through software licensing and maintenance fees. The company also offers professional services such as implementation and training to ensure customer success.\n4. Endpoint Security\nAlmost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks. As the volume of internet enabled devices grows, every device that employees use to connect to business networks represents a potential risk. Endpoint security software enables businesses to protect devices (endpoints) that employees use for work purposes either on a network or in the cloud from cyber threats.\nCompetitors offering data protection and security software providers include Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS), Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD), and F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV).\n5. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last three years, Varonis grew its sales at a 11% compounded annual growth rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds.\nThis quarter, Varonis reported year-on-year revenue growth of 16.7%, and its $152.2 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.8%. Company management is currently guiding for a 11.8% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 12.8% over the next 12 months, an acceleration versus the last three years. This projection is above average for the sector and implies its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance.\n6. Annual Recurring Revenue\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nVaronis\u2019s ARR punched in at $693.2 million in Q2, and over the last four quarters, its growth was impressive as it averaged 18.3% year-on-year increases. This alternate topline metric grew faster than total sales, which likely means that the recurring portions of the business are growing faster than less predictable, choppier ones such as implementation fees. That could be a good sign for future revenue growth.\n7. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period measures the months a company needs to recoup the money spent on acquiring a new customer. This metric helps assess how quickly a business can break even on its sales and marketing investments.\nVaronis is extremely efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 10.8 months this quarter. The company\u2019s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation. These dynamics give Varonis more resources to pursue new product initiatives while maintaining the flexibility to increase its sales and marketing investments.\n8. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like Varonis, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nVaronis\u2019s robust unit economics are better than the broader software industry, an output of its asset-lite business model and pricing power. They also enable the company to fund large investments in new products and sales during periods of rapid growth to achieve outsized profits at scale. As you can see below, it averaged an excellent 81.5% gross margin over the last year. Said differently, roughly $81.46 was left to spend on selling, marketing, and R&D for every $100 in revenue.\nVaronis\u2019s gross profit margin came in at 79.5% this quarter, down 3.3 percentage points year on year. Varonis\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 3.1 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs.\n9. Operating Margin\nMany software businesses adjust their profits for stock-based compensation (SBC), but we prioritize GAAP operating margin because SBC is a real expense used to attract and retain engineering and sales talent. This metric shows how much revenue remains after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to sales and R&D.\nVaronis\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly over the last 12 months but has remained more or less the same, averaging negative 20.4% over the last year. Unprofitable software companies that fail to improve their losses or grow sales rapidly deserve extra scrutiny. For the time being, it\u2019s unclear if Varonis\u2019s business model is sustainable.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Varonis\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly but has generally stayed the same over the last year. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\nIn Q2, Varonis generated a negative 24% operating margin. The company's consistent lack of profits raise a flag.\n10. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nVaronis has shown robust cash profitability, driven by its attractive business model and cost-effective customer acquisition strategy that enable it to invest in new products and services rather than sales and marketing. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 20.8% over the last year, quite impressive for a software business. The divergence from its underwhelming operating margin stems from the add-back of non-cash charges like depreciation and stock-based compensation. GAAP operating profit expenses these line items, but free cash flow does not.\nVaronis\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $17.32 million in Q2, equivalent to a 11.4% margin. This result was good as its margin was 3 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends are more important.\nOver the next year, analysts predict Varonis\u2019s cash conversion will fall. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 20.8% for the last 12 months will decrease to 17.8%.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nCompanies with more cash than debt have lower bankruptcy risk.\nVaronis is a well-capitalized company with $807.4 million of cash and $742.3 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $65.19 million net cash position gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from Varonis\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how Varonis raised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance. We were also glad its revenue, EPS, and adjusted operating income trumped Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 2.3% to $53 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Varonis Systems?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:26 PM EDT\nAre you wondering whether to buy Varonis Systems or pass? We urge investors to not only consider the latest earnings results but also longer-term business quality and valuation as well.\nVaronis Systems has a few positive attributes, but it doesn\u2019t top our wishlist. Although its revenue growth was uninspiring over the last three years, its growth over the next 12 months is expected to be higher. And while Varonis Systems\u2019s operating margins reveal poor profitability compared to other software companies, its efficient sales strategy allows it to target and onboard new users at scale.\nVaronis Systems\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 9.7x. While this valuation is fair, the upside isn\u2019t great compared to the potential downside. We're fairly confident there are better investments elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $61.20 on the company (compared to the current share price of $59.11)."

      "text": "Qualys (QLYS)\nQualys doesn\u2019t excite us. Its growth has been lacking and its cash conversion is projected to decline, a situation we\u2019d avoid.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy Qualys Is Not Exciting\nOriginally developed to address the growing complexity of IT security in the cloud era, Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) provides a cloud-based platform that helps organizations identify, manage, and protect their IT assets from cyber threats across on-premises, cloud, and mobile environments.\n- Sales trends were unexciting over the last three years as its 12.4% annual growth was below the typical software company\n- Estimated sales growth of 6.8% for the next 12 months implies demand will slow from its three-year trend\n- A bright spot is that its excellent operating margin highlights the strength of its business model\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Qualys\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Qualys\nAt $134.54 per share, Qualys trades at 7.2x forward price-to-sales. We acknowledge that the current valuation is justified, but we\u2019re passing on this stock for the time being.\nWe prefer to invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with superior earnings growth.\n3. Qualys (QLYS) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nCloud security and compliance software provider Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) reported Q2 CY2025 results topping the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 10.3% year on year to $164.1 million. Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was better than expected at $166 million at the midpoint, 1.3% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.68 per share was 13.3% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nQualys (QLYS) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $164.1 million vs analyst estimates of $161.3 million (10.3% year-on-year growth, 1.7% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $1.68 vs analyst estimates of $1.48 (13.3% beat)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $70.09 million vs analyst estimates of $63.49 million (42.7% margin, 10.4% beat)\n- The company slightly lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $659 million at the midpoint from $652.5 million\n- Management raised its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $6.35 at the midpoint, a 3.3% increase\n- Operating Margin: 31.3%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 85.3%, up from 67.3% in the previous quarter\n- Billings: $152.2 million at quarter end, up 10% year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $4.93 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 1999 as one of the first subscription security companies, Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) provides organizations with software to assess their exposure to cyber-attacks.\nThe cyberattack surface has expanded rapidly in recent years. The digitization of business processes and the shift of enterprise resources to the cloud have led to the explosion of IT applications and systems. To secure their systems and stay compliant with the latest regulations, organizations need to adopt a security platform to efficiently monitor all their assets.\nQualys helps organizations prevent and detect cyber threats using its vulnerability management software, which scans and discovers all the IT assets owned by a company. Its software automatically collects and analyses data from these assets to detect potential vulnerabilities, such as weak security policies, unpatched software, outdated apps, and compromised logins. Then, it prioritizes these issues based on severity and provides recommendations on how they can be remediated. Qualys is also capable of automating the full threat detection process so that security analysts can focus on the most dangerous threats.\nFor example, due to the scale of their network infrastructure eBay needed a solution that would automatically find the most recent vulnerabilities without requiring constant research by security specialists. It also needed to make sure that the networks of its business partners are not posing a risk. Qualys is able to automatically scan eBay\u2019s and its partners networks, provide detailed inventory of all apps and devices and alert the information security team on any vulnerabilities, saving them time and cost.\nBeyond automation, Qualys has been investing in the endpoint security space to cover the detection and prevention of threats on devices such as laptops, servers, mobile phones, as well as cloud environments.\n4. Vulnerability Management\nThe demand for cybersecurity is growing as more and more businesses are moving their data and processes into the cloud, which along with a major increase in employees working remotely, has increased their exposure to attacks and malware. Additionally, the growing array of corporate IT systems, applications and internet connected devices has increased the complexity of network security, all of which has substantially increased the demand for software meant to protect data breaches.\nOther companies with similar capabilities as Qualys include Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD), Tenable (NASDAQ:TENB) and cloud security innovators such as CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE).\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Over the last three years, Qualys grew its sales at a 12.4% annual rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds.\nThis quarter, Qualys reported year-on-year revenue growth of 10.3%, and its $164.1 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.7%. Company management is currently guiding for a 7.9% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 5.7% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. This projection doesn't excite us and suggests its products and services will face some demand challenges.\n6. Billings\nBillings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called \u201ccash revenue\u201d because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract.\nQualys\u2019s billings punched in at $152.2 million in Q2, and over the last four quarters, its growth slightly outpaced the sector as it averaged 10.5% year-on-year increases. This performance aligned with its total sales growth and shows the company is successfully converting sales into cash. Its growth also enhances liquidity and provides a solid foundation for future investments.\n7. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period measures the months a company needs to recoup the money spent on acquiring a new customer. This metric helps assess how quickly a business can break even on its sales and marketing investments.\nIt\u2019s relatively expensive for Qualys to acquire new customers as its CAC payback period checked in at 62.6 months this quarter. The company\u2019s slow recovery of its sales and marketing expenses indicates it operates in a highly competitive market and must invest to stand out, even if the return on that investment is low.\n8. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like Qualys, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nQualys\u2019s robust unit economics are better than the broader software industry, an output of its asset-lite business model and pricing power. They also enable the company to fund large investments in new products and sales during periods of rapid growth to achieve higher profits in the future. As you can see below, it averaged an excellent 81.8% gross margin over the last year. That means Qualys only paid its providers $18.16 for every $100 in revenue.\nThis quarter, Qualys\u2019s gross profit margin was 82.4%, in line with the same quarter last year. On a wider time horizon, the company\u2019s full-year margin has remained steady over the past four quarters, suggesting its input costs have been stable and it isn\u2019t under pressure to lower prices.\n9. Operating Margin\nMany software businesses adjust their profits for stock-based compensation (SBC), but we prioritize GAAP operating margin because SBC is a real expense used to attract and retain engineering and sales talent. This metric shows how much revenue remains after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to sales and R&D.\nQualys\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly over the last 12 months but has generally stayed the same, averaging 31% over the last year. This profitability was elite for a software business thanks to its efficient cost structure and economies of scale. This result isn\u2019t surprising as its high gross margin gives it a favorable starting point.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Qualys\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly but has generally stayed the same over the last year. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\nThis quarter, Qualys generated an operating margin profit margin of 31.3%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s cost structure has recently been stable.\n10. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nQualys has shown terrific cash profitability, driven by its lucrative business model that enables it to reinvest, return capital to investors, and stay ahead of the competition while maintaining an ample cushion. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the software sector, averaging an eye-popping 54.5% over the last year.\nQualys\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $140 million in Q2, equivalent to a 85.3% margin. This result was good as its margin was 52.5 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends are more important.\nOver the next year, analysts predict Qualys\u2019s cash conversion will fall. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 54.5% for the last 12 months will decrease to 35%.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nOne of the best ways to mitigate bankruptcy risk is to hold more cash than debt.\nQualys is a profitable, well-capitalized company with $194 million of cash and $48.25 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $145.7 million net cash position is 3% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from Qualys\u2019s Q2 Results\nThis was a beat and raise quarter. We were impressed by how significantly Qualys blew past analysts\u2019 EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year EPS guidance, which was raised from the previous figure, exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock traded up 7.1% to $140.11 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Qualys?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:23 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Qualys.\nThere are some bright spots in Qualys\u2019s fundamentals, but its business quality ultimately falls short. Although its revenue growth was uninspiring over the last three years and analysts expect growth to slow over the next 12 months, its bountiful generation of free cash flow empowers it to invest in growth initiatives. Investors should still be cautious, however, as Qualys\u2019s forecasted free cash flow margin suggests the company will ramp up its investments next year.\nQualys\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 7.2x. This valuation multiple is fair, but we don\u2019t have much faith in the company. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $141.02 on the company (compared to the current share price of $134.54)."

  "argos_summary": "Okta is set to report earnings, having recently beat revenue expectations with $688\u202fmillion and a 11.5% YoY growth, but analysts now forecast a slower 10.2% revenue increase to $711.6\u202fmillion for the next quarter. While the company\u2019s operating margin and free cash flow remain strong, its guidance signals a deceleration from the 16.2% growth seen last year, raising concerns about future demand. Peer comparisons show Varonis and Qualys also posted revenue beats, yet both face slower growth and cash conversion challenges, while Lattice Semiconductor is highlighted as a higher\u2011quality play benefiting from AI demand.
