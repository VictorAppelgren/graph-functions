  "title": "DAVID BLACKMON: Has India Made Its Geopolitical Choice?",
  "description": "President Trump boasts America \u201cholds all the cards\u201d in its trade negotiations with other countries, but the equation is more complex where India is concerned.",
  "content": "The leaders of China, Russia, and India tried over the weekend to signal their unity at the annual meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), even as strong differences remain among the three powerful nations. Many of those areas of unity \u2013 and differences \u2013 revolve around energy and energy geopolitics.\n\nThe New York Times reports that \u201cChina wants to seize on the unpopularity of America\u2019s trade policy to drive a wedge between Washington and the rest of the world, arguing that it can serve as a more stable global leader.\u201d It is no surprise that Russian leader Vladimir Putin continues to sidle up to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he has leaned in that direction for many years, no doubt spurred along by the Democratic Party\u2019s hysteria campaign to poison U.S./Russia relations with its Trump collusion hoax.\n\nThe more troubling development out of the weekend\u2019s summit was the posturing by India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who appears to be increasingly moving his own country into this China/Russia orbit. While Mr. Modi made no mention of his country\u2019s increasingly cooperative relations with both China and Russia in his formal remarks to the SCO\u2019s planning committee, his engagements with both Putin and Xi during the rest of the event created speculation that he may be moving towards a higher degree of cooperation with India\u2019s fellow BRICS members as his government remains entangled in trade and tariff disputes with the Donald Trump administration. (RELATED: Trump Ratchets Up Pressure On Key Partner For Buying Russian Oil)\n\nLast week, President Trump raised the U.S. tariff on goods imported from India to 50%, a doubling of the 25% tariff he had implemented just a few weeks earlier. This new rate, effective Sept. 2, brings America\u2019s tariff levy on India to among the highest of any country, no doubt raising tensions with the Modi government.\n\nPresident Trump views the move as simply leveling the playing field with one of the world\u2019s two most populous nations. \u201cWhat few people understand is that we do very little business with India, but they do a tremendous amount of business with us,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social feed on Sept. 1. \u201cIn other words, they sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest \u2018client,\u2019 but we sell them very little \u2013 Until now a totally one-sided relationship, and it has been for many decades. The reason is that India has charged us, until now, such high Tariffs, the most of any country, that our businesses are unable to sell into India. It has been a totally one-sided disaster!\u201d\n\nThe aggressive U.S. posture towards India has been largely motivated by the Modi government\u2019s decision in the past three years to become the biggest importer of Russian crude oil. Mr. Trump hopes he can pressure Putin to end his war with Ukraine by penalizing his largest customer, thus impeding Putin\u2019s ability to continue funding his military operations.\n\nThe tactic doesn\u2019t appear thus far to be working, possibly because the U.S. 50% tariff comes with a whopping loophole: It doesn\u2019t apply to India\u2019s sizable exports of refined products to America. Those refined products \u2013 largely processed by big Indian refiners like Reliance Industries from their purchases of Russian crude oil \u2013 make up a big portion of India\u2019s overall U.S. exports. This ability to buy crude from Russia at highly discounted prices and then sell the refined products at full market prices has become a big growth industry in India in recent years.\n\nThis massive loophole no doubt exists due to the White House\u2019s priority of keeping energy costs to consumers as low as possible, but it also lessens any real leverage the U.S. might derive from using energy to influence India\u2019s posturing towards Russia. This reality, combined with India\u2019s increasing trade ties with both China and Russia through its leadership in the BRICS trade alliance, creates a powerful incentive for the Modi government to retain strong relations with those peer nations.\n\nPresident Trump has often boasted that America \u201cholds all the cards\u201d in its trade and tariff negotiations with other countries. While that is true in most cases, the equation is more tenuous and complex where India is concerned, and it showed last weekend in Shanghai.\n\nDavid Blackmon is an energy writer and consultant based in Texas.

      "text": "President Donald Trump followed through on his promise to implement 50% tariffs on India as punishment for continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas.\nThe tariffs climbed to some of the highest rates among U.S. trade partners after Trump\u2019s 21-day deadline for India, enacted on Aug. 6, expired today. India remains one of Russia\u2019s most loyal customers for oil, importing approximately 1.75 million barrels per day between January and June 2025.\nThe tariffs have been accompanied by significant outcry from India, who see the move as potentially damaging to the nation\u2019s relationship. (RELATED: Trump Doubles Tariffs On Major Ally For Buying Putin\u2019s Oil)\nThe Indian Ministry of External Affairs told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the tariffs were \u201cextremely unfortunate\u201d and that India would take \u201call actions necessary to protect its national interests.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has been attempting to put an economic squeeze on Russia to increase the likelihood that Russian President Vladimir Putin will come to the peace table. The U.S. has also threatened to put secondary tariffs on buyers of key Russian goods.\nTrump initially imposed a 25% tariff on India on July 30, then doubled the impending tariffs to 50% on Aug. 6. Trump stressed in a July Truth Social post that India could not buy Russian oil \u201cat a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE.\u201d\nSome experts have warned that India cannot wean off Russian oil supply so quickly, and that the tariffs may excessively strain Indian and American relations. India is one of the U.S. largest trading partners, the two exchanging $212.3 billion worth of goods and services in 2024, up over 8% from 2023, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\nTrump has been a long-standing critic of India\u2019s trade policy towards American goods, saying India was having a \u201cfield day\u201d with the U.S. in an unbalanced trade relationship in 2019.\n\u201cPresident Trump leaned on his relationships with both India and Pakistan to secure a ceasefire in this deadly conflict that could have gone nuclear without his involvement,\u201d A White House official told the DCNF. \u201cThis President is effective because he is able to maintain relationships while advocating for America First policies \u2013 such as reducing the massive trade deficit between our two countries and stopping the killing in the Russia-Ukraine War.\u201d\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "India\u2019s leader Modi cozies up to Putin and Xi Jinping at Shanghai summit \u2014 after he was spurned by Trump\nElephants and dragons and bears \u2014 oh my!\nIndia\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi cozied up to Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader-for-life Xi Jinping at a meeting in Shanghai on Monday.\nThe Xi-some took place at the Shanghai Cooperation Summit (SCO), which the Chinese said is aimed at challenging the West\u2019s global influence.\nAll three leaders have found themselves spurned by President Trump \u2014 with India slammed with 50% tariffs last week as punishment for the country\u2019s refusal to stop buying Russian oil.\nXi welcomed Modi with open arms at the meeting, as the leaders of the world\u2019s two most populous nations appeared to put aside their regional rivalry for the moment.\n\u201cIt is the right choice for both sides to be friends who have good neighborly and amicable ties, partners who enable each other\u2019s success, and to have the dragon and the elephant dance together,\u201d Xi said \u2014 a reference to the national symbols of both nations.\nAdd to the mix the Russian bear \u2014 and the three leaders expressed the need for economic unity while also discussing the future of the Ukraine war.\nPutin and Modi appeared to be especially united in their efforts to woo Xi, with the two pictured riding inside the Russian president\u2019s limo, holding hands, and repeatedly hugging throughout the day.\n\u201cConversations with him are always insightful,\u201d Modi wrote on X alongside a picture with Putin.\nPutin returned the kind words, calling Modi a \u201cdear friend\u201d and boasting about Russia\u2019s relationship with the world\u2019s largest democracy at a time when most countries have shunned him for invading Ukraine.\nOne heavyweight leader is still yet to arrive \u2014 North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un is taking a slow train to host city Tianjin for the summit. His presence \u2014 along with Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian \u2014 will complete the so-called \u201cAxis of Upheaval\u201d at the meeting.\nXi, who is leading the conference, stood beside Putin and Modi in criticizing the heavy sanctions levied against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine and the punishing tariffs faced by India.\nHe specifically called the sanctions against Russia a clear sign of \u201cbullying behavior\u201d from the West, calling on his Shanghai block to unite.\n\u201cWe must uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and support the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core,\u201d the Chinese president said.\nXi aimed part of his comments on united economic prosperity at Modi, seeking to cool their once-hostile relationship \u2014 including a dispute over a remote region of the Himalayas that saw Chinese and Indian troops beating each other to death.\nChina is also a longtime ally of India\u2019s nuclear-armed rival Pakistan.\nIndia and China have started to restructure their relationship after Trump lashed out at India, with Modi now describing himself as a \u201cpartner\u201d to China.\nXi, who has been accused of propping up Russia\u2019s war machine, also urged the members of the SCO to boost trade and investment deals among each other, with China promising to provide $280 million in foreign aid to member states this year.\nThe bloc, which originally began with six nations, has expanded to 10 permanent members and 16 dialogue and observer countries in recent years, forming what Beijing has dubbed the \u201cGlobal South,\u201d a group of developing countries in the southern hemisphere.\nXi, Modi and Putin were seen chatting away during the conference, which included talks between the three on the war in Ukraine.\nPutin touted Xi\u2019s leadership during the conference and thanked both the Chinese and Indian leaders for efforts in \u201cfacilitating the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis.\u201d\nPutin then reiterated claims that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was not the inciting factor of the war, which has grown to become the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II.\nInstead, Putin insisted that the conflict was \u201ca result of a coup in Ukraine, which was supported and provoked by the West.\u201d\n\u201cThe second reason for the crisis is the West\u2019s constant attempts to drag Ukraine into NATO,\u201d the Russian president added.\nMoscow\u2019s aggression in Ukraine ramped up in 2014 following the Revolution of Dignity, which saw the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych over years of alleged, deep-rooted corruption in Kyiv.\nRussia would go on to invade Ukraine and illegally annex Crimea, one of the regions still under contention in the heated peace-talks.\nAlong with blaming the West, Putin claimed he had reached certain \u201cunderstandings\u201d with President Trump during their summit in Alaska last month.\nPutin did not elaborate on what those understandings were, only that he hoped it would \u201copen the way to peace in Ukraine.\u201d\nDuring the Alaska summit, Putin laid out his demands for ending the war, which included no real concessions from Russia and for Ukraine to give up land that Moscow has yet to completely take over.\nUkraine slammed the talks and Russia\u2019s subsequent delays as proof that Putin is not negotiating in good faith and only seeking to prolong the war and capture as much territory as possible.\nWith Post wires"
