  "description": "FIFA president Gianni Infantino's closeness with deeply polarizing U.S. president could have ramifications for 2026 World Cup.",
  "content": "It\u2019s one thing for Gianni Infantino to debase himself, fawning over autocrats and human rights abusers.\n\nHis sycophancy is also sullying the World Cup, however, as sure as if the FIFA president took that iconic gold trophy once held by Pele\u0301, Maradona and Messi and dipped it in tar.\n\nThe men\u2019s World Cup next year is shaping up to be a North Korea-style state propaganda event, and Infantino is going right along with it. He stood beside Donald Trump as the president turned what was supposed to be an announcement that the draw will take place at the Kennedy Center into a 45-minute stream of lies Friday, smiling, laughing and agreeing with Trump as if he was a Cabinet member.\n\nAnd because sacrificing your dignity and self-respect doesn\u2019t go as far as it used to, Infantino came bearing more gifts! The first ticket to the July 19, 2026, final at MetLife Stadium, and a hint of a role in the December draw.\n\n\u201cAh! That\u2019s an interesting proposal,\u201d Infantino said, when someone asked if Trump will announce the results of the draw. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss that.\u201d\n\nInfantino even stood by while Trump suggested that Vladimir Putin \"may\" attend the tournament, despite Russia being banned from FIFA competitions since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFIFA and its leaders have never been paragons of virtue. Bribes and kickbacks were an accepted part of doing business, votes and support traded for bagsful of cash. Infantino\u2019s predecessor, Sepp Blatter, is still ostracized by FIFA for his shady dealings, and half of the members of the Executive Committee that voted on the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were fined, suspended or banned for life for corruption.\n\nBut the World Cup was always viewed separately from its leaders\u2019 tawdry behavior. FIFA and the (mostly) men who run it might be morally bankrupt, but soccer had center stage at the World Cup, the game a wonderful diversion from the ugliness of the world around it.\n\nUnder Infantino, however, that has changed.\n\nWhen the World Cup was awarded to Qatar, that country\u2019s leaders promised that it would not impose its local customs and rules on a global tournament. So much for that. Human rights violations were rampant, the LGBTQ community was targeted and longtime sponsor Budweiser discovered its $75 million sponsorship was worth less than warm beer.\n\nAll of this was fine \u2013 just fine! \u2013 with Infantino, who saved his outrage for the critics of his besties rather than the cheapening of a World Cup that upended the global calendar and had all the atmosphere and authenticity of a timeshare sales pitch.\n\nNow comes next summer\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe United States is sliding into autocracy, with Trump encouraging voter suppression in Texas, manufacturing a crime wave to justify a takeover of Washington, D.C., and retaliating against his enemies. And that was just in the last few days!\n\nTrump likes anything that can be used to exalt his glorious leadership, so he is, naturally, all in on the World Cup. And Infantino is happy to oblige his grandiosity.\n\nHe was late to FIFA's Congress because he was hobnobbing with Trump in the Middle East. He didn\u2019t step in when Trump crashed Chelsea\u2019s victory celebration after winning the Club World Cup, and he \u201clet\u201d Trump keep the original trophy. Now he\u2019s fawning over Trump\u2019s tales of Washington\u2019s \u201cresurgence\u201d and placating his overestimation of the U.S. men\u2019s national team\u2019s chances next summer.\n\n\u201cThe home team always have a good chance to win,\u201d Infantino said.\n\nThis is a team that lost four in a row earlier this year and got humiliated by Panama in the semifinals of the Nations League. At full-strength and at home, no less. Let\u2019s slow the roll.\n\nBy allowing Trump to co-opt the World Cup, Infantino is risking the success of the tournament, FIFA's crown jewel.\n\nTrump is a deeply polarizing president, and there is widespread opposition to many of his policies. Most of the rest of the world has an even dimmer view, which is already being reflected by a drop in foreign tourism. Allow the World Cup to become \u201cTrump\u2019s tournament,\u201d and Infantino should not be surprised if fans decide to sit it out. Or only go to games in Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe World Cup has always been a celebration of \"the beautiful game.\" Infantino is giving it a very ugly look.",

      "text": "Opinion: Club World Cup is latest way Infantino, FIFA betray soccer\nThe 32-team, month-long Club World Cup tournament adds to what is already an overcrowded calendar and threatens to dilute quality of the game.\nFor someone who is the head of soccer\u2019s global governing body, FIFA president Gianni Infantino sure does hate the sport. Or the players who play it, at least.\nThe expanded Club World Cup, the latest frontier in Infantino and FIFA\u2019s incessant cash grab, kicks off Saturday. An idea that no one was clamoring for, the 32-team, month-long tournament adds to what is already an overcrowded calendar and threatens to dilute the quality of the game.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d La Liga president Javier Tebas said in an interview with Cadena Cope radio, \u201ccompletely absurd.\u201d\nWell, yes. But what\u2019s a little thing like risk of injury and exhaustion when Infantino and his FIFA cronies can stuff more money into their pockets?\nOh, Infantino will say the Club World Cup is meant to expand the game. To bring a spotlight to teams outside of Europe and broaden soccer\u2019s appeal. But that is, to put it nicely, hogwash.\nThe Club World Cup is a glorified ego trip for Infantino, who put his name on the trophy and his face on a Panini sticker. He wants credit, and cash, and he doesn\u2019t really care about the long-term consequences.\nPlayers have, for years already, been complaining about the increasingly crowded calendar.\nSay you\u2019re a top men\u2019s player from one of Europe\u2019s powerhouse countries and you play in one of the top European leagues. The club schedule is 38 or 34 games, depending on the league. Champions League or Europa League games will add anywhere from eight to 17 more games. Domestic cups can mean another half-dozen or more.\nThen there\u2019s national team duty. There are qualifiers, for either the European championship or the World Cup. Friendlies. And, for the last seven years, the Nations League.\nThat adds up.\nEven before the Club World Cup starts, France and Inter Milan striker Marcus Thuram has played 56 games this season, according to FBRef.com. After playing 58 last season. Should Inter reach the Club World Cup final, Thuram will have gone more than 12 months without a significant break.\nHis France teammate Kylian Mbappe has played a whopping 64 games since last July \u2014 and that\u2019s with Real Madrid going out in the quarterfinals of the Champions League. Lamine Yamal, arguably the game\u2019s brightest young star, played in 65 games this season between Spain and Barcelona.\nThese aren\u2019t garbage minutes, either. Thuram, Mbappe, Yamal and the other top players are starting and playing most, if not all, of these games.\nChristian Pulisic has gotten grief for asking out of the U.S. men\u2019s national team roster for the Gold Cup so he can be in top form for next summer\u2019s World Cup, but can you blame him? According to FBRef.com and U.S. Soccer, Pulisic has played in 118 games for club and country since signing with Milan in July 2023.\nAnd that doesn\u2019t even take into account the transatlantic travel required when he plays for the USMNT during the club season. Pulisic is banged up and he\u2019s bone tired, and you can\u2019t keep running him into the ground if you want him in top form for next summer\u2019s World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\u201cAfter thoughtful discussions and careful consideration, we made the collective decision that this is the right moment for him to get the rest he needs,\u201d said Matt Crocker, U.S. Soccer\u2019s sporting director.\n\u201cThe objective is to ensure he\u2019s fully prepared to perform at the highest level next season.\u201d\nPlayers aren\u2019t the only ones showing signs of fatigue. Broadcasters worldwide yawned at the media rights for the Club World Cup before the now-Saudi-backed DAZN agreed at the 11th hour to take them. Ticket sales have been anemic, with FIFA having to cut prices even for games featuring Lionel Messi\u2019s Inter Miami.\nThis is a problem of FIFA\u2019s own making.\nInfantino is going heavy on the \u201chistorical\u201d nature of the Club World Cup, but that\u2019s a tough sell. Especially when the World Cup is just a year away and will be played in many of the same cities.\nFans don\u2019t have Saudi sugar daddies like Infantino and his FIFA brethren. If the choice for their disposable income is between next year\u2019s World Cup and a second-tier tournament that is not new, just revamped, and is being played in many of the same cities as the World Cup, that\u2019s not really a choice at all.\n\u201cFootball is such an important sport all over the world,\u201d Infantino said Tuesday.\nBe nice if he and FIFA treated it that way, rather than a means of feeding their own egos and bank accounts.\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour."

      "text": "World Cup draw will be held at Kennedy Center, Trump and FIFA announce\nPresident Donald Trump announced Friday that the 2026 World Cup draw will be held in Washington at the Kennedy Center, with the event set for Dec. 5.\nTrump was joined by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, vice president J.D. Vance, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell in the Oval Office for the announcement. Trump \u2014 seated with the World Cup trophy stationed on the Resolute Desk \u2014 noted that he had visited the Kennedy Center earlier on Friday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes \u2014 the best athletes in the world \u2014 to the cultural center of our nation\u2019s capital,\u201d said Trump.\nWhile FIFA did not have an official statement to coincide with Friday's White House press event, Infantino stated himself that the draw will commence at noon ET, moments before handing the World Cup trophy to Trump.\nThe news came as something of a surprise. In July, reports emerged that the World Cup draw would take place in Las Vegas, though a spokesperson for The Sphere shot down claims that the venue was the site of the event.\nThe D.C. region was not selected to host matches at the World Cup, with issues at Northwest Stadium eventually resulting in a joint Washington/Baltimore bid that was ultimately rejected. However, speaking in 2022, U.S. Soccer Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone did hint at plans to follow long-standing World Cup tradition, which has largely seen national capitals play a major role for the tournament. The last men's World Cup to not feature matches in the host country's capital city was in 1974, when West Germany did not hold matches in Bonn.\n\u201cOur nation\u2019s capital is very much going to be a huge part of this World Cup, even though they\u2019re not hosting games,\u201d said Parlow Cone shortly after the host cities were confirmed.\nThe Trump administration has in recent days instituted federal control over Washington's police force and called in national guard units from several states amid a sharp increase in visible law enforcement throughout the capital. The president insisting during Friday's announcement that the move has reduced crime. The move has drawn significant pushback in the region, with protests of the crackdown becoming a regular occurrence.\nThe 2026 edition of the men's World Cup \u2014 set to run from June 11 to July 19, 2026 \u2014 will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and will be the first to feature an expanded 48-team field. 11 U.S. cities will host matches, along with two in Canada and three in Mexico. The tournament final is set for MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., the same stadium that welcomed the recent 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final.\nWhat is World Cup draw? Kennedy Center event explained\nThe World Cup draw is a major event held before a given World Cup, which sets the schedule of games and bracket for the tournament. With each team only guaranteed three group stage games, the results of the draw are considered critical in gauging a given country's hopes of a deep tournament run.\nBased on the December 2025 FIFA rankings and a desire to prevent too many nations from one continent being paired together in the tournament's group stage, FIFA will sort the 48 qualifying teams into four pots.\nHost nations Canada (Group B), Mexico Group A), and the United States (Group D) have already been assigned to groups as seeded teams, with nine best-ranked teams in the world set to be the seeded sides in the other groups. The top two finishers from each group are guaranteed to advance to the knockout stage, while the final eight places will go to the best third-place finishers.\nWorld Cup 2026: What cities will host games?\nMatches at the 2026 World Cup will take place in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Here is a full list of cities and corresponding venues:\nCanada\n- Toronto (BMO Field)\n- Vancouver (BC Place)\nMexico\n- Guadalajara (Estadio Akron)\n- Mexico City (Estadio Azteca)\n- Monterrey (Estadio BBVA)\nUnited States\n- Atlanta (Mercedez-Benz Stadium)\n- Boston (Gillette Stadium)\n- Dallas (AT&T Stadium)\n- Houston (NRG Stadium)\n- Kansas City (Arrowhead Stadium)\n- Los Angeles (SoFi Stadium)\n- Miami (Hard Rock Stadium)\n- New York/New Jersey (MetLife Stadium)\n- Philadelphia (Lincoln Financial Field)\n- San Francisco Bay Area (Levi's Stadium)\n- Seattle (Lumen Field)"

      "text": "Trump approval holds at 40%, lowest of his term, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds\nWASHINGTON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's approval rating held at 40% in recent weeks, matching the lowest level of his current term, amid weak ratings from Hispanic voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Monday.\nThe six-day poll was conducted as economic data showed signs the U.S. labor market is weakening and as Trump oversees a sweeping immigration crackdown, while at the same time the Republican has been engaged in intense diplomacy to end a war between Russia and Ukraine.\nTrump's approval rating was unchanged from a late July Reuters/Ipsos poll, but has dropped seven percentage points since his first days back in the White House in January, when 47% of Americans gave him a thumbs-up.\nThe latest poll showed Hispanics, a group that swung toward Trump in last year's election, have also soured on the president. Some 32% approved of his performance in the White House, matching their lowest level of approval for Trump this year.\nMore than half of respondents -- 54%, including one in five Republicans -- said they thought Trump was too closely aligned with Russia, even as he ramped up a push to broker peace between Moscow and Kyiv. Trump has appeared to embrace Russia's claim that Ukraine must cede territory to Russia in order for the war to stop.\nTrump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, and the poll closed just ahead of the president's meeting on Monday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\nJust 42% of respondents approved of Trump's performance on crime and 43% thought he was doing a good job on immigration policy. On all policies, Trump's support came overwhelmingly from Republicans.\nAfter returning to the White House in January, Trump ordered a sweeping crackdown on people living in the country illegally, deploying masked agents to arrest and deport migrants across the country. The policy has triggered mass protests in cities including Los Angeles, where about half the population identifies as Latino and many people have family members who are recent immigrants.\nMore recently, Trump ordered federal agents and National Guard troops to aid in law enforcement in Washington, D.C., arguing that crime was rampant there. Statistics show that violent crime shot up in 2023 but has been rapidly declining since.\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 4,446 U.S. adults nationwide and online and had a margin of error of about 2 percentage points.\n(Reporting by Jason Lange; editing by Scott Malone and Deepa Babington)"

      "text": "Texas Republicans approve Trump-backed congressional map after Dems ended walkout\nTexas Republicans passed a new state congressional map intended to flip five Democratic-held U.S. House seats up for grabs in the 2026 elections after dozens of Democratic lawmakers ended a two-week walkout, temporarily delaying the bill's passage.\nIn an 88-52 vote on Aug. 20, Republican legislators, who have dominated Texas politics for more than two decades, undertook a rare mid-decade redistricting to help President Donald Trump improve their party's odds of holding a narrow U.S. House of Representatives majority amid political turmoil.\nIf the map under consideration had been in effect in 2024, Trump would have won 28 or 29 of the state's 38 districts, instead of the current 25, according to Texas Policy Research, a right-leaning organization that provides reports on the state legislature. Two other districts would also become more competitive for Republicans under the map.\nThe map, expected to be in synch with the state Senate's version and then eventually signed by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott before becoming official, has sparked a national redistricting war with governors of both parties threatening to initiate similar efforts in other states. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom is devising a strategy to redraw his state's map to convert five Republican seats.\nA Democratic hotbed, California is the nation's most populous state. The Texas map would shift conservative voters into districts currently held by Democrats and combine some districts that the party currently holds.\nAnalysts: Texas restricting essentially done deal\nAs the GOP partisan gerrymander bill could flip as many as five Democratic-held seats to Republican, the Texas legislation now heads to the Senate, where it could be approved as early as Aug. 21, one political analyst predicts.\n\"I think the deal is essentially done when you consider the Texas Legislature is pretty well-wired from a Republican standpoint,\" said Brian Sobel, a longtime political analyst based in the San Francisco Bay Area. \"They basically know where the (Senate) votes are before they're taken.\"\nSobel said it will be \u201ca fait accompli\u201d in Texas as Abbott will sign off on the redistricting. And it may help California Gov. Newsom's proposed special redistricting strategy that will go to voters this November, Sobel added.\n\"I think if Newsom needed any momentum for making his case to California, well, he just got it thanks to Texas,\" Sobel said. \"Newsom has to convince voters that this one-time breach is important to offset what Texas did.\"\nAnother analyst, John Cluverius, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, agrees.\n\"If California changes maps, then Indiana will maybe try to do something, and then maybe New York after that,\" Cluverius said. \"We could see a redistricting arms race that could be dangerous. All of this could also undermine voters\u2019 faith in the election process.\"\nTexas lawmaker: 'A dark day in history'\nFollowing the vote, Democratic Rep. Ron Reynolds said the vote would forever be known as \"a dark day in history.\"\n\"This map weakens the political power of Black and brown Texans and sets a dangerous precedent,\" Reynolds posted on X . \"I joined my Democratic colleagues in voting no and will do everything that I can to continue fighting against Trump\u2019s Texas Takeover!\"\n'We will push forward'\nAfter several hours of hearing Democratic opposition, Republican Rep. Todd Hunter told Texas House members that his party has enough votes to pass the redistricting bill.\nHunter said the U.S. Supreme Court allows for congressional redistricting, and they are going to take full advantage of it.\n\"We will not agree on this issue, but we will push forward,\" said Hunter, flanked by numerous state GOP House members. \"Republicans support it, Democrats do not, that\u2019s the bottom line.\"\nHunter then chastised the Democratic House members who fled the state for more than two weeks, stalling an eventual vote favoring redistricting.\n\"You chose to leave, that\u2019s your choice. We chose to stay that was our choice,\" Hunter said. \"This is the plan. It has been supported, it has counsel approval, and it absolutely should pass.\"\nLawmaker says fear of Hispanic voters motivated GOP plan\nRep. Erin Gamez, whose district represents South Texas, urged her colleagues to think of her majority Hispanic constituents when they vote to redistrict the state.\n\u201cAcross Texas and the nation, people should be able to choose their representatives and not the other way around,\u201d said Gamez, flanked by her Democratic colleagues, including Rep. Nicole Collier, who had spent more than 24 hours in the House Chambers in protest.\n\u201cAnd for those who think, 'This is just politics and gerrymandering doesn\u2019t affect me'; well, ladies and gentlemen, politics affects everything,\u201d Gamez said. \"The air that we breathe, the water that we drink, the books that we read \u2013 or do not allow others to read. It affects everything.\"\nGamez added that the vote \"is not about whether you are red or whether you are blue, it is about your voice and your representation.\"\nGamez said the proposed redistricting is a lie that\u2019s \"carving lines, building walls, and destroying communities.\" She had a message for her constituents.\n\"South Texas, they are drawing these lines because they are very, very afraid of Hispanic voices,\" Gamez said. \"And I think they should be.\"\nState lawmaker urges House to reject 'Texas takeover'\nAs Hunter pushed back against yet another proposed amendment to the GOP redistricting map amendment showing more minority representation \u2013 this time from Rep. Yvonne Davis, a veteran Democratic lawmaker \u2013 Hunter offered this short response:\n\"I simply like my plan better than hers,\" said Hunter, before the amendment was withdrawn.\nThat led to a back-and-forth squabble between Hunter and House Second Vice-Chair Ron Reynolds, who accused Hunter of reducing the state\u2019s African American majority congressional districts from four to two. Reynolds later urged the House to reject this \"Texas takeover.\"\n\"When you look in the mirror, will you ask whether you were on the right side of history for voting rights for all?\" Reynolds asked. \"Or on the wrong side with this racial gerrymandering map?\"\nObama approves Newsom\u2019s California redistricting plan\nFormer President Barack Obama said he approves of the California redistricting plan Newsom is promoting.\nDuring a National Democratic Redistricting Committee fundraiser on Tuesday, Obama said he believes Newsom\u2019s strategy is a \"responsible approach\" because it is contingent upon Texas breaking with past practice for redistricting.\nObama said Newsom's proposal is \"completely responsible,\" Obama said, according to the Associated Press.\nThe former president summed up Newsom's statement that, \"We\u2019re not going to completely maximize it,\" but rather \"We\u2019re only going to do it if and when Texas and/or other Republican states begin to pull these maneuvers. Otherwise, this doesn\u2019t go into effect.\"\nNewsom responded by thanking Obama on social media, saying the state has to stop Trump\u2019s \"attempts to rig our elections.\"\nTrump praises Texas for 'safe and secure' border\nTrump congratulated Texas for apparently recording zero illegal immigrant entries in the state in July.\nIn a Truth Social post on Aug. 19, Trump wrote, \u201cThe U.S. Border Patrol reported ZERO releases of Illegal Aliens into the Country.\u201d The president said the Texas border with Mexico is \u201cSafe and Secure, and the entire World knows it.\u201d\nTrump then encouraged the state\u2019s House GOP to pass the controversial redistricting map bill into law to keep the illegal entries stats down.\n\"Which is exactly why Texas Republicans need to help us WIN the 2026 Midterm Elections, and pass their new Bill, AS IS, for the ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL CONGRESSIONAL MAP!,\" Trump said. \"I call on all of my Republican friends in the Legislature to work as fast as they can to get THIS MAP to Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s desk, ASAP.\"\nAudience applauds as Republican condemns walkout\nApplause erupts in the House chamber as Hunter, a Republican, pushes back on Rep. Barbara Gervin-Hawkins, a Democrat from San Antonio.\n\"You left us for 18 days, and that\u2019s wrong!\" Hunter says. He previously accused her of talking over him as she asked him questions.\n\"Let me finish!\" he exclaimed.\n'This is a test'\nRep. Mihaela Plesa, a Democrat from Dallas, asked what had changed among voters between 2021 and 2025 that required redistricting.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about fairness or representation,\u201d Plesa said. \u201cIt\u2019s about rushing maps through before the 2026 midterm elections. If that\u2019s not the reason, why are we rushing this?\n\u201cIf my Republican colleagues reject this amendment, they are admitting, on record, that this bill isn\u2019t about fairness,\u201d said Plesa, her voice rising to scattered applause.\n\u201cThis is a test,\u201d Plesa continued, as she peered around the House floor. \u201cWhether this house stands for Democratic norms or unfair manipulation?\u201d\nDemocratic opposition is delaying a vote on redistricting\nOpposition from Democrats is delaying the House from voting on whether to pass the Republican plan to redraw congressional maps.\nRep. Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat from San Antonio, is now asking members to vote on whether the bill violates the Voting Rights Act\nDemocrat questions the origins of the congressional map\nRep. Chris Turner, who is leading the Democratic opposition, is questioning Hunter, the Republican author of the bill, about who created the congressional map they\u2019re proposing.\n\"All I know is I met with counsel,\" Hunter said. \"Counsel drafted it.\"\n\"You can\u2019t tell members who had the hand on the maps, moving cursors, moving precincts around?\" Turner asked.\n\"I can tell you that the law firm did it,\" Hunter said, but said he couldn\u2019t provide specific names.\nDemocrat highlights lack of Latino district in Dallas area\nRep. Jessica Gonzalez, a Democrat from Dallas, criticized the Texas congressional maps for not having an opportunity district for Latino Texans in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\nUnder the Voting Rights Act, an opportunity district usually has a small but not overwhelming majority of voting-age residents who are people of color.\nWho is Dustin Burrows, the Texas House speaker?\nBurrows is a lawyer from Lubbock, Texas, in the northwestern region of the state. He\u2019s served in the legislature for 10 years and became speaker in January.\nDemocrat calls redistricting 'discriminatory'\n\"House Bill 4 is an illegal and racially discriminatory congressional map that this body has no business passing,\" said Rep. Chris Turner, a Democrat from Grand Prairie.\nTurner is proposing changing the underlying bill, which he said \"surgically removes, strips away minority representation in the U.S. Congress.\"\nDemocrats scrutinize placement of Hispanic voters\nRep. Ramon Romero, a Democrat from Fort Worth, asked questions about the demographic makeup of the five new congressional districts.\nHunter says four of the five new districts are Hispanic-majority, but declines to say whether Hispanic voters tend to vote for one party over another.\nRepublican Rep. says redistricting is about helping Republicans\n\u201cThe underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: Improve Republican political performance,\u201d said Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican from Corpus Christi.\n\u201cWe are allowed to draw districts based on the basis of political performance,\u201d he said. He pointed to Supreme Court precedent that guides the law on partisan and race-based redistricting.\nHouse makes it difficult to leave the chamber ahead of vote\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows says no one will be permitted to leave the House chamber without a permission slip, a move that appears to be attempting to maintain the quorum.\nRep. Gina Hinojosa, a Democrat from Austin, repeatedly questioned whether the policy was constitutional. She asked if she would be subject to arrest if she left without a permission slip.\nBurrows, a Republican, warned people observing the session from the upper viewing area that the House prohibits \"demonstrations or outbursts\" and said the Sergeant at Arms would have them removed if they violate the policy.\nProtesters have become a common sight outside and inside the statehouse in recent weeks.\nPartisan gerrymandering is unpopular, and spreading\nPartisan map-drawing is widely unpopular among voters, and recent polling from YouGov shows that fewer than one-third of Americans support the Texas redistricting plan, and just under one-half disapprove of it. The plan is least popular among Democrats and Independents.\nIn direct retaliation to Texas' efforts, California is asking voters in a Nov. 4 election to allow lawmakers to draw five new Democratic-leaning seats, a direct retaliation to the effort in Texas. Redistricting efforts are ongoing in Florida and Ohio, and states such as Indiana, Missouri, and New York have also discussed redistricting.\nRedistricting typically occurs every 10 years after the U.S. Census to account for population changes, and mid-decade redistricting has historically been unusual. Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike have redrawn maps in their favor, a practice known as gerrymandering but voters in several Democratic states have passed constitutional amendments to distance partisan lawmakers from the process.\nHow the process is moving in Texas\nTexas' new map was listed on Wednesday's schedule for the state House, though it was not clear how quickly Republicans could move to approve it. The bill is still subject to debate on the floor, and Democrats can also introduce amendments to be voted on.\nDemocrats fled the state earlier this month to deny the Texas House a quorum to move the new congressional maps forward, and Republicans filed lawsuits to remove them from office and issued arrest warrants in attempts to bring them home.\nRepublican House leadership has assigned state law enforcement officers to monitor Democrats to ensure they would not leave the state again. One Democratic representative, Nicole Collier, slept in the Capitol building on the night of Aug. 18 rather than accept a police escort.\nContributing: Reuters\nCorrection: This story was updated to correct the first name of a state representative."

      "text": "FIFA president Gianni Infantino's screed on Qatar criticisms wrong, inappropriate | Opinion\nDOHA, Qatar \u2013 On the day before the World Cup began, FIFA celebrated Festivus.\nFor 90 minutes Saturday, FIFA president Gianni Infantino held an \u201cairing of grievances,\u201d taking aim in a deluded, hypocritical and factually ignorant screed at all those who have criticized soccer\u2019s governing body for putting the World Cup in Qatar.\nHe co-opted the plights of migrant workers and the LGBTQ community, bemoaning the fact he\u2019d been bullied as a child because of his red hair and freckles. He gave Qatar a pass for its continuing bigotry and exploitation because of what western countries once did. He chided critics for their double standards without the slightest recognition of his own.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad that we can\u2019t focus on football,\u201d Infantino lamented as he put on his martyr\u2019s cloak. \u201cYou want to criticize someone, come to me. Criticize me. Crucify me. I\u2019m here for that. Don\u2019t criticize the players, don\u2019t criticize Qatar.\u201d\nWho will win the World Cup? Predictions, picks for champion, Golden Boot and more\nOpinion: USMNT roster for World Cup in Qatar is young but talented, with few big surprises\nHow sweet of Infantino to defend the honor of his new Qatari besties, I wasn\u2019t sure they had any. But I suppose blind loyalty is what\u2019s demanded after all the millions the Qataris have put in the pockets of Infantino and other FIFA members over the last 12-plus years.\nInfantino isn\u2019t wrong to say the United States and European nations have had their own issues with human rights. The United States is still trying to heal the scars left on our society by slavery. Europe has been rebuilding its walls in recent years rather than tearing them down.\nBut those countries didn\u2019t buy a World Cup to try and sportswash their sins as Qatar did. Those countries haven\u2019t turned FIFA into their useful idiot as Qatar has.\n\u201cDeflection and whataboutery have always been at the core of Qatar\u2019s PR efforts to defend its rank failures, and now they have the FIFA president doing their work for them,\u201d Nicholas McGeehan, director of the human rights group FairSquare, said in response to Infantino\u2019s comments.\nFIFA screwed up. It gave Qatar the World Cup thinking it could keep its hosts in line. I\u2019ll be charitable and say maybe a few members even thought hosting the world\u2019s largest sporting event could spark change in the theocratic regime.\nQatar\u2019s rulers had no interest in any of that, however. They wanted to be considered one of the world\u2019s elites, and figured a shiny new stadium or eight would blind everyone to the country\u2019s raft of human rights abuses. And rather than even the slightest acknowledgment that mistakes have been made, Infantino spouted their party line.\nHe dismissed the unsafe conditions and low wages for migrant workers because at least they\u2019re making more than they would have in their home countries. He addressed LGBTQ fans\u2019 concerns for their safety in a country where homosexuality is still criminalized by saying Qatari officials had assured him that \u201ceveryone is welcome.\u201d\nThey\u2019d also once promised they wouldn\u2019t interfere with FIFA\u2019s sponsorship deals, only to ban alcoholic beer at stadiums two days before the start of the World Cup. But I digress.\n\u201cOf course there are still things that don\u2019t work and need to be addressed,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cBut this moral lesson giving, one-sided, it\u2019s just hypocrisy.\u201d\nTo dismiss standing up for the marginalized and those whose health and safety are put at risk, and to do it with such a display of petulance and anger, was astonishing to see from the head of a global sports organization. This isn\u2019t a Seinfeld episode. Real people have died. Real people are afraid for their health and safety. Real people are being treated as if they are not fully human.\nThat Infantino and his Qatari friends have been rankled by the criticisms is simply too damn bad.\n\u201cDemands for equality, dignity and compensation cannot be treated as some sort of culture war \u2013 they are universal human rights that FIFA has committed to respect in its own statutes,\u201d Amnesty International\u2019s Steve Cockburn said.\nInfantino said repeatedly that engaging with people is more effective at fixing societal ills than hammering away with criticism. Perhaps next time he should heed his own words.\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour."

      "text": "FBI searches home of Trump critic and former national security adviser John Bolton\nWASHINGTON \u2212 FBI agents searched former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s house in suburban Maryland, in what the agency called a \u201ccourt authorized activity\" and critics of the administration called \"vindictive\" and \"unnecessary.\"\nBolton, who served in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, was previously investigated for allegedly including classified information in his 2020 book about the administration. But the Justice Department dropped that inquiry without charges.\nBolton has become a vocal critic of the administration\u2019s foreign policy and called the president unfit to serve. Trump, who revoked Bolton's security detail and his security clearance after returning to the White House this year, called Bolton a \u201clowlife\u201d on Aug. 22 but said he didn\u2019t know more about the search than what he saw on television.\nVice President JD Vance said \u201cclassified documents are certainly part of\u201d the search of Bolton\u2019s house and not political retaliation, in an interview with \u201cMeet the Press with Kristen Welker\" that will air Aug. 24. Here's what you need to know about the search:\nBolton in 2020: Trump efforts to block his book all about politics, not classified information\nJohn Bolton said in a 2020 USA TODAY interview that then-President Donald Trump didn\u2019t want Bolton\u2019s tell-all memoir coming out before the November presidential election and that Trump\u2019s effort to block its publication \u201chas nothing to do with classified information.\u201d\nBolton made the comments in a June 18, 2020, interview with USA TODAY\u2019s Susan Page, referring to Trump's accusations he had included classified information in his book, \"The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department at the time started a criminal investigation and filed a federal lawsuit to block publication of Bolton's $2 million book, alleging that it contained \u201csignificant amounts of classified information,\u201d including some classified as \u201cTOP SECRET.\u201d The inquiry was dropped without charges.\n\"In my view, it was never my intention to disclose classified information. I had plenty to write about without doing that,\u201d Bolton told Page at the time. As a result, he said, \u201cI didn't really feel I had to submit the book for pre-publication review for that reason, but I did out of abundance of caution.\u201d\nBolton said he and his lawyer went through an arduous four-month classification review process and the government itself in its complaint agreed that there was no more classified information in the manuscript.\nBut then the Trump administration went back to do a second review, Bolton said, to \u201ctry and stretch out whatever they can.\u201d\n\u201cI think the main thing that the president wants to avoid is the book coming out before the election. This has nothing to do with classified information,\u201d Bolton told Page. \u201cIt's the revelation about the president himself that bothers him. He's not worried about foreign governments reading this book. He's worried about the American people reading this book.\"\n--Josh Meyer and Susan Page\nVance says classified documents are part of Bolton inquiry\nVice President JD Vance said \u201cclassified documents are certainly part of\u201d the search of Bolton\u2019s house but federal authorities have broad concerns about the former national security adviser, in an interview with \u201cMeet the Press with Kristen Welker.\u201d\nVance said the investigation is \u201cin the very early stages\u201d and that if no evidence of crimes is found Bolton wouldn\u2019t be charged.\n\u201cClassified documents are certainly part of it, but I think that there's a broad concern about, about Ambassador Bolton,\u201d Vance told NBC.\nVance denied Bolton was targeted because he is a critic of the administration.\n\u201cWe are investigating Ambassador Bolton, but if they ultimately bring a case, it will be because they determine that he has broken the law,\u201d Vance told NBC. \u201cWe're going to be deliberate about that, because we don't think that we should throw people even if they disagree with us politically, maybe especially if they disagree with us politically, you shouldn't throw people willy-nilly in prison.\u201d\n--Bart Jansen\nFBI confirms activity at Bolton house but doesn't identify target of investigation\nThe FBI confirmed the activity around Bolton\u2019s home but didn\u2019t identify the target of the investigation before declining further comment.\n\u201cThe FBI is conducting court authorized activity in the area,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cThere is no threat to public safety.\u201d\nJohn Bolton recently described Trump\u2019s second term as \u2018a retribution presidency\u2019\nFormer Trump national security advisor John Bolton said Aug. 10 that he was worried about President Donald Trump\u2019s vow to get revenge against him and other outspoken critics, describing Trump\u2019s second term as \u201ca retribution presidency.\u201d\nTrump was asked by ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl ABC News \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos\u201d about what Karl described as \u201cTrump's retribution campaign we're seeing at the FBI and the Justice Department.\u201d\n\u201cYou're obviously on his enemies list. At least Kash Patel's enemies list,\u201d Karl said in reference to Trump\u2019s FBI director. \u201cAre you worried that they're going to come after you in some way? I mean, he's hinted at it before.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I think he's already come after me and several others in withdrawing the protection that we had for \u2026 the Iranians for the attack on Qasem Suleimani,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cSo I think, and I said in the new forward to the paperback edition of my book, I think it is a retribution presidency.\u201d\n--Josh Meyer\nFBI search \u2018an obvious act of intimidation,\u2019 says former Obama White House ethics czar\nFormer White House ethics czar Norm Eisen called the FBI action \u201can obvious act of intimidation,\u201d and another example of the double standards President Donald Trump is applying \u201cas he puts himself and his cronies above the law, and weaponizes it against his perceived enemies.\u201d\nEisen, executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund and a former Obama administration ethics lawyer, said in a statement that the FBI action in \u201craiding the home of a high- profile critic in this way is an attack on the fundamental American right to disagree with the government.\u201d\n\u201cIf this President, who tramples on the Constitution and laws every day, is willing to abuse his power to go after his own former National Security Adviser, he can do it to anyone,\u201d Eisen said in the statement co-written with Susan Corke, executive director of Democracy Defenders Fund.\n\u201cAs prominent Republicans pointed out this morning, when the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago under the Biden Administration, it negotiated with President Trump\u2019s team for a year beforehand,\u201d Eisen and Corke wrote. \u201cAnd his possession of those documents was defended by none other than his current FBI Director Kash Patel.\u201d\n--Josh Meyer\nFBI search may be \u201ca lawful search, but still completely unwarranted,\u2019 former DOJ official says\nFormer senior Justice Department prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said the FBI action at John Bolton\u2019s residence may be \u201ca lawful search\u201d but expressed concern that President Donald Trump is trying to equate it to the court-ordered search of his Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022.\nThe Mar-a-Lago search warrant to find classified documents Trump took with him when leaving office in January 2021 \u201cwas necessary after repeated attempts verbally and through a subpoena to obtain the thousands of government documents being kept there,\u201d said Weissmann, a lead prosecutor in Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\u201cOnly when that failed, was a search warrant required to be obtained and executed. So key issues will be what notice was given to Bolton, if any (my surmise is none at all), and the volume of alleged documents (if any),\u201d Weissmann wrote on Substack.\n\u201cThis may be, at the end of the day, a lawful search, but still completely unwarranted and inappropriate government activity,\u201d Weissmann, a frequent critic of Trump, wrote. \u201cRight now, we do not know enough facts, but I would worry about those who make it seem like this is just doing what the DOJ did with respect to the Trump compound in FLA.\u201d\n--Josh Meyer\nTrump calls Bolton \u2018lowlife\u2019 but knows little about FBI search\nTrump told reporters Aug. 22 that he knew little about the FBI searching Bolton\u2019s home but that he is a \u201clowlife.\u201d He said the Justice Department would probably brief him on the search.\n\"I'm not a fan of John Bolton,\" Trump told reporters at The People\u2019s House museum near the White House. \"He's a real, sort of a lowlife.\"\nJournalist livestreaming FBI Bolton raid, calls it \u2018theatrical.\u2019 \u2018Doing it this way allows lots of pictures.\u2019\nJournalists and neighbors are lined up outside John Bolton's home in Bethesda to watch \u2013 and livestream -- the FBI search of the Trump critic's home. One of them is Benjamin Wittes, the editor in chief of Lawfare, which has been critical of the Trump administration Justice Department.\nWittes was using his cameraphone and Substack journalism platform to livestream the action, available here.\nWittes \u201chas been chronicling Trump's acts of retribution on a near-daily basis,\u201d according to CNN, which reported on Wittes\u2019 livestream, calling the FBI action \"theatrical\" and noting that \"doing it this way allows lots of pictures.\"\n--Josh Meyer\nAttorney General Pam Bondi: 'Justice will be pursued'\nThe Justice Department didn't immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment on the investigation into Bolton. However, the department's head, Attorney General Pam Bondi, re-posted FBI Director Kash Patel's morning statement on X that \"NO ONE is above the law.\" Above that post, Bondi included a message of her own.\n\"America\u2019s safety isn\u2019t negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always,\" Bondi said above Patel's message. She didn't clarify what she was referring to.\n\u2013 Aysha Bagchi\nBolton lawyer has claimed in the past his 2020 memoir contained no classified information despite White House claims\nCharles Cooper, a lawyer who has represented Bolton in the past, was unavailable for comment on Aug. 22, a Cooper aide said.\nBut in 2020, when in news broke of Bolton\u2019s forthcoming book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,\u201d Cooper defended it against Trump White House accusations that it contained top-secret information.\n\"We do not believe that any of that information could reasonably be considered classified,\u201d Cooper wrote in a letter to the White House, Axios reported at the time.\nThe White House had made public a Jan. 23, 2020, letter addressed to Cooper that claimed Bolton's manuscript contains \"significant amounts of classified information\" that could \"cause exceptionally grave harm\" to U.S. national security, Axios said.\n--Josh Meyer\nBolton faces \u2018serious legal risk\u2019 over book, but timing of search appears \u2018vindictive\u2019: expert\nMark Zaid, a national security lawyer who represents whistleblowers against the government, said in a social media post Aug. 22 that \u201cthere is serious legal risk for Bolton\u201d from the dispute over his book.\u201cBut timing of this raid is highly \u2013 and I mean highly \u2013 suspicious,\u201d Zaid said. \u201cLooks like retaliatory, vindictive behavior.\u201d--Bart Jansen\nTrump administration has accused Bolton of using classified info in book\nThe Justice Department during Trump's first term filed a federal lawsuit and started a criminal investigation into Bolton over allegations that the book, \"The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,\" contained classified information.\n\"The United States seeks an order requiring Defendant to abide by his contractual and fiduciary duties to complete the pre-publication review process and not disclose classified information without written authorization, thereby protecting the national security of the United States,\" according to the filing.\nBolton\u2019s attorney, Chuck Cooper, called the lawsuit \u201ca transparent attempt to use national security as a pretext to censor\u201d Bolton.\nA judge rejected the lawsuit\u2019s request to block the book and the Justice Department dropped both the lawsuit and the criminal inquiry during the Biden administration.\nThe lawsuit filed in June 2020 alleged that Ellen Knight, the senior director for records access at the National Security Council, found \u201csignificant amounts of classified information\u201d including some classified as \u201cTOP SECRET,\u201d in the $2 million book while reviewing it for publication.\nBut the lawsuit alleged that Bolton was frustrated with the pace of the review and chose to publish before waiting for it to be completed, despite having signed classified nondisclosure agreements.\nBolton had been targeted in Iranian assassination plot\nTrump canceled Bolton\u2019s security detail despite the discovery of an Iranian plot to kill him. A member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Shahram Poursafi, was charged in 2022 in a murder-for-hire plot targeting Bolton.The plot was in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed Iran commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020 in Baghdad, according to Justice Department officials.\nFBI Director Kash Patel: 'NO ONE is above the law'\n\u201cNO ONE is above the law,\u201d Patel said in a social media post Aug. 22 after the search began. \u201c@FBI agents on mission.\u201d\nBolton didn\u2019t mention the search in a social media post Aug. 22 but said he didn\u2019t see \u201cany progress\u201d in Trump leading peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.\n\u201cMeanwhile, meetings will continue because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don't see these talks making any progress,\u201d Bolton said.\nBolton, a Trump critic, had said Putin 'clearly won' summit with Trump\nEarlier, Bolton had told CNN after Trump met with Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin on Aug. 15 that Putin \"clearly won\" the summit in Alaska.\n\u201cIt\u2019s far from over, but I\u2019d say Putin achieved most of what he wanted,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cTrump achieved very little.\u201d\nFormer FBI deputy director calls search 'really stunning' on CNN\nAndrew McCabe, a former deputy director FBI, told CNN on Aug. 22 the search was \"really stunning.\" McCabe said there were reasons to look at the search \"with a jaundiced eye\" because of what might have motivated the search warrant.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think many people saw this one coming,\" McCabe said. \u201cThere is this very fraught relationship between the two, and the President's history of going after people, using the level, the levers of power that he has access to, particularly the Department of Justice, to go after people he doesn't like.\""

      "text": "Trump claims FIFA gifted Club World Cup trophy to White House: 'You can have it forever'\nChelsea may have claimed the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, but according to Donald Trump, the original tournament trophy remains at the White House.\nThe English Premier League power stunned observers in Sunday's final by rolling past Paris Saint-Germain 3-0, an upset to cap off the first edition of a massively expanded tournament. President Trump \u2014 who spent plenty of time ahead of the event bonding with FIFA head Gianni Infantino \u2014 made his presence known after the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., taking the field to boos before lingering among Chelsea players in an awkward trophy ceremony.\nEventually, Chelsea captain Reece James managed to hoist the trophy, designed by Tiffany and Co. and inspired by the Voyager space probes. Still, per the president, that may not have been the same trophy that has spent much of the last few months sitting in the Oval Office.\nHere's what President Trump said about the Club World Cup trophy:\nTrump: Original Club World Cup trophy remains at White House\nOn Sunday, Club World Cup broadcaster DAZN conducted an interview with President Trump, who declared that he was told by FIFA that the trophy originally unveiled at the White House back in March could remain there in perpetuity.\n\"I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' claimed Trump, before stating that FIFA officials replied, \"'We\u2019re never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We\u2019re making a new one.' And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.\"\nFIFA had not previously announced plans to make a second Club World Cup trophy, while Chelsea's official Instagram page included a photo of airplane pilots holding the trophy \u2014 replica or not \u2014 before the team departed for London.\nThe Club World Cup trophy seems to have become part of the decor in the Oval Office since Infantino joined Trump to reveal its design to the world. It has been present for some soccer-related moments, like a bizarre event where the president offered his take on world affairs while confused-looking Juventus players stood in the background. However, it has also remained in the Oval Office during moments with no soccer context, lingering in the background as Trump awarded Elon Musk a key to the White House in May, among other instances.\nUSA TODAY Sports' 48-page special edition commemorates 30 years of Major League Soccer, from its best players to key milestones and championship dynasties to what exciting steps are next with the World Cup ahead.

      "text": "World Cup has just started but legacy of tournament has already been secured | Opinion\nAL KHOR, Qatar \u2013 The stadiums are spectacular, stunning displays of both architecture and art. The Doha waterfront is beautiful, and the skyline in Lusail is breathtaking. The fans \u2013 the real ones, anyway \u2013 are a festive delight.\nIf only it wasn\u2019t all so gross.\nThe World Cup finally kicked off Sunday, 12 years after Qatar bought, err won, the right to host. Contrary to what FIFA president Gianni Infantino would have you believe, the criticism of the Qataris is not hypocrisy nor is it unjust. The stadiums, the skyscrapers, this whole event has been paid for in blood.\n\u201cWe invested for the good of all humanity,\u201d Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s emir, said during the opening ceremony.\nThat\u2019s as big a farce as that VAR call on what should have been Ecuador\u2019s first goal in what ended up being a 2-0 win over Qatar. The emir and his family want to be a power, both in the region and beyond, and they saw the World Cup as their entr\u00e9e.\nFortunately for them, Infantino and his fellow FIFA members are feckless grifters who are unbothered by human rights abuses so long as the money is good. I\u2019d say they sold their souls, but no one is na\u00efve enough to think they ever had them.\nNEWSLETTER: Get daily news and stories delivered directly to your inbox\nOPINION: FIFA president Infantino's screed on Qatar criticisms wrong, inappropriate\nSo here we are. Thousands of migrant workers were exploited and abused to build the gleaming palaces for the World Cup, and an untold number died. Despite the emir promising that everyone is welcome in Qatar, homosexuality is still illegal and, after Friday\u2019s reversal on the sale of alcoholic beer at stadiums, the LGBTQ community is petrified at what other promises will be broken. Women remain second-class citizens.\nAnd FIFA has gone along with all these horrors without a second thought, giving Qatar an assist as it sportswashes its sins away.\n\u201cWelcome to celebrate football, because football unites the world!\u201d Infantino said at the opening ceremony.\nThat\u2019s the biggest disappointment of all.\nSports is society\u2019s great equalizer, a common ground that bridges language barriers, politics and religion, and no sport is more egalitarian than soccer. It\u2019s played in every corner of the world, by men and women, young and old, rich and poor.\nIt isn\u2019t right that the World Cup, the crown jewel of this global game, has been held almost exclusively in Europe and the Americas. The Middle East deserved to host a World Cup, just as Africa did 12 years ago, and it could have been transformative.\nImagine if the Qataris \u2013 who, last I checked, have money to burn \u2013 had used their construction projects as an exemplar for worker\u2019s rights. Imagine if they\u2019d used these last 12 years to encourage tolerance and respect. What a message that would have sent not just to the rest of the region, but the rest of the world.\nInstead, Qatar\u2019s World Cup has further marginalized some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. It has sanctioned bigotry and hate. It has sullied the beautiful game.\nNow that the tournament has started, Qatar and FIFA are no doubt hoping that attention will shift to the games. That we\u2019ll be so entranced by Brazil\u2019s poetic style, France\u2019s flow and Lionel Messi\u2019s last chance to lift the Jules Rimet Trophy that we\u2019ll forget how morally bankrupt and inauthentic everything about this World Cup is.\nBut you cannot sit in these majestic stadiums and not think about their human cost. You cannot see crowds of fans and not wonder who among them would be subject to persecution simply for being who they are. You cannot see the close-ups of the Qatari fan section, with nary a woman in sight, and not feel desperate for the women and girls who live here.\nThis will be the enduring legacy of the World Cup in Qatar, and nothing that happens over the next four weeks can change that.\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour."

      "text": "Six months into his second term, public evaluations of President Donald Trump\u2019s job performance have grown more negative. His job approval stands at 38% (60% disapprove), and fewer Americans now attribute several positive personal characteristics to him than did so during the campaign.\nTwo of the new administration\u2019s signature accomplishments \u2013 the rollout of its tariff policies and the tax and spending law known as the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d \u2013 garner considerably more disapproval than approval:\n- 61% of Americans disapprove of Trump\u2019s tariff policies, while 38% approve.\n- 46% disapprove of the tax and spending law, while 32% approve (23% say they are unsure).\nWhile there are wide partisan divides over both initiatives \u2013 with Republicans largely supportive and Democrats largely in opposition \u2013 Democratic disapproval substantially outpaces Republican approval.\nRead Chapter 3 for more on views of Trump\u2019s economic policies.\nThe latest national survey by Pew Research Center \u2013 conducted Aug. 4-10 among 3,554 adults \u2013 also finds that a 53% majority say Trump is making the federal government work worse, while only about half as many (27%) say he is making the government work better. (Two-in-ten say he is making things about equally better and worse.)\nBoth Republicans and Democrats now offer more negative assessments of Trump\u2019s impact on the federal government than they had predicted in a survey conducted in the weeks immediately following Trump\u2019s inauguration:\n- 55% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now say Trump is improving the way the federal government works \u2013 while 16% say he\u2019s making things worse and 29% say his effect is a mix of positive and negative. In the weeks after he took office, 76% of Republicans expected he would make government work better.\n- 87% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say Trump is worsening the way government functions, up from 78% who said this at the beginning of his term.\nTrump\u2019s job performance and personal traits\nTrump\u2019s approval rating has slipped 3 percentage points over the last two months and is down 9 points since shortly after he took office. This drop is attributable to a combination of declining approval among his 2024 backers and adults who did not vote in November:\n- The vast majority of Trump\u2019s 2024 voters continue to approve of his job performance \u2013 but that share is down to 85% from 88% in June and 95% in the weeks after his inauguration.\n- 32% of 2024 nonvoters now approve of Trump\u2019s job performance \u2013 down from 36% in June and 45% at the beginning of his term.\nPeople who identify as strong Republicans continue to overwhelmingly approve of Trump\u2019s job performance: 93% do so today, little different than the 96% who approved at the outset of his presidency. But there has been substantial erosion in his approval over this period among those who identify as Republicans but not strongly, as well as among independents who lean toward the GOP: About six-in-ten of those in these groups approve of Trump\u2019s performance today, down from roughly three-quarters at the start of his second term.\nPublic assessments of Trump on several personal traits are also more negative than they were in 2024. Fewer now say he cares about the needs of ordinary people (37% today, 42% last summer), is a good role model (29% now, 34% then) or is mentally sharp (48% now, 53% then).\nTrump is widely described as standing up for what he believes in: 68% say this today, identical to the share who said this last summer.\nRead Chapter 1 for more on Trump\u2019s job approval and personal traits.\nOther key findings\nFewer than half of Americans express confidence in Trump on key issues asked on the survey. But Americans express somewhat more confidence in Trump to negotiate trade agreements (47% are at least somewhat confident) and to handle immigration (46%) than on some other issues, including foreign policy (43%) and health care policy (38%). Read more in Chapter 2.\nConfidence in Trump to make wise decisions about the war between Ukraine and Russia is now lower than it was before he took office. Today, 40% of U.S. adults say they are at least somewhat confident in Trump\u2019s decision-making on this conflict; last July, 45% expressed confidence. Republican confidence has declined by 8 percentage points over this period (73% of Republicans now say they are confident in Trump to handle this issue, down from 81% last summer). As was the case last year, only about one-in-ten Democrats express confidence in Trump to handle this issue.\nRelated: How Americans view the Trump administration\u2019s approach to the Russia-Ukraine war\nSeven-in-ten Americans disapprove of the Trump administration\u2019s handling of information related to the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, while 25% approve. GOP views are fairly divided (53% disapprove of the administration\u2019s handling, while 44% approve), with disapproval higher among younger Republicans than older Republicans. Democrats overwhelmingly express disapproval (90%).\nMost Americans also distrust what the administration is saying about the Epstein issue: 63% say they have little or no trust in what the administration is saying, including 88% of Democrats and 38% of Republicans. About a quarter of Republicans say they trust a great deal or fair amount of what the administration is saying (34% say they trust some of what it is saying)."

      "text": "FIFA, Qatar both get what they deserve with World Cup beer debacle | Opinion\nTwo days before the World Cup opens, FIFA reverses course and announces alcoholic beer won't be sold around stadiums as originally planned.\nDOHA, Qatar \u2013 Imagine that. People who bribe and cheat to get what they want aren\u2019t to be trusted.\nFIFA got what it so richly deserved Friday, stabbed in the back by the same folks whose indifference to human rights the sport\u2019s governing body has spent the last 12 years ignoring and excusing simply because the price was right. Now FIFA\u2019s reputation \u2013 or whatever was left of it after all its other greed and corruption \u2013 is worth less than Twitter, and its relationship with one of its oldest and most lucrative sponsors has been trashed.\nAnd for what? A World Cup that feels slapped together despite more than a decade of planning and has all the authenticity of a Kardashian. Great job, FIFA executives, I hope those extra riches in your bank accounts were worth cheapening the world\u2019s biggest sporting event, your crown jewel.\nFIFA announced Friday afternoon, a mere two days before the World Cup is to begin, that alcoholic beer won\u2019t be sold at any of the eight stadiums in Qatar as originally planned. No explanation, no apologies to fans who spent thousands on tickets and travel under the assumption that Qatari organizers would live up to their promise that local customs wouldn\u2019t be imposed on a global event.\nJust \u2026 no beer.\n\u201cThe tournament organizers appreciate AB InBev\u2019s understanding and continuous support to our joint commitment to cater for everyone,\u201d FIFA said in a statement confirming it was shelving AB InBev\u2019s Budweiser products.\nExcept FIFA isn\u2019t catering to everyone. It\u2019s catering to the Qataris and only the Qataris. And it\u2019s doing so because Qatar offered FIFA members millions during the World Cup bidding process, and those FIFA members took them without a second thought.\nNo doubt they assumed it would be graft as usual. They\u2019d take the wads of cash in exchange for their vote and then everybody would consider the debt paid.\nThe Qataris, however, had other ideas.\nFULL COVERAGE: Follow all the action from the World Cup\nROSTERS: Meet the teams from the U.S., Canada and Mexico\nOPINION: Once a given, USMNT's choices at goalkeeper now loom large at World Cup\nThey wanted the tournament moved to the fall and FIFA acquiesced. They wanted to push up the start date by a day only three months before the tournament and FIFA said fine. They wanted a Nobel Peace Prize for agreeing to what should be the bare minimum in human rights for both migrant workers and the LGBTQ community and FIFA ran to get the nominating form.\nSo when Qatari officials decided it would be unseemly for fans to see alcohol at the stadiums \u2013 with some even consuming it, heaven forbid! \u2013 FIFA had no capacity to say no. Even if its spinelessness came at the expense of a loyal and lucrative partner.\nBudweiser has been a major sponsor since the 1986 World Cup, and it paid a reported $75 million for the right to be FIFA\u2019s exclusive beer provider. But the Qataris spent untold millions in bribes, and then spent billions building FIFA shiny new stadiums and hotels, and apparently that wins.\nFIFA\u2019s betrayal will cost it with sponsors, who will no doubt think twice before doing business with a partner that would sell them out for a higher bidder. And Egypt and Saudi Arabia can forget their hopes of a joint bid with Greece for the 2030 World Cup, because no sponsor is going to sign on for round two of this absurdity.\nBut Qatar won\u2019t be unscathed by this, either.\nThe World Cup is supposed to be its coming-out party, the chance to show the 1.2 million fans who come and their friends back home what an attractive and cosmopolitan place Qatar is. That carefully constructed \u2013 some would call it artificial \u2013 image has now been shattered.\nQatar still harbors hope of hosting an Olympics, too, having been unsuccessful in its bids for the 2016, 2020 and 2032 Summer Games. Good luck with that now given some of FIFA\u2019s sponsors are also big spenders in the Olympic movement. International Olympic Committee members are every bit as craven as their FIFA counterparts, but they\u2019re not as naked in their greed.\nBy chasing Qatar\u2019s cash, FIFA cost itself. Because it threw its weight around now, Qatar limited its influence in the future. No one wins in this debacle.\nExcept those of us who said putting the World Cup and the alcohol-fueled party that comes with it in a conservative Islamic country was a terrible idea, and are delighted to see FIFA and Qatar paying the price.\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour."

  "argos_summary": "Gianni Infantino\u2019s close ties to Donald Trump and his willingness to align FIFA with the former president\u2019s political agenda have drawn criticism for compromising the integrity of the World Cup. The 2026 draw announcement at the Kennedy Center, Trump\u2019s speculation about Vladimir Putin\u2019s attendance, and Infantino\u2019s support for a 32\u2011team Club World Cup have all been seen as attempts to use the tournament for political and commercial gain. Meanwhile, FIFA\u2019s history of corruption, the controversial Qatar hosting and human\u2011rights concerns, and the decision to cancel alcohol at Qatari stadiums illustrate the organization\u2019s ongoing ethical challenges. The article argues that Infantino\u2019s actions risk alienating fans and tarnishing the sport\u2019s reputation on the global stage.",
