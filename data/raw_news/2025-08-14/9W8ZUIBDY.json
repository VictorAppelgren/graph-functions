  "title": "Trump Revokes Biden\u2019s Competition Executive Order",
  "description": "Biden\u2019s competition executive order centralized power instead of expanding free enterprise. Trump just revoked it - good news, but deregulation still requires bigger steps",
  "content": "Donald Trump just scrapped President Biden\u2019s 2021 \u201cExecutive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s good news. In a column that summer of four years ago (\u201cHow Biden\u2019s Executive Order On Promoting Competition Instead Consolidates Government Power\u201d I detailed how Biden\u2019s order was uninterested in actually unleashing competition, and instead about expanding Washington\u2019s power over the economy and calling it competition, classic newspeak style.\n\nBiden\u2019s directive even created a \u201cCompetition Council\u201d with a staff of lordly busybodies that hosted a series of confabs, reinforcing the top-down cartelization and centralization enshrined in the order. That\u2019s gone now\u2014but policymakers need to ensure there\u2019s not a new Trump version of the same.\n\nTrump\u2019s delightfully short and sweet new order (\"Revocation of Executive Order on Competition\u201d) simply \u201chereby\u201d revokes Biden\u2019s. The only surprising part is that this revocation didn\u2019t come earlier since Trump has axed numerous Biden orders as part of the overall regulatory streamlining project.\n\nWhen Biden\u2019s 2021 order appeared, media headlines dutifully promised crackdowns on \u201cmonopolies\u201d and a boost to competition \u201cacross the board.\u201d The reality of the order and a series of reinforcing actions during that administration was an aggressive blueprint for centralizing authority in sectors that were already among the most heavily regulated and subsidized in our entire economy. Agriculture, airlines, broadband, banking, health care, technology policy\u2014all of them were in Biden\u2019s crosshairs, but curiously enough total strangers to laissez-faire.\n\nDespite promising to promote competition, the order didn\u2019t remove regulatory constraints but amplified them, even engaging so-called independent agencies like the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission in expanded antitrust and pricing interventions. It unleashed regulators from the modest restraints of the prior Trump 1.0 era, after having already issued a directive called \u201cModernizing Regulatory Review\u201d that did away with traditional audit-like review of regulations altogether.\n\nBiden claimed during the signing of his order to be \u201ca proud capitalist,\u201d but the directive\u2019s content told another story, as, in fact, did Biden\u2019s embrace of unbounded \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d intervention. Biden saw government as both an architect and referee of markets, tasking it with preservation of \u201ccompetition\u201d and maintenence of progressive social policies in ESG and DEI.\n\nThe few deregulatory crumbs of that era, like over-the-counter hearing aids and some occupational licensing relief, were overwhelmed by moves toward federal agenda-setting. The winners in such an environment are political appointees, entrenched regulators and politically connected corporations and cronies instead of consumers, entrepreneurs and small businesses.\n\nTrump\u2019s revocation this week ends the formal framework for this government-first \u201ccompetition\u201d policy. That\u2019s necessary and welcome but not the end of concerns. Despite the aggressive rollbacks by the likes of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Departments of Energy and Transportation, agencies retain all their powers for the next set of progressive appointees to unbox yet again.\n\nInstead, abolition of departments and agencies outright, plus broader regulatory reforms to constrain the structure that remains, is necessary. But that requires congressional action; and so far, while Congress has voted to overturn more than a dozen Biden rules, it has enacted no broad regulatory reforms whatsoever.\n\nWithout the big steps, the bureaucracy will keep finding ways to steer markets, pick winners and losers and embed itself into emerging sectors like artificial intelligence and smart cities and infrastructure.\n\nThe most worrisome elements at the moment are Trump\u2019s own swampy impulses that not infrequently manifest, such as tariffs (the most prominent), antitrust regulation, a sovereign wealth fund, campus speech codes, regulation of concert ticket prices, drug price interventions and the like.\n\nIn the wake of Trump abolishing Biden\u2019s competition order, it would represent a huge fail for some of his own policies to serve as the basis for future progressive regulatory power grabs, but they will if the trend continues.\n\nTrump\u2019s revocation of Biden\u2019s misnamed competition executive order is a move in the right direction. Needed now is sustained commitment to full-throated deregulation that goes beyond undoing the overreach of the last administration and that rolls back decades of accumulated centralization that began more than a century before Biden. Thus far, Trump is not wholeheartedly doing that, but there are at least three years to go to turn the ship around.\n\nAs I\u2019d fretted on these pages when Biden issued his 2021 competition order, \u201cNo one seems concerned over the resultant cronyism and corporate welfare, nor over the temporal distortion of technology advancements, nor over intellectual property ambiguities created by government banging around in the entrepreneurial process with its \u2018appropriations\u2019.\u201d\n\nLike the Democrats, Republicans sport an inability to recognize government force as the monopoly of concern and the most worrisome impediment to competition. In turn, they almost uniformly support their own versions of Biden\u2019s policies\u2014ranging from publicly funded research, to subsidies for manufacturing, to pricing intervention\u2014just branded differently.\n\nPromoting competiton in the American economy still remains the north star, if not the appropriate title of an executive order.",

      "text": "In his first term, Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order 13,771 \u201cReducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs\u201d required agencies to eliminate two rules or guidance documents for every new \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d added\u2014essentially a net-zero regulatory budget.\nNow, two weeks into a second term that\u2019s already seen dozens of Trump directives, including those freezing Biden\u2019s rules and addressing DEI and environmental excesses, Trump\u2019s \u201cUnleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation\u201d (Executive Order 14,192) is in place.\nFirst promised at the Economic Club of New York during the campaign, \u201cUnleashing Prosperity\u201d stipulates that \u201cfor each new regulation issued, at least 10 prior regulations be identified for elimination,\u201d and that \"total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations \u2026 shall be significantly less than zero, as determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]\n.\"Word was already out. Since Inauguration Day, Trump\u2019s administration has issued only 39 rules (five significant) and added just 1,212 pages to the Federal Register. Biden, by contrast, added 782 pages on his last day alone.\nWhile there will be no shortage of claims that Trump\u2019s simultaneously announced tariffs against China, Mexico and Canada wreck the entire savings narrative, it\u2019s a safe bet that the one-in, ten-out framework is just the beginning of the Trump deregulatory architecture.\nJoe Biden\u2019s dismantling of Trump\u2019s entire first-term regulatory streamlining apparatus included his \u201cModernizing Regulatory Review\u201d (E.O. 14,094) that raised the threshold for regulatory review from $100 million to $200 million in annual effect, and directed OMB to rewrite \u201cCircular A-4\u201d guidance on regulatory analyses. Even before Biden weakened A-4 to internalize progressive conceits and exaggerate benefits of coercive regulation, it had never served as a true check on the regulatory state but instead legitimized its excesses.\nSince Biden\u2019s E.O. 14,094 was among Trump\u2019s day-one revocations, Biden\u2019s rewrite of the Circular was ditched and the lower review threshold was implicitly restored. Trump\u2019s new Unleashing Prosperity order order explicitly revokes Biden\u2019s Circular A-4, reinforcing the lower threshold.\nUnleashing prosperity also requires more upfront disclosure of forthcoming rules. Agencies typically are not required to limit their regulatory activity to what they publish in the Unified Agenda of federal regulations unless an administration instructs otherwise. Trump did so during his first term, and now, Unleashing Prosperity stipulates that, \u201cno regulation shall be issued by an agency if it was not included in the most recent version or update of the published Unified Regulatory Agenda as required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order, unless the issuance of such regulation was approved in advance in writing by the Director.\u201d\nExecutive Order 12866 is the sticky Clinton Era \u201cRegulatory Planning and Review\u201d that has long enjoyed bipartisan favor. Trump\u2019s order references E.O. 12866 \u201cas amended, or any successor order\u201d three times, which is a giveaway that further regulatory reforms are forthcoming. In addition, the OMB Director (Russell Vought is Trump\u2019s nominee again) is given leeway to \u201caccomplish the purposes of this order\u201d by requiring \u201cadditions to the Unified Regulatory Agenda and Regulatory Plan.\u201d\nAmong other innovations, we are likely to see the return of the \u201cDeregulatory\u201d designations for rules that Trump initiated (and Biden rescinded) along with detailed White House guidance to assure costs remain \u201csignificantly less than zero.\u201d Trump\u2019s order also reinstates lapsed OMB oversight over tax rules.\nIf there is concern that Unleashing Prosperity is too weak, such unclosed loops are indicators that the administration is not, in fact, skipping leg day. The earlier two-for-one effort saw diminishing returns as the most easily removable regulations were eliminated first. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) can make eliminating rules a slow process by requiring the writing new rules to replace old ones. Trump\u2019s order is likely a stake in the ground for bigger things to come, including structural reforms beyond executive orders alone.\nAddressing Spending and Regulation Simultaneously\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative reflects an understanding of the fusion of spending and regulation. A serious ten-for-one effort cannot merely trim regulations; it must address the agencies producing them. Only by abolishing departments, agencies and programs is it possible to get rid of both the costs and the interventions alike. Much regulation is indirectly created through federal spending, loan guarantees, and grants that regulate via conditions on businesses and exploit contracting and procurement procedures. DOGE seems to grasp that what gets called \u201cregulation\u201d may often be no such thing; it does not advance competition and efficiency, and it often does not protect but impedes advances in safety and discipline with the kind of make-work jobs DOGE is trying to eliminate. The regulatory state assumes market failures require expert intervention, but in most cases, the real failures are political, and agencies obstruct rather than apply expertise.\nRapid Use of the Congressional Review Act\nThe Congressional Review Act (CRA), which Trump used in his first term to eliminate late-stage Obama-era regulations, will again be crucial in repealing Biden-era rules. With congressional alignment, dozens of regulations can be targeted. The CRA can also strike down guidance documents, and ambitious interpretations can deem chunks of existing rules and guidance invalid.\nReinstate and Expand Key Executive Orders\nTrump\u2019s hinted-at \u201csuccessor orders\u201d will likely reinstate and expand upon what Biden rescinded. Obvious ones include Trump\u2019s 2017 E.O. 13777, \u201cEnforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda\u201d which required agencies to appoint Regulatory Reform Officers and establish Regulatory Reform Task Forces. With obvious new relevance given synergies with DOGE, these were responsible for evaluating regulations and recommending repeals, replacements and modifications. The revived task forces need enhanced authority to recommend entire program eliminations, not just individual rule repeals.\nFoundational Legislative Support for Systematic Regulatory Reduction\nPast experience shows that executive orders alone cannot achieve and sustain deep regulatory reform--these will simply be reversed. Congress needs to institutionalize a regulatory cost budget to reinforce Trump\u2019s, and enact new laws explicitly geared to sunset regulations. Past bipartisan support for regulatory budgeting suggests a pathway for this, but the left learned its lesson and now what were once unfunded mandates are now funded to the tune of hundreds of billions. This is why, regulatory reforms notwithstanding, without the aforementioned terminations of departments and agencies, streamlining cannot ultimately succeed. The lead reform here is a version of the Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act (from Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky) to require congressional approval of certain significant rules. That done, Congress will need to adhere to enumerated powers, the disregard of which is the root of today\u2019s excesses rather than the agencies targeted by Trump and DOGE.\nTarget Regulatory Dark Matter Aggressively\nSub-regulatory guidance drives much of the administrative state\u2019s burdens. These are the memos, bulletins, policy statements, directives and more that never go through formal notice-and-comment rulemaking. Trump\u2019s Unleashing Prosperity allows offsetting rules with guidance, and we are likely to see a reinstatement in some form of his EO 13,891 (Promoting the Rule of Law Through Improved Agency Guidance Documents), which improved transparency in agency guidance with online portals and public-fairness rules (all of which Biden also torpedoed). Streamlining formal regulations is insufficient when agencies circumvent oversight and launder regulations through regulatory dark matter and the gargantuan contracting and procurement apparatus. Trump\u2019s guidance orders should be bolstered by legislation like the Guidance Out Of Darkness (GOOD) Act, and other measures beyond GOOD to abolish dark matter.\nFrom Aspiration to Execution\nLegal challenges delayed or overturned some of Trump\u2019s first-term deregulatory advances. This time, a solid roadmap must anticipate litigation. For Trump\u2019s ten-for-one agenda to succeed, it must go beyond waste, fraud, and abuse rhetoric and directly challenge the legitimacy of the expansive administrative state. The administration must work with Congress to make key executive actions permanent.\nThe Office of Management and Budget has a role to play but its pro-regulatory shift under Biden from a regulatory watchdog to a promoter of government intervention must be thoroughly rooted out. A reformed OMB should replace Circular A-4 only after the shortcomings of the administrative state philosophy are recognized and accounted for, such as the deification (yet non-use) of cost-benefit analysis. OMB sits in the driver\u2019s seat for both agency spending and agency regulation. It is extraordinarily powerful, but if it cannot administer in a manner consistent with Article I, a move such as implementation of a Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis may be necessary to replace its oversight function."

      "text": "President Joe Biden on Friday signed a new executive order aimed at cracking down on anti-competitive practices in Big Tech, labor and numerous other sectors.\n\"Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism. It's exploitation,\" Biden said at the White House in a speech before signing the directive.\nThe sweeping order, which includes 72 actions and recommendations that involve more than a dozen federal agencies, is intended to reshape the thinking around corporate consolidation and antitrust laws, according to a White House fact sheet.\nThose wide-ranging goals and initiatives include:\n- Urging the Federal Trade Commission to \"challenge prior bad mergers\" that previous administrations let slide\n- Pushing the FTC to ban occupational licensing restrictions, arguing they \"impede economic mobility\"\n- Encouraging the FTC to ban or limit noncompete agreements\n- Encouraging the Federal Communications Commission to restore \"net neutrality\" rules that were undone during the Trump administration\n- Asking the FCC to block exclusivity deals between landlords and broadband providers\n- Lowering prescription drug prices by supporting state and tribal efforts to import cheaper drugs from Canada\n- Allowing hearing aids to be sold over the counter\n- Establishing a \"White House Competition Council\" to lead federal responses to large corporations' growing economic power\n\"The impulse for this executive order is really around where can we encourage greater competition across the board,\" the White House's chief economic advisor, Brian Deese, told CNBC's Ylan Mui in an exclusive interview that aired earlier Friday morning.\nThrough its tech-related actions, Biden's order aims to make the case that the biggest companies in the sector are wielding their power to box out smaller competitors and exploit consumers' personal information.\nThe order calls for regulators to enact a slew of reforms, including increasing their scrutiny of tech mergers and putting more focus on maneuvers such as \"killer acquisitions,\" in which firms acquire smaller brands to take them out of the market.\nThe tech giants' tightened grip has led to a decline in innovation, Deese told Mui.\nThose platforms have \"created significant problems,\" Deese said. That includes \"problems for users in terms of privacy and security\" and \"problems for small businesses in terms of entering markets,\" he said.\nThe executive order \"is not just about monopolies,\" Deese said, \"but it's about consolidation more generally and the lack of competition when you have a limited set of market players.\"\nHe noted that some research suggests wages are lower in more concentrated markets that are dominated by just a handful of firms. A White House fact sheet cites a May 2020 paper from the Journal of Human Resources, which used CareerBuilder.com data to find that market consolidation suggests a decrease in wages by double-digit percentages.\nThe order was unveiled just a few weeks after the House Judiciary Committee voted to advance six antitrust bills aimed at revitalizing competition in the tech sector.\nThe bills, which would make it harder for dominant firms to complete mergers and outlaw certain common business models for such firms, have faced significant bipartisan pushback from those concerned that they don't go far enough or will have unintended side effects.\nIn late June, a judge threw out complaints from the Federal Trade Commission and a group of state attorneys general alleging Facebook has illegally maintained monopoly power.\nBiden's executive order also calls on the FTC to craft new rules on Big Tech's data collection and user surveillance practices, and asks the agency to prohibit certain unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces.\nThe order could provide some relief to small and medium-sized businesses that have complained of the allegedly crippling grip of tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google over digital markets.\nBiden's executive order doesn't impose its will on Big Tech companies unilaterally, and instead frequently calls on independent agencies to take action.\nBut new FTC Chair Lina Khan, a Biden appointee who at 32 became the youngest person ever to hold the role when she was sworn in last month, has already carved out a reputation as a vocal advocate for reforming and beefing up regulations on tech giants.\nAmazon is calling for Khan to be recused from ongoing probes of its business, arguing she lacks impartiality and accusing her of repeatedly saying the company is \"guilty of antitrust violations and should be broken up.\"\nWATCH: How US antitrust law works, and what it means for Big Tech"

      "text": "Remarks by President Biden At Signing of An Executive Order Promoting Competition in the American Economy\nState Dining Room\n1:48 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, everyone. They have a Cabinet meeting. (Laughter.) Please \u2014 please be seated. Thank you.\nWell, it is not \u201cgood morning,\u201d which my remarks say here, but \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 good afternoon. We\u2019re in the midst of a historic economic recovery. And because our successful vaccination program strategy has been working and the immediate relief through the American Rescue Plan has brought back our economy from the worst economic crisis in nearly a century, America is now on track. We\u2019re now on track for the highest economic growth in 40 years and among the highest growth records on record.\nWe designed our ecomi- \u2014 our economic strategy to be durable through the ups and downs that come with recovery. And there are ups and downs.\nThat\u2019s why the American Rescue Plan was designed to help people not just all at once, but over the course of a full year so we could continue supporting families, small businesses, state and local budgets to help them weather those ups and downs.\nAnd now that the economy is back on track, we\u2019re making progress on the second phase of our strategy: ensuring long-term growth.\nThat\u2019s what my Build Back Better agenda, including my Americans Family Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure agreement we reached last month \u2014 that\u2019s what they\u2019re all about: long term.\nBut to keep our country moving, we have to take another step as well \u2014 and I know you\u2019re all tired of hearing me during the campaign and since I\u2019m elected President talk about it \u2014 and that\u2019s bringing fair competition back to the economy.\nThat\u2019s why today I\u2019m going to be signing shortly an executive order promoting competition to lower price \u2014 to lower prices, to increase wages, and to take another critical step toward an economy that works for everybody.\nThe heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition \u2014 that means that if your companies want to win your business, they have to go out and they have to up their game; better prices and services; new ideas and products.\nThat competition keeps the economy moving and keeps it growing. Fair competition is why capitalism has been the world\u2019s greatest force for prosperity and growth.\nBy the same token, \u201ccompetitive economy\u201d means companies must do all they do to do \u2014 everything they do to compete for workers: offering higher wages, more flexible hours, better benefits.\nBut what we\u2019ve seen over the past few decades is less competition and more concentration that holds our economy back. We see it in big agriculture, in big tech, in big pharma. The list goes on.\nRather than competing for consumers, they are consuming their competitors. Rather than competing for workers, they\u2019re finding ways to gain the upper hand on labor. And too often, the government has actually made it harder for new companies to break in and compete.\nLook at what that means for family budgets. Take prescription drugs: Just a handful of companies control the market for many vital medicines, giving them leverage over everyone else to charge whatever they want. As a result, Americans pay two and a half times more for prescription drugs than in any other leading country. And nearly one in four Americans struggles to afford their medication.\nAnother example: hearing aids. Right now, if you need a hearing aid, you can\u2019t just walk into a pharmacy and pick one up over the counter. You have to get it from a doctor or a specialist. Not only does that make getting hearing aids inconvenient, it makes them considerably more expensive, and it makes it harder for new companies to compete, innovate, and sell hearing aids at lower prices.\nAs a result, a pair \u2014 a pair of hea- \u2014 a pair of hearing aids can cost thousands of dollars. That\u2019s a big reason why just one in seven Americans with hearing loss actually use a hearing aid.\nAnother example: Internet services. There are more than 65 million Americans who live in a place with only one high-speed Internet provider. Research shows, when you have unlimited Internet operation, you pay up to five times more on average than families in places with more choices. That\u2019s what a lack of competition does: it raises the prices you pay.\nAnd it\u2019s not just consumers getting hurt. Big ag is putting a squeeze on farmers. Small and family farms, first-time farmers \u2014 like veterans coming home and Black and Latino and Indigenous farmers \u2014 they\u2019re seeing price hikes for seed, lopsided contracts, shrinking profits, and growing debt.\nLack of competition hurts workers as well. In many communities, there are only a handful of employers left competing for workers. Think of company towns across Appalachia and other parts of the country where one big corporation runs the show.\nWhen corporations have that kind of leverage over workers, it pushes down aver- \u2014 it pushes down advertised wages by up to 17 percent. And as competition decreases, businesses don\u2019t feel the pressure to innovate or invest in their workforce. That hurts working families and it hurts our economy.\nAll told, between rising prices and lowering wages, lack of competition costs the median American household $5,000 a year.\nNow, look, I\u2019m a proud capitalist. I spent most of my career representing the corporate state of Delaware. I know America can\u2019t succeed unless American business succeeds.\nBut let me be very clear: Capitalism without competition isn\u2019t capitalism; it\u2019s exploitation. Without healthy competition, big players can change and charge whatever they want and treat you however they want. And for too many Americans, that means accepting a bad deal for things that can\u2019t go \u2014 you can\u2019t go without.\nSo, we know we\u2019ve got a problem \u2014 a major problem. But we also have an incredible opportunity. We can bring back more competition to more of the country, helping entrepreneurs and small businesses get in the game, helping workers get a better deal, helping families save money every month. The good news is: We\u2019ve done it before.\nIn the early 1900s, President Teddy Roosevelt saw an economy dominated by giants like Standard Oil and JP Morgan\u2019s railroads. He took them on, and he won. And he gave the little guy a fighting chance.\nDecades later, during the Great Depression, his cousin Franklin Roosevelt saw a wave of corporate mergers that wiped out sec- \u2014 scores of small businesses, crushing competition and innovation. So he ramped up antitrust enforcement eightfold in just two years, saving families billions in today\u2019s dollars and helping to set the course for sustained economic growth after World War Two.\nHe also called for an economic bill of rights, including, quote, \u201cthe right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies.\u201d End of quote.\nBetween them, the two Roosevelts established an American tradition \u2014 an antitrust tradition. It is how we ensure that our economy isn\u2019t about people working for capitalism; it\u2019s about capitalism working for people.\nBut, over time, we\u2019ve lost the fundamental American idea that true capitalism depends on fair and open competition. Forty years ago, we chose the wrong path, in my view, following the misguided philosophy of people like Robert Bork, and pulled back on enforcing laws to promote competition.\nWe\u2019re now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power. And where- \u2014 what have we gotten from it? Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses. Too many Americans who feel left behind. Too many people who are poorer than their parents.\nI believe the experiment failed. We have to get back to an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out.\nThe executive order I\u2019m soon going to be signing commits the federal government to full and aggressive enforcement of our antitrust laws. No more tolerance for abusive actions by monopolies. No more bad mergers that lead to mass layoffs, higher prices, fewer options for workers and consumers alike.\nMy executive order includes 72 specific actions. I expect the federal agencies \u2014 and they know this \u2014 to help restore competition so that we have lower prices, higher wages, more money, more options, and more convenience for the American people.\nToday, I want to focus on three specific actions:\nFirst, the FDA \u2014 the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 are going to work with states and Tribes to safely import prescription drugs from Canada. That\u2019s just one of many actions in the executive order that will lower prescription drug prices.\nSecond, the FDA is going to issue rules so that hearing aids can be sold over the counter. That\u2019s something the last administration was supposed to have done but didn\u2019t do. We\u2019re going to get it done. After these rules go into effect, a pair of hearing aids can cost hundreds of dollars, not thousands. And you\u2019ll be able to pick them up at your local drugstore.\nThird, we\u2019re going to improve competition for workers. I\u2019ve talked a lot about non-compete agreements \u2014 contracts that say you can\u2019t take another job in your field, even if you get a better deal. I made a speech \u2014 I was just reminiscing with my staff \u2014 back in 2018, at the Brookings Institution, where I talked about the non-compete clauses that were just \u2014 I found \u2014 to be absolutely ridiculous, but how prevalent they were throughout industries.\nAt least one in three businesses require their workers to sign a non-compete agreement. These aren\u2019t just high-paid executives or scientists who hold secret formulas for Coca-Cola so Pepsi can\u2019t get their hands on it. A recent study found one in five workers without a college education is subject to non-compete agreements. They\u2019re construction workers, hotel workers, disproportionately women and women of color.\nThink of the 26-year-old employee at a company. She\u2019s a star worker, but she isn\u2019t being treated right. She\u2019s underpaid, passed over for promotions. A competitor across the street knows and wants to bring her in at a higher wage, but she can\u2019t do it. Her company threatens legal action over a non-compete clause she had to sign in order to get hired in the first place. She can\u2019t afford a lawyer for help, so she\u2019s locked in.\nImagine if you\u2019re in her shoes. You\u2019d feel powerless, disrespected, bullied, trapped. That\u2019s not right. Workers should be free to take a better job if someone offers it.\nIf your employer wants to keep you, he or she should have to make it worth your while to stay. That\u2019s the kind of competition that leads to better wages and greater dignity of work.\nLook, I\u2019m not going to go into it now, but I used to talk about, you know, there\u2019s non-compete clauses of people running the machines that lay down asphalt. If, in fact, you get offered a job and you have a \u2014 you know, you\u2019re in Arkansas doing it, a lot of \u2014 a specific example is you can\u2019t take a job in west Texas to do it. What in the hell does that have to do with anything? (Laughter.) No, I\u2019m serious. Or there were clauses in McDonald\u2019s contracts: You can\u2019t leave Burger King to go to McDonald\u2019s. Come on. Is there a trade secret about what\u2019s inside that patty? (Laughter.) No, but I\u2019m serious.\nYou all \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you do know; I didn\u2019t know it until five years ago \u2014 the incredible number of non-compete clauses for ordinary people who \u2014 it was done for one reason: to keep wages low. Period.\nLook, my executive order calls on the FTC to ban or limit non-compete agreements. Let workers chose who they want to work for.\nI\u2019m also calling on the FTC to do away with certain occupational licensing requirements. You realize, if you want to braid hair and you move from one state to another, sometimes you have to do a six-month apprenticeship, even though you\u2019ve been in the business for a long, long time? What the hell \u2014 what\u2019s that all about?\nMilitary families, for example, they\u2019re often on the move between states with each new assignment. So you have a woman in the military, her husband is following her, or vice versa. Guess what? If you have \u2014 if you\u2019re a plumber, you have to get a different license when you move from Delaware to Missouri.\nLook, it can\u2019t be a significant burden to get a new license in a new home state. That burden can\u2019t be around anymore. It takes time and it takes money. It takes a toll on a family\u2019s income while you\u2019re waiting. We should remove that barrier, providing more mobility, more opportunity, higher wages for families on the move.\nThis is something that my wife, Jill, has worked on together with Michelle Obama through the Joining Forces initiative for the military.\nWe\u2019re going to keep that moving. We\u2019re going to get it done in an executive order.\nLet me close with this: Competition works. We know it works. We\u2019ve seen it works when it exists. Fair competition is was what made America the wealthiest, most innovative nation in history. That\u2019s why people come here to invent things and start new businesses.\nIn the competition against China and other nations of the 21st century, let\u2019s show that American democracy and the American people can truly outcompete anyone. Because I know that just given half a chance, the American people will never, ever, ever let their country down. Imagine if we give everyone a full and fair chance. That\u2019s what this is all about. That\u2019s what I\u2019m about to do.\nSo I\u2019d like to invite the Cabinet members up here. I\u2019d like to \u2014 and the Attorney General is here \u2014 Attorney General Garland. Xavier \u2014 Mr. Secretary, you can come up too. I\u2019ve been watching on television; you\u2019ve been really good. (Laughter.) Gina Raimondo. Also, Pete Buttigieg. And the chair of the FCC [FTC], Lian [sic] \u2014 excuse me, Lina Khan, Acting Chair of the FTC. And Director of the National Economic Council.\nAm I leaving anybody out? Anyway, come on up. This may be the first Cabinet meeting we\u2019ve had.\nOkay. \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy.\u201d\nFirst pen. (Laughter.) Second pen. Third. Fourth. (Laughter.) Fifth.\nI\u2019m wondering how Barack did this with a shorter name. (Laughter.)\n(The executive order is signed.)\nThank you. Thank you, everyone. (Applause.)\nQ Mr. President, how did President Putin respond to your call today, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I made it very clear to him that \u2014 that the United States expects, when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil, even though it\u2019s not \u2014 not sponsored by the state, we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act on who that is.\nAnd, secondly, that we have set up a means of communications now, on a regular basis, to be able to communicate to one another when each of us thinks something is happening in another country that affects the home country.\nAnd so, it went well. I\u2019m optimistic.\nQ You said, three weeks ago, there would be consequences. Will there be, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.\n2:06 P.M. EDT"

      "text": "July brought headlines announcing, \u201cBiden to sign order to crack down on Big Tech, boost competition \u2018across the board\u2019\u201d and \u201claunch [an] assault on monopolies\u201d\nInstead, Joe Biden\u2019s executive order on \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy\u201d has little to do with promoting competition.\nWhat the \u201corder\u201d \u2014 no urging is needed \u2014 actually does is give the go-ahead to agency bosses already contemplating further consolidation of federal power over\u2014 going alphabetically and probably non-exhaustively \u2014 agriculture, airlines, banking, broadband, health, and the technology sector.\nReminiscent of Obama\u2019s \"Steps to Increase Competition and Better Inform Consumers and Workers to Support Continued Growth of the American Economy\" that got shelved during the Trump interlude, some of the same progressive activists are involved.\nProclaiming that \"The American promise of a broad and sustained prosperity depends on an open and competitive economy,\" the order rebukes \"excessive market concentration.\"\nSince media headlines appear reluctant to do so, it would seem helpful to point out the obvious, that laissez-faire free enterprise is not the prevailing state of affairs in the United States. Some of the handwringing over \u201cconcentration\u201d should be directed at a seemingly unbounded regulatory state with its executive branch overreach and its decline in transparency regarding federal doings.\nWith centralized regulation comes concentration, and each sector Biden invokes is already heavily regulated and subsidized (for a century in some cases) by the likes of the the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Transportation, and Health and Human Services; and by independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission. The lack of competition attributable to the existence of these bodies needs most of the attention.\nBiden\u2019s order gives specific to-dos even to the so-called independent agencies, not that they are offended in any way. White House staff were prepared with a raft of executive orders for Biden\u2019s first day in office, and progressive appointees today are surfing a wave of welcome amplification, not being swamped by a breaker in the form of Biden\u2019s order. What Biden gave was not a command, but a removal of a leash that is synergistic with his legislative triad (the American Rescue Plan, and the pending American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan). Indeed, FTC and DOJ antitrust officials sent out a high-five the very day of Biden\u2019s order with a jointly announced review of merger guidelines.\nExpanding the power of these already massive government bodies is a promotion, not of competition among individual businesses, but of centralization of government authority over all American business sectors, collectively. These agencies wield literal coercive power, which is the genuine meaning of monopoly, while perversely posing as guardians against monopoly.\nBefore signing his order, Biden declared, \"Now, look, I\u2019m a proud capitalist.\" But if that were the case, one would see a \u201cPromoting Competition\u201d agenda consisting of sweeping economic and regulatory liberalization and retrenchment of the federal administrative enterprise. We got only a brief and imperfect interlude in that respect with Trump.\nThis matters greatly because the precedent set by this malignant executive order will be that tomorrow\u2019s innovators get hobbled by Washington in even worse fashion. Now is the time to pursue liberalization to preserve ordered laissez-faire and maximize the wealth creation and public benefits to be ushered in by the the next breakthroughs and ascendant technologies like smart cities, artificial intelligence, automated vehicles (both grounded and airborne), and space commercialization that make the distraction of months spent on this order a waste of time. Tellingly, the order is not a waste of time if Washington is positioning itself to pull the regulatory strings on them, too.\nThe limited spots in which the order is deregulatory (we appreciate the over-the-counter hearing aids and long-overdue Democratic stamp on relaxation of occupational licensing) are paltry compared to the risks to free society this order poses in its misguided framing of the nature of competitive enterprise. Bureaucracy and government/business alliances will be the primary beneficiaries rather than the public.\nThe GOP will have its work cut out challenging the sweeping moves as agencies execute them, since sections like those on pharmaceutical price and access controls could have been written by former president Trump, while the call for regulation of the technology sector might as well be a collaboration between the two dominant political parties. Some quarters of of big tech (like Facebook and part of the cryptocurrency sector) are asking for \u201cupdated regulation,\u201d yet even that does not raise a red flag for many Republicans. The Biden order in an unfortunate sense propagates Republican-endorsed follies like the Endless Frontier Act and their appeal for a deal with Democrats on a \u201creal\u201d infrastructure package. Like the Democrats, Republicans sport an inability to recognize government force as the monopoly of concern; so they support nationalized science research and the accompanying subsidized manufacturing hubs and infrastructure banks. No one seems concerned over the resultant cronyism and corporate welfare, nor over the temporal distortion of technology advancements, nor over intellectual property ambiguities created by government banging around in the entrepreneurial process with its \u201cappropriations.\u201d\nThere is worrisome interference with contracts in Biden\u2019s directive as well, given the underlying progressive ideology. For example, addressing abuse of non-compete clauses could make a great deal of sense; but on the other hand we probably lack the governance that could do it rationally at this point in time. The same may hold for \u201cright-to-repair\u201d restrictions on purchased equipment and electronic devices. Such restrictions can go much too far, but in some circumstances they are rational. The market can resolve such ordinary dilemmas without the federal government stepping in with unsuitable resolutions of what should be varying approaches.\nSimilarly relaxations of occupational licensing requirements had been among the most important steps taken during the Covid era, moves that should be made permanent. However, most such requirements exist at the state level, and in today\u2019s environment of eroded federalism worsened by the Covid response, of Biden pursuing \u201cgood union jobs\u201d while goading desperate small businesses to \u201cpay them more,\u201d and amid the backdrop of a progressive push for a universal basic income or UBI, it seems less than conspiratorial to suspect something more afoot with a federal assumption of licensing authority. Not unrelated, in today\u2019s wokeness environment, corporations are being transformed into some as yet undefinable kind of entity while acting as the enforcers of social policy regulation. Whatever deregulatory crumbs Biden drops, he has deemed progressive social justice and climate reformatting of the economy the drivers of everything the administration does. In the process, the traditional wealth-maximizing corporation (that\u2019s a good thing, despite it all) may be rendered a thing of the past, replaced by something....else. So stay tuned for what the executive order ultimately means.\nAs in Obama\u2019s 2016 competition order, we see a disdain for free labor markets. But not spoken of are the unseen harms of raising the minimum wage and exhorted unionization that actually fit the definition of anti-competitive policy. Also echoing the prior order, we see a proclivity to regulate tech and other firms\u2019 data collection, but to leave alone the government\u2019s dangerous data collection and abuses of privacy.\nA dominant element of the package is Biden\u2019s call \u201cto enforce the antitrust laws to combat the excessive concentration of industry, the abuses of market power, and the harmful effects of monopoly and monopsony \u2014 especially as these issues arise in labor markets, agricultural markets, Internet platform industries, healthcare markets (including insurance, hospital, and prescription drug markets).\u201d\nAs noted, any such lack of competition in the non-\u201dBig Tech\u201d arena is more attributable to their having long ago been placed into Mother-May-I regulatory silos. Dismantling those would be a more worthy pursuit. So here let\u2019s address the (so far) ostensibly less-regulated tech sector targeted by the order.\nIn his speech accompanying the signing ceremony, Biden specifically singled out Robert Bork and his alleged \u201cmisguided philosophy\u201d on antitrust. What Bork showed, and what Biden and his appointees reject, is that certain business practices deemed abusive and anti-competitive (mergers, \u201canticompetitive\u201d conduct, \u201ccollusion\u201d) are rather more likely benign and transitory. Biden and his team, and Republicans too, are on the brink of re-legitimizing the concept of people in Washington arbitrarily picking winners and losers. In so doing, this meddlesome behavior denies consumers the competitive market response to the allegedly bad behavior that would otherwise have ensued from ordinary, now derailed, economic rivalry.\nAntirust regulation in this sense is regulatory protectionism. It not only saves a company from the need to compete, but it delivers to it gift-wrapped the rival\u2019s customers. The very existence of antitrust law allows and fosters such political predation, and itself embodies the coercive monopoly power about which the public and media should be concerned.\nAntitrust is in part about the political class seizing for itself a portion of the immense wealth created by the innovators and movers and shakers. Consolidating government and corporate power, as antitrust activism to divide spoils does, is not the avenue for promotion of competition that authorities should exhaust resources and time on. There are grave costs inflicted by the forcible steering of entire sectors and the dictation of individual business models; of rent-seeking by the revolving-door bureaucracies; of companies exploiting antitrust as an alternative to competition; and of agitation by the dutiful academic antitrust armies and the antitrust bar generally.\nThis behavior is particularly galling with respect to the Internet sector, where there can be no monopolies in ones and zeros on growing and boundless networks, cyberspaces and splinternets. Facebook is used by neither my kids nor yours; they\u2019re even ditching Facebook\u2019s Instagram for TikTok. Google meanwhile is a waterbug skimming across the top of all the stuff that comprises the bulk of the Internet, a realm not accessible by such search engines at all. The stuff that is accessible can be sought, crawled and cataloged otherwise, just as it could when the commercial Net emerged in the first place.\nThat giants can fall is a reason to expect some segments of Big Tech to come around to the \u201cwisdom\u201d of antitrust and regulatory protection, making Biden\u2019s order more ominous. Large businesses can be bureaucratic rather than nimble, yet conversely tomorrow\u2019s grand adventures will be carried out by companies far larger than those of today. Resolving that tension is precisely what markets do better than anything else, and antitrust intervention disrupts that evolution.\nWe often get lectured about the need to \u201cregulate\u201d common carriers and essential facilities. But the federal government created both the Federal Communication Commission's monopoly over spectrum that subverted evolution in communications technologies, and it protected an AT&T monopoly for decades. Emblematic of the continued folly is the Biden order\u2019s call to resurrect Obama-era net neutrality programs. This would freeze growth in competitive infrastructure, since one would need favorable \u201cAdvisory Opinions\u201d from government to act.\nA fundamental concept rejected by progressives and unrecognized by conservatives is the importance of, as Fred L. Smith Jr. would express it, defending the liberty of not just flows but of the underlying infrastructures and grids themselves. It is vital, wealth-enhancing, and necessary to the protection of consumer welfare to treat the concept of competition in the creation of networks as being even more vital than competition in the bits and goods that move across one network. Instead, much in public policy with respect to infrastructure is about forced sharing, which sacrifices those innovations. A lack of imagination prevails with respect to expanding the boundaries of complex property rights whether the ephemeral stuff, or the long and thin and wired. Beware, though. If we can't get the \u201cmere\u201d Internet right, U.S. policymakers are going to mangle the long-term evolution of the aforementioned and far more complex smart cities, automated vehicle networks, airspace networks for drones, low Earth orbit \u2014 and artificial intelligence generally. These will all get trapped by the likes of Biden\u2019s stunted view of \u201cpromoting competition\u201d and result in the imposition of helicopter government.\nAn amusing bit is where the president\u2019s Executive Order asks agencies to \"rescind ... regulations that create unnecessary barriers to entry that stifle competition,\" but only upon \"adopting pro\u2011competitive regulations.\" Even before Trump, agencies performed reluctant \u201cretrospective reviews\u201d of regulations, but, alas, they added rather than subtracted new burdens in response. Teeth could be given to such a directive though, by working with Congress to pass law actually reforming the regulatory process and freeing up producers. But where president Obama merely promised to veto congressional regulatory reform initiatives, Biden declared Trump\u2019s limited regulatory liberalization efforts to be \u201charmful policies,\u201d therefore such reform hasn\u2019t even emerged as a possibility yet.\nBooming stock market notwithstanding, the most most notable growing power in American society is that of the federal government, a taxing and regulating entity that doesn\u2019t produce but is capable of pushing around those that do. It would best step aside and leave alone those who do produce and compete.\nBroadly, with a couple exceptions, Biden\u2019s order attempts to repackage anti-competitive intervention as pro-competition. As Fred Smith also noted, assets and resources in government control at the dawn of progressivism often remain there, governed by three-letter bureaucracies of the type saluted in Biden\u2019s order. Plainly, further tight-fisted control is sought by today\u2019s progressives. Biden\u2019s directive, if agencies follow through, will hurt business, competition and consumers broadly. But it will benefit certain favored businesses while consolidating government power. That is a problem.\nGiven the premises contained not just in Biden\u2019s order but in new missives like those of Republicans against big tech, it is clear that much of the work in defending capitalism and property rights \u2014 the real prerequisites for robust competition and of expanded consumer welfare \u2014 has yet to be done. Worse, it has yet to be thought of."

      "text": "In recent roundups of the Trump-era administrative state and its \u201cUnrules,\u201d we\u2019ve noted that the Trump administration is on track (so far) to issue the lowest annual tally of rules and regulations since record-keeping began in the 1970s.\nWhile a number of Trump rules take the form of recissions, rollbacks, delays and relaxation of enforcement, it is the congressional \u201cResolutions of Disapproval\u201d of late-term Biden rules that are getting much of the attention. Rooted in the Congressional Review Act of 1996, these allow Congress and a new president to overturn certain rules issued late in a predecessor\u2019s term.\nTo some extent the attention that CRA\u2019s get makes makes sense, as these disapprovals tend to zero in on some of the most prominent recent regulatory activity. In the current setting, it is Biden\u2019s aggressive and even punitive green agenda getting upended, not just by Congress and its CRAs, but prominently by the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency (as a flurry of tweets from EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin attests in the latter case).\nBefore Trump 1.0, there had been only one resolution of disapproval signed into law -targeting Department of Labor rulemaking on repetitive-motion injuries. But then in a rapid 2017-18 change of pace, the Trump administration overturned 16 Obama rules.\nTurnabout was not unexpected, so the Biden era brought three reversals of Trump rules (notably on relaxation of emission standards and bank lending), as part of what proved to be Biden\u2019s wholesale rejection of regulatory streamlining as such in favor of what his administration dubbed \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d progressive interventions.\nHere we are in 2025. So far in Trump 2.0 there have been 16 resolutions of disapproval of Biden-era rules (the most recent signed into law on June 20, as compiled below).\nOf dozens of candidates for potential overturn by CRA resolution of disapproval (I did an inventory in this column late last year) Congress did wind up getting rid of some of the most noteworthy.\nThat comes with a big caveat, however. While the CRA does get used to eliminate some of the most significant, headline-grabbing and prominent regulations, the CRA cannot fundamentally roll back the administrative state.\nRemember; the CRA has been with us since 1996. A pace of a couple dozen rule eliminations per generation - however large or costly and worthy of revocation they may be individually - is a slog that just won\u2019t do to preserve limited government over the long term.\nConsider: betwwen 1976 (when federal agency rules first started getting counted in the Federal Register) and year-end 2024, 220,813 final rules were finalized. So far this year, another 1,560 rules have been issued (granted, a sizable number of them the recissions and relaxations noted) for a total of 222,373. A few dozen CRAs makes just a dent.\nNot only that, as CEI\u2019s work on agency guidance documents, policy statements memoranda and other forms of regulatory dark matter attests, conventional notice-and-comment regulation increasingly comes nowhere close to capturing government intervention in the economy. That intervention includes the likes of antitrust regulation (which I like to refer to as the Original Sin of the administrative state, although even it has forebears); tariffs; and perhaps most distressingly, regulatory laundering via the procurement/contracting behemoth and subsidies, grants and public-private partnerships. Topping the list and responsible for all the rest is congressional disregard of enumerated powers, its unwillingness to leave any corner of economic or social life alone and the collapse of federalism.\nBut still, during White House transitions, the CRA resolutions are the splashiest and most headline grabbing, and they do matter a lot for planning and strategy.\nThere\u2019s also an interesting twist to all this in 2025. So far, there have been are \"only\" 31 public laws enacted in the 119th Congress. But half of them (16, as noted) have been CRA resolutions of disapproval.\nIt\u2019s kind of funny to think that half of 2025\u2019s laws are Biden rule-killers.\nWe\u2019ve long needed legislators willing to come to DC, not to \u201cget things done\u201d and be otherwise meddlesome, but to get things undone. The year 2025 has served as an example of how to go about that.\nAmong prominent CRAs in 2025 are the Department of Energy\u2019s conservation standards (\"We now have the technology available to eliminate efficiency!\" our CEI founder Fred Smith would joke about wrongheaded federal policies). EPA is dominant of course, along with some finance rules. What follows is the to-date compilation of rules and the public law overturning them.

  "argos_summary": "Donald Trump has revoked President Biden's 2021 Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy, which critics argue expanded government control rather than fostering true competition.
