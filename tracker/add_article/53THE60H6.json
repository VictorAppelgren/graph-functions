      "summary": "Latino communities face significant health disparities driven by inadequate insurance coverage, low income, and environmental exposures, with 55% lacking adequate coverage and 52% reporting care access barriers. Air‑pollution studies show that people of color, including Latinos, experience higher PM2.5 exposure regardless of income, contributing to higher rates of asthma and chronic disease. Policy gaps such as Medicaid cuts and occupational hazards further threaten Latino health, underscoring the need for targeted health and environmental reforms.",
