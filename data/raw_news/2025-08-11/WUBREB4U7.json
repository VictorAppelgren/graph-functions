  "description": "Across the country, Trump\u2019s immigration raids have roiled farms and farming communities \u2013 with cases of worker shortages and fears of unpicked crops.",
  "content": "\u2022 The Trump administration's tough stance on immigration is creating uncertainty for America's farmers.\n\u2022 Many farms rely on foreign-born labor to pick crops, tend to livestock and handle other work.\n\u2022 The Trump administration in June suspended farm enforcement but then reversed that decision.\n\u2022 More recently, Trump has cited the importance of farm labor and said his administration would look into ways for farmworkers to \u201cbe here legally, they can pay taxes and everything.\u201d\n\u2022 Other administration officials, including border czar Tom Holman, said there would be no \u201camnesty\u201d but cited ongoing discussions about policy changes related to farmworkers.\n\nFor Candice Lyall, cherry harvest is always a race against the clock.\n\nEastern Washington is famous for its cherries, and in the fourth-generation farmer\u2019s lush orchards, not far from Columbia River, there\u2019s just a short window when they are the perfect ripeness. Wait too long and they are too soft for sale.\n\nAnd they must be picked by hand. Lots of them.\n\nFinding those hands locally can be a challenge. Like other growers, some of her workers are foreign-born, whose presence is reflected in the Hispanic restaurants in the nearby 3,300-resident town of Mattawa.\n\nBut this summer the harvest coincided with President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation sweeps. Rumors swirled of roadway checkpoints. More than 100 workers who started Lyall\u2019s harvest dwindled to 30 by the second week, leading her farm to struggle to get cherries picked in time.\n\nSome were picked too late, she said, but the financial hit to her farm was likely to be far less than what some other growers experienced.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of farms that didn't pick because they didn't have enough labor,\u201d she said.\n\nLyall is a Trump supporter in a conservative farming region. She favors stricter border security because of worries of drug cartels. But she wants to see a path toward a stable workforce.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be some solutions put on the table,\u201d Lyall told USA TODAY.\n\nAcross the country, Trump\u2019s immigration raids have roiled farms and farming communities \u2013 with cases of worker shortages and fears of unpicked crops. And it has fueled growing calls for the Trump administration to protect agricultural workers critical to the U.S. food supply.\n\nOf the 2.6 million people working on U.S. farms, about 42% lack legal status, according to the Department of Agriculture and other estimates.\n\nFarmers say few native\u2013born residents will pick fruit or tend cows. The country\u2019s foreign agriculture worker visa program can be costly, burdensome and limited. And farmers say Congress has failed for decades to pass comprehensive immigration reforms.\n\nThose long-standing struggles are now compounded by the lurking presence of Trump\u2019s masked immigration forces as harvest season approaches or is underway.\n\nEarlier this month, raids on farms in California left hundreds detained, and soon after, a group of farmworkers in California held a three-day strike and called for boycotts. At stake are potential disruptions to the U.S. food supply and higher consumer costs.\n\n\u201cFarm employers are holding their breath, trying to keep operations afloat without knowing whether their workforce will show up tomorrow \u2014 or stay away for fear of a raid,\u201d said Ben Tindall, head of the Save Family Farming advocacy group, based in Washington state.\n\nThe Trump administration in June suspended farm enforcement but then reversed that decision. More recently, Trump has cited the importance of farm labor and said his administration would look into ways for farmworkers to \u201cbe here legally, they can pay taxes and everything.\u201d\n\nOther administration officials, including border czar Tom Holman, said there would be no \u201camnesty\u201d but cited ongoing discussions about policy changes related to farmworkers. A bill in Congress would create a legal pathway for longtime workers and streamline worker visas.\n\nThe push for changes comes amid signs of a shift in public attitudes reflected in a recent Gallup poll that found a record-high of 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is good for the country, while only 35% said they approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the issue.\n\nManuel Cunha, the president of the Nisei Farmers League, which represents 500 farmers employing about 75,000 California farmworkers, said he\u2019s hopeful that policies will change.\n\nFor now, he said, workers in places like the San Joaquin Valley are holding steady despite raids that have caused temporary shortages.\n\nStill, farmers are on edge, knowing it could change at any moment.\n\nWhy foreign-born workers are critical to farmers\n\nIn Lincoln County, Wisconsin, where the rural landscape of pastures and fields is dotted with barns and silos, Hans Breitenmoser\u2019s parents emigrated here in 1968 from Switzerland to raise dairy cows on a small farm.\n\nHe grew up amid the daily rhythms of feeding and milking. When the farm grew, they had to hire more workers. But they could find few native-born residents willing to take the jobs in the sparsely populated area. And over time, fewer younger people were sticking around the farms.\n\nNow, the 56-year-old relies on about a dozen foreign-born workers, mostly from Mexico, to operate the 460-cow farm, not far from a shuttered church with peeling paint about five miles outside a town of 9,000 residents.\n\n\u201cIf it wouldn't be for immigrants, my dairy farm wouldn't run,\u201d he said.\n\nIn recent months, dairy farms in Texas reported absenteeism while ICE has detained or deported people at dairy farms in New York and Vermont, where one Trump-voting farmer told a news outlet he didn\u2019t think deportations would impact the industry\u2019s workers.\n\nDairies are particularly vulnerable to labor shortages because cows need daily care to survive, Brietenmoser said, and cannot be temporarily shut down like a construction site or restaurant.\n\n\u201cAm I concerned about it? Absolutely,\u201d said Breitenmoser, who said he was among a minority in Lincoln County who did not support Trump in 2024. \u201cThey don't get fed and they don't get watered, and they don't get milked and they don't get cleaned up after, they will die.\u201d\n\nAcross the nation today, about 70% of workers in the U.S. farm sector are foreign born, according to the Federal Reserve of Kansas City. The National Milk Producers Federation says milk prices could nearly double if the U.S. dairy industry loses its foreign-born workforce, the group said.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty that undergirds agricultural labor and immigration in the U.S. continues to harm workers and their families, farm employers, rural communities and national food security,\u201d according to the federation.\n\nFarmers typically hire workers with documentation such as Social Security cards or permits the government says must \u201creasonably appear to be genuine.\u201d The government\u2019s E-Verify system, required in some places, isn't foolproof.\n\nBreitenmoser argues Trump\u2019s political rhetoric painting immigrants as criminals and invaders, when most are workers filling jobs no one else will, is a self-defeating strategy.\n\n\u201cWe've built an economy that relies on people, but we have a public policy that demonizes them. And to my way of thinking that just doesn't make any sense,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican farming cannot survive without foreign-born staff.\u201d\n\nThe dairy farmer noted that \u201cwe had immigration reform in front of the Congress prior to the election, but because all of the Republicans were scared of Donald Trump, it didn't happen.\u201d\n\nThe solution, he said, is \u201cstupid simple:\u201d Accept the realities of farm labor. Hand out more work visas. And create pathways to vet longtime workers who need legal work permits.\n\nHe hopes the recent turmoil will lead to long-needed changes.\n\n\u201cSomebody's going to drive through McDonald's to buy a freaking latte and a hamburger. And guess where that comes from? It comes from my farm. And it doesn't happen magically. It takes human beings, be they brown, Black, White, green or otherwise, to get the job done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that's what our public policy should reflect.\u201d\n\nIn a Colorado agricultural area northeast of Denver, Maria has worked in fields of watermelon, pumpkins and tomatoes for years. But not now.\n\nThe 56-year-old, who didn\u2019t want to use her full name because she doesn\u2019t have legal status, emigrated from Chihuahua, Mexico 20 years ago to escape violence and find better pay.\n\nJobs on farms are hot, grueling and physically challenging. But some farmworkers can earn in one hour what they\u2019d make in a full day back in Mexico.\n\nShe said she sees an ICE presence in her part of Colorado. One friend\u2019s brother was detained on the street earlier this year. Her husband is still working in a dairy to make ends meet, but she said some farms have had to look for workers out of state.\n\nFor now they want to stick it out. Their lives are here. They have children and U.S. citizen grandchildren who live in the United States and are concerned about them.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of anxiety about, you know, grandmother, are they going to take you away?\u201d she said.\n\nMany have reluctantly returned to work after raids that have taken place in places like California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley for financial reasons, said Teresa Romero, head of United Farm Workers.\n\n\u201cIt is a little misconception, assuming that workers are not going back to work. Some workers are, of course, scared of what could happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThey might be scared for a day or so, but they go back to work. They need their jobs and they need to support their families.\u201d\n\nRomero said the crackdown is also impacting the communities in which they live and work. Many are staying inside and not going to parks, school functions, churches and restaurants.\n\nIn raids earlier this month at cannabis farms in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, immigration agents descended on Glass House Farms near Camarillo and in Carpinteria. They clashed with protesters and detained more than 200 farmworkers.\n\nA Mexican farmworker, Jaime Alani\u0301s Garcia, 57, died after falling from a greenhouse roof he\u2019d climbed atop in an alleged attempt to evade officers, according to multiple reports,\n\n\u201cThe farmworkers detained in these raids are clearly in the United States to fill jobs that employers cannot otherwise fill,\u201d U.S. Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Thousand Oaks, said in a letter to federal officials. \u201cTheir undocumented status is not by choice, but a direct result of Congress\u2019 ongoing failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform that would allow a sufficient number of workers into the country and provide a viable pathway to citizenship.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Gabriel, a 42-year-old from Puebla, Mexico, who didn\u2019t want to use his name because he lacks legal status and fears detention, would like to see, too. The farmwork in California\u2019s Central Valley has lived in the U.S. for 25 years. He has worked in fields of crops from eggplant to pumpkin, waking up at 4 a.m. and earning $16.50 an hour.\n\nHe said the majority of his fellow workers are also immigrants without papers and are still working, but some are considering going home.\n\nHe blames past and current administrations for failing to deliver on immigration reform. He said some longtime workers were angry at former President Joe Biden for enacting more legal pathways to migrate and not focusing on legalizing the status of longtime workers.\n\n\u201cLet workers work,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people who help feed the country and pay taxes.\u201d\n\nICE officials have argued they don\u2019t need probable cause to detain people and the agency could deport people with just six hours\u2019 notice.\n\nMaurico Sol, an H-2A worker who supervises dozens of fellow visa holders on a farm that spans Idaho and Oregon, said some colleagues have asked if it\u2019s safe to go to Walmart on weekends. He advised them to always carry their passport and visa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve also heard people that say, well, maybe this is going to be my last year,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it feels different \u2026 Even when we are in a good space here, where it's not happening a lot, you feel like, eh, we don't know. We don't want to go out. Because maybe they're going to confuse me if they see me in the mall and I'm going to be chained for, I don't know, 48 hours, or maybe they're going to deport me even though I have papers.\u201d\n\nSol works for Shay Myers, a farmer whose onions grow in fields not far from where the Snake River separates Oregon and Idaho.\n\nThe third-generation farmer operates Owyhee Produce, which grows one in every 20 onions consumed in America.\n\nMyers, 45, is also TikTok influencer with 692,000 followers and posts videos about his farm and the intricacies of agriculture.\n\nBut lately the Republican farmer has been highlighting his mostly foreign-born laborers \u2013 from Mexico, Central America, Peru and Colombia \u2013 who he says are critical. The majority of his workers, which can number 350 during harvests, are here on H-2A visas.\n\nWhile such workers represent about 13% of the nation's farmworkers, the number of certified H-2A workers grew by 64.7% between 2017 and 2022. Meanwhile, the share of unauthorized workers has dropped to about 42% from from 55% in 2001.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a bureaucratic and expensive program, he said. Farmers have to prove no domestic workers are available or willing to do the job. They provide housing and adhere to wage-premiums meant to keep the program from pushing down wages of U.S. residents who do similar jobs, and must follow rules such as overtime that differ among states. And it\u2019s time-limited.\n\nLabor groups also criticize the H-2A visa program, saying it often requires workers to stick with one employer which makes them vulnerable to wage theft or poor housing.\n\nMyers said that\u2019s not the case at his farm. He grew up and went to school in the area with undocumented families. And today his children do, too.\n\n\u201cWe lose from every angle. The right-wingers come at us \u2026 \u2018You won't give jobs to Americans,\u201d Myers said. \u201cAnd then the left wing side of the discussion is, well, all you do is bring H-2A workers and they work for you like slaves.\u201d\n\nHe, too, wants a more flexible worker program and creating a path to legal status for undocumented workers here for 10 years and longer. He said the deportations have proved a problem both ethically for farm families and economically for the industry.\n\n\u201cLet's find a solution,\u201d he said on one video.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump suggested in Iowa \u2013 a leading corn and pork producer that relies heavily on migrant workers \u2013 that his administration would seek to permit some migrants without legal status to stay on farms, the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\n\"If a farmer\u2019s willing to vouch for these people, in some way, Kristi, I think we\u2019re going to have to just say that\u2019s going to be good, right?\" he said, referencing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem who was with him on the Iowa trip. \"You know, we\u2019re going to be good with it. Because we don\u2019t want to do it where we take all of the workers off the farms. We want the farms to do great like they\u2019re doing right now.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins cited plans to make the H-2A program \u201ccheaper, more efficient and more effective for those farmers.\u201d\n\nThe United Farm Workers favors paths to legal status for those already here over simply expanding the guestworker program for new arrivals, who they say would still be more prone to labor abuses.\n\nIn Congress, Republican U.S. Reps. Mari\u0301a Elvira Salazar of Florida, and Veronica Escobar of Texas introduced the DIGNITY Act. Among its many provisions is a seven-year earned legal status program allowing undocumented immigrants to live and work legally, with renewable status based on good conduct and restitution.\n\n\"We have 10 million people or more working in construction, hospitality, agriculture, dairy, fisheries, slaughterhouses who are undocumented but are not criminals,\" Salazar said at a news conference.\n\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson told the Wall Street Journal that immigration overhauls would face an uphill battle.\n\nRollins has also suggested that the country could fill jobs with Americans who will face Medicaid work requirements, something farmers immediately shot down.\n\nCunha, head of Nisei Farmers League, was among those very blunt about that idea: \u201cThat's just not going to work,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 1998, during President Bill Clinton\u2019s Welfare-to-Work push, Cunha helped launch an effort in 10 California counties to recruit welfare recipients and unemployed workers to help fill tens of thousands of farmworker jobs.\n\nPeople would be aided with child care, transportation and training. Just 500 people applied. And only three took jobs. None of them lasted more than two days, he said. Crops were lost.\n\n\u2018It was a total disaster,\u201d he said.\n\nA similar result took place in North Carolina, according to a 2013 report by the Partnership for a New American Economy and the Center for Global Development. When North Carolina had more than 489,000 unemployed residents, a growers association offered 6,500 jobs. Of 245 domestic workers hired, only seven lasted the entire season.\n\nIt's not likely he contended that higher wages alone would have Americans flocking to the jobs, he argued. Not only can the work be physically grueling or dangerous, Cunha said it is not the unskilled work that many people assume. It takes experience and skill to prune a fruit tree or know which fruits to pick now and which to return for later.\n\nAt a recent farm training in California that included topics like heat illness, Cunha said workers instead were full of questions about avoiding run-ins with ICE.\n\nShould they drive different routes or not wear hats and bandanas? One asked if he should shave his beard to look less like a farmworker.\n\nFor now, he said, as the area\u2019s remaining harvests are closing in, it's stressful for both farmers and farmworkers.\n\n\u201cLabor is tight, but it's holding. And as long as \u2013 we pray every day \u2013 they stay out of the valley, then we'll make it through this season,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do need to deal with it. We should not have to go through this type of tension. And workers should not have to worry about shaving their beard.\u201d",

      "text": "Labor and Immigration Reform\nEven as technology becomes a greater part of agriculture, much of dairy farming remains labor-intensive. U.S. dairy farmers rely on skilled workers to care for their animals, milk cows and tend crops.\nMany dairy farmers struggle to recruit and retain native workers despite higher wages and benefits, making immigrant labor an increasingly important part of the dairy workforce. A recent study estimates that immigrants make up over one-half of all dairy workers. The uncertainty that undergirds agricultural labor and immigration in the U.S. continues to harm workers and their families, farm employers, rural communities and national food security.\nDairy farmers continue to face the same shortage of domestic workers as all of agriculture, but they do not have access to the H-2A farmworker program, which only provides for seasonal labor rather than the year-round workers dairy needs. Dairy farms will not be able to survive, let alone thrive, without a steady, reliable workforce. Congress must act to address dairy\u2019s labor needs and ensure a stable food supply.\nOur Position\nNMPF strongly supports efforts to pass agriculture labor reform that provides permanent legal status to current workers and their families and gives dairy farmers access to a workable guestworker program.\nKey Points\n- Agricultural labor reform is long overdue and dairy farmers urgently need access to a stable, legal workforce.\n- Immigrant labor accounts for 51 percent of all dairy labor, and dairies that employ immigrant labor produce 79 percent of the U.S. milk supply. If the U.S. dairy industry lost its foreign-born workforce, it would nearly double retail milk prices and cost the total U.S. economy more than $32 billion.\n- Dairy farmers cannot lose their current workers without massive disruption to their farms and to rural economies. Employees who have been working on dairy farms for years should be able to continue working and earn permanent legal status, as should their immediate families.\n- The H-2A guestworker visa program, used by many in agriculture to attract seasonal foreign labor, doesn\u2019t fit dairy\u2019s year-round needs, but could be improved to make the program workable for dairy farmers.\n- Through the National Dairy FARM Program\u2019s Workforce Development program, dairy farmers are proactively implementing HR and safety management best practices; identifying which best practices are most useful to implement on their farm; and tracking improvement over time."

      "text": "Rep. Salazar Introduces Historic Bipartisan DIGNITY Act to Finally Fix America's Broken Immigration System\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Today, Congresswoman Mar\u00eda Elvira Salazar (FL-27) and Congresswoman Veronica Escobar (TX-16) introduced a new and improved version of the DIGNITY Act \u2013 the DIGNITY Act of 2025: a bold, historic, and commonsense immigration reform bill.\nThey were joined by a group of 20 members including Reps.Mike Lawler (NY-17), David Valadao (CA-22), Dan Newhouse (WA-04), Mike Kelly (PA-16), Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01), Gabe Evans (CO-08), Marlin Stutzman (IN-03), Don Bacon (NE-02), Young Kim (CA-40), Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), Hillary Scholten (MI-03), Susie Lee (NV-03), Adam Gray (CA-13), Salud Carbajal (CA-24), Mike Levin (CA-49), Nikki Budzinski (IL-13), Laura Gillen (NY-04), and Jake Auchincloss (MA-04).\nAt a press conference held at the U.S. Capitol, Rep. Salazar outlined a revolutionary path forward to fix a system that has been broken for decades.\n\"The Dignity Act of 2025 is a revolutionary bill that offers the solution to our immigration crisis: secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and provide an earned opportunity for long-term immigrants to stay here and work,\" said Congresswoman Salazar. \"No amnesty. No handouts. No citizenship. Just accountability and a path to stability for our economy and our future.\u201d\n\u201cI have seen firsthand the devastating consequences of our broken immigration system, and as a member of Congress, I take seriously my obligation to propose a solution. Realistic, common-sense compromise is achievable, and is especially important given the urgency of this moment. I consider the Dignity Act of 2025 a critical first step to overhauling this broken system,\u201d said Congresswoman Escobar. \u201cImmigrants \u2013 especially those who have been in the United States for decades \u2013 make up a critical component of our communities and also of the American workforce and economy. The vast majority of immigrants are hard-working, law-abiding residents; and, most Americans recognize that it is in our country\u2019s best interest to find bipartisan reforms. We can enact legislation that incorporates both humanity and security, and the Dignity Act of 2025 offers a balanced approach that restores dignity to people who have tried to navigate a broken system for far too long. The reintroduction of this legislation includes changes that reflect the challenges in today\u2019s political environment. I\u2019m proud of my bipartisan work with Representative Salazar, who has been a strong partner on this issue since December 2022. It is our hope that Congress seizes the opportunity to take an important step forward on this issue.\u201d\nThe Dignity Act delivers a long-overdue solution: it secures the border, restores law and order, revitalizes the American Workforce, and allows certain long-term undocumented immigrants to earn legal status, without amnesty or a path to citizenship. The bill restores order while offering a tough but fair opportunity for those who have contributed to the country.\nUnlike past efforts, the DIGNITY Act is fully funded through restitution payments and application fees made by immigrants, requiring NO taxpayer dollars.\n\"In conversations across NY-17, I\u2019ve heard a lot of frustration, both from employers struggling to fill jobs and families looking to reunite with their loved ones,\" said Congressman Lawler. \"We must do this by fixing our broken legal immigration system, securing our borders, and creating a fair, earned process for those who are already here and contributing. The Dignity Act honors America\u2019s legacy of being a nation of immigrants and that\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to support it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s past time for Congress to move reasonable immigration reform that restores law and order, ends illegal immigration, and provides a solution to undocumented immigrants\u2014who meet certain requirements\u2014the chance to live and work here legally,\u201d said Congressman Valadao. \u201cImmigration reform has long been one of my top priorities, and I\u2019m proud to help lead this bipartisan effort to secure our border, fix our immigration system, and strengthen our economy.\u201d\n\u201cAs the grandson of Mexican immigrants and a former cop and soldier, I\u2019ve seen firsthand the importance of a secure border and a fair immigration system,\" said Congressman Evans. \"I\u2019m proud to help introduce Congresswoman Salazar's bipartisan DIGNITY Act, which prioritizes border security while delivering a practical solution for immigrants who want to work hard, follow our laws, and be productive members of society. Our legislation accomplishes what Latino business owners and community members have been asking for: give immigrants positively contributing to our community an opportunity to pursue the American Dream.\u201d\nKey provisions of the Dignity Act include:\n- Border Security: Fully funds modern border infrastructure and enforcement.\n- Mandatory E-Verify: Prevents illegal hiring and protects American jobs.\n- Asylum Reform: Ends catch-and-release, and ensures timely and credible outcomes.\n- Dreamer Protections: Grants legal status and a path to permanent residency.\n- The Dignity Program: A 7-year earned legal status program allowing undocumented immigrants to live and work legally, with renewable status based on good conduct and restitution.\n- Workforce Development: Expands training, apprenticeships, and education for American workers.\n- Legal Immigration Reform: Updates visa categories to align with 21st-century economic needs.\nWith growing bipartisan support and endorsements from immigration groups, faith leaders, businesses, the agricultural sector, educators, and community leaders, the Dignity Act presents the strongest and most viable opportunity in years to achieve meaningful, lasting immigration reform.\nThe legislation acknowledges a key truth: most undocumented individuals are not seeking citizenship at all costs, but rather the dignity of living and working legally, contributing to society, paying taxes, being safe from deportation, and traveling to see family during the holidays.\nAt the same time, the Dignity Act makes clear that this will be the final fix, because real border security and enforcement must be in place to prevent future crises.\nWHY NOW?\nThe immigration crisis is no longer confined to border towns. From the recent riots in Los Angeles to overwhelmed communities across the country, the consequences of a broken system are unfolding in plain sight. Millions live in the shadows, our economy suffers from labor shortages, and the border remains a flashpoint of national concern.\nFor too long, Congress has failed to act, leaving communities, law enforcement, and immigrants caught in a system that doesn't work.\nThe Dignity Act delivers a real solution: secure the border and provide undocumented immigrants who meet strict conditions with an earned opportunity to live and work legally, with dignity and accountability.\nIt balances compassion with law and order.\nThis is a defining moment to act. The American people want security, dignity, and a system that works. The Dignity Act makes that possible.\nBACKGROUND:\nFor generations, the United States has been a beacon of hope for those fleeing violence, seeking opportunity, and building a better life. But our broken immigration system has left too many in the shadows and too many Americans without answers.\nThe Dignity Act reaffirms that while we are a nation of laws, we are also a nation of second chances. By restoring order and creating a clear, enforceable process, this legislation renews the American legacy of hope and opportunity.\nRESOURCES:\nFull press conference, click here.\nOne-pager on the Dignity Act, click here.\nDetailed summary of the Dignity Act, click here.\nSection-by-section breakdown of the Dignity Act, click here.\nFull text of the bill, click here."

      "text": "A cannabis farmworker who was critically injured during a chaotic immigration raid by federal authorities in Southern California died Saturday, according to his family.\nJaime Alanis Garcia\u2019s death came days after he fell roughly 30 feet during a raid by federal immigration authorities at Glass House Farms in Camarillo, California, a city about 50 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.\nGarcia\u2019s family told NBC Los Angeles that he broke his neck and skull in the fall and was placed on life support shortly afterward \u2014 until his wife could travel from Mexico to be by his side before he died.\n\u201cHis wife and parents decided today to let him rest. He has passed away,\u201d his niece said in a statement Saturday.\nHis family acknowledged to NBC Los Angeles that Garcia would not have survived the past fews days had he not been connected to an assistive breathing machine.\nTeresa Romero, president of United Farm Workers, the labor union that has long represented California field hands from Mexico and other points outside the United States, said in a statement Saturday night that Garcia's death has left the organization anguished.\n\u201cOur hearts are heavy for the grieving family of Jaime Alanis, who died from injuries sustained during a chaotic raid on Thursday,\" she said. \"We'll do everything we can to support them.\"\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return a request for comment.\nImmigration officials said in a statement Friday that Garcia was not in federal custody when he fell.\n\u201cAlthough he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a green house and fell 30 feet,\u201d Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. \u201cCBP immediately called a medivac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.\u201d\nThe raid drew hundreds of demonstrators, some of whom threw rock and bricks at cars belonging to federal agents. Immigration officers \"faced assaults, violence, and even bullets fired at them,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi said in a post on X on Saturday.\nIn response, federal agents deployed less-lethal weapons and tear gas at the protesters, while employees were being arrested inside the cannabis grow house.\nPresident Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post Friday night that he watched the protests \u201cin disbelief,\u201d adding that immigration authorities should use \u201cwhatever means is necessary\u201d to arrest people who do not obey the law.\nThe cannabis farm where Garcia worked was one of two Glass House properties federal officers raided Thursday.\nNoem said in Saturday's X post that the operation led to the arrest of 319 undocumented migrants. Fourteen children were also \u201crescued\u201d from \u201cpotential forced labor, exploitation, and trafficking,\u201d she said.\nRomero, of the United Farm Workers, said those children should be given an opportunity to obtain their own legal counsel \"to protect them from further harm.\"\nShe said farmworkers are not protected under child labor laws that might otherwise exclude them from such work. \"Detaining and deporting children is not a solution,\" Romero said.\nThe raids came more than a month after protests against similar operations in Los Angeles virtually shut down parts of the city and captured the nation\u2019s attention.\nIn response, Trump took the rare step of deploying the National Guard to quell protesters.\nOn Friday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a Democrat, signed a directive requiring city departments to submit preparedness plans detailing how employees, including contractors, should respond if approached by federal immigration authorities.\nRomero said U.S. citizens were among those rounded up during the law enforcement action in Camarillo.\n\u201cThese violent and cruel federal actions terrorize American communities, disrupt the American food supply chain, threaten lives and separate families,\u201d she said.\nShe touted a federal court's temporary restraining order against U.S. immigration enforcement in cases where officers lack reasonable suspicion and target people based on how they look, the type of work they do, where they're located, or whether they speak Spanish or English with an accent.\nThe suit was brought by UFW, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, the ACLU and other civil rights and migrant organizations, and it was supported by the state of California, the city of Los Angeles and other jurisdictions."

      "text": "ERS provides information on a range of farm labor issues, including:\n- Size and composition of the U.S. agricultural workforce (self-employed versus hired)\n- Recent trends in the employment of hired farmworkers\n- Demographic characteristics of hired farmworkers, including age, sex, and nativity\n- Wages of hired farmworkers\n- Labor cost share of total gross revenues\n- H-2A temporary agricultural program\n- Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR)\n- Legal status and migration practices of hired farmworkers (crop agriculture only)\nFinally, we provide links to key data sources with summaries.\nSize and Composition of the U.S. Agricultural Workforce\nThe U.S. agricultural workforce has long consisted of a mixture of two groups of workers: (1) self-employed farm operators and their family members, and (2) hired workers. Both types of employment were in long-term decline from 1950 to 1990, as mechanization contributed to rising agricultural productivity, reducing the need for labor. Since 1990, employment levels have stabilized.\nThe reduction in self-employed and family labor through 1990 was more rapid than the decline in hired labor. According to data from the Farm Labor Survey (FLS) of USDA's National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS), the number of self-employed and family farmworkers declined from 7.60 million in 1950 to 2.01 million in 1990, a 74-percent reduction. Over this same period, average annual employment of hired farmworkers\u2014including on-farm support personnel and those who work for farm labor contractors\u2014declined from 2.33 million to 1.15 million, a 51-percent reduction. As a result, the proportion of hired workers has increased over time.\nDownload chart image | Chart data\nThe rest of this page describes the employment, earnings, demographic characteristics, and other information for the hired farm labor force only. (Information on the well-being of the self-employed farmers and their families may be found on the ERS topic page on Farm Household Well-being.)\nHired farmworkers make up less than 1 percent of all U.S. wage and salary workers, but they play an essential role in U.S. agriculture. According to data from the 2022 Census of Agriculture, wages and salaries plus contract labor costs represented just 12 percent of production expenses for all farms, but 42 percent for greenhouse and nursery operations and 40 percent for fruit and tree nut operations.\u201d\nHired farmworkers are found in a variety of occupations, including field crop workers, nursery workers, livestock workers, graders and sorters, agricultural inspectors, supervisors, and hired farm managers. The majority are wage and salary workers, hired directly by farmers, but some are employees of agricultural service companies, including farm labor contractors, custom harvest providers, and management service providers. Many industrywide employment estimates also include support personnel on farms, such as human resource managers, sales agents, and truck drivers.\nMany hired farmworkers are foreign-born people from Mexico and countries in Central America, with many lacking authorization to work legally in the United States. In recent years, farmworkers have become more settled, fewer migrating long distances from home to work, and fewer pursuing seasonal follow-the-crop migration. The number of young, recent immigrants working in agriculture has also fallen, and as a result the farm workforce is aging. Over the past 30 years, wages for hired farmworkers have gradually risen, both in real terms and in relation to wages for the average nonsupervisory worker in a nonfarm occupation.\nHired farmworkers are employed in both metro (urban) and nonmetro (rural) counties. The statistics presented here refer to farmworkers nationwide, unless otherwise indicated.\nRecent Trends in the Employment of Hired Farmworkers\nAccording to data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), wage and salary employment in agriculture (measured as the annual average number of full- and part-time jobs)\u2014including support industries such as farm labor contracting\u2014stabilized in the 2000s and has been on a gradual upward trend since 2010, rising from 1.13 million in 2013 to 1.17 million in 2023, a gain of 4 percent.\nFrom 2013 to 2023, employment increases were highest in crop support services (which added about 17,400 jobs, a 6-percent increase) and the livestock sector (which added about 29,000 jobs, a 12-percent increase). It should be noted that the QCEW is based on unemployment insurance records, not on surveys of farms or households. As a result, it does not cover smaller farm employers in those States that exempt such employers from participation in the unemployment insurance system.\nHowever, survey data sources, such as the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey, also find rising farm employment since the turn of the century.\nDownload chart image | Chart data\nDemographic Characteristics of Hired Farmworkers\nDemographic information on farmworkers can be found in the American Community Survey (ACS) from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. These data also allow us to distinguish among manual laborers, managers/supervisors, and other occupations in the industry. Farm laborers have lower levels of educational attainment, are slightly younger than U.S. private wage and salary workers, are more likely to be Hispanic of Mexican origin, and are less likely to be citizens than both workers in other occupations in agriculture and the U.S. wage and salary workforce as a whole.\n| Item | Farm laborers, graders and sorters | Farm managers, inspectors, and supervisors | All other occupations in agriculture | Agriculture: All occupations | All U.S. private wage and salary workers |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Percent female | 26 | 17 | 35 | 27 | 44 |\n| Average age in years | 39.6 | 42.4 | 42.3 | 40.8 | 40.5 |\n| Percent under age 25 | 20 | 11 | 15 | 17 | 18 |\n| Percent over age 44 | 39 | 43 | 45 | 41 | 41 |\n| Percent married | 48 | 64 | 55 | 53 | 48 |\n| Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry | |||||\n| Percent White, not Hispanic | 31 | 63 | 62 | 46 | 57 |\n| Percent Black, not Hispanic | 3 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 11 |\n| Percent other, not Hispanic | 4 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 11 |\n| Percent Hispanic: Mexican origin | 55 | 23 | 23 | 40 | 12 |\n| Percent Hispanic: Other | 8 | 6 | 5 | 7 | 8 |\n| Percent born in U.S. (includes Puerto Rico) | 46 | 76 | 79 | 61 | 81 |\n| Percent U.S. citizens | 56 | 83 | 87 | 70 | 91 |\n| Education | |||||\n| Percent lacking high school diploma | 44 | 17 | 15 | 31 | 8 |\n| Percent with high school diploma (includes equivalency) | 33 | 33 | 32 | 33 | 29 |\n| Percent with at least some college | 22 | 50 | 52 | 36 | 63 |\n| Note: Counts all private sector wage and salary workers employed in the crop, livestock, and agricultural support industries. Source: USDA, Economic Research Service analysis of data from U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, American Community Survey, 2022. |\nDifferences in demographics are also evident between crop and livestock workers (not shown in table). A larger share of laborers in crops and related support industries are female (28 percent versus 20 percent in livestock). Crop laborers are also less likely to be non-Hispanic White (26 percent versus 49 percent for livestock), and less likely to have been born in the United States (41 percent for crop workers in manual labor occupations versus 65 percent for manual livestock workers). Finally, crop laborers have lower levels of educational attainment: 47 percent lack a high school degree, compared with 34 percent in livestock.\nNotably, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS), discussed below, finds larger shares of foreign-born, Hispanic, and less-educated employees among crop and support workers than does the ACS (livestock workers are not surveyed in NAWS). For example, according to NAWS estimates from data spanning fiscal years 2020\u201322, just 32 percent of crop farm workers in manual labor occupations were U.S. born, compared with 41 percent in the 2022 ACS.\nThe Hired Farm Workforce Is Aging\nAs fewer young immigrants are entering agriculture, the average age of foreign-born farmworkers has risen, pulling up the average for the farm workforce as a whole.\nThe average age of foreign-born farmworkers rose by close to 7 years between 2006 and 2022. In contrast, the average age for U.S.-born farmworkers has remained roughly constant over this period.\nDownload chart image | Chart data\nWomen Are an Increasing Share of the Hired Farm Workforce\nThe share of farmworkers who are women declined in 2006\u201309, from 20.3 percent to 18.6 percent, but has since climbed to 26.4 percent (in 2022). The fact that the female share fell during the Great Recession and has risen during the recovery is consistent with men moving into agriculture as employment in the nonfarm economy declines, and out of agriculture as nonfarm job prospects improve. The rising female share is also consistent with the fact that, as labor costs rise, some growers are adopting mechanical aids (such as hydraulic platforms that replace ladders in tree-fruit harvesting, and mobile conveyor belts that reduce the distance heavy loads must be carried) which facilitate more women and older workers in performing tasks that traditionally have been performed by younger men.\nDownload chart image | Chart data\nWages of Hired Farmworkers\nAccording to data from the FLS, real (inflation-adjusted) wages for nonsupervisory crop and livestock workers (excluding contract labor) rose at an average annual rate of 1.1 percent per year between 1990 and 2023. In the past 5 years, however, real farm wages grew at 2.1 percent per year, consistent with growers' reports that workers were harder than usual to find.\nIn 1990, the average real farm wage for nonsupervisory crop and livestock workers was just over half the average real wage in the nonfarm economy for private-sector nonsupervisory occupations ($11.71 versus $23.19, in 2023 dollars). By 2023, the farm wage ($17.55) was equal to 61 percent of the nonfarm wage ($28.93). In other words, the gap between farm and nonfarm wages is slowly shrinking, but still substantial.\nDownload chart image | Chart data\nWages for nonsupervisory occupations varied little across occupations, ranging from $16.36 (for packers and packagers) to $18.47 (for equipment operators). For five out of the six nonsupervisory occupations, however, wages were more than 3.5 percent higher in 2023 than in 2022 (not adjusted for inflation).\nAverage hourly wages for hired agricultural managers stood at $28.79 in 2023, up 4.4 percent from the year before. Supervisor wages averaged $25.61 per hour, up 6.4 percent from 2022 (not adjusted for inflation).\n| Occupation | SOC code | Employment share 2023 (percent) | Average hourly wage 2023 | Nominal wage growth, 2022-23 (percent change) | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Graders and sorters, agricultural products | (45-2041) | 2 | 16.58 | 3.9 | |\n| Agricultural equipment operators | (45-2091) | 17 | 18.47 | 5.0 | |\n| Farmworkers, crop, nursery, and greenhouse | (45-2092) | 43 | 17.60 | 6.4 | |\n| Farmworkers, farm, ranch, and aquacultural | (45-2093) | 22 | 16.51 | 3.5 | |\n| Agricultural workers, all other | (45-2099) | 1 | 17.82 | 4.7 | |\n| Packers and packagers, hand | (53-7064) | 2 | 16.36 | -2.3 | |\n| Subtotal, nonsupervisory farmworkers | 87 | 17.45 | 5.1 | ||\n| Farmers, ranchers, and agricultural managers | (11-9013) | 4 | 28.79 | 4.4 | |\n| First-line supervisors | (45-1011) | 3 | 25.61 | 6.4 | |\n| Subtotal, supervisory and nonsupervisory occupations | 94 | 18.13 | 5.3 | ||\n| All other farm occupations | 6 | 24.40 | 6.7 | ||\n| All farm occupations | 100 | 18.53 | 5.5 | ||\n| Note: SOC = Standard Occupational Classification (SOC).

Source: USDA, Economic Research Service using data from USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Farm Labor Survey. |\nLabor Cost Share of Total Gross Revenues\nAlthough farm wages are rising in nominal and real terms, the impact of these rising costs on farmers' incomes has been offset by rising productivity and/or output prices. As a result, labor costs as a share of gross cash income do not show an upward trend for the industry as a whole over the past 20 years. For all farms, labor costs (including contract labor, and cash fringe benefit costs) averaged 10.4 percent of gross cash income during 2018\u201320, compared with 11.0 percent during 1998\u20132000.\nHowever, these trends in labor cost shares differ by commodity. Labor cost shares have fallen slightly over the past 20 years for the more labor-intensive fruit and vegetable sectors, although they appear to have been trending upwards again in the past few years. On dairies and in nursery operations, both of which also rely heavily on immigrant labor, labor costs as a share of income are at or near their 20-year highs.\nDownload chart image | Chart data\nH-2A Temporary Agricultural Program\nThe H-2A Temporary Agricultural Program\u2014often called the H-2A visa program\u2014provides a legal means to bring foreign-born workers to the United States to perform seasonal farm labor on a temporary basis, for a period of up to 10 months. Crop farmers can use this program to meet their seasonal labor needs, but most livestock producers, such as ranches, dairies, and hog and poultry operations, are not legally allowed to use the program to meet year-round labor needs. An exception to this restriction is made for producers of livestock on the range, such as sheep and goat operations, who can use H-2A workers year-round.\nEmployers in the H-2A program must demonstrate, and the U.S. Department of Labor must certify, that efforts to recruit U.S. workers were not successful.\nEmployers must also pay a State-specific minimum wage, which may not be lower than the average wage for crop and livestock workers surveyed in the FLS in that region in the prior year, known as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR). (See the next section for details on the AEWR.) In addition, employers must provide housing for their H-2A workers and pay for their domestic and international transportation.\nOne of the clearest indicators of the scarcity of farm labor is the fact that the number of H-2A positions requested and approved has increased more than sevenfold in the past 18 years, from just over 48,000 positions certified in fiscal 2005 to around 378,034 in fiscal year 2023. The average duration of an H-2A certification in fiscal 2023 was 5.75 months, implying that the 378,034 positions certified represented around 180,000 full-year equivalents. A certified job does not necessarily result in the issuance of a visa; in fact, in recent years only about 80 percent of jobs certified as H-2A have resulted in visas. Around 310,000 visas were issued in fiscal 2023 by the Department of State.\nDownload chart image | Chart data\nAdverse Effect Wage Rate\nH-2A employers must provide transportation and housing and pay the higher of the applicable State or federal minimum wage, the prevailing wage in that region and occupation, as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, or the regional average farm wage observed in the NASS FLS. The latter is known as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR), reflecting the legal requirement that H-2A employment should not negatively affect domestic farmworkers by lowering the average wage. For fiscal 2024, this minimum hourly wage ranged from $14.53 (in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi) to $19.75 (in California) and $20.72 (in the District of Columbia).\nDownload chart image | Chart data\nLegal Status and Migration Practices of Hired Crop Farmworkers\nLegal immigration status is difficult to measure: not many surveys ask the question, and unauthorized respondents may be reluctant to answer truthfully if asked. The U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) provides data on farmworkers\u2019 legal immigration status. NAWS data, believed to be of high quality, is gathered by trained and trusted enumerators who conduct face-to-face interviews with workers at their job sites and with their employers\u2019 permission. NAWS also queries workers on their inter- and intranational migration patterns. One limitation of the NAWS, however, is that it excludes the growing number of H- 2A workers, as well as all hired livestock workers.\nRoughly Half of Hired Crop Farmworkers Lack Legal Immigration Status\nThe share of hired crop farmworkers who were not legally authorized to work in the United States grew from roughly 14 percent in 1989\u201391 to almost 55 percent in 1999\u20132001; in recent years it has declined to about 40 percent. In 2020\u201322, 32 percent of crop farmworkers were U.S. born, 7 percent were immigrants who had obtained U.S. citizenship, 19 percent were other authorized immigrants (primarily permanent residents or green-card holders), and the remaining 42 percent held no work authorization. The share of workers who are U.S. born is highest in the Midwest, while the share who are unauthorized is highest in California.\nDownload chart image | Chart data\nMore Farmworkers Are Settled, Fewer Are Migrants\nEighty three percent of hired crop farmworkers are not migrant workers but are considered settled, meaning that they work at a single location within 75 miles of their home. This share is up from 41 percent in 1996\u201398, reflecting a profound change in the nature of the crop farm workforce.\nAmong the small share of remaining migrant workers, the largest group is \"shuttlers,\" who work at a single farm location more than 75 miles from home and may cross an international border to get to their worksite. Shuttlers made up about 9 percent of hired crop farmworkers in 2022, down from about 24 percent in 1996\u201398.\nMore common in the past, the \"follow the crop\" migrant farmworker, who moves from State to State working on different crops as the seasons advance, is now a relative rarity. These workers made up just 4 percent of those surveyed by the NAWS in 2020\u201322, down from a high of 14 percent in 1992\u201394.\nThe final category of hired crop farmworkers is newcomers to farming, whose migration patterns have not yet been established. The fact that they now represent just 3.6 percent of the crop farm workforce, down from as much as 22 percent in 1998\u20132000, in part reflecting the slowdown in net migration from Mexico to the United States since 2007.\nDownload chart image | Chart data\nLinks to Key Data Sources\nFrom the U.S. Department of Agriculture:\n- Farm Labor Survey\nThe Farm Labor Survey (FLS) conducted by USDA\u2019s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is based on semi-annual phone interviews with a random sample of farm employers (crops and livestock) who are asked to provide quarterly data on their wage bill, employment counts, and average weekly hours for all hired workers, by occupation. Contract labor is excluded, and no demographic information on the workforce is collected. Each year, the FLS's estimate of the annual average wage for nonsupervisory field and livestock workers in each of 18 regions is used as the basis for the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR), which sets a minimum wage for H-2A workers in the following year. The survey is described here, and its quarterly reports are archived here. Data and statistics can also be obtained via NASS Quick Stats. - Census of Agriculture\nEvery 5 years (years ending in 2 and 7), NASS conducts a full census of every farm in the country. Published statistics include national-, State-, and county-level tables on many topics, including land use and ownership, operator characteristics, production practices, income, and expenditures. Information on total employment (a simple head count, not adjusted for full-year or full-time equivalency) and labor expenditures (including contract labor) is also available. Again, almost no demographic information on the hired farm work force is collected. The Census is described here. Published tables from the 2022 Census are here. Data can also be obtained via NASS Quick Stats. - Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS)\nARMS, jointly sponsored by ERS and NASS, is an annual survey of roughly 30,000 farms that serves as the primary source of information on the financial condition, production practices, and resource use of America's farm businesses and the economic well-being of America's farm households. The field-level phase collects information on production practices and costs (fertilizer, pesticide, labor, tillage, seed, etc.) for target commodities. The farm-level phase collects financial information for farm businesses and a variety of financial and demographic information (age, education, occupation, off-farm income, etc.) for farm operators and their households. The survey collects information from 48 States and is designed to represent the continental United States and to support State-level estimates for 15 key agricultural States. An online web tool permits the creation of various customized reports on farm structure and finance, and crop production practices.\nFrom Other Agencies:\n- National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS)\nNAWS, conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor, is an employment-based, random-sample survey of U.S. crop workers (neither livestock workers nor seasonal workers on H-2A visas are covered) that collects demographic, employment, and health data in face-to-face interviews. The NAWS is the source of estimates of legal immigration status of the Nation's crop farmworkers and is the basis for much of the research on farmworker health and well-being. is an employment-based, random-sample survey of U.S. crop workers (livestock workers are not covered, nor are seasonal workers on H-2A visas) that collects demographic, employment, and health data in face-to-face interviews. The NAWS is the source of estimates of legal immigration status of the Nation's crop farmworkers, and is the basis for much of the research on farmworker health and well-being. Results are tabulated here, and the underlying microdata files are also available for public use. - Current Population Survey (CPS)\nThe Census Bureau's CPS interviews about 60,000 households each month, asking detailed questions about demographic characteristics and labor market outcomes. It is the source of the official estimates of the unemployment rate, which are released on the first Friday of every month. Note that this release also contains information on employment levels, derived from a different survey, called the Current Employment Statistics survey, which interviews employers. CPS also serves as the basis for much of the published research on the U.S. labor market. CPS's Annual Social and Economic Supplement, conducted each March, is the source of official statistics on poverty and income distribution. Farmworkers may be identified using industry and occupation codes in the CPS Public Use Microdata (PUMS) files. Results are available at the State level, and for larger metro areas. Results are not generally tabulated for metro versus nonmetro areas, but such tabulations are possible using the microdata files, although for a small number of households, metro status is not reported. - American Community Survey (ACS)\nThe ACS is a rolling monthly survey that interviews more than 2 million households annually, collecting basic demographic, labor market, and income data. Results are released annually for the nation, for States (with separate tallies for their metropolitan and nonmetropolitan components), and for large metro areas. Information on smaller geographic areas is released only for 5-year averages. Although the income questionnaire is less detailed than CPS, its larger sample size makes the ACS a more reliable measure of income and basic labor market outcomes for smaller geographic regions. Results are accessible using the Census data access site. Farmworkers may be identified using industry and occupation codes in the ACS Public Use Microdata (PUMS) files. - Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)\nBEA synthesizes data from multiple sources to provide annual industry employment and earnings estimates at the national, State and county levels. Information on the number of farm proprietors, hired farmworkers, and both self-employed and hired workers in agricultural support services, and their earnings, is reported. Note that BEA's data on self-employment (employment of proprietors) are not comparable to other sources of data on self-employment, because they are not limited to those for whom self-employment is the primary activity. - Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)\nThe QCEW provides monthly estimates of employment and earnings for all industries, but is limited to employers who are mandated to contribute to State unemployment insurance funds. This excludes some smaller farm employers in States that do not have universal unemployment insurance coverage. The QCEW classifies farm employers by their primary product, and then reports employment and earnings for all occupations employed in that industry, at the national, State, and county levels. Some results are suppressed at lower levels of geography and finer industry detail to protect respondent anonymity."

      "text": "Washington, DC \u2013 Yesterday, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons demanding answers about recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations conducted in Ventura County, California. These operations, which took place at a farm in Camarillo, have sparked widespread fear and raised serious concerns about the agency\u2019s tactics, transparency, and adherence to due process.\n\u201cThe farmworkers detained in these raids are clearly in the United States to fill jobs that employers cannot otherwise fill,\u201d said Congresswoman Brownley. \u201cTheir undocumented status is not by choice, but a direct result of Congress\u2019 ongoing failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform that would allow a sufficient number of workers into the country and provide a viable pathway to citizenship. Instead of working to build this pathway, the government is spending tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to deport, in such a cruel and callous way, the exact individuals who would be covered by a comprehensive immigration reform package. Congress refuses to take up comprehensive immigration reform for purely partisan reasons.\u201d\nIn the letter, Brownley demanded urgent answers about the \u201clegal basis, execution, and impact\u201d of these raids on our community.\n\u201cThe sudden and ominous nature of ICE\u2019s presence and tactics has sown fear, disrupted lives, and raised serious questions about ICE\u2019s adherence to due process and established policies,\u201d said Congresswoman Brownley. \u201cAccording to reports and eyewitness accounts, there are significant concerns about the conduct of ICE\u2019s enforcement activities, including potential violations of civil rights and the harmful impact on public trust.\u201d\n\u201cAs you undoubtedly are aware, these recent ICE actions have had a chilling effect on the entire community, causing fear among families, workers, students, and business owners. Many residents are now afraid to go to work, take their children to school, or seek medical care out of concern for their safety and legal status. Furthermore, such actions erode trust in law enforcement and local government, making it more difficult for authorities to maintain public safety and community cooperation.\u201d\nIn the letter, Congresswoman Brownley demanded ICE & DHS provide immediate and accurate information on their immigration enforcement activities, including:\n- The number of individuals arrested and their current status, including whether any face deportation or expedited removal\n- The rationale behind targeting Ventura County and what prompted this enforcement operation\n- The locations where detained individuals are being held\n- Whether agents entered non-public areas without warrants or consent, and details of any permissions granted\n- Whether arrests were made with or without warrants, and if ICE followed federal guidelines for warrantless arrests\n- The criteria used to determine whom to question, and whether race, ethnicity, or language were factors\n- Whether U.S. citizens, legal residents, DACA recipients, visa holders, or veterans were detained, and how their rights were safeguarded\n- What engagement, if any, occurred with local law enforcement, community organizations, or legal aid groups to ensure transparency and due process\n- Whether detained individuals have had access to legal counsel or been allowed to notify family members\n- The process for family and attorneys to locate, contact, or visit detained individuals\nThe Department of Homeland Security has confirmed receipt of the letter but has yet to provide responses to the questions posed by Congresswoman Brownley. The Department also never responded to Brownley\u2019s prior inquiries on immigration raids earlier in the year in Ventura County.\nView the full text of the letter below and here.\nThe Honorable Kristi Noem\nSecretary\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave., SE\nWashington, DC 20528-0525\nMr. Todd M. Lyons\nActing Director\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n500 12th Street, SW\nWashington, DC 20536-5010\nDear Secretary Noem and Acting Director Lyons,\nI am writing to express my deep concerns regarding the recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations conducted in my district in Ventura County, California and to seek urgent answers about its legal basis, execution, and impact on our community.\nCalifornia\u2019s 26th Congressional District is home to a diverse and hard-working population- families, small business owners, service workers, educators, veterans, and farmworkers \u2013 who all contribute to the social and economic fabric of Ventura County. While my constituents and I understand the important role ICE plays in protecting our nation from violent criminals, sex traffickers, and gang members, we also believe ICE should focus its resources on deporting those who pose a real danger to the public, not hard working individuals who are making positive contributions to our nation, working in hard-to-fill jobs, paying taxes, and raising their children.\nThe sudden and ominous nature of ICE\u2019s presence and tactics has sown fear, disrupted lives, and raised serious questions about ICE\u2019s adherence to due process and established policies. According to reports and eyewitness accounts, there are significant concerns about the conduct of ICE\u2019s enforcement activities, including potential violations of civil rights and the harmful impact on public trust.\nFor months, I have heard from agriculture industry representatives who have contacted my office to express concerns about the impacts of ICE\u2019s activities on farm operations, as farmworkers \u2014 who are essential workers \u2014 may fear showing up to work. Last month, ICE chased farmworkers through the fields of Oxnard and Santa Paula; and today, the nation watched as ICE officers descended upon a local agricultural grower and rounded up dozens of individuals and deploying tear gas against concerned local residents, who came to protest ICE\u2019s harsh tactics.\nIn light of these concerns, I am requesting prompt answers to the following questions:\n- How many individuals were arrested during ICE\u2019s activities in my district? What is the status of each individual arrested, and are any facing imminent deportation proceedings? Has anyone been placed in expedited removal or administrative removal?\n- Why has Ventura County been targeted for ICE\u2019s enforcement tactics? What sparked this sudden effort?\n- Where are individuals who were taken being detained?\n- Did ICE agents enter non-public areas of businesses or residential buildings? If so, did they have judicial warrants authorizing such access, or was consent obtained? Please provide details on any permissions granted, including by whom and under what circumstances.\n- Did ICE have specific arrest warrants for individuals in Ventura County, or were any arrests made without a warrant? If warrantless arrests were made, did ICE comply with the nationwide warrantless arrest policy under the Castanon Nava settlement, including requirements for probable cause and proper documentation?\n- What criteria did ICE agents use in determining whom to question? Were race, ethnicity, or language proficiency factors in those decisions? For each person questioned, please specify the justification for their detainment or interrogation.\n- Were U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, DACA recipients, visa holders, or veterans among those questioned or detained? If so, how were their rights protected during this operation?\n- What measures, if any, were taken to engage with local law enforcement, community organizations, or legal aid groups before or after this action to ensure transparency and due process?\n- For individuals detained, how many have had access to legal counsel? How many have been allowed to notify family members and loved ones of their location and reasons for detention?\n- What is the process for such notifications, and what is the process for loved ones and legal counsel to visit with or talk to those detained?\nAs you undoubtedly are aware, these recent ICE actions have had a chilling effect on the entire community, causing fear among families, workers, students, and business owners. Many residents are now afraid to go to work, take their children to school, or seek medical care out of concern for their safety and legal status. Furthermore, such actions erode trust in law enforcement and local government, making it more difficult for authorities to maintain public safety and community cooperation. Targeting hardworking immigrants is also contrary to our values as a nation, as we are a nation made up largely of immigrants whose ancestors all came to the United States to make better lives for themselves and their families.\nThe 26th Congressional District of California is a vibrant and inclusive region where people of all backgrounds work hard to build better lives for themselves and their families. Actions that instill fear and division harm not only those directly impacted but also the broader social and economic stability of our communities. Given these serious concerns, I request a detailed response to my questions no later than July 18, 2025.\nSincerely,\nJULIA BROWNLEY\nMember of Congress\n###\nIssues: 119th Congress, Immigration, Local Issues"

      "text": "North Country dairy farms are getting caught up in Trump's immigration enforcement\nThere\u2019s a culture of apprehension in dairy country right now. Rumors and reports are swirling about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, visiting farms and taking away workers.\n\"We've been hearing some different things out on the web and amongst the community,\" a New York State dairy farmer said. We\u2019re not using his name because farm owners and their employees risk immigration crackdowns and deportations.\n\"The challenge to ourselves is to try to determine the difference between the rumors and what's actually going on,\" he said.\nIt\u2019s not all just rumors, though. Last week, ICE picked up four adults and three children at a dairy farm in Sackets Harbor. ICE said it began conducting \u201cenhanced targeted operations in parts of New York\" on March 24.\n\"There's no doubt that there's increased enforcement. So there's a lot of smoke, but there's also some fire,\" said Richard Stup, the director of Cornell Agricultural Workforce Development.\nImmigration enforcement ramps up\nStup said we\u2019re seeing President Donald Trump\u2019s promise play out: to deport millions of immigrants who are living and working in the US illegally.\nRight now, the feds are primarily pursuing individuals who have a criminal record, Stup said. While immigration officers are looking for them, in some cases, they\u2019re also picking up unauthorized workers they find along the way.\n\"The concern is, will that policy remain the way it is? Or will they start to pick up more people that may not have a criminal record, but in fact, may be unauthorized to be here?\" Stup said.\nUnauthorized workers fill the industry\nThe dairy industry relies on workers who are in the country illegally, mostly from Mexico and Central America. There isn\u2019t a legal way for immigrants to work on dairy farms year-round.\nSome estimates say unauthorized workers make up as high as 80% of the workforce, or as low as 30%. Stup says he thinks it\u2019s somewhere in between, like 40-60%.\nIt became that way because farm owners couldn\u2019t find local workers.\n\"It really became a situation where they were looking elsewhere for creative solutions,\" said Allyson Jones-Brimmer, vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs for the Northeast Dairy Producers Association, a group that advocates for dairy farmers.\nFarmers started hiring migrant workers to fill in the gaps, and it\u2019s worked out well for them. Many workers stay at a farm for years. They may move around to find better salaries and benefits. Some rise to management roles. Their employers depend on them to keep farms running.\n\"It doesn't really hurt the local, domestic workforce,\" Stup said. \"Even if we were pushed to depend only on the domestic workforce, there just wouldn't be enough people to go around to fill the dairy farm jobs that are out there. We need some guest workers to fill those jobs.\"\nThe unheard push for reform\nThe industry and both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in the North Country and New York State have lobbied for decades for a legal year-round visa program. But Congress has failed to act.Many dairy farmers and agricultural groups want to see the existing H-2A temporary guest worker program expanded.\nJones-Brimmer said the temporary visa is great for fruit and vegetable farms that are busiest during planting and harvesting, but cows don\u2019t care what time of year it is.\n\"There are just some positions on a dairy farm that are not seasonal,\" she said. \"They happen every day of the year, multiple times a day, to feed, milk, and care for the cows.\"\nThis labor issue is one of the factors that\u2019s forcing some farmers to sell their herds.\nThe 2022 Census of Agriculture showed that while dairy is the largest sector of state agriculture, about 1,900 dairy farms in New York closed between 2017 and 2022.\nNew York Farm Bureau President David Fisher said that trend could continue if there isn\u2019t reform.\n\"Where do people want to get their food? Do they want to import some workers or do they want to import all the food?\" he said. \"We have in the last couple years become a net importer of food in this country, which is concerning because that's national security. Once farmers are out of business, they don't start up very easily.\"\nThat could have a huge impact in the North Country, where dairy farming is one of the biggest economic drivers.\nThe top fear right now is that if ICE detains multiple workers from multiple farms, no one will be left to milk thousands of cows.\n\"What if inside of a county, six dairies are affected and then lose most of their workforce?\" Richard Stup, with Cornell Agricultural Workforce Development, said. \"Suddenly, our neighbors can't help us because they're also affected. If you start having widespread enforcement like that, it could quickly become a cascading effect that would be a really serious challenge for the industry to deal with.\"\nFor farmers, there\u2019s still plenty of work to do. Most are keeping their heads down. The New York dairy farmer, whose name we\u2019re not using, said this is taking up time and brain power.\n\"It's a lot of unnecessary turbulence right now that we're just trying to work through,\" he said.\nThe farmer said he\u2019ll just keep working, like all farmers do, through any conditions."

      "text": "Trump, in Iowa, celebrates America's birthday, recent victories: 'We\u2019ve saved our country'\n- Trump said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to be back in Iowa and reminisced on the historically cold caucus night he won in 2024.\n- Attendees braved the weather for hours in the lead-up to the event with little reprieve from the baking sun.\n- \"There can be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago when Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill to make America great again,\" Trump said.\nPresident Donald Trump cheered his signature legislative achievement in Des Moines just hours after Congress passed a massive tax cut and spending plan that he\u2019s dubbed \u201cthe one, big, beautiful bill.\u201d\n\"With this bill, every major promise I made to the people of Iowa in 2024 became a promise kept,\" he told an ebullient crowd July 3 at the Iowa State Fairgrounds.\nThe sweeping legislation will make permanent tax cuts that Trump signed into law during his first term, and it will make massive spending cuts to benefit programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. It also is projected to increase deficits by about $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve saved our country,\u201d Trump told a cheering crowd.\nTrump was in town to help kick off the one-year lead-up to America250, the nation\u2019s semiquincentennial, which celebrates the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\nHe said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to be back in Iowa and reminisced on the historically cold caucus night he won in 2024.\n\"Eighteen months ago, the people of Iowa braved subzero temperatures,\" Trump said. \"Do you remember that night? Oh, that was cold. It was cold but we were warm inside because we won by a landslide to turn out the first in the nation caucuses.\"\nIt was a sharp departure from the 90-plus-degree heat that blanketed the fairgrounds on July 3.\nBut attendees still handled the weather for hours in the lead-up to the event with little reprieve from the baking sun.\nAt the fair\u2019s midway point next to the grandstand, a trio of risers bedecked with flag banners formed a semicircle around a raised podium where Trump stood, speaking behind protective glass. Hundreds more chairs completed the circle, with Trump at the center. The crowd fanned out on its feet from there.\n\"President Trump, he could have picked our nation\u2019s Capitol in Washington, D.C.,\" Iowa\u2019s Republican Attorney General Brenna Bird told the crowd. \"He could have picked Philadelphia, Independence Hall. Thank you, President Trump, for picking Iowa and bringing our celebration to the heart of the heartland.\"\nIn addition to Bird, Iowa\u2019s Republican U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley spoke ahead of Trump\u2019s visit.\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds attended the event, but she did not speak. Trump thanked Reynolds and Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer, as well as a string of other Iowa politicians for their support and for attending the event.\nAfter the conclusion of Trump's speech, fireworks lit up over the fairgrounds. The remaining attendees stopped to watch and cheer as they exploded in the sky.\nTrump, Republicans celebrate \u2018big beautiful bill\u2019 just hours after passage\n\"There can be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago when Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill to make America great again,\" Trump told the crowd.\nBut Iowa Democrats have been deeply critical of the legislation, saying the cuts will directly harm those who seek out government benefits.\nThe bill will cut Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over a decade, resulting in 11.8 million people becoming uninsured, and it would cut $300 billion in spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\nRepublican Party of Iowa Chair Jeff Kaufmann urged the crowd, \"do not cede an inch\" when talking to friends and neighbors about the bill's impact.\n\"If you work and if you\u2019re legal, you\u2019re not going to get kicked off Medicaid,\" he said. \"That\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s a lie from desperate people.\"\nTrump also criticized congressional Democrats, none of whom voted for the package. He suggested Republicans would use Democrats' \"no\" votes against them in the 2026 elections.\n\"With all of the things we did, with the tax cuts and rebuilding our military, not one Democrat voted for us,\" he said. \"And I think we\u2019ll use it in the campaign that\u2019s coming up \u2014 the midterms. Because we\u2019ve got to beat them.\"\n\"But all of the things that we\u2019ve given and they wouldn\u2019t vote, only because they hate Trump \u2014 but I hate them too,\" he added. \"You know that? I really do. I hate them. I cannot stand them because I really believe they hate our country, you want to know the truth.\"\nShortly after voting to pass the legislation, Iowa\u2019s four Republican members of the U.S. House \u2014 U.S. Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra \u2014 joined Trump on Air Force One to fly to the event in Des Moines.\n\u201cWe flew in together and boy, they were nice,\" Trump said. \"They were so happy at that victory today. Weren\u2019t you? \u2026 We had a good flight.\u201d\nThey were also joined on board by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, according to photos shared on social media.\nTrump said he'll 'put farmers in charge' of deportations\nIn the hour-long speech, Trump riffed on some of his favorite topics, including immigration.\nHe told Iowans he's going to \"put the farmers in charge\" when it comes to deporting agricultural workers who are in the country illegally.\n\"The murderers, the drug dealers, we\u2019re getting them the hell out of here,\" Trump said.\nBut he said he and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are \"going to sort of put the farmers in charge.\"\n\"If a farmer\u2019s willing to vouch for these people, in some way, Kristi, I think we\u2019re going to have to just say that\u2019s going to be good, right?\" he said. \"You know, we\u2019re going to be good with it. Because we don\u2019t want to do it where we take all of the workers off the farms. We want the farms to do great like they\u2019re doing right now.\"\nIowa, which is a leading corn and pig producer, relies heavily on migrant workers.\nTrump kicks off nation\u2019s 250th birthday party celebration at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, promises White House UFC fight as part of future festivities\nIn 2023, Trump previewed his vision for including the Iowa State Fair in the nation\u2019s 250th birthday celebrations.\n\u201cMy hope is that the amazing people of Iowa will work with my administration to open up the legendary Iowa State Fairgrounds to host the great American state fair and welcome millions and millions of visitors from around the world to the heartland of America for this special one-time festival,\u201d he said in a May 2023 video.\nThat vision at least partially came to fruition July 3, with thousands of people flocking to the fairgrounds to celebrate Trump.\n\u201cTwo years ago I came to Iowa and promised that the festivities would begin right here at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, and tonight, here I am,\" Trump said. \"Promises kept. It\u2019s an honor because you\u2019ve been with me from the beginning.\u201d\nAlthough the event was ostensibly a nonpartisan event, hosted by the nonprofit organization America250, speakers also used their time to praise Trump, who they said would help usher in next 250 years of American greatness.\n\"Our current president is a direct inheritor of the founders' heroic character,\" said Monica Crowley, the Trump administration's chief of protocol. \"A profoundly brave man driven by the noble fight for American Freedom, guided by the hand of God. From Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Hamilton to Trump, the through lines of history are clear.\"\nTrump said that America's 250th birthday celebration will also feature an Ultimate Fighting Championship fight held at the White House sometime during the next year.\n\"We\u2019re going to have a UFC fight, championship fight, full fight, like 20, 25,000 people and we\u2019re going to do that as part of 250 also,\" he said. \"We\u2019re going to have some incredible events. Some professional events, some amateur events, but the UFC fight\u2019s going to be a big deal, too.\"\nHe said the 250th anniversary celebration will include special events at the nation's parks, battlefields and historic sites.\n'He does what he says and he doesn\u2019t hem and haw'\nDan Thompson, a 76-year-old Ankeny resident, grabbed a bottle of water out of a cooler near the back of the gathering crowd.

      "text": "Hundreds arrested in immigration raid at 2 California farms; workers reportedly injured\nHundreds were arrested amid immigration raids at a cannabis farm\n- DHS says the farm was employing and endangering minors; union notes that it's legal for minors to work on farms\n- Targeted farm said it has never knowingly violated hiring laws and does not employ minors\nVENTURA COUNTY, California \u2012 Around 200 people were arrested when federal law enforcement officers executed criminal warrants at a farm near Camarillo and another in Carpinteria, according to a statement released July 11 by the Department of Homeland Security.\nThe July 10 raids by federal immigration agents sparked a chaotic scene in which union officials say several workers were injured.\nTeresa Romero, president of United Farm Workers, said in a statement that some workers were critically injured during the raid and that others, including U.S. citizens, remain unaccounted for. Later, the union reported one person had died, but the information was not confirmed.\nA man was reported in critical condition at a local hospital, and a family member who organized a GoFundMe campaign said doctors did not expect him to survive. A farmworker at Glass House, the man reportedly fell 30 feet during the raid. The campaign page described his injuries as catastrophic and asked for help covering medical expenses and other costs.\nOn the morning of July 10, immigration agents descended on Glass House Farms near Camarillo and in Carpinteria \u2013 a greenhouse complex that is one of the state's largest marijuana farms. They blocked the main road and clashed with protesters until after dark as agents detained farm workers.\nThe hours-long raid was one of the largest since President Donald Trump's administration began ramping up a mass deportation campaign across California and the country.\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement July 11 that, in addition to the arrests of undocumented workers, \"law enforcement rescued at least 10 migrant children from what looks like exploitation, forced child labor and potentially human trafficking or smuggling.\"\nThe UFW addressed the allegation, noting in a post on the social media site X that farm workers are excluded from basic child labor laws.\n\"It is unfortunately not uncommon for teenagers to work in the fields,\" the UFW said in the statement. \"To be clear: detaining and deporting children is not a solution for child labor.\"\nA bleary-eyed crowd of farmworker families waited outside the farm's gate on July 11, some hoping to recover the belongings of their detained loved ones.\n\"A lot of people here are scared,\" said Alyssa Caro, a 20-year-old Oxnard resident whose mother, an undocumented farmworker, was detained by federal agents during the raid. \"It's so close to home.\"\nHow many people were swept up in the raid?\nGlass House Farms said it has never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors. On July 10, the company received immigration and naturalization warrants, verified they were valid and complied, company officials said in a social media post.\nWorkers were detained and the company is helping provide them legal representation, according to the July 11 post.\n\"We do not expect this to affect operations moving forward,\" the company said.\nMarijuana use among adults 21 and older is legal in California.\nDHS estimated that more than 500 people were involved in the protests and were attempting to disrupt the immigration raid. The agency alleged protestors damaged vehicles and one fired a gun.\nThe FBI in Los Angeles said a man, shown in footage from a news helicopter, appeared to fire a gun at law enforcement at 2:26 p.m. on Laguna Road. The incident happened \"during a lawful search,\" according to the FBI's post, and a reward of up to $50,000 would be offered for information leading to a conviction.\nFour U.S. citizens were being processed for charges including assault or resisting officers, DHS said.\nDHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said anyone who assaults or publicly identifies federal law enforcement would be prosecuted.\nWhat happened to farmworkers?\nSome workers were critically injured during the raid.\nThe Ventura County Fire Department said eight people were taken from the incident to local hospitals on July 10. Four others were assessed and treated at the scene, said department spokesperson Andrew Dowd. The department did not have information about the severity of the injuries.\nMany workers, United States citizens included, were held at the farm by federal authorities for eight hours or more, the UFW said.\n\"U.S. citizen workers report only being released after they were forced to delete photos and videos of the raid from their phones,\" the UFW said.\nIsaiah Murtaugh can be reached at isaiah.murtaugh@vcstar.com and Cheri Carlson at cheri.carlson@vcstar.com."

  "argos_summary": "The Trump administration's immigration policies are causing significant labor shortages in U.S. agriculture, particularly affecting farmers who rely on foreign-born workers. Many farmers report difficulties in securing enough labor to harvest crops, leading to financial losses and unpicked produce. Recent immigration raids have heightened fears among farmworkers, resulting in decreased attendance and increased anxiety within farming communities. Calls for immigration reform are growing, as farmers and advocates emphasize the critical role of immigrant labor in maintaining the U.S. food supply.",
