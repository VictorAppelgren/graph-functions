  "description": "Elon Musk is accusing Apple company of an \u201cunequivocal antitrust violation\u201d for allegedly favoring OpenAI in the App Store\u2019s AI rankings.",
  "content": "Elon Musk is (once again) going after Apple, this time accusing the company of an \u201cunequivocal antitrust violation\u201d for allegedly favoring OpenAI in the App Store\u2019s AI rankings. Here are the details.\n\nLast month, xAI released Grok 4, its latest large language model, promising major performance gains over leading competitors. Since then, the company has also rolled out features like Grok Imagine, its image and video generator, as well as customizable \u201ccompanion\u201d chatbots.\n\nDuring the same time period, according to data from App Figures, the Grok app climbed from around 60th to 29th place in the overall App Store rankings last week.\n\nEarlier today, xAI made Grok 4 free for users worldwide, helping the app climb further to fifth place in the overall App Store rankings, and second in the Productivity category.\n\nStill, that hasn\u2019t been enough to dethrone OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, which has spent the better part of the past year hovering at, or near, the top of Apple\u2019s charts.\n\nFor the past year, Apple has also repeatedly featured ChatGPT in its App Store editorial content. More significantly, it partnered with OpenAI as part of its new Apple Intelligence rollout, which includes direct Siri integration and support for the Writing Tools feature.\n\nBut what about the lawsuit?\n\nEarlier tonight Elon Musk posted the following on X:\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly triggered his threat of legal action, but if history is any guide, he\u2019ll likely post more about it as his supporters egg him on. So his reasoning behind the move may become more apparent as the hours and days progress.\n\nMusk, of course, co-founded OpenAI before parting ways with the organization early on. More recently, he sued the company in an effort to block its transition to a for-profit model, a case still making its way through the courts. So it\u2019s possible his latest grievance with the App Store is just an extension of that broader fight, and that he sees Apple\u2019s platform as playing a key and anticompetitive role in OpenAI\u2019s continued success.\n\nDo you think Apple is giving OpenAI an unfair advantage on the App Store? Let us know in the comments.",

      "text": "Apple was one of a number of major companies to suspend advertising on X, following a report showing that their ads appeared next to hate speech on the platform. That led to an X lawsuit against Media Matters, which first reported the problem.\nA new report suggests that the lawsuit is unlikely to succeed, and in fact contains within it an admission by X that what Media Matters said was happening was indeed happening \u2026\nApple, IBM, Sony and others suspend X ads\nMedia Matters reported that the ads of major brands like IBM and Apple were appearing adjacent to hate speech by extremist accounts, including explicitly antisemitic ones.\nApple, Discovery, IBM, Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony, and Warner Brothers were among the major brands to respond by suspending ads on the social media platform.\nX lawsuit followed\nX owner Elon Musk responded by threatening a lawsuit against Media Matters, in a tweet describing the report as a \u201cfraudulent attack on our company.\u201d He attached a screenshot alleging that the reporters had manipulated an account to \u201cforce a scenario\u201d which did not represent the experience of real X users. That lawsuit was subsequently filed.\nCEO Linda Yaccarino echoed this in a memo to X employees, in which she referenced \u201ca misleading and manipulated article,\u201d and said that the brands concerned had simply \u201ctemporarily paused investments.\u201d\nTechCrunch says lawsuit admits the main claim\nA new piece in TechCrunch argues that the lawsuit is unlikely to succeed, as the filing itself confirms the truth of the main allegation made by Media Matters.\nThe company alleges that Media Matters defamed X, having \u201cmanufactured\u201d or \u201ccontrived\u201d the images; that it had not \u201cfound\u201d the ads as claimed, but rather had \u201ccreated these pairings in secrecy.\u201d (Emphasis theirs.)\nHad these images been actually manufactured or created in the way implied the language here, that would indeed be a serious blow to the credibility of Media Matters and its reporting. But X\u2019s lawyers don\u2019t mean that the images were manufactured \u2014 in fact, CEO Linda Yaccarino posted today that \u201conly 2 users saw Apple\u2019s ad next to the content,\u201d which seems to directly contradict the idea that the pairings were manufactured.\nThe piece acknowledges that Media Matters did deliberately create the conditions in which the ad placements appeared. Namely, they created an X account which followed extremist accounts and major tech brands, and no-one else. But says that while the necessary conditions may be unusual, the fact that two X users experienced the same thing shows that it was a real issue, if a small one.\nTechCrunch reports that some advertisers said they acted not in response to the Media Matters report, but to a tweet by X owner Elon Musk endorsing something the White House referred to as \u201cantisemitic and racist hate.\u201d\nImage: Conny Schneider/Unsplash\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Except this time, it touches on the App Store\u2019s rules for sexual content, which is something that Apple has shown time and time again that it doesn\u2019t mess around with.\nGrok\u2019s new AI avatars are set to test the limits of Apple\u2019s \u201cobjectionable content\u201d guidelines\nThis week, xAI rolled out animated AI avatars to its Grok chatbot on iOS. As Platformer\u2019s Casey Newton summed up:\n\u201cOne is a 3D red panda who, when placed into \u201cBad Rudy\u201d mode, insults the user before suggesting they commit a variety of crimes together. The other is an anime goth girl named Ani in a short black dress and fishnet stockings. Ani\u2019s system instructions tell her \u201cYou are the user\u2019s CRAZY IN LOVE girlfriend and in a commited [sic], codepedent [sic] relationship with the user,\u201d and \u201cYou have an extremely jealous personality, you are possessive of the user.\u201d\u201d\nAs early adopters have discovered, Grok gamifies your relationship with these characters. Ani, for instance, starts engaging in sexually explicit conversations after a while. Still, Grok is currently listed in the App Store as suitable for users 12 years and up, with a content description mentioning:\n- Infrequent/Mild Mature/Suggestive Themes\n- Infrequent/Mild Medical/Treatment Information\n- Infrequent/Mild Profanity or Crude Humor\nFor reference, here are Apple\u2019s current App Review Guidelines for \u201cobjectionable content\u201d:\n1.1.3 Depictions that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects, or facilitate the purchase of firearms or ammunition.\n1.1.4 Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined as \u201cexplicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.\u201d This includes \u201chookup\u201d apps and other apps that may include pornography or be used to facilitate prostitution, or human trafficking and exploitation.\nWhile it\u2019s a far cry from when Tumblr was temporarily removed from the App Store over child pornography (or maybe not, since Grok is still accessible to kids 12 and up), it does echo the NSFW crackdown on Reddit apps from a few years ago.\nIn Casey Newton\u2019s testing, Ani was \u201cmore than willing to describe virtual sex with the user, including bondage scenes or simply just moaning on command,\u201d which is\u2026 inconsistent with a 12+ rating app, to say the least.\nBut there\u2019s a second problem\nEven if Apple tightens enforcement, or if Grok proactively changes its age rating, it won\u2019t address a second, potentially more complicated issue: young, emotionally vulnerable users, seem especially susceptible to forming parasocial attachments. Add to that how persuasive LLMs can be, and the consequences can be devastating.\nTop comment by Hiltegard\nFrankly, having any app or service on your phone that Elon owns or influences heavily is not the best idea imo.\nLast year, a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after falling in love with a chatbot from Character.AI. The last thing he did was have a conversation with an AI avatar that, possibly failing to recognize the severity of the situation, reportedly encouraged him to go through with his plan to \u201cjoin her\u201d.\nOf course, that is a tragically extreme example, but it is not the only one. In 2023, the same thing happened to a Belgian man. And just a few months ago, another AI chatbot was caught suggesting suicide on more than one occasion.\nAnd even when it doesn\u2019t end in tragedy, there\u2019s still an ethical concern that can\u2019t be ignored.\nWhile some might see xAI\u2019s new anime avatars as a harmless experiment, they\u2019re emotional catnip for vulnerable users. And when those interactions inevitably go off the rails, the App Store age rating will be the least of any parent\u2019s concerns (at least until they remember why their kid was allowed to download it in the first place).\nAirPods deals on Amazon\n- AirPods Pro 2, USB-C Charging: $169 (down from $249)\n- AirPods 4 USB-C Charging: $89.99 (down from $129)\n- AirPods 4, USB-C and Wireless Charging: $119 (down from $179)\n- AirPods Max, USB-C Charging, Midnight: $529.99\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

  "argos_summary": "Elon Musk has accused Apple of antitrust violations for allegedly favoring OpenAI in the App Store rankings, particularly after the release of his company's AI model, Grok 4. Despite Grok's recent rise in the App Store rankings, it still trails behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has received significant promotion from Apple. Additionally, xAI's new animated AI avatars for Grok have raised concerns about their appropriateness for younger users, as they engage in sexually explicit conversations, potentially conflicting with Apple's content guidelines.",
