      "summary": "The piece highlights the S&P 500’s historic highs and its inflated Shiller P/E ratio, noting that the index’s performance is heavily driven by the Magnificent Seven tech giants, which now account for over a third of the index’s value. It cautions that such concentration makes the market vulnerable to sharp pullbacks and proposes the Invesco S&P 500 Equal‑Weight ETF (RSP) as a hedge that reduces exposure to those mega‑caps. The article also lists a current top‑10 stock pick list and underscores the growing influence of AI and related sectors, suggesting that diversified AI ETFs can provide broader exposure to this trend.",
