  "content": "Ausenco was chosen to lead the PEA based on its extensive experience with projects of similar scale in Mexico, including advancing Silvercrest\u2019s Las Chispas Project from technical studies through construction, leading the delivery of Discovery Silver\u2019s Cordero Project Feasibility Study and Vizsla Silver\u2019s Panuco PEA and providing process design expertise for GoGold\u2019s Los Ricos Project Feasibility Study.\n\nOn June 20 th , the Company announced the voting results from its annual general meeting, wherein all the directors listed as nominees were elected and all matters presented were approved.\n\nOn June 17 th , the Company announced that 97% of its $1.10 warrants due June 12, 2025 had been exercised.\n\nOn May 28 th , the Company announced it had selected Ausenco Engineering Canada ULC (\u201cAusenco\u201d) to lead the study work for a Preliminary Economic Assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) on Los Reyes.\n\nOn May 12 th , the Company released its 2024 Financial and Operating Results.\n\nCorporate Highlights During the Quarter (Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are presented in Canadian dollars.)\n\nPrime Chief Executive Officer Scott Hicks commented, \u201cThe second quarter has been highly productive for Prime on multiple fronts. Following the selection in May of Ausenco as its lead engineer for the development of the Los Reyes Preliminary Economic Assessment, the Company announced the exercise of 97% of its June warrants, resulting in a substantial increase to our treasury, closing the quarter with $32.7 million in cash and equivalents. On July 28, Prime announced a transformational proposed acquisition of Prime by Torex Gold in a share-based transaction. This transaction enables Prime shareholders to continue to participate in the advancement of Los Reyes while enjoying an immediate premium on the value of their Prime shares, participation in the free-cash flowing Torex Morelos Complex and reduced financing and development risk. Both teams are very excited about the future and look forward to providing updates along the way.\u201d\n\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prime Mining Corp. (\u201cPrime\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) ( TSX: PRYM ) ( OTCQX: PRMNF ) ( Frankfurt: O4V3 ) is pleased to report its operating and financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Prime is focused on the exploration and development of its wholly owned high-grade Los Reyes Gold-Silver Project in Sinaloa State, Mexico (\u201cLos Reyes\u201d or the \u201cProject\u201d).\n\nPrime remains engaged with local stakeholders and is proactive in monitoring employees and contractors concerning general health conditions. The Company continues to closely adhere to the directives of all levels of government and relevant health authorities in Mexico and Canada.\n\nWe continued to gather environmental and community data in the quarter in support of our ESG programs, including completion of a materiality assessment, strategic plan, and disclosure matrix. We strive to minimize the environmental footprint of our activities and ensure that Los Reyes has a positive impact on our host communities.\n\nThe Company released its inaugural sustainability report during April 2023, establishing a baseline and a new yardstick to measure our progress in meeting our commitments regarding sustainability and stewardship of the environment, relevant social issues, and corporate governance. The Company released latest report, the 2024 Sustainability Report, in June.\n\nOn July 28, 2025, Prime and Torex Gold Resources Inc. (\u201cTorex\u201d) announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cArrangement Agreement\u201d) whereby Torex will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Prime Mining (the \u201cPrime Mining Shares\u201d) pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the \u201cTransaction\u201d).\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, Prime Mining shareholders will receive 0.060 of a common share of Torex (each whole share, a \u201cTorex Share\u201d) for each Prime Mining Share held (the \u201cExchange Ratio\u201d or the \u201cConsideration\u201d).\n\nUpon completion of the Transaction, Torex will issue approximately 10.5 million Torex Shares to Prime Mining shareholders and existing Prime Mining shareholders will own approximately 10.7% of Torex.\n\nFull details of the Transaction will be included in the meeting materials to be prepared by Prime Mining in connection with the special meeting of securityholders, which are expected to be mailed to such securityholders in September 2025. A special meeting of Prime Mining securityholders is expected to be held in September 2025. The Transaction does not require a vote of Torex shareholders.\n\nSubject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the parties obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals, the Transaction is expected to close in H2 2025, subject to the timing of clearance under Mexican antitrust laws. Prime Mining Shares are expected to be delisted from the TSX promptly after closing of the Transaction.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the Transaction, Prime has paused work on the PEA pending the outcome of the Transaction.\n\nThe following selected financial data is summarized from the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto (the \u201cFinancial Statements\u201d) for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. A copy of the Financial Statements and MD&A is available at www.primeminingcorp.ca or on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Torex Gold\u2019s proposed acquisition of Prime on July 28, 2025, the Company commenced the process of preparing the related information circular, targeting distribution to our shareholders on September 5, 2025. The shareholder vote is planned for September 29, 2025. The Transaction does not require a vote of Torex shareholders.\n\nIn addition to securityholder and court approvals, the Transaction is subject to applicable regulatory approvals (including approvals of the TSX and clearance under Mexican antitrust laws) and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions customary for a transaction of this nature.\n\nOn January 28, 2025, drilling was paused in response to a deterioration in the security situation in parts of Sinaloa, including the Los Reyes area. Six drill rigs remain on site and drill contractors are on standby to resume drilling as soon as security improves. The Company will continue to work with local authorities to monitor the current situation.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the Transaction, Prime has paused work on the PEA pending the outcome of the Transaction.\n\nAbout the Los Reyes Gold and Silver Project\n\nLos Reyes is a high-grade, low-sulphidation epithermal gold-silver project located in Sinaloa State, Mexico. On October 15, 2024, Prime announced an updated multi-million-ounce high-grade open pit and underground resource based on exploration drilling up to July 17, 2024. Since acquiring Los Reyes in 2019, Prime has spent $66,653,314 on direct exploration activities and has completed over 221,000 metres of drilling.\n\nOn January 28, 2025, drilling was paused in response to a deterioration in the security situation in parts of Sinaloa, including the Los Reyes area. Drill rigs remain on site and drill contractors are on standby to resume drilling as soon as security improves. Prime will continue to work with local authorities to monitor the current situation.\n\u2022 Open Pit Resource estimates are based on economically constrained open pits generated using the Hochbaum Pseudoflow algorithm in Datamine\u2019s Studio NPVS and the following optimization parameters (all dollar values are in US dollars):\n\u2022 Mill recoveries of 95.6% and 81% for gold and silver, respectively.\n\u2022 Heap leach recoveries of 73% and 25% for gold and silver, respectively.\n\u2022 Pit slopes by area ranging from 42-47 degrees overall slope angle.\n\u2022 5% ore loss and 5% dilution factor applied to the 5 x 5 x 5m open pit resource block models.\n\u2022 Mining costs of $2.00 per tonne of waste mined and $2.50 per tonne of ore mined.\n\u2022 G&A cost of $2.00 per tonne of material processed.\n\u2022 3% royalty costs and 1% selling costs were also applied.\n\u2022 A 0.17 g/t gold only cutoff was applied to ex-pit processed material (which is above the heap-leaching NSR cutoff).\n\u2022 Underground Resource estimates are based on economically constrained stopes generated using Datamine\u2019s Mineable Shape Optimizer (MSO) algorithm and the following optimization parameters (all dollar values are in US dollars):\n\u2022 Mill recoveries of 95.6% and 81% for gold and silver, respectively.\n\u2022 Mechanized cut and fill mining with a $60.00 per tonne cost.\n\u2022 G&A cost of $4.00 per tonne of material processed.\n\u2022 3% royalty costs and 1% selling costs were also applied.\n\u2022 Where mentioned, \u201cresidual open pits\u201d assumes that any underground stopes are backfilled with zero grade material at two-thirds of the original rock density. Economic-constrained open pits are then estimated with this mined-out, backfilled material in the open pit block selective mining unit (\u201cSMU\u201d) model and assuming the resource parameters above.\n\u2022 Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves (as that term is defined in the CIM Definition Standards) and do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n\u2022 Refer to the Additional Notes section for further information. \n\n\n\n\n\nDrilling and geological interpretation suggests that the three known main deposit areas (Guadalupe, Central and Z-T) are larger than previously reported. Potential also exists for new discoveries where mineralized trends have been identified outside of the currently defined resource areas. Historic operating results indicate that an estimated 1 million ounces of gold and 60 million ounces of silver were recovered from five separate operations at Los Reyes between 1770 and 1990. Prior to Prime\u2019s acquisition, recent operators of Los Reyes had spent approximately US$20 million on exploration, engineering, and prefeasibility studies.\n\nDrill core at the Los Reyes project is drilled in predominantly HQ size (63.5 millimetres \u201cmm\u201d), reducing to NQ (47.6 mm) when required. Drill core samples are generally 1.50 m long along the core axis with allowance for shorter or longer intervals if required to suit geological constraints. After logging intervals are identified to be sampled, the core is cut and one half is submitted for assay.\n\nSample QA/QC measures include unmarked certified reference materials, blanks, and field duplicates as well as preparation duplicates are inserted into the sample sequence and make up approximately 8% of the samples submitted to the laboratory for each drill hole.\n\nSamples are picked up from the Project by the laboratory personnel and transported to their facilities in Durango or Hermosillo, Mexico, for sample preparation. Sample analysis is carried out by Bureau Veritas and ALS Labs, with fire assay, including over limits fire assay re-analysis, completed at their respective Hermosillo, Mexico laboratories and multi-element analysis completed in Vancouver, Canada. Drill core sample preparation includes fine crushing of the sample to at least 70% passing less than 2 mm, sample splitting using a riffle splitter, and pulverizing a 250 gram split to at least 85% passing 75 microns.\n\nGold in diamond drill core is analyzed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectroscopy of a 30 g sample (code FA430 or Au-AA23). Multi-element chemistry is analyzed by 4-Acid digestion of a 0.25-gram sample split (code MA300 or ME-ICP61) with detection by an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer for a full suite of elements.\n\nGold assay techniques FA430 and Au-AA23 have an upper detection limit of 10 g/t. Any sample that produces an over-limit gold value via the initial assay technique is sent for gravimetric finish via method FA-530 or Au-GRA21. Silver analyses by MA300 and ME-ICP61 have an upper limit of 200 g/t and 100 g/t, respectively. Samples with over-limit silver values are re-analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric finish FA530 or Au-GRA21.\n\nBoth Bureau Veritas and ALS Labs are ISO/IEC accredited assay laboratories.\n\nPrime\u2019s MRE as of October 15, 2024 is classified in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\u201cCIM\u201d) \u201cCIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\u201d adopted by the CIM Council (as amended, the \u201cCIM Definition Standards\u201d) and in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n\nMetres is represented by \u201cm\u201d; \u201cetw\u201d is Estimated True Width and is based on drill hole geometry or comparisons with other on-section drill holes; \u201cAu\u201d refers to gold, and \u201cAg\u201d refers to silver; \u201cg/t\u201d is grams per metric tonne; some figures may not sum due to rounding; Composite assay grades presented in summary tables are calculated using a Au grade minimum average of 0.20 g/t or 1.0 g/t as indicated in \u201cAu Cut-off\u201d column of Summary Tables. Maximum internal waste included in any reported composite interval is 3.00 m. The 1.00 g/t Au cut-off is used to define higher-grade \u201ccores\u201d within the lower-grade halo.\n\nAdditional details are available in the associated Technical Report with effective date of October 15, 2024, filed on November 27, 2024 with amended filing on June 27, 2025.\n\nScott Smith, P.Geo., Executive Vice President of Exploration, is a Qualified Person for the purposes of NI 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical content in this news release.\n\nPrime is managed by an ideal mix of successful mining executives, strong capital markets personnel and experienced local operators all focused on unlocking the full potential of the Project. The Company has a well-planned capital structure with a strong management team and insider ownership. Prime is targeting a material resource expansion at Los Reyes through a combination of new generative area discoveries and growth, while also building on technical de-risking activities to support eventual project development.\n\nFor further information, please visit https://www.primeminingcorp.ca/ or direct enquiries to:\n\nCautionary Notes to U.S. Investors Concerning Resource Estimates\n\nThis news release has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of the U.S. securities laws.
