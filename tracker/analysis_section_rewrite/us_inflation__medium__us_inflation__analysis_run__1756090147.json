      "feedback": "The draft does a solid job layering a 3–6 month, multi‑source narrative, but it needs a tighter, more cash‑flow‑driven causal chain, explicit timing, and a fully reconciled, source‑based framework to reach world‑class quality. Strengths: it threads consumer/retailer dynamics (Great Value, BetterGoods, Douglas tires), AI‑enabled productivity (Range), private‑markets real assets (Pacaso), and health‑tech upside (HeartSciences) into a single horizon view, and it labels catalysts and some watch signals. Opportunities to upgrade: (1) sharpen the causal chain from macro to markets to sec tors—specify how AI productivity translates into GDP growth, inflation paths, and rate expectations, and how private‑label supply chains interact with consumer inflation and discretionary demand (cite Range, Pacaso, and HeartSciences where relevant); (2) codify a disciplined 3–6 month scenario map with explicit timing windows, triggers, and invalidations (e.g., AI adoption pace, policy progress on OB/BB bills, FDA/Medicare milestones) and end with clearly defined base case plus 1–2 clearly defined alt paths; (3) reconcile conflicts and quantify where possible—state ranges (not single points) for debt/deficit estimates across sources (2.4T vs 3.4T vs 4.4T over a decade), and attach each figure to its source; (4) maximize numeric content from sources rather than general statements—pull 40k–60k mile claims for Douglas tires, 21% YoY Pacaso growth, 18.8% cash‑on‑cash in mogul‑style notes, $32B TAM for AI‑ECG, and 0% AUM pricing in Range, then stress‑test them; (5) tighten source use and reconstruction of the “watchlist” and invalidations so every signal has a measurable trigger and a clear falsification path; (6) align more tightly with SECTION FOCUS by clearly enumerating timing windows (e.g., 0–8 weeks AI adoption metrics; 2–6 quarters policy/healthcare milestones) and concluding with a single base case, 1–2 explicit alts, a compact risks watchlist, and a concise confidence metric. Specific edits: restructure into a compact, explicit scenario map (Macro backdrop → Transmission channels → Catalysts with timing → Base case vs alts → Watch list signals → Invalidation clauses → Confidence); replace absolutes with source‑anchored ranges (cite YQOMV2HAJ for private‑label structure, V8TEZOR8R for auto‑cycle flips, ILYC1M41F for Barista FIRE framing, UPV3X2MQ6 for Range/Pacaso/real‑assets, EPJYXB7DX for the Big Beautiful Bill and Medicaid/deficit implications, ILYC1M41F for healthcare/retirements); explicitly document two to three plausible paths with quantified payoffs (e.g., base case: inflation moderates and AI productivity adds 0.9–1.5% annual GDP growth; alt A: policy tightening/backward debt spiral drives rates higher; alt B: slower AI diffusion keeps inflation sticky); add two to three clear invalidations (policy failure to pass OB/BB, AI diffusion below 0.5–1.0 pp per annum, HeartSciences FDA/Medicare uptake stalls). Finally, ensure every claim ties to a cited ID and present a one‑paragraph synthesis at the end that mirrors a 3–6 month view with a crisp, testable catalyst/trigger clock.",
