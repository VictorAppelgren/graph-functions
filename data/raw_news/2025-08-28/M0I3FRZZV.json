  "title": "Musk Vs. OpenAI \u2014 And Apple: xAI To Turn A Culture War Into An Antitrust Win?",
  "description": "Elon Musk\u2019s xAI sues Apple and OpenAI, alleging their ChatGPT integration on iPhones locks out rivals like Grok.",
  "content": "Has Elon Musk ever needed a courtroom to set or upend the narrative? Perhaps not. But this week, he chose one anyway: On August 25, xAI and X Corp. filed a federal antitrust in Texas accusing Apple and OpenAI of locking the iPhone\u2019s front door to competing chatbots.\n\n\u201cThis is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nThe complaint claims Apple\u2019s marketing and operating-system integration of ChatGPT \u2014 paired with alleged preferential treatment in App Store rankings \u2014 tilts the playing field against rivals such as xAI\u2019s Grok, violating U.S. competition law. Apple to comment, while OpenAI framed the suit as part of Musk\u2019s ongoing campaign against the company he once helped found.\n\n\u201cThis latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk\u2019s ongoing pattern of harassment,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nThe legal broadside arrives 15 months after Apple first unveiled its OpenAI tie-up at WWDC 2024. Apple said then \u2014 and reiterates in support pages now \u2014 that ChatGPT access is being woven into Siri and system \u201cWriting Tools,\u201d with explicit user consent prompts before any query or document is sent to OpenAI\u2019s servers, and without requiring separate app-hopping. That is a powerful distribution advantage on a platform used by more than a billion people, but it is also as an opt-in conduit rather than a default takeover. The distinction will likely matter in court.\n\nMusk, meanwhile, has been seemingly trying to reimagine the battlefield: He argues Apple\u2019s embrace of OpenAI makes it \u201cimpossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store,\u201d the situation \u201can unequivocal antitrust violation.\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pushed back on X, noting that Musk himself allegedly manipulates X \u201cto benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nThe rhetorical clash arguably previews the core question for a judge: is Apple-OpenAI a consumer-benefiting feature integration, or an exclusionary agreement that forecloses rivals from scale?\n\nThe case will unfold against a legal environment that cuts both ways for Musk: On the one hand, Apple is already fighting the U.S. Department of Justice in a sweeping iPhone monopolization that survived a motion to dismiss this summer, possibly signaling judicial openness to arguments that Apple\u2019s ecosystem rules can restrain competition. That alleges Apple systematically impedes third-party apps and accessories, from super-apps to cloud streaming and digital wallets, to keep users locked in. Those claims are not the same as xAI\u2019s, but they prime the courts to probe Apple\u2019s control over mobile distribution.\n\nOn the other hand, Epic Games\u2019 long fight showed how hard it is to win a Sherman Act case against Apple. After years of , the Ninth Circuit largely upheld findings that Apple\u2019s App Store model was not an illegal monopoly \u2014 even as it forced Apple to loosen \u201canti-steering\u201d rules. The Supreme Court declined to review. That precedent doesn\u2019t immunize Apple, but it could raise the bar for rivals claiming anticompetitive harm on iOS. xAI may have to tell a cleaner, tighter story than Epic did, and one tailored to AI\u2019s distinct market structure.\n\nLegally, xAI appears to be swinging at two targets at once.\n\nThe first is a Section 1 claim: an unlawful agreement between Apple and OpenAI that unreasonably restrains trade by privileging OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in ways that foreclose distribution or data access for competitors. The second is Section 2: that Apple, as a dominant platform, is engaging in exclusionary conduct \u2014 through OS-level integration and promotional placement \u2014 that maintains monopoly power in a relevant market, whether that\u2019s \u201cperformance smartphones,\u201d \u201cmobile AI assistants,\u201d or some other properly defined space. xAI says it wants an injunction and billions in damages \u2014 the complaint\u2019s framing resembles the government\u2019s theory in the DOJ case, but it will likely to stitch App Store ranking allegations, OS integrations, and actual foreclosure into one persuasive story of consumer harm, rather than merely competitor pain.\n\nHere is where facts about Apple\u2019s implementation could narrow the runway for xAI: Apple\u2019s public documentation emphasizes opt-in flows and per-use consent when Siri consults ChatGPT, with responses presented inline \u2014 smoother than launching a separate app, but not necessarily an exclusive pipeline. Apple has not described the integration as exclusive, and users remain free to install rival chatbots, including Grok, as standalone apps. If discovery shows marketing prominence rather than contractual exclusivity, courts may view the arrangement as product design \u2014 potentially pro-competitive if it improves user experience \u2014 rather than a forbidden market allocation. Conversely, if xAI can uncover evidence of preferential search rankings, default placements, or technical barriers that materially depress rival usage, it could begin to look more like a de-facto exclusive dealing arrangement at the operating-system level.\n\nThe antitrust merits could rise or fall on two tricky thresholds: market definition and foreclosure. Defining \u201cthe market\u201d too narrowly \u2014 say, \u201ciOS-integrated AI chat assistants\u201d \u2014 invites some judicial skepticism. Define it too broadly \u2014 \u201call AI\u201d or \u201call smartphones\u201d \u2014 and the causal link between Apple-OpenAI cooperation and competitive harm may dissipate. Even after clearing that hurdle, xAI may need to show substantial foreclosure: that Apple\u2019s design and promotion meaningfully block rivals from reaching users at scale. That\u2019s easier to argue for an OS-level service than for a single app. It is also where the DOJ\u2019s case matters, because it paints a broader pattern of Apple using tight integration to preference its own channels. Judges may be more receptive to the notion that iOS is a gatekeeper whose defaults shape entire downstream markets, including AI assistants.\n\nThen there is credibility.\n\nMusk\u2019s public crusade against OpenAI cuts two ways: It keeps pressure high and keeps cameras rolling, but it risks coloring the antitrust suit as a tactical extension of a personal , not a neutral defense of competition.\n\nWhat happens next is worth watching. Apple and OpenAI may move to dismiss, arguing the complaint fails to plead a coherent market, a cognizable agreement to restrain trade, or non-speculative consumer harm. If the case survives in part, discovery could unearth internal communications about App Store placements, Siri defaults, and the business terms of the OpenAI partnership. Those records \u2014 more than press conferences or fiery posts on X \u2014 could determine whether this is another Epic-style skirmish that forces narrow conduct tweaks, or the seed of a larger reckoning over AI distribution on smartphones.\n\nThe most plausible near-term outcomes comprise either a narrowed case that proceeds to discovery or a dismissal with leave to amend, rather than a sweeping preliminary injunction that rips ChatGPT out of iOS. The path to a blockbuster win runs through evidence of exclusivity and measurable foreclosure; absent that, courts typically defer to product design choices that plausibly benefit consumers.\n\nThree datapoints are worth keeping tabs on. First, how narrowly xAI defines the market in amended pleadings \u2014 precision helps but over-narrow tailoring can backfire. Second, whether the court consolidates schedule or discovery with any overlapping issues in the DOJ action; even informal judicial cross-pollination can change momentum. Third, Apple\u2019s iterative disclosures about Apple Intelligence: If, in practice, Siri begins favoring ChatGPT in ways that crowd out app-level competition \u2014 or if Apple adds policy restrictions that make non-ChatGPT assistants harder to use \u2014 xAI\u2019s theory of harm strengthens. The reverse is also true: If Apple expands choice architecture or allows system-level access for multiple assistants, the antitrust temperature drops.\n\nThere\u2019s a coda to the theater: Musk has already embedded Grok across his empire, from X to Tesla, creating his own distribution lanes. That perhaps undercuts, in part, the claim that Apple and OpenAI\u2019s partnership fatally starves rivals of audience, but it also reiterates the stakes: the firm that controls the default assistant at the OS layer will inform everything from search and shopping but payments to advertising and on-device automation. In AI, the front door is nearly half the market.\n\nFor now, if one were to strip away the sound and fury and noise, the likely near-term result is modest. The suit sharpens political and regulatory of Apple\u2019s AI design choices, may pry open slivers of discovery that inform the DOJ\u2019s case, and could even spur Apple to codify more explicit user choice. A court order to unwind the integration is improbable on today\u2019s record, but incremental, court-warranted changes to defaults and disclosures \u2014 in Apple\u2019s world, that\u2019s non-trivial.",

      "text": "Related Content\nPress Release\nThis is archived content from the U.S. Department of Justice website. The information here may be outdated and links may no longer function. Please contact webmaster@usdoj.gov if you have any questions about the archive site.\nThe Justice Department, joined by 16 other state and district attorneys general, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Apple for monopolization or attempted monopolization of smartphone markets in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\nThe complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges that Apple illegally maintains a monopoly over smartphones by selectively imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access points from, developers. Apple undermines apps, products, and services that would otherwise make users less reliant on the iPhone, promote interoperability, and lower costs for consumers and developers. Apple exercises its monopoly power to extract more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses, and merchants, among others. Through this monopolization lawsuit, the Justice Department and state Attorneys General are seeking relief to restore competition to these vital markets on behalf of the American public.\n\u201cConsumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cWe allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law. If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly. The Justice Department will vigorously enforce antitrust laws that protect consumers from higher prices and fewer choices. That is the Justice Department\u2019s legal obligation and what the American people expect and deserve.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter how powerful, no matter how prominent, no matter how popular \u2014 no company is above the law,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cThrough today\u2019s action, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to that principle.\u201d\n\u201cWhen corporations engage in anticompetitive conduct, the American people and our economy suffer,\u201d said Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer. \u201cToday\u2019s action against Apple sends a strong signal to those seeking to box out competitors and stifle innovation \u2014 that the Justice Department is committed to using every tool available to advance economic justice and root out anticompetitive practices, wherever they arise.\u201d\n\u201cFor years, Apple responded to competitive threats by imposing a series of \u201cWhac-A-Mole\u201d contractual rules and restrictions that have allowed Apple to extract higher prices from consumers, impose higher fees on developers and creators, and to throttle competitive alternatives from rival technologies,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division. \u201cToday\u2019s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets.\u201d\nAs alleged in the complaint, Apple has monopoly power in the smartphone and performance smartphones markets, and it uses its control over the iPhone to engage in a broad, sustained, and illegal course of conduct. This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apple\u2019s monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible. The complaint alleges that Apple\u2019s anticompetitive course of conduct has taken several forms, many of which continue to evolve today, including:\nThe complaint also alleges that Apple\u2019s conduct extends beyond these examples, affecting web browsers, video communication, news subscriptions, entertainment, automotive services, advertising, location services, and more. Apple has every incentive to extend and expand its course of conduct to acquire and maintain power over next-frontier devices and technologies.\nFor over a century, the Department has enforced the antitrust laws against illegal monopolies, deploying the Sherman Act to unfetter markets and restore competition. As alleged in the complaint, the Department is seeking equitable relief on behalf of the American public to redress Apple\u2019s long-running, pervasive anticompetitive conduct.\nApple Inc. is a publicly traded company incorporated in California and headquartered in Cupertino, California. In fiscal year 2023, Apple generated annual net revenues of $383 billion and net income of $97 billion. Apple\u2019s net income exceeds any other company in the Fortune 500 and the gross domestic products of more than 100 countries."

Musk co-founded OpenAI alongside Altman in 2015, before leaving the startup in 2018 due to disagreements over OpenAI's direction.\nMusk sued OpenAI and Altman last year, accusing them of breach of contract by putting commercial interests ahead of its original mission to develop AI \"for the benefit of humanity broadly.\"\nIn a counterclaim, OpenAI has alleged that Musk and xAI engaged in \"harassment\" through litigation, attacks on social media and in the press, and through a \"sham bid\" to buy the ChatGPT-maker for $97.4 billion designed to harm the company's business relationships."

      "text": "Suit claims anticompetitive exclusive agreements in generative AI chatbot and smartphone markets.\nX Corp. and X.AI LLC sued Apple Inc. and OpenAI today (8/25/2025) alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws, including Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Texas Free Enterprise & Antitrust Act. Plaintiffs demand a jury trial and seek injunctive relief, damages, and other remedies to address what they describe as a coordinated effort by Apple and OpenAI to stifle competition in the generative AI chatbot and smartphone markets.\nThe suit was filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas (X Corp. and X.AI LLC v. Apple Inc. and OpenAI, No. 4:25-cv-00914-P, N.D. Texas, Fort Worth Div.).\nKey Allegations\nThe plaintiffs, X Corp. (owner of the social media platform X, formerly Twitter) and X.AI LLC (developer of the generative AI chatbot Grok), accuse Apple and OpenAI of entering into an exclusive agreement that unlawfully restrains trade and maintains monopolies in their respective markets.\nAccording to the complaint, Apple integrated OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT into its iOS operating system, making ChatGPT the sole generative AI chatbot available for native integration on iPhones. This arrangement allegedly forecloses competitors like Grok from accessing billions of user prompts generated by iPhone users, a critical resource for scaling and improving generative AI models.\nThe plaintiffs argue that this exclusive integration harms competition by depriving rival generative AI chatbots of scale, suppressing innovation, and reducing consumer choice.\nThey further maintain that Apple has manipulated its App Store rankings to favor ChatGPT while deprioritizing competing apps like Grok and X. Additionally, Apple is accused of delaying approvals for updates to Grok\u2019s app, further hindering its ability to compete.\nCauses of Action\nThe causes of action include:\nUnlawful Agreement in Violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act: Plaintiffs allege that Apple and OpenAI\u2019s exclusive arrangement constitutes an illegal restraint of trade, foreclosing competition in the generative AI chatbot market and suppressing the development of super apps that could disrupt Apple\u2019s smartphone monopoly.\nMonopolization and Attempted Monopolization in Violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act: Apple is accused of maintaining its monopoly in the U.S. smartphone market by inhibiting the development of super apps, while OpenAI is alleged to have monopolized the generative AI chatbot market by foreclosing rivals from critical resources.\nConspiracy to Monopolize: Plaintiffs claim that Apple and OpenAI conspired to leverage their respective monopolies to maintain dominance in their markets, harming competition and innovation.\nUnfair Competition: The complaint asserts that the defendants\u2019 conduct violates the policy and spirit of antitrust laws, interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to scale their businesses.\nViolations of the Texas Free Enterprise & Antitrust Act: Plaintiffs allege that the defendants\u2019 conduct constitutes monopolization, attempted monopolization, and conspiracy to monopolize under Texas law.\nMusk\u2019s Discontent\nElon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has become one of its most vocal critics. After leaving the company\u2019s board in 2018, Musk has repeatedly accused OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission and aligning too closely with corporate interests, particularly Microsoft.\nMusk\u2019s legal battle with Apple didn\u2019t begin with today\u2019s lawsuit. Over the past year, he has repeatedly accused Apple of anticompetitive behavior, including manipulating App Store rankings to favor OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT over his own Grok chatbot. In 2024, Musk even threatened to ban Apple devices from his companies if ChatGPT was integrated at the OS level, calling it a security risk. These earlier disputes laid the groundwork for the current antitrust suit, which alleges a broader scheme to suppress AI competition.\nImplications for Antitrust Law\nThis case highlights the intersection of antitrust law and emerging technologies like generative AI. The plaintiffs argue that Apple and OpenAI\u2019s conduct not only harms competitors but also stifles innovation and consumer choice in two critical markets. The complaint underscores the importance of scale and network effects in the generative AI chatbot industry, as well as the competitive threat posed by super apps to entrenched smartphone monopolies.\nAntitrust attorneys and companies are monitoring this case for its potential impact on antitrust enforcement and the regulation of exclusive agreements in technology markets."

Additionally, Apple is accused of delaying approvals for updates to Grok\u2019s app, further hindering its ability to compete.\nCauses of Action\nThe causes of action include:\nUnlawful Agreement in Violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act: Plaintiffs allege that Apple and OpenAI\u2019s exclusive arrangement constitutes an illegal restraint of trade, foreclosing competition in the generative AI chatbot market and suppressing the development of super apps that could disrupt Apple\u2019s smartphone monopoly.\nMonopolization and Attempted Monopolization in Violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act: Apple is accused of maintaining its monopoly in the U.S. smartphone market by inhibiting the development of super apps, while OpenAI is alleged to have monopolized the generative AI chatbot market by foreclosing rivals from critical resources.\nConspiracy to Monopolize: Plaintiffs claim that Apple and OpenAI conspired to leverage their respective monopolies to maintain dominance in their markets, harming competition and innovation.\nUnfair Competition: The complaint asserts that the defendants\u2019 conduct violates the policy and spirit of antitrust laws, interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to scale their businesses.\nViolations of the Texas Free Enterprise & Antitrust Act: Plaintiffs allege that the defendants\u2019 conduct constitutes monopolization, attempted monopolization, and conspiracy to monopolize under Texas law.\nMusk\u2019s Discontent\nElon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has become one of its most vocal critics. After leaving the company\u2019s board in 2018, Musk has repeatedly accused OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission and aligning too closely with corporate interests, particularly Microsoft.\nMusk\u2019s legal battle with Apple didn\u2019t begin with today\u2019s lawsuit. Over the past year, he has repeatedly accused Apple of anticompetitive behavior, including manipulating App Store rankings to favor OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT over his own Grok chatbot. In 2024, Musk even threatened to ban Apple devices from his companies if ChatGPT was integrated at the OS level, calling it a security risk. These earlier disputes laid the groundwork for the current antitrust suit, which alleges a broader scheme to suppress AI competition.\nImplications for Antitrust Law\nThis case highlights the intersection of antitrust law and emerging technologies like generative AI. The plaintiffs argue that Apple and OpenAI\u2019s conduct not only harms competitors but also stifles innovation and consumer choice in two critical markets. The complaint underscores the importance of scale and network effects in the generative AI chatbot industry, as well as the competitive threat posed by super apps to entrenched smartphone monopolies.\nAntitrust attorneys and companies are monitoring this case for its potential impact on antitrust enforcement and the regulation of exclusive agreements in technology markets."

      "text": "Topline\nThe Justice Department and more than a dozen states and Washington, D.C. filed a lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, alleging the tech giant and iPhone maker violated antitrust laws through restrictive policies that hurt competitors and consumers\u2014one of the largest lawsuits so far in the federal government\u2019s sweeping tech antitrust crackdown.\nKey Facts\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, alleges that Apple has illegally monopolized the smartphone market in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.\nThe complaint alleges the tech giant makes it harder for consumers to switch to non-Apple devices, such as Androids, and \u201caffirmatively undermines the quality of rival smartphones,\u201d citing as examples \u201climited functionality\u201d and green text bubbles that occur when iPhone users attempt to message non-iPhone users.\nApple also allegedly uses a \u201cseries of shapeshifting rules and restrictions\u201d like app store policies and developer agreements that prevent competitors from offering alternatives to its services on iPhones, like digital wallets, according to the lawsuit.\nThe alleged monopolization extends beyond Apple\u2019s iPhone, according to the lawsuit, affecting web browsers, automotive services, advertising services and more.\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said during a press conference the tech giant \u201chas gone from revolutionizing the smartphone market to stalling its advancement.\u201d\nAttorney generals from New Jersey, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Wisconsin and Washington, D.C. have joined the lawsuit, according to court filings.\nApple told Forbes it believes the lawsuit \u201cis wrong on the facts and the law,\u201d adding \u201cwe will vigorously defend against it.\u201d\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cUnless Apple\u2019s anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct is stopped, it will likely extend and entrench its iPhone monopoly to other markets and parts of the economy,\u201d the lawsuit said.\nKey Background\nApple is one of the world\u2019s largest companies, owing its $2.66 trillion market cap largely to the success of the iPhone, which was first introduced in 2007. But the tech giant has long faced criticisms that it has used its dominance in the smartphone market to stifle competition and impose large fees on payments to third-party app developers. Fortnite maker Epic Games sued Apple in 2020 for requiring apps to use its in-house payment system and taking a 30% cut on in-app payments. A judge ruled in 2021 that Apple violated California state laws on unfair competition but did not have a monopoly on mobile gaming. The Supreme Court refused to review appeals from both parties in January, requiring the iPhone maker to begin allowing alternative in-app payment options. On March 13, Epic Games alleged Apple did not comply with the ruling and requested the company be held in contempt. Microsoft, Match Group, Meta, and X (formerly known as Twitter) filed a brief on Wednesday opposing the alternative payment plan. Thursday\u2019s lawsuit is also the third the DOJ has filed against Apple since 2010, according to Bloomberg, but is the first that accuses the tech giant of illegally maintaining a monopoly\u2014and the latest in the federal government\u2019s antitrust crackdown on big tech companies.\nTangent\nRegulating anti-competitive behavior in the tech sector has been a priority for the Biden administration. Last January, the DOJ and eight states filed a lawsuit against Google\u2014the second since October 2020\u2014alleging it abused its monopoly on advertising technology and prevented competition through various acquisitions. In January, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating AI deals across big tech companies, including Microsoft, OpenAI and Alphabet. The federal government also unsuccessfully tried to stop Microsoft from acquiring game developer Activision Blizzard.\nFurther Reading\nApple Shares Slip Ahead Of Reported DOJ Antitrust Case (Forbes)\nMicrosoft, Meta, X Oppose Apple\u2019s Plan To Introduce Outside Payment Options On App Store (Forbes)\nBig Tech Firms Could Soon Face More Government Scrutiny (Forbes)"

      "text": "EPIC GAMES, INC. V. APPLE, INC., No. 21-16506 (9th Cir. 2023)\nAnnotate this Case\nEpic Games, Inc. sued Apple, Inc. pursuant to the Sherman Act and California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law (UCL). Epic contends that Apple acted unlawfully by restricting app distribution on iOS devices to Apple\u2019s App Store, requiring in-app purchases on iOS devices to use Apple\u2019s in-app payment processor, and limiting the ability of app developers to communicate the availability of alternative payment options to iOS device users. Apple counter-sued for breach of contract and indemnification for its attorney fees arising from this litigation.\nThe Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court\u2019s judgment, after a bench trial, against Epic Games on its Sherman Act claims for restraint of trade, tying, and monopoly maintenance against Apple, Inc.; in favor of Epic on its UCL claim; against Epic on Apple\u2019s claim for breach of contract; and against Apple on its claim for attorney fees. The panel affirmed except for the district court\u2019s ruling respecting attorney fees, where it reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\nThe panel affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of antitrust liability and its corresponding rejection of Epic\u2019s illegality defense to Apple\u2019s breach of contract counter-claim. The panel held that the district court erred as a matter of law in defining the relevant antitrust market, but those errors were harmless. The panel held that independent of the district court\u2019s errors, Epic failed to establish, as a factual matter, its proposed market definition and the existence of any substantially less restrictive alternative means for Apple to accomplish the procompetitive justifications supporting iOS\u2019s walled garden ecosystem.\nCourt Description: Antitrust The panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court\u2019s judgment, after a bench trial, against Epic Games, Inc., on its Sherman Act claims for restraint of trade, tying, and monopoly maintenance against Apple, Inc.; in favor of Epic on its claim under California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law; against Epic on Apple\u2019s claim for breach of contract; and against Apple on its claim for attorney fees. The panel affirmed except for the district court\u2019s ruling respecting attorney fees, where it reversed and remanded for further proceedings. * The Honorable Michael J. McShane, United States District Judge for the District of Oregon, sitting by designation. The panel explained that, when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app developers, it created a \u201cwalled garden,\u201d rather than an open ecosystem in which developers and users could transact freely without mediation from Apple. Epic alleged that Apple acted unlawfully by restricting app distribution on iOS devices to Apple\u2019s App Store, requiring in-app purchases on iOS devices to use Apple\u2019s in-app payment processor, and limiting the ability of app developers to communicate the availability of alternative payment options to iOS device users. These restrictions were imposed under the Developer Program Licensing Agreement (\u201cDPLA\u201d), which developers were required to sign in order to distribute apps to iOS users. The district court rejected Epic\u2019s Sherman Act \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 claims challenging the first and second restrictions, principally on the factual grounds that Epic failed to propose viable less restrictive alternatives to Apple\u2019s restrictions. The district court concluded that the third restriction was unfair pursuant to the California UCL and enjoined Apple from enforcing it against any developer. The district court held that Epic breached its contract with Apple but was not obligated to pay Apple\u2019s attorney fees.\nOn Epic\u2019s appeal, the panel affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of antitrust liability and its corresponding rejection of Epic\u2019s illegality defense to Apple\u2019s breach of contract counter-claim. The panel held that the district court erred as a matter of law in defining the relevant antitrust market and in holding that a non-negotiated contract of adhesion, such as the DPLA, falls outside the scope of Sherman Act \u00a7 1, but those errors were harmless. The panel held that, independent of the district court\u2019s errors, Epic failed to establish, as a factual matter, its proposed market definition and the existence of any substantially less restrictive alternative means for Apple to accomplish the procompetitive justifications supporting iOS\u2019s walled- garden ecosystem.\nOn Apple\u2019s cross-appeal, the panel affirmed as to the district court\u2019s UCL ruling in favor of Epic, holding that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Epic was injured, err as a matter of law when applying California\u2019s flexible liability standards, or abuse its discretion when fashioning equitable relief. Reversing in part, the panel held that the district court erred when it ruled that Apple was not entitled to attorney fees pursuant to the DPLA\u2019s indemnification provision.\nConcurring in part and dissenting in part, Judge S.R.\nThomas wrote that he fully agreed with the majority that the district court properly granted Epic injunctive relief on its California UCL claims. Judge S.R. Thomas also fully agreed that the district court properly rejected Epic\u2019s illegality defenses to the DPLA but that, contrary to the district court\u2019s decision, the DPLA did require Epic to pay attorney fees for its breach. On the federal claims, Judge S.R. Thomas also agreed that the district court erred in defining the relevant market and erred when it held that a non-negotiated contract of adhesion falls outside the scope of Sherman Act \u00a7 1. Unlike the majority, however, Judge S.R. Thomas would not conclude that these errors were harmless because they related to threshold analytical steps and affected Epic\u2019s substantial rights. He would remand for the district court to re-analyze the case using the proper threshold determination of the relevant market.\nThe court issued a subsequent related opinion or order on July 17, 2023.\nSome case metadata and case summaries were written with the help of AI, which can produce inaccuracies. You should read the full case before relying on it for legal research purposes.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply."

      "text": "PRESS RELEASE\nJune 10, 2024\nIntroducing Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac\nSetting a new standard for privacy in AI, Apple Intelligence understands personal context to deliver intelligence that is helpful and relevant\nCUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today introduced Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that\u2019s incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. It harnesses the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. With Private Cloud Compute, Apple sets a new standard for privacy in AI, with the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to introduce a new chapter in Apple innovation. Apple Intelligence will transform what users can do with our products \u2014 and what our products can do for our users,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cOur unique approach combines generative AI with a user\u2019s personal context to deliver truly helpful intelligence. And it can access that information in a completely private and secure way to help users do the things that matter most to them. This is AI as only Apple can deliver it, and we can\u2019t wait for users to experience what it can do.\u201d\nNew Capabilities for Understanding and Creating Language\nApple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.\nWhether tidying up class notes, ensuring a blog post reads just right, or making sure an email is perfectly crafted, Writing Tools help users feel more confident in their writing. With Rewrite, Apple Intelligence allows users to choose from different versions of what they have written, adjusting the tone to suit the audience and task at hand. From finessing a cover letter, to adding humor and creativity to a party invitation, Rewrite helps deliver the right words to meet the occasion. Proofread checks grammar, word choice, and sentence structure while also suggesting edits \u2014 along with explanations of the edits \u2014 that users can review or quickly accept. With Summarize, users can select text and have it recapped in the form of a digestible paragraph, bulleted key points, a table, or a list.\nIn Mail, staying on top of emails has never been easier. With Priority Messages, a new section at the top of the inbox shows the most urgent emails, like a same-day dinner invitation or boarding pass. Across a user\u2019s inbox, instead of previewing the first few lines of each email, they can see summaries without needing to open a message. For long threads, users can view pertinent details with just a tap. Smart Reply provides suggestions for a quick response, and will identify questions in an email to ensure everything is answered.\nDeep understanding of language also extends to Notifications. Priority Notifications appear at the top of the stack to surface what\u2019s most important, and summaries help users scan long or stacked notifications to show key details right on the Lock Screen, such as when a group chat is particularly active. And to help users stay present in what they\u2019re doing, Reduce Interruptions is a new Focus that surfaces only the notifications that might need immediate attention, like a text about an early pickup from daycare.\nIn the Notes and Phone apps, users can now record, transcribe, and summarize audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to help recall key points.\nImage Playground Makes Communication and Self\u2011Expression Even More Fun\nApple Intelligence powers exciting image creation capabilities to help users communicate and express themselves in new ways. With Image Playground, users can create fun images in seconds, choosing from three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Image Playground is easy to use and built right into apps including Messages. It\u2019s also available in a dedicated app, perfect for experimenting with different concepts and styles. All images are created on device, giving users the freedom to experiment with as many images as they want.\nWith Image Playground, users can choose from a range of concepts from categories like themes, costumes, accessories, and places; type a description to define an image; choose someone from their personal photo library to include in their image; and pick their favorite style.\nWith the Image Playground experience in Messages, users can quickly create fun images for their friends, and even see personalized suggested concepts related to their conversations. For example, if a user is messaging a group about going hiking, they\u2019ll see suggested concepts related to their friends, their destination, and their activity, making image creation even faster and more relevant.\nIn Notes, users can access Image Playground through the new Image Wand in the Apple Pencil tool palette, making notes more visually engaging. Rough sketches can be turned into delightful images, and users can even select empty space to create an image using context from the surrounding area. Image Playground is also available in apps like Keynote, Freeform, and Pages, as well as in third-party apps that adopt the new Image Playground API.\nGenmoji Creation to Fit Any Moment\nTaking emoji to an entirely new level, users can create an original Genmoji to express themselves. By simply typing a description, their Genmoji appears, along with additional options. Users can even create Genmoji of friends and family based on their photos. Just like emoji, Genmoji can be added inline to messages, or shared as a sticker or reaction in a Tapback.\nNew Features in Photos Give Users More Control\nSearching for photos and videos becomes even more convenient with Apple Intelligence. Natural language can be used to search for specific photos, such as \u201cMaya skateboarding in a tie-dye shirt,\u201d or \u201cKatie with stickers on her face.\u201d Search in videos also becomes more powerful with the ability to find specific moments in clips so users can go right to the relevant segment. Additionally, the new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo \u2014 without accidentally altering the subject.\nWith Memories, users can create the story they want to see by simply typing a description. Using language and image understanding, Apple Intelligence will pick out the best photos and videos based on the description, craft a storyline with chapters based on themes identified from the photos, and arrange them into a movie with its own narrative arc. Users will even get song suggestions to match their memory from Apple Music. As with all Apple Intelligence features, user photos and videos are kept private on device and are not shared with Apple or anyone else.\nSiri Enters a New Era\nPowered by Apple Intelligence, Siri becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri is more natural, more contextually relevant, and more personal, with the ability to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. It can follow along if users stumble over words and maintain context from one request to the next. Additionally, users can type to Siri, and switch between text and voice to communicate with Siri in whatever way feels right for the moment. Siri also has a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when Siri is active.\nSiri can now give users device support everywhere they go, and answer thousands of questions about how to do something on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Users can learn everything from how to schedule an email in the Mail app, to how to switch from Light to Dark Mode.\nWith onscreen awareness, Siri will be able to understand and take action with users\u2019 content in more apps over time. For example, if a friend texts a user their new address in Messages, the receiver can say, \u201cAdd this address to his contact card.\u201d\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri will be able to take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. For example, a user could say, \u201cBring up that article about cicadas from my Reading List,\u201d or \u201cSend the photos from the barbecue on Saturday to Malia,\u201d and Siri will take care of it.\nSiri will be able to deliver intelligence that\u2019s tailored to the user and their on-device information. For example, a user can say, \u201cPlay that podcast that Jamie recommended,\u201d and Siri will locate and play the episode, without the user having to remember whether it was mentioned in a text or an email. Or they could ask, \u201cWhen is Mom\u2019s flight landing?\u201d and Siri will find the flight details and cross-reference them with real-time flight tracking to give an arrival time.\nA New Standard for Privacy in AI\nTo be truly helpful, Apple Intelligence relies on understanding deep personal context while also protecting user privacy. A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, and many of the models that power it run entirely on device. To run more complex requests that require more processing power, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence.\nWith Private Cloud Compute, Apple Intelligence can flex and scale its computational capacity and draw on larger, server-based models for more complex requests. These models run on servers powered by Apple silicon, providing a foundation that allows Apple to ensure that data is never retained or exposed.\nIndependent experts can inspect the code that runs on Apple silicon servers to verify privacy, and Private Cloud Compute cryptographically ensures that iPhone, iPad, and Mac do not talk to a server unless its software has been publicly logged for inspection. Apple Intelligence with Private Cloud Compute sets a new standard for privacy in AI, unlocking intelligence users can trust.\nChatGPT Gets Integrated Across Apple Platforms\nApple is integrating ChatGPT access into experiences within iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, allowing users to access its expertise \u2014 as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities \u2014 without needing to jump between tools.\nSiri can tap into ChatGPT\u2019s expertise when helpful. Users are asked before any questions are sent to ChatGPT, along with any documents or photos, and Siri then presents the answer directly.\nAdditionally, ChatGPT will be available in Apple\u2019s systemwide Writing Tools, which help users generate content for anything they are writing about. With Compose, users can also access ChatGPT image tools to generate images in a wide variety of styles to complement what they are writing.\nPrivacy protections are built in for users who access ChatGPT \u2014 their IP addresses are obscured, and OpenAI won\u2019t store requests. ChatGPT\u2019s data-use policies apply for users who choose to connect their account.\nChatGPT will come to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia later this year, powered by GPT-4o. Users can access it for free without creating an account, and ChatGPT subscribers can connect their accounts and access paid features right from these experiences.\nAvailability\nApple Intelligence is free for users, and will be available in beta as part of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia this fall in U.S. English. Some features, software platforms, and additional languages will come over the course of the next year. Apple Intelligence will be available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac with M1 and later, with Siri and device language set to U.S. English.

  "argos_summary": "Elon Musk\u2019s AI startup xAI and its social\u2011media arm X filed a federal antitrust suit in Texas accusing Apple and OpenAI of colluding to lock Apple iPhones to ChatGPT, allegedly giving the duo a monopoly over AI assistants and foreclosing rivals like xAI\u2019s Grok. The complaint claims Apple\u2019s system\u2011level integration, App Store ranking favoritism and data\u2011access restrictions violate Sections\u202f1 and\u202f2 of the Sherman Act, while also citing Apple\u2019s broader DOJ antitrust case and the Epic Games v. Apple precedent. Apple has defended the integration as a consumer\u2011benefiting feature, noting opt\u2011in flows and no exclusive pipeline, and the case may hinge on proving substantial foreclosure and market definition. The lawsuit could prompt discovery that informs both the DOJ\u2019s smartphone monopoly case and future antitrust scrutiny of AI distribution on iOS. Overall, the suit positions Musk\u2019s challenge as a broader fight against perceived monopolistic practices in the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem.",
