      "summary": "WTI crude rose 1.2% on Thursday, buoyed by signs of progress in US‑Japan and US‑EU trade talks and a record‑high S&P 500 rally that signal stronger economic growth and energy demand.  The rally was tempered by a firmer dollar, mixed U.S. data (lower unemployment claims but a weak manufacturing PMI) and a weak crack spread that discourages refinery purchases.  Support for oil also came from Iraq’s planned resumption of Kurdish exports, EU sanctions cutting Russian oil supply, and a decline in tanker inventories, while OPEC+ has increased output but is considering pausing further hikes amid concerns of a supply glut.  Overall, the market remains cautiously optimistic, with crude prices likely to stay near the 1‑2% upside range over the next few weeks.",
