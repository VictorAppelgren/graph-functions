  "title": "Banks Challenge Open Banking Deadlines as CFPB Mulls Revisions",
  "description": "Even as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau signals its intent to overhaul its sweeping open banking rule, U.S. banks say they risk spending millions",
  "content": "The protracted nature of the CFPB\u2019s planned regulatory overhaul means banks are locked into costly compliance for an indefinite period, fueling the call for court intervention.\n\nThe lawsuit directly challenges the CFPB\u2019s core authority and the rule\u2019s framework, particularly regarding data sharing and fee prohibitions.\n\nBanks face unrecoverable financial harm by being forced to prepare for an open banking rule, they allege in a new court filing against the CFPB.\n\nEven as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau signals its intent to overhaul its sweeping open banking rule, U.S. banks say they risk spending millions of dollars as soon as next year to comply with a regulation the agency itself has declared unlawful and ripe for re-examination.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nA motion filed in Kentucky Wednesday (Aug. 13) by Forcht Bank, the Kentucky Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute alleges the CFPB\u2019s new open banking rule is fundamentally unlawful. The plaintiffs argue that the rule exceeds the bureau\u2019s statutory authority by forcing banks to share sensitive customer data with commercial third parties, rather than just the individual consumers themselves.\n\nThe suit contends that the rule\u2019s overall framework is arbitrary and capricious, particularly in how it manages the inherent risks to consumer data. As has been the case with the legal back and forth with the CFPB, a key point of contention also involves the CFPB\u2019s prohibition on banks charging fees to the commercial third parties that benefit from accessing these newly mandated data interfaces.\n\nAs the motion seeks clarification from the court regarding compliance, the banks\u2019 immediate concern centers on the practical and financial consequences of preparing for the rule that is on track to take effect next year.\n\u2022 None Banks argue they face imminent and irreparable financial harm due to the \u201cunrecoverable costs\u201d of preparing for a rule that is likely to be vacated or substantially revised. Because the federal government by sovereign immunity, any funds expended by banks to comply cannot later, even if the rule . Personnel, technological development and ongoing infrastructure maintenance for a \u201crule-compliant developer interface\u201d would be required to satisfy a mandate that the CFPB itself has acknowledged is legally deficient and is actively working to replace. The complexity of the rule\u2019s requirements already made timely compliance by the initial April 2026 deadline (since adjusted to June 2026 for the largest banks) \u201cunrealistic,\u201d and now these expenditures are likely to be entirely wasted, the banks allege.\n\u2022 None The Paradox of Binding Deadlines Without Regulatory Clarity: Despite the CFPB\u2019s own concession that the rule is unlawful, as well as the bureau\u2019s stated intent to initiate a new rulemaking process, the current compliance deadlines remain in effect. puts banks in a position where they cannot simply ignore the existing rule and its approaching deadlines without incurring regulatory risk, according to the motion.\n\u2022 None The bureau\u2019s proposed path to addressing the rule\u2019s legal deficiencies involves a new rulemaking, beginning with an \u201cadvance notice of proposed rulemaking\u201d (ANPRM). Plaintiffs emphasize that an ANPRM is merely a \u201cpreparatory step\u201d and not the formal notice of proposed rulemaking that begins the public comment period. Such a \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d re-examination of the rule is expected to take years, especially given that the initial promulgation of this rule took eight years from the CFPB\u2019s first information request to its current form. This extended timeline means banks will likely to continue substantial, unrecoverable compliance efforts past the initial June 2026 deadline, according to the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs respectfully request an order staying the rule\u2019s compliance deadlines and enjoining the rule\u2019s enforcement until one year following the conclusion of this litigation,\u201d the motion states. \u201cOnly at that point will all parties have certainty about all relevant regulatory obligations.\u201d\n\nBeyond the immediate compliance cost dilemma, the lawsuit delves into several other legal disputes. The plaintiffs argue that the CFPB\u2019s interpretation of \u201cconsumer\u201d in Section 1033 is overly broad, extending data access beyond individual account holders to commercial third parties that typically lack a special, fiduciary-like relationship.\n\nThe Battle Over Data and Fees\n\nThe battle over the fees and access is being fiercely waged. In a separate matter, and in an e-mail to PYMNTS Thursday (Aug. 14), the Bank Policy Institute, along with the American Bankers Association and the Consumer Bankers Association, responded to a letter from the Financial Technology Association and a variety of FinTechs that had been sent to President Donald Trump. The letter contends that data access, or \u201caccount access\u201d fees, would limit information flows that underpin FinTech, cryptocurrency and digital innovation.\n\nIn the response, the banking trade groups counter that \u201cthe double standard these companies want to perpetuate, where they may charge fees for service while banks are expected to provide the same service to these private companies for free, is absurd.\u201d",

      "text": "More than 80 leaders of FinTech companies, crypto companies and other firms involved with open banking signed a public letter asking President Donald Trump to prevent banks from charging \u201caccount access\u201d fees when consumers connect their accounts to financial products.\n\u201cThis is not a dispute over fair pricing; it is an anti-competitive move designed to consolidate power,\u201d the business leaders said in the letter, which is dated Wednesday (Aug. 13) and was posted online by the Financial Technology Association. \u201cIt threatens to cripple innovative products and may cause small businesses and financial tools to shut down entirely.\u201d\nThe letter said \u201caccount access\u201d fees would limit the access to consumers\u2019 and business\u2019 finances that is needed to support the operations of cryptocurrency companies, financial artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, and digital wallets and payments.\n\u201cThis access is critical to ensuring Americans have control of their own financial lives in a digital economy,\u201d the letter said. \u201cMore fundamentally, [banks] are advancing a dangerous legal interpretation that a consumer\u2019s right to their account information does not include the freedom to share access to a trusted application acting on their behalf.\u201d\nIt was reported July 11 that JPMorgan told FinTechs it will begin charging for access to customer bank data.\nThe bank sent pricing sheets explaining the new charges to data aggregators that connect banks and FinTechs.\nA spokesperson for JPMorgan told Bloomberg in July that the bank has invested heavily to develop a system that protects consumer data.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had productive conversations and are working with the entire ecosystem to ensure we\u2019re all making the necessary investments in the infrastructure that keeps our customers safe,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wrote in an annual letter to shareholders released in April that \u201ca new battle is brewing\u201d over third-party access to banks\u2019 customer data.\n\u201cContrary to what you may read, we have no problem with data sharing but only if it is done properly,\u201d Dimon wrote. \u201cIt must be authorized by the customer \u2014 the customer should know exactly what data is shared and when and how it is used; third parties should pay for accessing the banking system and payment rails.\u201d\nIn their Wednesday letter to Trump, the FinTech and crypto business leaders said: \u201cWith these fees set to impact the market in September, the White House should act immediately. Account access fees are not permitted under the law, and if they are allowed to go into effect it will undermine the pro-innovation consensus your Administration is building.\u201d"
