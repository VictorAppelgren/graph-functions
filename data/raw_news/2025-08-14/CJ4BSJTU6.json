  "description": "A 43-inch TV is a good fit for small rooms, and some models work great as gaming monitors. These are our top picks for different needs.",
  "content": "In recent years, many brands have cut down on the number of smaller screen sizes in their flagship TV lineups. This is especially true if you're shopping for a 40-, 42-, or 43-inch TV. But while there aren't as many options as there used to be, you can still find some great models if you know what to look for. With that in mind, I've used my expertise to select the best 43-inch TVs available.My picks are informed by more than a decade of experience reviewing home entertainment products, and I've included models for different needs. At this screen size there aren't many midrange options, so the best 43-inch TVs tend to be either affordable entry-level models or pricey premium displays.The 42-inch Samsung S90D earns my highest recommendation thanks to its infinite contrast ratio with deep black levels that disappear into a dark room. It's also one of the few TVs this size with support for a fast 144Hz refresh rate that's ideal for gamers. However, the S90D is pricey. If you want a budget-friendly option, I recommend the 43-inch TCL S5, which is often sold for around $200. The S5 has lower contrast, but it still delivers good color performance and comes with a handy Google Assistant voice remote.Editor's note: Brands make TV models in slightly different sizes depending on the type of panel used, so I looked at displays that range from 40 to 43 inches for this guide. However, 40-inch TVs are rare, and no currently available models made the cut as one of my top recommendations. Best overall: Samsung S90D 4K TV - See at AmazonBest on a budget: TCL S5 4K TV - See at WalmartBest for bright rooms: Samsung QN90F 4K TV - See at Amazon\n              The S90D is one of the top 42-inch TVs on the market, thanks to its high-contrast OLED panel, deep black levels, wide viewing angles, and fast refresh rate. It's also a great gaming monitor alternative for PCs and consoles. \n            The Samsung S90D delivers some of the best picture quality you can get in a 42-inch TV. It's one of the few OLEDs available in this screen size, and this type of panel has major benefits over other kinds of displays.Most notably, the S90D has an infinite contrast ratio. When watching TV in a dark room, black levels are truly black, which gives images a deep and inky quality that adds dimension and depth. The TV's light output is controlled on a pixel level, so the S90D is free from any backlighting flaws, like blooming, clouding, or uneven patches of brightness. Those issues all crop up to some degree on even the most expensive LED and QLED sets.The S90D also has exceptional viewing angles, so you can sit off to the side of the screen without the image fading or washing out. Brightness is solid too, but the 42-inch model isn't as bright as its larger 55-, 65-, or 77-inch siblings. Those bigger options incorporate an extra feature called quantum dots, which allows them to produce a slightly wider range of colors and higher peak luminance. That said, the S90D's color performance is still strong, and it's capable of displaying bold high dynamic range (HDR) images.The TV is well-equipped for gaming, with a fast response time and support for up to a 144Hz refresh rate. This makes the 42-inch S90D an excellent option for PC players who want to use it as an extra-large gaming monitor on a desk. Samsung's Tizen interface is also one of the few smart TV platforms with support for Xbox Game Pass streaming, which lets members play games without an Xbox console.The Tizen OS offers decent overall performance, with access to all of the most popular video services and fairly smooth navigation speed. However, I've run into some lag and a couple of small glitches here and there when testing various S90 series TVs. The system isn't perfect, but its flaws aren't a dealbreaker.Ultimately, the 42-inch S90D's biggest con is its price. This set is often sold for around $1,000, which is expensive for such a compact display. LG and Sony also have a couple of 42-inch OLED options, but they're often sold for a bit more and offer very similar performance. In addition, Samsung sells a 2025 version of this TV, called the S90F, but it doesn't offer a big upgrade and costs more. In general, you can't go wrong with any 42-inch OLED model, but given recent price trends, I give the S90D the edge as the best 42-inch TV overall.Check out our guides to all of the best TVs, best smart TVs, and best OLED TVs.\n              The S5 is a good 43-inch TV on a budget. Its brightness and contrast are lower than pricier TVs, but its picture quality is solid for casual viewing. It also comes with a handy voice remote, which some cheaper options lack. \n            One of the perks of buying a smaller TV is that you can often find many budget-friendly options. There are a couple of worthy models to choose from, but the TCL S5 stands out from the pack. This 43-inch LED TV is often on sale for just under $200, and it delivers solid performance for the money.Now, it's important to remember that all 43-inch TVs in this price range make notable concessions to keep their costs down. But the S5 still offers solid image quality for casual viewing, and its color capabilities are a bit better than most rivals in this class.However, this TV uses a standard LED panel without local dimming, so its contrast and brightness are much lower than those of the pricier picks in this guide. Its black levels are also lighter and less uniform. Though it can technically process every major HDR format, it's not capable of fully showcasing the benefits of high-dynamic-range content. Its viewing angles are also fairly narrow, and it lacks advanced gaming capabilities since it has a 60Hz rather than a 120Hz screen.All those limitations might make it sound like the S5 is a poor performer, but these drawbacks are all expected and well within the norm for any budget-friendly 43-inch TV. To get a substantial bump in performance at this size, you'll need to step up to an OLED, like the Samsung S90D, or a high-end QLED, like the Samsung QN90F, which are five times as much. At this size, there just aren't many worthwhile midrange TVs.On the plus side, the S5's 4K panel delivers a sharp and detailed image. I also like the S5's Google TV interface, which is nicely organized and reliable. Amazon also sells an alternative model that uses the Fire TV operating system instead. The Google TV model includes a Google Assistant voice remote, while the Fire TV model has an Alexa voice remote.There are a few other solid 43-inch TVs that cost around the same amount as the S5, including the Roku Select Series, but the S5 has an edge in color performance. Likewise, there are some options that are even cheaper, like the 43-inch Walmart Onn TV, but generally, it's worth paying a bit more to get the S5 since it includes a voice remote and slightly better image quality.Check out our guides to all of the best budget TVs and best TVs under $500.\n              The QN90F is one of the few high-end QLED TVs available in a 43-inch screen size. Its anti-glare matte screen does an excellent job of combating reflections, and thanks to its fast refresh rate, it's a fantastic gaming TV.  \n            SpecificsSamsung's QN90F is an impressive high-end QLED display. It's the best 43-inch TV for people who struggle with reflections in bright rooms. This set is one of the few TVs that uses an anti-glare matte screen rather than a glossy one. Matte screens greatly reduce reflections, which is perfect for spaces with lots of windows and overhead lights.During my tests, the QN90F's matte screen worked great and was of similar quality to the anti-reflective screens I've seen on Samsung's premium S95D and S95F OLED TVs (which are not sold in sizes smaller than 55 inches). The QN90F also delivers excellent brightness. I measured a peak of 2,130 nits on the 65-inch model, but the smaller 43-inch unit uses a less advanced HDR processing system so it's a bit dimmer. Though it can't match its larger counterpart, the QN90F is still one of the brightest 43-inch TVs on the market. This makes it great for daytime viewing and also enables bold HDR highlights. This is also one of the only TVs this small to use a Mini LED backlight, which offers great contrast control. The QN90F's local dimming still can't equal the pixel-level precision of an OLED, like the Samsung S90D, but it offers good black levels with only minor signs of blooming.Viewing angles are solid for a QLED TV, but aren't as wide as an OLED. Gaming capabilities are stacked, with support for up to a 165Hz refresh rate and Xbox Game Pass streaming. General smart TV capabilities are good, too, but as was the case with the S90D, Samsung's Tizen system is prone to some lag here and there.Like the S90D, the QN90F is an expensive 43-inch TV. This set costs about $1,100, but that price is justified when you consider that this is essentially the only high-end QLED TV available in this size. You can still find an older version of this TV, the QN90D, in stock at some stores, but it typically sells for the same amount of money and doesn't have the QN90F's anti-glare screen.That said, some people may prefer the older QN90D's glossy screen as it preserves black levels a bit better in bright rooms. Matte screens are fantastic at reducing glare, but they scatter light in such a way that they can make dim scenes look a bit flat. But this isn't an issue when watching TV with the lights off.Check out our guide to all of the best Samsung TVs.To find the best 43-inch TVs, our experts relied on hands-on testing and research informed by over a decade of experience reviewing home entertainment tech products. When we evaluate new TVs, we typically test 65-inch units since most companies use that size as their flagship offering. However, when specific TV models are sold in multiple sizes, general specifications are usually carried over across each. So, testing results for a 65-inch TV will also apply to the 43-inch size of that same model.That said, some features can vary slightly on smaller displays compared to their larger counterparts. For instance, the 65-inch Samsung S90D has quantum dots, while the 42-inch model does not, so color performance isn't as high-end on the smaller size. Likewise, QLED and LED TVs with local dimming have fewer zones on smaller sizes, which leads to small differences in contrast control. We take all of these variances into account when selecting our picks and explain these differences when they pop up.When reviewing TVs, we focus on picture quality attributes like contrast ratio, black levels, brightness, color volume, viewing angles, and refresh rate. We also test smart TV capabilities and assess general usability, design benefits, build quality, and overall value. To measure brightness and color, we use a colorimeter with test patterns from the Spears & Munsil 4K Benchmark disc.Test patterns are helpful for measuring certain elements, but ultimately, what matters most is how a TV actually looks when watching real-world content on a daily basis. With that in mind, we aim to live with each TV we review for several weeks, using it as we would any display that we bought ourselves. We also use a curated selection of scenes from different movies and TV shows that we've selected to test features like local dimming, color gamut, shadow details, upscaling, and HDR highlights. Different sources are also used, including 4K Blu-ray discs, 4K streaming, HD streaming, and cable TV. Testing is done in both bright and dark environments.For more details on our review methodology, check out our breakdown of how we test tech products.A 43-inch TV is a good choice for people who want a compact display to put in an area where space limitations are a concern. In that sense, they're great for bedrooms, dorms, or small living rooms, particularly if you have an apartment. Alternatively, some models also work well as computer monitors. Though small for a TV, 43 inches is large for a monitor, so certain TVs this size are a good fit for people who want a big screen on their desk.However, 43 inches is not the best choice if you want to put a TV on a wall or media console in a medium- or large-sized room since this size is just too small to offer an immersive viewing experience from a typical viewing distance. For larger TV recommendations, check out our other size-specific guides:The best 43-inch TVs vary in price, with entry-level HD models starting at around $120 and entry-level 4K models costing around $150 to $250. Though some brands also sell 43-inch 4K TVs priced in the $300 to $600 range, we don't typically recommend those options since they rarely offer notable improvements over cheaper sets.Instead, you need to pay at least $900 to find a 43-inch TV with substantial performance benefits over entry-level models. In the $900 to $1,200 range, you can find a few 42-inch OLED TVs that deliver excellent image quality, and a couple of high-end 43-inch QLEDs that offer high-brightness panels with local dimming.When seated at a typical viewing distance, the benefits of 4K resolution are difficult to see on a 43-inch screen. However, if you're using a 40-, 42-, or 43-inch TV as a computer monitor on your desk, the perks of 4K are much easier to discern.That said, the debate about whether 4K is worth it on a 43-inch screen is mostly moot since 4K is now the industry standard. You can still find a few 40- to 43-inch HDTVs out there, but they're limited to entry-level options and aren't much cheaper than their 4K counterparts. And if you want a 43-inch TV with step-up image quality features like wide color, local dimming, or an OLED panel, you'll need to buy a 4K model.Even the best 43-inch TVs usually have mediocre audio quality. Companies need to keep speaker drivers small to fit them within compact panels, and these tiny built-in speakers often lack bass and depth.For better performance, we recommend pairing your TV with a soundbar or speaker system. Smaller models are a better fit for 43-inch TVs, and you can find some affordable, compact options in our various buying guides:",

  "summary": "The article discusses the best 43-inch TVs available, with recommendations based on reviews from more than a decade of reviews. The Samsung S90D is the top 42-inch TV for picture quality and is one of the few TVs available in this size with support for a fast 144Hz refresh rate. However, while there are no more affordable entry-level models or premium displays for this screen size, the TCL S5 is considered a budget-friendly option. The best overall recommendation is the Samsung S95D 4K TV, which delivers high-contrast OLED panel, deep black levels, wide viewing angles, and fast refresh rate, and is also a great gaming monitor for PCs and consoles. The Tizen OS offers decent overall performance and smooth navigation speed, but its price isn't a deal. The article also mentions the TZOSOS, which offers access to all popular video services and is often sold for around $1,000, which is often set for compact displays.",

      "text": "Business Insider's history traces back to 2007 when it was a tech and business blog called Silicon Alley Insider. It has since grown into a major site for news and lifestyle stories. In 2015, the company launched Insider Picks, the precursor to what is now the Reviews team, to help shoppers navigate the complex retail industry and make the best purchasing decisions.\nToday, the Reviews team is part of Business Insider's Service Journalism department and is helmed by a group of experienced commerce journalists who test and write about consumer products in a variety of categories, including home and kitchen, tech and electronics, pets, health and fitness, style, and beauty. Our in-depth research and testing are what help inform our recommendations to readers.\nWhat types of products we test\nBelow is a sampling of some of the core products and services the Reviews team tests. All products undergo a rigorous research or testing process and, when applicable, long-term testing.\nHome and kitchen: Cookware, small appliances, furniture, home decor, mattresses, bedding, DIY and gardening tools, smart home, and home office. The team also tests foods and drinks, delivery services, and many other home and kitchen-related products.\nPets: Cat and dog food, harnesses, litter boxes, collars, apparel, flea medication for dogs and cats, and many other pet accessories and services. Reporters enlist their cats, dogs, and other pets to help test products, while pet health articles are medically reviewed by veterinarians and supported by expert interviews.\nTech: Smartphones, desktop and laptop computers, smartwatches and wearables, TVs, stereo systems, headphones, home entertainment/streaming, and gaming.\nStyle and beauty: Apparel and shoes for all genders, bags, jewelry, underwear, bras, skincare, cosmetics, and other fashion-related topics. The team also puts health-related personal care products through a medical review to ensure they are safe to use.\nHealth and fitness: Workout clothes for women and men, thermometers, bikes, tents, outdoor gear, fitness equipment, health supplements, oral care, and more. Insider Reviews' health articles are medically reviewed by doctors and other health professionals, and supported by expert interviews.\nTravel: Travel gear, backpacks, commuter bags, luggage, travel tech accessories, and travel-related tips and tricks.\nEntertainment: Streaming platforms, how-to-watch major sporting or streaming events, concert and sporting tickets, and VPN services.\nHow we test products\nThe Reviews team tests products the way people would use them in everyday life. Instead of a lab environment, we use products in the real world. That means we're cooking with kitchen tools and appliances in our own kitchens, installing smart devices in our homes, wearing and washing clothing the way we would in our daily lives, and more. This helps us share real-life insights with our readers about how products integrate into our everyday environments.\nTo conduct our tests, we create a methodology for each product category, which is based on research, consultation with experts in the area, and experience from editors and reporters. All tests are tracked and the results are used to determine which products are worth recommending to readers. Our testing process is explained in greater detail within our buying guides, including information on why some products pass the grade and others don't.\nIn addition to our in-house and freelance testers, we also have an internal council of volunteers and freelancers who help us test products and offer additional perspectives. We occasionally make recommendations based on research and expert feedback \u2014 for example, asking professional makeup artists what products they recommend for certain skin types.\nWhy you can trust us\nThe Reviews team includes a roster of full-time, topic-based editors and reporters, plus several experienced freelance writers with strong backgrounds and expertise in their areas of coverage. Each of our editors and reporters has years of experience testing products and translating the results of those tests into recommendations for readers. Our team is organized based on our core coverage areas mentioned above, with each section focusing on reviewing the products, services, and industries they know best.\nIn addition to individual product review stories, we also maintain a vast collection of buying guides. These guides, which are tied to our reviews, recommend the best products for what readers are searching for (for example, the best espresso machines). We thoroughly test or research every product we recommend in both reviews and guides. We often apply additional scrutiny by consulting a panel of experts to ensure our information is accurate and offer buying advice. And for topics like health, parenting, and pets, we have a third-party medical review board that fact-checks our reviews and buying guides.\nIn all our articles, the reader always comes first. The Reviews team aims to answer every question that readers may have while helping you discover new products and services.\nHow our affiliate links work\nBusiness Insider earns commissions when products and services are purchased through links in our stories. However, our editorial team has complete independence to write about the products and services we truly deem the best based on our extensive testing and research. We do not make decisions based on affiliate relationships, and we would never write about a product that we didn't fully stand behind as product journalists.\nMeet our senior team leaders\n| Sally Kaplan, Executive EditorSally joined Insider in 2018 as an editor and has since held the role of senior editor and deputy editor on the Reviews team. She has interviewed CEOs and brand founders, reported on the rebirth of a fashion startup that narrowly escaped bankruptcy, developed testing methodologies for hundreds of stories, and edited countless others.

      "text": "When shopping for a new TV, screen size is one of the first things you'll need to settle on. Though large TVs have their benefits, not everyone wants a massive panel. If you need something more manageable, a 55-inch TV is a good middle ground. This size is small enough to fit in a variety of rooms but still large enough to showcase the benefits of 4K resolution. Some of the best 55-inch TVs start at less than $300, and many brands sell 55-inch versions of their top models with all the bells and whistles you'd get on a larger size.\nTo help you find the right display for your needs, I picked the best 55-inch TVs available. My top recommendation is the Samsung S90D. This OLED TV features high contrast and deep black levels, which result in fantastic image quality. However, if you want a more affordable option, I recommend the TCL QM6K. This QLED model isn't as high-end as the S90D, but it has smooth Google TV navigation and solid picture performance for its class.\nBelow are all five of my picks for the best 55-inch TVs, with models geared toward casual buyers and enthusiasts alike. My recommendations are informed by more than 10 years of experience testing home entertainment products.\nOur top picks for the best 55-inch TVs\nBest overall: Samsung S90D OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest on a budget: TCL QM6K QLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest premium option: LG G5 OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest entry-level model: TCL S5 LED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest for sports: Samsung S95D OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nThe S90D is one of our favorite 4K TV models. It uses a QD-OLED panel to deliver the most impressive brightness and color performance available in this price range.\n- Impressive peak brightness for a midrange OLED\n- Quantum dots enable high color volume\n- Wide viewing angles\n- Tizen interface lags a bit here and there\n- Some annoyances with notifications and signal glitches\n- Doesn't support Dolby Vision\nCompetition is steep for the best 55-inch TV, but the Samsung S90D rises above the pack. This TV offers the most impressive value of any display I've tested.\nThe S90D uses a QD-OLED panel, which allows it to produce an infinite contrast ratio with deep black levels that disappear into a dark room. High contrast is one of the most important elements of good picture quality, and contrast doesn't get any better than this. In addition, the TV incorporates quantum dot color technology. This is something LG's competing OLEDs lack, and it enables a wider and brighter range of colors.\nThe TV's peak brightness is impressive for a midrange OLED. In my testing, I measured a max of around 1,240 nits. When watching 4K HDR content, this helps produce impactful highlights and vivid detail, with image quality that's nearly on par with high-end sets that cost $1,000 more. Even lower-quality sources like cable TV and HD YouTube streams look good, though the set's image processing and upscaling aren't quite as refined as you'd get with competitors from Sony or LG.\nThe S90D's viewing angles are also excellent, so the picture doesn't noticeably fade or distort when you sit to the side of the TV. The display is a great pick for gamers, thanks to its low input lag and fast 120Hz refresh with a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It can support an even faster 144Hz refresh rate with a compatible PC. Samsung is also one of the few smart TV brands that includes the Xbox app, which lets Game Pass members stream games without a console.\nOn the downside, like all Samsung TVs, the S90D is missing support for Dolby Vision. This HDR format can provide the most accurate image from streaming services like Disney Plus and Netflix. I don't think Dolby Vision is a must-have for a TV this bright, but it's still a nice perk. Check out my HDR TV guide for more details on the differences between HDR formats.\nI also encountered a few hiccups with the S90D's smart TV interface. It offers tons of streaming apps and convenient Alexa voice search, but navigation lagged a bit and wasn't as responsive as the best streaming devices I've reviewed.\nBut where it counts most, the 55-inch S90D is an absolutely stunning TV. People who want a midsize display that doesn't skimp on image quality and features should consider this model first. Samsung does sell a newer version of this set, the S90F, that offers some improvements. But it costs a lot more, so the S90D remains the better value. You can learn more in our full Samsung S90F TV review.\nCheck out our guide to all of the best Samsung TVs.\nBest on a budget\nTCL's QM6K is the brand's new entry-level Mini LED model. It offers great performance for its class, making it one of the best values out there for people who want a budget TV that doesn't sacrifice image quality.\n- Good HDR contrast for a budget-friendly Mini LED TV\n- Local dimming works well with minimal blooming\n- Google TV interface is easy to use and snappy\n- Can't get as bright as pricier QLEDs\n- Viewing angles are better than past models but still mediocre\nTCL's QM6K is the best 55-inch TV for budget-conscious shoppers. Despite its affordable price, the QM6K has advanced picture quality features that a lot of similarly priced models lack.\nMost notably, the QM6K uses a QLED panel with a Mini LED backlight. Most TVs in this price range cut those features to keep costs down, resulting in low contrast, dim images, and a washed-out picture. The QM6K, however, has solid performance across the board.\nThe QLED panel produces a wide range of vivid colors, and the Mini LED backlight has local dimming to control contrast across multiple zones. This leads to good black levels with very few signs of blooming (halos around bright objects). In fact, the QM6K is better at handling blooming than many pricier QLED TVs I've reviewed.\nOf course, there are areas where the QM6K falls short. Its brightness is decent for a TV in this class, but not as high as midrange models. I measured a max of around 550 to 730 nits across different test patterns, which is better than most competing TVs in this price range. That said, high-brightness HDR content doesn't have the luster and pop that I've seen on more expensive TVs.\nThe QM6K's viewing angles are also a bit limited. Colors and contrast fade and distort if you sit off to the side of the screen. That said, the effect isn't as severe as it is on most budget TVs like this.\nTCL also gets points for including a backlit remote, which other brands, like LG and Samsung, don't offer. The remote supports Google Assistant, and you can use hands-free voice control. The QM6K's Google TV interface is smooth, and I only ran into some small hiccups here and there when navigating menus.\nThe QM6K is also one of the most affordable TVs with a high 144Hz refresh rate. This enables smooth gaming when paired with a high-end PC that can handle high frame rates, and it allows for full 120Hz support with a PS5 or Xbox Series X.\nWhen it first hit stores earlier this year, the QM6K's list price was a bit higher than I'd like, which prevented me from giving it a full recommendation. But the 55-inch model is now regularly sold for $550 and is sometimes on sale for as little as $448. Those are excellent prices for a TV in this class, so I now recommend it without reservation\nRead our TCL QM6K 4K TV review.\nCheck out our guides to the best budget TVs and best TVs under $500.\nBest premium option\nThe G5 is LG's latest top-of-the-line TV. It's the brightest OLED display we've measured, offering premium picture performance and a handsome build with a flush wall mount.\n- Brightest OLED available\n- Pixel-level contrast\n- Wide off-axis viewing angles\n- High price\n- Doesn't include a stand\n- Isolated issues with some HDR10 gradients\nLG's G5 is the new high-end TV to beat. This premium OLED edges out my previous pick in this spot, the Sony A95L. Sony's TV is still an excellent option, but the G5 beats it in a few areas.\nMost notably, the G5 is the brightest OLED TV I've ever tested. I measured a peak luminance of 2,410 nits using a 10% test pattern with the TV set in Filmmaker Mode. That's a big leap over the A95L and last year's LG G4, which maxed out at around 1,240 and 1,500 nits, respectively.\nSuch high luminance allows the G5 to deliver more impactful HDR images. When paired with high-brightness HDR movies, like \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" and \"Aquaman,\" the TV simply stuns, delivering an unrivaled combination of bold highlights, rich colors, and deep black levels. This is the kind of image quality that TV nerds like myself geek out over.\nLike all OLED TVs, the G5's viewing angles are wide, so the picture doesn't degrade much when you sit off-center from the screen. This is great for rooms with seating on the side of the TV. The G5 is also built with advanced gaming features, like a high 165Hz refresh rate when paired with a PC to enable smooth motion. This is notably faster than the 120Hz rate that Sony's A95L uses.\nHowever, as impressive as the G5's image capabilities are, the TV isn't quite perfect. When watching a small selection of HDR videos, I did see some false contouring (also called posterization). This flaw caused some colors and shadows to appear blocky rather than smooth. But LG has since released firmware updates to address this, so I don't consider it a notable drawback.\nThe G5 uses LG's webOS interface for smart TV functions, and this platform works just fine. It offers access to lots of streaming apps and has some cool features like Voice ID, which automatically switches user profiles based on who speaks to the TV. On the downside, webOS is prone to emphasizing sponsored content and shopping recommendations more than I'd like, but most of these ads can be deactivated if you navigate through some buried menu options.\nThe TV's design matches its premium picture quality, with a sturdy build, thin profile, and a flush wall mount included in the box. But people who'd prefer to attach the G5 to a traditional TV stand have to buy one separately, as the set doesn't include one at all.\nSome new 55-inch TVs, like Sony's Bravia 8 II and Panasonic's Z95B, could surpass the G5 in certain areas. I'll be testing both TVs soon, but for now, this LG set is my top pick for enthusiasts willing to spend top dollar for their home theaters.\nCheck out our guide to the best LG TVs.\nBest entry-level\nThe S5 is one of TCL's upper entry-level TVs. Its contrast capabilities are limited compared to QLED and OLED models, but it offers solid performance for viewers who just want a cheap smart TV for casual viewing.\n- Affordable price\n- Google TV and Fire TV options\n- Supports wide color\n- Lacks local dimming which limits contrast and black level performance\n- Not as bright as step-up models\n- Narrow viewing angles\nFor a typical sale price of under $300, the TCL S5 is the best 55-inch TV for people who favor affordability over advanced image quality.\nThis model uses a standard LED panel without local dimming. As a result, its brightness and black-level capabilities are a noticeable step down from QLED TVs like the QM6K and pricier OLED models.\nThough the S5 can produce a wide range of colors, its limited contrast prevents the set from displaying HDR content the way it's meant to look, and it causes dark scenes to look more washed out if you watch TV with the lights off. Colors and contrast also distort if you sit to the side of the screen, and the TV's refresh rate is limited to 60Hz, so it can't support high-frame-rate gaming. To be clear, these drawbacks are common for any TV this inexpensive, but they're important to keep in mind.\nI recommend you pay more for the QM6K if you want a budget-friendly TV with HDR in mind. However, the S5 is a solid option if you just want basic 4K playback for casual viewing. Integrated support for the Fire TV platform and an Alexa voice remote round out the package, offering playback from all the best streaming services. An edition with the Google TV OS is also available for those who prefer Google's platform.\nCheck out our guide to all of the best budget TVs.\nBest for sports\nThe S95D is one of Samsung's flagship 4K TVs. It's the brightest OLED we\u2019ve ever measured, and it has a unique anti-glare screen that nearly eliminates reflections. However, the matte display gives black levels a slightly elevated look in a bright room.\n- Highest peak brightness we've seen on an OLED\n- Matte screen combats glare much better than competing TVs\n- Supports 144Hz refresh rate for smooth PC gaming\n- Thin profile with One Connect Box for cable management\n- Lacks Dolby Vision capabilities\n- Anti-reflective coating causes black levels to look faded in bright rooms\n- Similar 2023 model costs a lot less\nSamsung's high-end S95D OLED has a unique matte screen that makes it particularly well-suited for watching sports in a bright room. Most competing displays use a glossy or semi-glossy panel, but the S95D's matte display enables it to reduce glare and reflections significantly.\nIf you have a room where reflections are a big problem, this set could be a game changer. It also has wide viewing angles, so colors and contrast don't distort if you sit off-center from the screen. That's a great perk for viewing parties during big sporting events.\nHowever, there is a notable drawback. While the S95D's matte screen combats glare, it gives black levels a slightly elevated look in bright rooms. This can give dark scenes a hazy and flat quality when you watch TV with the lights on. Sports content won't be affected much, but you could notice the lighter black levels while watching certain movies and TV shows. So, there's a tradeoff, and whether you prioritize reducing reflections or preserving black levels comes down to personal preference.\nThankfully, in a dark room, the S95D's black levels look just as impressive as any OLED's. The TV delivers exceptional picture performance that holds its own against top competitors from Sony and LG. It also has excellent brightness for an OLED. I measured a peak of 1,700 nits. LG's G5 has an edge when it comes to overall image quality, but the S95D is still one of the top high-end TVs there is.\nThe TV's design is also premium, with a uniformly thin profile and a One Connect Box to house its inputs instead of building them into the panel. Gamers get cool perks like a 144Hz mode when paired with a PC and access to the Xbox Game Pass app to stream games.\nSamsung also sells a 2025 edition of this TV, the S95F, that can get even brighter. The S95F is a better TV, but it costs more. With that in mind, the S95D remains the better value for most people who need an anti-glare screen.\nRead our Samsung S95D 4K TV review and our Samsung S95F 4K TV review.\nCheck out our guide to the best TV for sports.\nHow we test 55-inch TVs\nTo select the best 55-inch TVs, our team of reviewers relied on a combination of hands-on testing and research informed by more than 10 years of experience covering home entertainment products.\nWhen we review TVs, we focus on 65-inch units since that size is considered the industry's flagship offering. However, a TV model's overall performance is often comparable across sizes 55 inches and above. For instance, a 65-inch LG G5 OLED and a 55-inch G5 have the same specs and capabilities. The only notable difference is the size of the screen.\nHowever, some TVs that use local dimming, like the TCL QM6K, employ fewer zones in smaller screen sizes versus larger ones. This can lead to small differences in contrast performance when comparing a 55-inch model to another size, but not enough to alter our general impressions of that model. Occasionally, there are bigger differences across sizes, and we note those details when applicable.\nTo test 55-inch TVs, we look at picture clarity, contrast, peak brightness, color performance, viewing angles, gaming capabilities, smart TV navigation, and overall value. We measure HDR brightness with a colorimeter and use test patterns on the Spears & Munsil UHD HDR Benchmark 4K Blu-ray disc to evaluate other objective display parameters.\nBut test patterns can only reveal so much, so we watch plenty of actual movies and shows to see how a TV performs with real-world content on a day-to-day basis in both dark and bright rooms. We revisit various scenes on each TV we test that we've specifically chosen to examine black levels, shadow details, HDR highlights, and upscaling. Our demo content includes 4K, 1080p high definition (HD), and standard definition (SD) material from various sources like Blu-ray discs, streaming services, and cable TV.\nYou can learn more about our review process in our breakdown of how we test tech products.\n55-inch TV FAQs\nIs 55 inches a good size for a TV?\nA 55-inch screen is a solid choice for various needs, and many of the best smart TVs are sold in this size. A 55-inch set is still big enough to feel immersive in smaller living rooms while offering a more compact alternative to 65-inch models that might be too big for some spaces. If you're shopping for a media console or mount to pair with a 55-inch TV, check out our guides to the best TV stands and best TV wall mounts for a few recommendations.\nA 55-inch TV is also a good fit for a bedroom where you might want something smaller than what you've got in your living room, but not so compact that you must sacrifice picture quality features. Most brands' best 4K TVs are available in 55-inch options, but many top displays are not sold in sizes below that. For instance, if you want one of Sony's best OLED TVs, 55 inches is the smallest size available.\nShould you buy a 2025 or 2024 55-inch TV?\nMost manufacturers have released their 2025 TV lineups, including new 55-inch models. That said, shoppers should remember that 2024 TV models will remain in stock for much of the year, and they're getting heavy discounts. As such, we'll continue to recommend certain 2024 options as long as they remain the better value. For instance, the Samsung S90D and S95D in this guide are both 2024 TV models.\nFor more info on new display models, visit our 2025 TV roundups\nHow much should a 55-inch TV cost?\nThe best 55-inch TVs vary in price, with entry-level options starting at under $300 and high-end options costing $2,000 or more.\nIf you want a midrange 55-inch TV, you should plan to spend about $400-$700. Several great 55-inch QLED models in that price range have quantum dots, local dimming, and Mini LED backlights to deliver good contrast and peak brightness levels as high as 1,000 nits.\nShoppers who want a 55-inch OLED TV rather than a QLED will have to pay more, with prices starting at around $1,200. Though notably more expensive than their QLED counterparts, OLED TVs offer pixel-level brightness control for superior contrast and perfect black levels.\nMany 55-inch TVs get discounts throughout the year, but we see the biggest price drops during sales like Prime Day and Black Friday and around major sporting events like the Super Bowl and March Madness.\nHow far should you sit from a 55-inch 4K TV?\nThe smaller a 4K screen is, the closer you'll need to sit to the display to see the full benefits of its resolution. To see the extra detail that 4K offers over 1080p Full HD, you'll want to sit at a distance of about one to 1.5 times the size of your display. For a 55-inch 4K TV, the recommended viewing distance is between 4.6 and 6.9 feet from your TV.\nOf course, you can still sit farther away from your TV and enjoy its image quality, but the recommended distance will allow you to see the best level of detail.\nIf you need to sit even closer to your TV or just have a small room to work with, check out our guides to the best 50-inch TVs and best 43-inch TVs.\nAnd for rooms where you'd need to sit farther from your display, we recommend opting for a larger screen size to get the full benefits of 4K resolution. Check out our guides for larger display models:\nDo 55-inch TVs have good sound quality?\nEven the best 55-inch TVs tend to have mediocre built-in speakers. Audio drivers integrated into most TVs are small and often placed in areas that can lead to a muddy sound that lacks range and deep bass. For this reason, we recommend pairing your TV with a soundbar or full surround sound system to get the best audio quality for movies, TV shows, and video games.\nFor the most immersive experience, we suggest finding a system that supports Dolby Atmos, which can enable sound effects from all directions, even above your head. Performance varies depending on the model you get, but there are entry-level Atmos systems that can still provide a nice upgrade over your TV's built-in speakers.\nCheck out our various soundbar and speaker guides to see our top recommendations for different needs:\n- Best soundbars\n- Best Dolby Atmos soundbars\n- Best budget soundbars\n- Best soundbars with subwoofers\n- Best Bose soundbars\n- Best Sonos soundbars\n- Best surround sound systems\nDo you need a 55-inch TV with HDMI 2.1?\nMany of the best 55-inch TVs include HDMI 2.1 ports. This feature is most beneficial for gamers who want to enjoy high frame rate modes on a console or PC.\nAn HDMI 2.1 connection enables a TV to receive 4K video signals with higher refresh rates than the previous standard of 60Hz. High refresh rates enable smoother motion in video games that support them.\nMost HDMI 2.1 TVs support a 4K/120Hz signal, and some models can even support higher refresh rates of 144Hz or 165Hz. Both the PS5 and Xbox Series X support 4K/120Hz modes, while high-end gaming PCs can support 144Hz and 165Hz output.\nIn this guide, the Samsung S90D, TCL QM6K, Samsung S95D, and LG G5 all have HDMI 2.1 ports. Only the TCL S5 is limited to HDMI 2.0 with a 60Hz signal.\nYou'll need a compatible HDMI cable to send and receive an HDMI 2.1 signal from a source device to a TV. For top recommendations, check out our guide to the best HDMI cables.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "The best Dolby Atmos soundbars create an immersive sense of 3D audio, with sound effects spread in all directions, including above your head. This means falling rain, swooping helicopters, and soaring birds can sound like they're actually coming from above. Top Dolby Atmos soundbars accomplish this with up-firing audio drivers that bounce sound off your ceiling and back down to your ears.\nOur reviewers have been covering home audio products for over a decade and have used that experience to test the best Dolby Atmos soundbars for different needs. The Samsung HW-Q990C earns our highest recommendation. It's a powerful system that comes with a dedicated subwoofer and separate surround speakers. But if you're on a tighter budget and want something more compact, we recommend the Bose Smart Soundbar. This model still offers solid performance in a smaller, more affordable package.\nEach of our picks has been evaluated using our rigorous testing process with an aim at selecting soundbars that do the best job of showcasing the benefits of Dolby Atmos technology. And if you're still new to Atmos, scroll down to browse our list of frequently asked questions.\nEditor's note: Ryan Waniata contributed to the FAQ section in this guide.\nOur top picks for the best Dolby Atmos soundbars\nBest overall: Samsung HW-Q990C - See at Amazon\nBest budget option: Bose Smart Soundbar - See at Amazon\nBest stand-alone bar: Sonos Arc Ultra - See at Amazon\nBest soundbar alternative: Sony Bravia Theater Quad - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nThis powerful 11.1.4 soundbar system has up-firing drivers, a dedicated subwoofer, and separate rear satellite speakers. It takes up more space than smaller options, but delivers the best Dolby Atmos performance we\u2019ve heard in a system like this.\n- Class-leading Dolby Atmos and DTS:X immersion\n- Quick and snappy setup\n- Rugged, minimalist design\n- No Chromecast or HDMI 2.1 support\n- Spotify Connect quirks with iPhone\n- Only minor upgrades compared to 2022 model\nThe Samsung HW-Q990C is our pick for the best Dolby Atmos soundbar overall. This powerful, multi-piece system is the perfect showcase for what the format is all about, providing a clear step up from traditional soundbars.\nThe package has a soundbar unit, two wireless surround speakers, and a wireless subwoofer. Together, these components provide 11.1.4 audio channels, including four up-firing and four side-firing drivers to bounce effects all around your room.\nThe system performed remarkably well during our tests. We were especially impressed by how realistic certain audio effects sounded, with incredibly precise and natural movements around the soundstage. Chirping birds, gusts of wind, zooming cars, loud gunshots, and small footsteps all felt organically placed across the horizontal and vertical planes. This seamless imaging goes a long way toward making you feel as if you're truly somewhere else.\nWe were also impressed by the Q990C's versatility across genres. Sure, the system handles big action movies with the robust oomph you'd expect, but we also heard small details in dialogue when watching comedies and quiet dramas. Music sounded great in our tests, too, with a crisp midrange, deep bass, and clean treble across instruments and vocals.\nThe Q990C is packed with features, including support for Dolby Atmos' main rival, DTS:X. You also get real-time sound optimization and two HDMI inputs with 4K HDR pass-through to connect devices like a media player or gaming system. However, the HDMI ports lack 2.1 support, which means the system can't handle 120Hz signals or variable refresh rate (VRR) when paired with a console like a PS5.\nBuyers should note that Samsung sells a few updated versions of this soundbar, including the brand-new Q990F. The latest model is similar but adds support for HDMI 2.1 and includes a more compact subwoofer with a refined design. We also reviewed the Q990F, and it sounds stellar. But given the current price difference, the older Q990C remains a better value.\nRead our Samsung HW-Q990C soundbar review.\nVisit our guide to the best soundbars.\nBest budget option\nThe new Bose Smart Soundbar is a refreshed version of the brand's Smart Soundbar 600. It carries over the same design and excellent Dolby Atmos audio performance while adding an AI enhanced dialogue mode and the ability to use Bose Ultra Open Earbuds as rear speakers.\n- Dolby Atmos support with up-firing drivers\n- Clear dialogue with new AI enhancement mode\n- Compact design\n- Built-in Alexa capabilities\n- Minimal inputs\n- Doesn't support DTS\n- Lacks separate subwoofer\nBose's Smart Soundbar is an excellent fit for people who want to dip their toes into the world of Dolby Atmos on a budget. This model is a slightly refreshed version of the now-discontinued Bose Smart Soundbar 600. Its physical design is identical to its predecessor, but the updated model adds two features: an AI Dialogue Mode and support for using Bose Ultra Open Earbuds as wireless rear speakers.\nThis stand-alone soundbar provides clean and detailed audio for movies, TV shows, and music. Dialogue is clear and easy to hear, even during sequences with lots of action and loud noises. Considering its compact size, the bar is also surprisingly good at providing expansive Dolby Atmos performance.\nUnlike the similar Sonos Beam, Bose's model has dedicated up-firing drivers to bounce sound off your ceiling, creating a more effective Dolby Atmos soundstage. And though this model lacks separate rear speakers, Bose's software does a solid job of expanding the soundstage, making effects like buzzing insects and zooming starships sound as if they're extending beyond the edges of the bar's small frame.\nOf course, if you do want to add actual rear speakers, the Smart Soundbar can pair with other Bose models. This lets you create a true surround sound configuration or a wireless multi-room audio setup throughout your home.\nThere's also a feature called Bose Personal Surround Sound. This lets you connect a pair of Bose Ultra Open Earbuds to use as rear speakers. Since the Ultra Open Earbuds expose your ears, you can hear surround sound effects through them while still hearing the soundbar. It's a cool perk, but not something we consider a big selling point. Likewise, the soundbar's new AI Dialogue mode is a nice inclusion, but we rarely felt the need to activate it since the bar's default dialogue performance is so good. This mode uses a real-time machine-learning algorithm to enhance vocals without affecting other sound effects.\nThe soundbar has an HDMI eARC/ARC port for connecting to a TV, and there's an app for adjusting audio settings and streaming music from different services. Built-in mics enable Amazon Alexa, and you can use Google Assistant if you pair the bar with a separate device that supports Google's platform.\nOn the downside, the Bose Smart Soundbar doesn't come with a separate subwoofer unit, so its low-frequency oomph can't match that of bigger speakers. You can add a subwoofer with the Bose Bass Module, but that doubles the system's cost. The bar is also missing support for Dolby's primary format rival, DTS. These are cons to keep in mind, but none of them are dealbreakers considering the Smart Soundbar's overall value at this price point.\nCheck out our guides to the best budget soundbars and best Bose soundbars for more options.\nAnd visit our guide to the best Bose headphones to browse some of the brand's other top products.\nBest stand-alone model\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra carries over everything we loved about the original Arc soundbar while offering bigger bass, improved Dolby Atmos immersion, and cleaner dialogue. It's pricey, but few stand-alone soundbars can match its performance.\n- Noticeable bass increase over the previous Arc\n- Exceptional dialogue clarity\n- Detailed spatial effects with Dolby Atmos\n- Slightly sleeker design\n- More expensive than original Arc soundbar\n- Sonos app still experiencing occasional bugs and glitches\n- Optical connection requires additional adapter\n- No DTS:X support\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra is the best Dolby Atmos soundbar for anyone who wants a single-unit device that doesn't skimp on powerful bass. This model is the successor to the original Sonos Arc, and it offers even better performance with deeper low frequencies and enhanced clarity.\nPowered by the brand's Sound Motion driver, which packs a large four-motor woofer into a compact space, the Arc Ultra delivers more rumble without needing a bigger design. It's still on the large side for a soundbar, at around 46 inches wide, but we're impressed by how powerful its bass is without the need for a separate subwoofer.\nDialogue clarity and spatial audio performance are also exceptional, with side- and up-firing drivers working together to create a 9.1.4-channel experience that engulfs the listener in sound. There are more powerful stand-alone soundbars out there, like the Sennheiser Ambeo Max, but that model costs around double the price.\nLike all Sonos speakers, the Arc Ultra can become part of a larger wireless audio ecosystem. You can even connect the bar with the Sonos Ace headphones to switch between home theater and private listening seamlessly. Sonos' app also lets you pair the Arc Ultra with add-on speakers to create a multi-piece configuration. Though the company's app had major issues when it was revamped last year, most of those problems have been fixed. Our reviewer ran into some small snags with delayed speaker switching, but nothing was troublesome enough to affect our recommendation.\nLike the original Arc, the Arc Ultra supports WiFi for accessing the best music streaming services, and this time around, Sonos has added Bluetooth support. On the downside, the Arc Ultra carries over a few of its predecessor's limitations, including a lack of physical inputs, with only a single HDMI port for connecting to your TV. Unlike similarly priced rivals from Samsung and Vizio, the Arc Ultra lacks support for DTS:X, Dolby's primary 3D audio rival.\nBut even with those drawbacks, the Arc Ultra stands out as a killer stand-alone soundbar with fantastic Dolby Atmos performance.\nRead our Sonos Arc Ultra review.\nVisit our guide to the best Sonos soundbars.\nBest soundbar alternative\nThe Bravia Theater Quad is a slim four-speaker wireless audio system with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support. Though we wish it had deeper bass, the system provides an immersive sense of surround sound.\n- Immersive Dolby Atmos and DTS:X performance\n- Sleek and stylish wireless design\n- Control box has HDMI 2.1 pass-through with 4K/120Hz support\n- Lower midrange and bass lack depth\n- You still need to plug the speakers in for power\n- Lacks Chromecast streaming support\nSony's Bravia Theater Quad sound system is a cool alternative for buyers who want an immersive Dolby Atmos experience but don't want a traditional soundbar. This package consists of four thin wireless speakers, each with front and up-firing audio drivers, along with a small control box that houses the system's inputs.\nThe resulting setup offers a clean, compact, and stylish Dolby Atmos solution supporting 4.0.4 audio channels. The sleek speakers can be wall-mounted or placed on furniture using their included tabletop bases. They connect wirelessly to the control box, which pairs with your TV via HDMI. However, like most wireless home theater speakers, each unit must be plugged into a power outlet.\nThe Quad speakers deliver excellent surround sound, with smooth imaging between the left, right, and rear channels. They also offer convincing overhead Atmos effects, which help create a spacious dome of sound. Though the system doesn't include a dedicated center speaker, the Quad does support Sony's Center Sync feature, which pairs with compatible Sony displays to use the TV's speaker as a center channel.\nWe tested the Quad with a Bravia 9 4K TV with Center Sync on and off. The feature positions dialogue more naturally, but the Quad speakers also handle speech well on their own. So, while a cool perk, the Bravia Theater Quad system is still worth considering even if your TV doesn't support Center Sync.\nIn addition to Dolby Atmos, the Quad system supports Sony's 360 Reality audio format, which is used by Amazon Music Unlimited. Like Atmos, this format creates a 3D effect with music separated across front, rear, and height channels. However, while the system has Bluetooth, AirPlay 2, and Spotify Connect support, it does not support Chromecast music streaming. On the plus side, the Quad does support DTS:X and its control box has a spare HDMI 2.1 input for full 4K/120Hz pass-through.\nWhile we love the Quad's sense of immersion, the system's audio profile is a bit thin in lower ranges, lacking deep resonance. The bass sounds underwhelming and isn't as full-bodied as it is on larger soundbar units and systems that include a separate subwoofer. To address this, the Quad supports pairing with a Sony wireless subwoofer, like the SW5. We recommend going this route as it helps to fill out the system's sound. Packages are sold with a subwoofer for an extra $400 to $600.\nBut that brings us to one of the Bravia Theater Quad's other downsides: cost. Without a subwoofer, the system starts at $2,500, which makes it the most expensive option on this list. That said, the system's high-quality build, stylish aesthetics, and packed set of features make it a worthy premium option for people who want a wireless Dolby Atmos speaker setup.\nVisit our guide to the best surround sound systems.\nWhat else we considered\nThough the four picks above represent our top recommendations for the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, we also tested a couple of other models that are well worth mentioning. Here are a few other Dolby Atmos soundbars we reviewed, along with details on why they didn't quite make the cut in this guide.\nSamsung Q990F - See at Amazon\nThe Q990F is the latest iteration of Samsung's flagship soundbar. It serves as a successor to the older Q990C and Q990D, which are both still available at many online stores. This new model has a redesigned subwoofer, which is now sealed and features a more compact build to reduce rattling. It also has HDMI 2.1 support, which the Q990C is missing. However, it costs a lot more than the Q990C and offers similar performance overall. While it's still in stock for less money, the Q990C remains our top pick for most people.\nRead our Samsung Q990F soundbar review.\nSennheiser Ambeo Max - See at Amazon\nSennheiser's Amebo Max is a fantastic high-end Dolby Atmos soundbar, but it's expensive compared to similar stand-alone alternatives like Sonos' Arc Ultra. Though the Ambeo Max's beefy performance and impressive surround sound effects are top-tier, we give the Arc Ultra an edge in overall value if you're looking for a premium single-unit Atmos solution. That said, we do like that the Ambeo Max supports DTS:X, which the Arc Ultra is missing.\nRead our Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Max review.\nHow we test Dolby Atmos soundbars\nOur reviewers conducted in-depth testing to find the best Dolby Atmos soundbars. We focused on several factors, including general sound performance, virtual surround and spatial audio immersion, format support, connection options, smart features, and overall value. Our methodology is informed by over a decade of experience reviewing home entertainment products.\nWe also evaluate usability factors like ease of setup, size (does the bar block your TV screen?), and aesthetics. The best Dolby Atmos soundbars should look stylish and modern without calling undue attention. For instance, a white soundbar might look great during the day but could be distracting when the lights go down for movie night.\nFor Dolby Atmos bars, we explore a wide variety of content. We evaluate basics like dialogue clarity, as well as overhead immersion, bass, midrange, and treble registers, including how well the bar transitions between each. We also test Dolby Atmos content from various sources, including Blu-rays, streaming services, and Dolby Atmos demo discs, the latter of which help to isolate key strengths and weaknesses.\nWe live with these bars for multiple days, playing all our media on them. We also listen to a wide selection of music genres and formats from sources like WiFi, Bluetooth, and, whenever possible, analog devices like turntables. Testing is primarily conducted in a living room, but some compact systems are also tested in a smaller home office environment.\nWhat to look for in a Dolby Atmos soundbar\nMany factors make for a good Dolby Atmos soundbar, but few are more important than dedicated up-firing speaker drivers. While that may sound obvious, plenty of so-called Dolby Atmos soundbars can decode the format but don't include up-firing drivers. Without them, soundbars have difficulty delivering convincing overhead effects. With this in mind, we've only included models with true up-firing drivers in our guide to the best Dolby Atmos soundbars.\nHowever, it's not just the height element that provides good performance. Side-firing speakers and, whenever possible, separate rear satellite speakers help a soundbar deliver convincing immersion.\nYou'll also want to pay attention to connectivity and format support. Compatibility with competing 3D audio formats like DTS:X is a plus, as are conveniences like WiFi for high-resolution audio streaming. Spotify Connect and Apple AirPlay 2 support are nice perks, too, as is a dedicated mobile app to adjust sound settings and controls.\nThe best Dolby Atmos soundbars include an HDMI ARC or eARC connection. HDMI eARC is designed to provide improved bandwidth and efficiency with compatible displays (which include many of the best TVs). Spare HDMI pass-through ports are handy if you have multiple devices to connect to your TV. Gamers may want a soundbar that supports HDMI 2.1 with features like VRR and ALLM. Check out our guide to the best HDMI cables for top recommendations you can use with your soundbar and TV.\nSize is another key factor to consider since you'll want a bar that isn't too wide to fit on your media console. Check out our guide to the best TV stands for options that accommodate large bars. It's also important to remember how tall a soundbar is, since you don't want it to block the bottom of your TV. If your bar is especially tall, opting to mount your display is a good way to get around this. Visit our guide to the best TV wall mounts for top picks.\nFinally, if smart home features are important to you, you'll want to look for a bar that offers built-in support for Amazon Alexa and/or Google Assistant via onboard microphones.\nDolby Atmos soundbar FAQs\nWhat is Dolby Atmos?\nDolby Atmos is a 3D sound format that uses object-based audio mixing with height elements. It's designed to provide a sense of immersion and realism that mimics how we hear sound in real life, with effects coming from the front, side, rear, and overhead.\nIn addition to height channels, Dolby Atmos audio tracks use \"sound objects\" that allow mixers to position specific effects, like a buzzing insect or strafing jet, in a three-dimensional plane. This type of sound mixing creates a more natural sense of movement than traditional surround sound techniques.\nDolby Atmos devices are designated with three numbers in their surround sound channel listing. So, instead of a 5.1-channel surround sound system, you might see 5.1.2 or 5.1.4-channel audio (and so on). In the examples provided, the \".2\" or \".4\" represents two and four dedicated Dolby Atmos height channels, respectively.\nDolby Atmos is best represented in movie theaters, where dozens of speakers can be placed around and above the listener to reproduce sound objects across an expansive three-dimensional plane. Dolby Atmos soundbars for home theaters generally use virtual height channels or up-firing speakers.\nFor more information about Dolby Atmos, check out our complete \"What is Dolby Atmos?\" guide.\nWhat are up-firing speaker drivers?\nThe best Dolby Atmos soundbars use up-firing speaker drivers to create a sense of overhead audio. Traditional speaker drivers are positioned to beam sound forward or to the side at ear level. However, up-firing speaker drivers are angled upward. This allows them to bounce sound effects off your ceiling and then back down to your ears, simulating the effect of audio coming from above.\nWhile less effective than ceiling-mounted speakers, up-firing drivers still work well when properly utilized.\nWhere can I find Dolby Atmos movies and shows?\nDolby Atmos movies and TV shows are available through various sources. Many of the best streaming services, including Netflix, Disney Plus, and Paramount Plus, offer titles with Dolby Atmos mixes. Dolby Atmos is also a popular format on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray releases.\nIs there Dolby Atmos music?\nIn addition to movies and TV shows, Dolby Atmos audio mixing is used for some music. This enables artists to spread vocals and instruments around a 3D space to create a surround sound experience via compatible soundbars, headphones, or speaker systems.\nDolby Atmos audio tracks are available through many of the best music streaming services, like Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music, and Tidal. Only select albums are mixed in Dolby Atmos, but each service has a growing selection of new and classic tracks that take advantage of the format.\nCan I play video games in Dolby Atmos?\nYes, many modern video games can be played in Dolby Atmos. The PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One X, Xbox One S, and Windows 10/11 PCs all support Dolby Atmos through compatible soundbars.\nWhat is DTS:X?\nDTS:X is a rival audio format that uses techniques similar to Dolby Atmos, such as object-based sound with height elements for three-dimensional immersion. Unlike Dolby Atmos, titles encoded with DTS:X audio are largely confined to Blu-ray discs, and the format isn't supported by many streaming services.\nHowever, in May 2024, Disney Plus launched DTS:X support for select Marvel Cinematic Universe and concert movies. Disney calls this feature \"IMAX signature sound by DTS.\" These titles are also available in Dolby Atmos.\nMany of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars also include support for DTS:X, but this feature is not always a given. For instance, the Sonos Arc Ultra and Bose Smart Soundbar are not compatible with DTS:X audio.\nAre Dolby Atmos soundbars better than TV speakers?\nIn a word, yes. While speaker systems integrated into premium TVs have improved over the years, physics still plays a factor. Even the best 4K TVs use small speaker drivers to keep their screens thin (and prices down), while soundbars, especially well-engineered models, use larger and more efficient speakers with acoustically superior cabinets. This results in better clarity, dimension, and power.\nDo I need a subwoofer?\nPhysics is always an obstacle when reproducing powerful, high-quality sound from small speakers. This is most evident in the lower bass frequencies. Generally, the bigger the speaker, the better it can reproduce powerful and convincing bass that's also musical and agile enough to support high-quality music, movies, and TV sound.\nThat's why some soundbars include a dedicated subwoofer. Even a small separate subwoofer can usually offer better bass than a stand-alone soundbar without one. Check out our guide to the best soundbars with subwoofers for our top recommendations.\nBut if you'd rather go without a subwoofer due to space or noise concerns, we recommend looking for a larger soundbar with its own dedicated woofers built in. For instance, the Sonos Arc Ultra can reproduce convincing bass on its own. In addition, many bars allow you to add a proprietary subwoofer later if needed.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "I've been reviewing tech products for over a decade, and every year, I test the latest displays to find the best TVs for different budgets. From affordable QLED sets to premium OLEDs, stores are filled with options. But don't worry \u2014 I'm here to help make your shopping experience easier with my top four picks.\nAfter extensive hands-on testing, the Samsung S90D earns my highest recommendation as the best TV overall. This OLED offers an impressive balance between price and performance, with deep black levels that disappear into a dark room, vibrant colors, and solid smart features. However, enthusiasts who want the absolute best image quality should consider splurging on the high-end LG G5. The G5 can get even brighter than the S90D, offering bolder images with more impact.\nWhile the four TVs in this guide represent my top recommendations for most needs, several other worthwhile displays are available for shoppers who want to dive deeper or have more specialized needs. Check out our full suite of TV buying guides for more picks covering specific sizes, display types, features, and brands.\nOur top picks for the best TVs\nBest overall: Samsung S90D 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest picture quality: LG G5 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest budget model: TCL QM6K 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest midrange option: TCL QM7K 4K TV - See at Amazon\nHow we choose the best TVs\nTo select the best TV, I focus on picture quality, smart features, design, and overall value. Here's a breakdown of how I go about evaluating each.\nPicture quality: My TV testing process involves objective measurements and real-world viewing to evaluate image performance. Though test patterns are important to get an idea of what a TV is capable of, it's also essential to evaluate how a TV looks when watching actual content on a day-to-day basis. After all, most people aren't tuning into color bars and grids. Whenever possible, I spend several weeks with each TV so I can watch a wide range of material, which helps me spot inconsistencies. Image quality is judged relative to a TV's price, so expectations are different for budget-friendly models than they are for high-end options.\nSmart features: All of the best TVs sold nowadays are smart models with internet connectivity. There are a few different smart TV platforms, and they all have certain pros and cons. I spend time using the built-in interface on every TV I test, evaluating navigation speed, digital assistant performance, app selection, and organization. I also pay attention to how obtrusive ads are and play around with any unique features to see if they're a selling point.\nDesign: Some TVs are built a bit better than others, with higher-end materials and more attractive designs. I don't hold cheaper construction against more budget-friendly models, like the TCL QM6K, but I keep an eye out for major issues. Expectations are higher for pricier displays, though, so I look for premium touches like thin screens, metal finishes, and sturdy stands. It's also nice when TVs include stands with multiple height options and remotes with perks like backlit keys.\nValue: The best TVs offer exceptional value, with an excellent balance between price and performance. If a TV is expensive, like the LG G5, it needs to justify that cost with image capabilities that you can't get on more affordable options. Likewise, when testing budget-friendly and midrange TVs, I look for models that include features that many similarly priced competitors lack.\nBest overall\nThe S90D is our favorite TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class.\n- Excellent peak brightness for a midrange OLED\n- High color volume with quantum dot technology\n- Wide viewing angles so picture doesn't degrade when sitting off center\n- Smart TV interface is OK but not the best\n- Issue with update notifications\n- Dolby Vision isn't supported\nThe Samsung S90D hits just the right sweet spot between price and performance. The 65-inch model is often on sale for around $1,500 or less and offers image quality that beats every other TV in its price range. It also boasts a healthy assortment of smart features and a handsome design.\nThe S90D uses a QD-OLED screen, which allows it to control contrast on a pixel basis so black levels are truly black and bright highlights pop with pinpoint precision. Even the most expensive LED and QLED TVs struggle in this area. The S90D also uses quantum dot technology to provide a brighter and wider range of colors than competing midrange OLEDs from LG. Sony is the only other brand that sells an OLED with quantum dots, but it costs around double the price of the S90D.\nIn my testing, I measured a peak brightness of around 1,200 nits, which makes the S90D an excellent TV for watching high-dynamic-range (HDR) content. Many HDR videos are mastered with 1,000 nits in mind, so the S90D is capable of showcasing HDR highlights (like explosions) with the intensity that filmmakers intended. This all translates to gorgeous image quality with bold colors and sharp details.\nAnother area where the S90D excels is viewing angles. Many LED and QLED sets look great from a centered position, but their image quality washes out when you sit to the side of the screen. The S90D offers consistent picture performance even if you sit at an angle, so it's a great fit for all kinds of rooms. The TV is also an excellent gaming display since it supports a 144Hz refresh rate with a PC or 120Hz with a PS5, Xbox Series X, or Nintendo Switch 2. This enables smoother gameplay with compatible titles.\nSamsung's smart TV interface even includes access to the Xbox app, which allows Game Pass subscribers to play Xbox games through the cloud. Samsung is one of the few TV brands to support this app. The TV's interface also offers a great assortment of streaming apps, but I do wish the navigation speed were more consistent. I also ran into an issue where the TV would display annoying notifications for various terms of service updates while watching content. I disabled notifications in the menu, but this didn't stop them. Ultimately, this was a small inconvenience, and it's something that's likely been fixed with firmware.\nIt's also worth mentioning that, like all Samsung TVs, the S90D lacks Dolby Vision support. Dolby Vision can provide a slightly better HDR image when watching supported content through services like Disney Plus and Netflix, but its benefits are subtle on upper-midrange TVs like the S90D. With that in mind, I don't consider Dolby Vision a must-have on a TV in this class. Check out our HDR TV guide for more information.\nThe S90D is available in many sizes, from 42 to 83 inches. However, keep in mind that the 42-, 48-, and 83-inch S90D models don't use quantum dots. They still offer excellent image quality, but their color performance can't match that of the 55-, 65-, and 77-inch sizes.\nSamsung also sells a 2025 version of this TV, the S90F, that can get a little brighter but costs a lot more. The S90F will likely come down in price a lot as the year goes on, but for now, the cheaper S90D is a better buy.\nBest picture quality\nThe G5 is LG's flagship OLED TV for 2025. It's one of the brightest OLED TVs we've ever seen, delivering high-end image quality and an elegant design that can hang flush on your wall.\n- Industry-leading OLED brightness\n- Deep black levels with an infinite contrast ratio\n- Wide off-axis viewing\n- High 165Hz refresh rate with a PC\n- Expensive, even compared to other top OLEDs\n- Minor banding in isolated sequences\n- Pedestal stand is not included\n- Some issues with voice search that resolved over time\nThe G5 is the most impressive high-end TV I've tested, besting my previous pick in this category, the Sony A95L. Though Sony's premium OLED is still a fantastic display, the G5 offers a brighter image with more impact while maintaining the pixel-perfect contrast that OLEDs are celebrated for.\nUsing an industry standard 10% test pattern with the TV set in its most accurate setting, I measured a peak brightness of around 2,400. That's a record for an OLED and more than 1,000 nits brighter than many midrange models, like the Samsung S90D.\nOf course, test patterns can only reveal so much. What's actually important is how the TV looks when watching real-world content. And in a word, the G5 is stunning. High-brightness HDR movies like \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" and \"Aquaman\" pop from the screen in ways I've never seen on an OLED, taking full advantage of the G5's nearly unmatched combination of intense peak highlights and infinite contrast. Viewing angles are wide as well, so you can sit to the side of the screen without any major shifts in contrast and color. Gamers even get a high 165Hz refresh rate when paired with a PC.\nBut while incredible on many fronts, the G5 isn't quite perfect \u2014 no display is. The TV initially had issues with banding/posterization (blocky rather than smooth gradations of color and dark shades) when watching certain types of HDR content. In April and June, LG released firmware updates to minimize this.\nThrough weeks of testing, banding occurred so rarely that I don't consider it to be a major issue. Those highly sensitive to spotting posterization may want to consider other high-end TVs that are less prone to it (like the Samsung S95F). But when evaluating the TV's image quality as a whole, the G5 has the best picture performance I've seen.\nThe G5's webOS smart TV interface works well enough, but it isn't my favorite platform. The homepage is a bit barebones in design and features shopping recommendations too prominently. But you still get access to all of the best streaming services, and general navigation and usability are solid. I did run into some errors with hands-free voice search, but it works better when using the remote.\nThe TV has a handsome build with sturdy materials and a thin profile. It comes with a flush wall mount that lets you hang the panel up with virtually no gap. But the tradeoff is that the display doesn't include a traditional stand at all. If wall mounting isn't doable in your room, you'll have to purchase a separate stand.\nThere are competing OLEDs that handle some of the G5's flaws a bit better, but they fall short in other areas, like peak brightness. That said, two TVs could surpass the G5 in overall picture quality: Sony's recently released Bravia 8 II and Panasonic's new Z95B. I'll be testing both soon and will update this guide with details on how they stack up.\nRead our LG G5 4K TV review.\nBest budget model\nThe QM6K is an excellent entry-level Mini LED TV with solid contrast, vibrant colors, and decent black levels. However, its HDR brightness capabilities are limited compared to step-up models.\n- Solid HDR performance for an entry-level Mini LED TV\n- Local dimming enhances contrast with minimal blooming\n- Google TV navigation is quick and responsive\n- Brightness is limited compared to midrange and high-end QLEDs\n- Viewing angles are improved over older models but are still narrow\nThe QM6K is TCL's top entry-level QLED TV for 2025. When the display launched earlier this year, its list price was a bit high, but recent discounts have made it the best TV on a budget. The 65-inch size is often on sale for $650 or less, which is an excellent value for a TV in this class.\nWhat sets the QM6K apart from most similarly priced TVs is its use of a Mini LED backlight with local dimming and quantum dots. These features are usually reserved for pricier sets, and they allow the QM6K to produce higher contrast and better colors than most of its rivals.\nWhen reviewing the TV, I was impressed by its backlight control, which produced minimal blooming (halos around bright objects). It also offered an overall solid HDR image with great saturation. However, as a budget-friendly TV, the QM6K has some limitations. The display's black levels are a little lighter than what I've seen on more expensive QLEDs, and the panel's brightness is limited compared to midrange and high-end sets.\nI measured a peak of 557 nits on a 10% HDR test pattern and about 736 nits on a larger 50% test pattern. Those are decent numbers for an entry-level Mini LED TV, but they're notably lower than the levels offered by my other picks in this guide. As a result, bright highlights in some movies and TV shows don't have as much impact as they're supposed to. And though viewing angles have been improved over last year's Q65 series, they're still much narrower than they are on an OLED TV.\nOn the plus side, the QM6K has received a big gaming upgrade over its predecessor, as this model supports up to a 144Hz refresh rate. This makes the QM6K one of the cheapest TVs that can display 4K/120Hz signals from a PS5 or Xbox Series X, which enables smoother motion when playing certain games.\nThe QM6K's Google TV interface is easy to use and snappy to navigate, with only minor hiccups. When reviewing older TCL TVs, I encountered lots of little glitches here and there, but the QM6K was completely free from bugs during several weeks of testing.\nAll things considered, the QM6K is the perfect starter home theater TV for anyone who wants a budget set that still offers worthwhile HDR performance.\nRead our TCL QM6K 4K TV review.\nBest midrange option\nThe TCL QM7K is an excellent midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED backlight delivers high brightness, and it has better contrast control and wider viewing angles than last year's model.\n- Excellent HDR brightness for a midrange TV\n- Fantastic backlight control with virtually no blooming\n- Improved viewing angles over last year's model\n- Supports up to a 144Hz refresh rate for PC gamers\n- Black levels aren't quite as deep as we've seen on other Mini LED models\n- Pedestal stand's depth could be an issue for soundbar placement\n- Though decent for a QLED, viewing angles still can't match those of an OLED\nTCL's QM7K is the brand's latest midrange QLED, and it's one of the best TVs in its price range. This model replaces last year's QM7, which is occasionally a bit cheaper but is now hard to find in stock. Though both displays offer similar performance, the QM7K has a few improvements in backlight control and viewing angles.\nLike the company's cheaper QM6K, the QM7K uses a Mini LED backlight with quantum dots and local dimming. It also supports up to a 144Hz refresh rate and uses the Google TV operating system for snappy access to tons of streaming services. But what sets this pricier model apart from its cheaper sibling is its peak brightness.\nThe QM7K can get more than twice as bright as the QM6K. I measured a peak of around 1,800 nits on a 10% test pattern. That's more than enough to give specular highlights (like explosions) ample intensity in HDR movies and TV shows. That said, the QM7K isn't much brighter than its predecessor from 2024, the QM7. But the QM7K does have other upgrades up its sleeve.\nTCL has implemented an improved backlighting system in this year's model, and the results are impressive. While I noticed some light fluctuations and patchy brightness in dark scenes when reviewing last year's QM7, the QM7K is almost entirely free from these kinds of flaws. Likewise, halos around bright objects are almost nonexistent. Similarly, viewing angles have been notably improved. This is still a QLED, so color and contrast do wash out from an extreme angle, but you can veer further from the center without the TV's quality degrading as much.\nHowever, black levels aren't quite as deep as I've seen on some pricier QLEDs, and the QM7K's backlight still can't match the pixel-level precision of an OLED. But given its place in the market, the QM7K is an excellent midrange TV option. The 65-inch model is often on sale for $900, which makes it ideal for people who want a bright QLED TV that's under $1,000.\nThe best TVs compared\nHere's a rundown of key specifications for each of our top TV picks to offer an overview of how they compare.\n| Samsung S90D | LG G5 | TCL QM6K | TCL QM7K | |\n| Typical price (65 inch) | $1,500 | $3,300 | $650 | $900 |\n| Panel type | QD-OLED | OLED | QLED | QLED |\n| Backlight | N/A | N/A | Mini LED with local dimming | Mini LED with local dimming |\n| HDR support | HDR10, HDR10+, HLG | HDR10, Dolby Vision, HLG | HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, HLG | HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, HLG |\n| Peak brightness | 1,200 nits | 2,400 nits | 560 nits | 1,800 nits |\n| Smart TV OS | Tizen | webOS | Google TV | Google TV |\n| HDMI | Four HDMI 2.1 | Four HDMI 2.1 | Two HDMI 2.1, two HDMI 2.0 | Two HDMI 2.1, two HDMI 2.0 |\n| Refresh rate | Up to 144Hz | Up to 165Hz | Up to 144Hz | Up to 144Hz |\nCheck out our other TV buying guides\nOur guide to the best TVs is designed to keep things simple, with our four top picks categorized by overall performance.

Here's a rundown of some other notable TVs we tested, along with details on why they didn't make our top four picks.\nSamsung S90F 4K TV - See at Amazon\nThe S90F is the 2025 version of Samsung's S90D, which remains our top pick for the best TV overall. The S90F can get a bit brighter, which enables slightly better HDR performance. Otherwise, both TVs offer very similar image quality and features. Since the S90D is a lot less expensive, it's the better value of the two. But that could change over the coming months as the S90D sells out and the S90F drops in price.\nRead our Samsung S90F review.\nLG G4 OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nLG's G4 is an incredible high-end TV with stunning contrast. However, LG's new G5 offers a substantial brightness upgrade. The G4 is still a great alternative for people who want a less expensive premium OLED, but the G5 is a better buy for enthusiasts who crave the best image quality.\nRead our LG G4 review.\nSamsung S95F OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nThe S95F is another excellent high-end TV alternative to the G5. It can't get quite as bright, but it's capable of offering slightly richer colors in some content. However, the S95F uses a divisive matte screen rather than a typical glossy screen. The matte panel does a fantastic job of combating reflections, but it causes black levels to look elevated in a bright room. Ultimately, we prefer how the G5 preserves inky black levels. But if you have trouble with ambient light, the S95F could be a better fit. Samsung also sells an older, less expensive version of this TV, the S95D, that offers similar performance but is a little dimmer.\nRead our Samsung S95F review and Samsung S95D review.\nLG C4 OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nThe C4 is LG's midrange OLED model from 2024, and it's an excellent TV. In fact, its performance is nearly neck and neck with our top pick in this guide, the Samsung S90D. However, the C4 doesn't use quantum dots while the 55-, 65-, and 77-inch S90D models do. This feature gives those S90D sizes slightly better color capabilities. Since both TVs are often sold for the same price, we give an edge to the S90D. LG also sells a 2025 version of the C4, called the C5, and though it gets a bit brighter, it costs more and still can't quite match the S90D's color performance.\nRead our LG C4 review and LG C5 review.\nTCL QM8K QLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nTCL's QM8K is the brand's top QLED model for 2025. It delivers excellent performance that's on par with many high-end sets from pricier brands. In particular, the QM8K has impressive brightness and better contrast control than similar QLEDs. However, overall image quality is still beaten by cheaper OLED models, like the Samsung S90D. Likewise, less expensive QLEDs, like the TCL QM7K, offer better overall value for most needs. That said, if you want a high-performance TV for a bright room, the QM8K is a great choice.\nRead our TCL QM8K review.\nRoku Pro Series QLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nRoku's Pro Series TV is an excellent midrange QLED with image quality that's similar to the TCL QM7K. We ultimately give an edge to the QM7K when it comes to picture performance for the money, but we do prefer Roku's smart TV interface over the QM7K's Google TV system.\nRead our Roku Pro Series 4K TV review.\nVizio Quantum Pro QLED 4K TV - See at Walmart\nThe Quantum Pro is a decent midrange QLED with superior viewing angles than most competitors in this class offer. However, its contrast is lacking compared to similarly priced options from TCL and Hisense.\nRead our Vizio Quantum Pro 4K TV review.\nAmazon Fire TV Omni Mini LED - See at Amazon\nThe Omni Mini LED is Amazon's new flagship TV. This model uses a Mini LED backlight to provide higher contrast and brightness than the brand's cheaper offerings. It stacks up well against other TVs in its class, like the QM7K, but its list price is a bit high, and we prefer other smart TV systems over Amazon's Fire TV interface.\nRead our Amazon Fire TV Omni Mini LED review.\nAmazon Fire TV Omni QLED - See at Amazon\nThe Omni QLED is Amazon's midrange smart TV model. It offers convenient hands-free Alexa control, but its picture quality is beaten by similarly priced sets like the Roku Plus Series.\nRead our Amazon Fire TV Omni QLED review.\nAmazon Fire TV Omni - See at Amazon\nAmazon's standard Omni series 4K TV delivers mediocre picture performance for the money. If the TV's Alexa integration is a selling point, we recommend getting the Omni QLED instead since it delivers much better image quality for nearly the same price.\nRead our Amazon Fire TV Omni review.\nHow we test TVs\nTo select the best TVs, our team relied on hands-on testing informed by more than a decade of experience covering home entertainment products. We evaluate displays across a series of testing factors, including image clarity, contrast, high-dynamic-range capabilities, peak brightness, color range, viewing angles, smart TV features, and overall value.\nWe use a colorimeter to measure a TV's brightness and test patterns from the Spears & Munsil UHD HDR Benchmark 4K Blu-ray disc to evaluate other objective display capabilities.\nWe also rely on an assortment of clips from movies and TV shows to get a better feel for how a TV actually performs under regular use. Clips are selected to focus on sequences that help demonstrate a TV's black-level quality, highlight performance, color range, and clarity. We also watch a mix of native 4K resolution (Ultra HD), high definition (HD), and standard definition (SD) content to see how a TV handles various resolutions through streaming, cable, and Blu-ray players. Viewing is conducted in both bright and dark rooms.\nSmart TV features and navigation are also tested to determine how long it takes for apps to load and how reliable overall stability is. Voice search and digital assistant performance are taken into account as well, along with other extra perks like ambient modes, smart home control, and game streaming support.\nFor more details on our review process, check out our breakdown of how we test tech products.\nWhat to look for in a TV\nIf you buy a TV in 2025, it will likely be branded as one of four primary display types: OLED, QD-OLED, QLED, or LED. Though performance varies depending on which specific model you buy, each tech has its own strengths and weaknesses.\nBelow is a rundown of the pros and cons of each, along with guidance on different smart TV platforms and size options. For a more detailed breakdown of TV panel technology, check out our QLED vs. OLED comparison.\nWhat is an OLED TV?\nAn OLED (organic light-emitting diode) TV uses self-illuminating pixel technology to display its images without a backlight.\nWho it's best for: OLED TVs are best for people who want high-end picture performance in a space that doesn't let in a ton of ambient light. Though they still look good in most living rooms, some models can be too dim for areas filled with direct sunlight.\nPros:\n- Infinite contrast ratio\n- True black levels\n- Wide viewing angles\n- Expanded color gamut\n- Overall performance is similar across different models\nCons:\n- Peak brightness is typically dimmer than top QD-OLED or QLED TVs*\n- Color volume can't match TVs with quantum dots\n- Some risk of burn-in in extreme cases\n- Limited sizes and budget tiers to choose from\n*Some newer OLED TVs use MLA or four-stack panel technology, enabling them to match top QD-OLED TVs in peak brightness.\nWhat is a QD-OLED TV?\nA QD-OLED TV is a type of OLED TV that adds a filter of quantum dots to its panel to enable better color and brightness performance.\nWho it's best for: QD-OLED TVs are great for people who want the absolute best picture quality. Since they're brighter than regular OLEDs, they're suited for home theaters and average living rooms alike, and they deliver a bit more HDR punch in highlights.\nPros:\n- Infinite contrast ratio\n- True black levels\n- Wide viewing angles\n- Expanded color gamut\n- Brighter than a regular OLED\n- Better color volume than a standard OLED\nCons:\n- Peak brightness still can't match top QLED TVs\n- Some risk of burn-in in extreme cases\n- Limited sizes and budget tiers to choose from\nWhat is a QLED TV?\nA QLED is a TV that uses an LCD (liquid crystal display) panel with an LED (light-emitting diode) or Mini LED backlight and a filter of quantum dots. QLED TVs may or may not include local dimming, which enables contrast control over specific LEDs on the screen. To get the best performance on a QLED TV, you should look for models with local dimming and a Mini LED backlight.\nWho it's best for: QLED TVs are good for people who favor high brightness to get the best performance in rooms that let in a lot of outside light. High-end models can also deliver excellent overall picture performance with vibrant HDR highlights, but we still prefer OLED technology for the best quality in a home theater.\nPros:\n- Top models have industry-leading brightness and color volume\n- Models with local dimming and Mini LEDs can provide great contrast\n- No risk of burn-in\n- Lots of sizes and budget tiers to choose from\nCons:\n- Even top Mini LED models can't match the contrast of an OLED\n- Black levels are lacking on models without local dimming\n- Viewing angles are typically mediocre\n- Performance varies a lot across different models and budget tiers\nWhat is an LED TV?\nAn LED TV uses LCD panel technology with an LED backlight. Backlights can either be direct or edge-lit. The main difference between an LED and a QLED TV is that LED TVs don't use quantum dots. Most TVs branded as LED are budget-focused models without local dimming or wide color support, but some exceptions exist.\nWho it's best for: LED TVs are best suited for budget shoppers. Most of these displays only offer basic image quality and lack the color and contrast performance you'd get on a QLED or OLED.\nPros:\n- No risk of burn-in\n- Lots of sizes and affordable options\nCons:\n- Typically lacks wide color support\n- Contrast is mediocre without local dimming\n- Edge-lit backlights can lead to uneven black levels\n- Viewing angles are usually mediocre\nWhat size TV is best?\nTVs come in various sizes, with options as small as 24 inches and as large as 100 inches or more. When deciding what size TV to get, you should consider a few factors, including the display's resolution, the size of the room it's in, how close you plan to sit, and how much money you're willing to spend.\nTypically, bigger screen sizes are pricier than comparable models in smaller sizes, and you'll need to have a big enough TV stand or wall with a mount to fit the TV you buy. Certain sizes are also better suited for certain resolutions.\nFor instance, HD resolution screens are acceptable for smaller sizes, around 43 inches or under. In that range, it's difficult to see the benefits of a higher resolution from an average viewing distance. On sets 50 inches and larger, we recommend opting for a 4K set to get the best image quality, especially if you plan to sit close to your display. Meanwhile, the subtle benefits of 8K resolution are best appreciated on extra-large TVs that are 75 inches or more.\nMany companies use 65 inches as their flagship size to showcase their best TV models, and we think this size offers a great balance between big-screen immersion and value without becoming too big for most living rooms.\nWhat smart TV interfaces does each brand use?\nPretty much any new TV you buy in 2025 will be a smart TV with built-in support for accessing various streaming services. However, different brands use different smart TV operating systems (OS).\nHere's a breakdown of popular smart TV platforms and the brands that use them:\n- Android TV: Older models from Sony, TCL, and Hisense\n- Fire TV: Amazon, Panasonic, Toshiba, Insignia, Pioneer, Hisense\n- Google TV: Sony, TCL, Hisense\n- Roku TV: Roku, TCL, Hisense\n- SmartCast: Vizio\n- Tizen: Samsung\n- webOS: LG\nAlthough the selection of apps across each OS is slightly different, they all offer access to the most popular streaming services. They also deliver similar features, but the style of navigation, personalization options, and extra perks vary.\nWe generally like Roku's interface the best since it's the most straightforward and reliable. However, its design is a little outdated compared to other platforms that offer a more modern, content-focused style.\nWhich smart TV OS is best for your needs depends on personal preference and whether you're already plugged into a smart home ecosystem. For instance, a Google TV or Fire TV will pair more seamlessly with existing Google or Amazon accounts and devices you might already own.\nIf you don't like the interface built into your TV, we recommend checking out our guide to the best streaming devices. You can choose a stand-alone streaming device with whatever OS you prefer. Stand-alone streaming players also tend to offer snappier performance than built-in smart TV interfaces. Reliable Roku and Fire TV devices are frequently on sale for as little as $20.\nDo you need a TV with HDMI 2.1?\nMany midrange and high-end TVs feature inputs that use the HDMI 2.1 specification. HDMI 2.1 ports can display signals at up to 4K/120Hz (some TVs also enable 144Hz or 165Hz with a PC), along with support for variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM). These features are primarily geared toward gamers since they enable smoother gameplay while minimizing lag and screen tearing.\nIn order to enable HDMI 2.1 features, every device in your entertainment chain must support HDMI 2.1, including your TV and gaming console/PC. Likewise, if you use video passthrough on a soundbar or AV receiver to connect your gaming system to your TV, that audio device must also support HDMI 2.1.\nFinally, your HDMI cables must be rated for 48Gbps to ensure they are able to transmit the full bandwidth needed for HDMI 2.1. Check out our guide to the best HDMI cables for our top recommendations.\nTV FAQs\nShould you buy a 2024 or 2025 TV model?\nNew 2025 TV models are now available from every major brand. That said, it's important to remember that 2024 TV models will remain available to purchase for the better part of the year, and they cost substantially less than their 2025 counterparts. With that in mind, we continue to recommend some 2024 TV models as long as they remain a better value and are readily in stock.\nYou can learn more about new models in our 2025 TV roundups:\nWhen is the best time to buy a TV on sale?\nIf you're shopping for a new TV, the best time to purchase a display on sale is during big deals events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or Amazon Prime Day. TVs often drop to their lowest prices during these sales. You can also find big discounts in the weeks leading up to sports events like the Super Bowl and March Madness, and sales tied to holidays like the Fourth of July and Memorial Day.\nWhat TV brands should you consider?\nThere are many TV brands to choose from, but some are better for certain needs than others. Sony, Samsung, LG, and Panasonic are the cream of the crop if you're looking for the latest display technologies and the best build quality. However, their midrange and entry-level TVs are slightly overpriced compared to similar options from competing brands. If you want a high-end OLED or QLED TV, the above brands should be your first choice, but you can often get more bang for your buck from other companies.\nFor instance, Hisense, TCL, and Vizio all sell affordable mid-tier QLED TVs that offer similar, if not better, picture quality than comparable options from Sony, LG, and Samsung. You'll still get better build quality and fancier design perks from those more expensive brands, but these value-geared companies deliver advanced features like quantum dots and local dimming without breaking the bank.\nRoku and Amazon have also launched midrange and entry-level TVs to compete with Hisense, Vizio, and TCL. Their top models are solid buys if you can snag them on sale, but otherwise, you can find options with slightly better specs for about the same price from other companies.\nBuyers who just want a no-frills entry-level LED TV should also consider budget brands like Insignia and Toshiba. Both companies sell inexpensive 4K and HDTVs that use the Amazon Fire TV interface, and they tend to get heavily discounted during sales like Prime Day and Black Friday. Generally, we recommend paying a bit more to get a TV from one of the other brands we've already mentioned, but these displays are fine for casual viewing, especially if you want a smaller screen for a bedroom or dorm.\nDo Hisense and TCL QLED TVs use quantum dots?\nHisense and TCL sell several TV models advertised as QLED TVs, which means they should use a technology called quantum dots. Quantum dots refer to nanocrystals used in a display panel to help produce expanded color performance. However, two class-action lawsuits have been filed by individuals in the US who claim certain TCL and Hisense QLED models are either missing quantum dots or have such a small amount that they don't offer their proposed benefits.\nIn response, Hisense shared this statement with Business Insider. \"Hisense stands by the high quality of its products and is confident that the complaint is without merit. Our products have been verified by tests conducted by an independent third-party lab that are consistent with our product claims. Per company policy, we will refrain from commenting further on this legal matter.\"\nTCL also shared a statement with Business Insider. \"TCL stands behind our high-performance lineup, which provides uncompromised color accuracy. TCL has definitive substantiation for the claims made regarding its QLED televisions and will respond to the litigation in due course. We remain committed to our customers and believe in the premium quality and superior value of our products. In the context of the ongoing litigation, TCL will validate that our industry-leading technologies meet or exceed the high bar that TV viewers have come to expect from us.\"\nWhile buyers should be aware of these lawsuits, no rulings have been made, and these claims do not affect our current reviews. It's also important to note that there isn't an industry-wide QLED certification process that defines exactly what quantum dot specifications are needed to qualify a display as a \"QLED TV.\" Until more is revealed, our recommendations stand. All of the TCL and Hisense QLED TVs we include in our buying guides delivered good image quality in our tests, and their performance represents a great value within their price range.\nDo TVs offer good sound quality?\nGenerally speaking, TVs offer mediocre sound quality. To keep TVs thin and affordable, manufacturers use small speaker drivers, often positioned in areas with poor performance. This leads to weak sound quality with muddy dialogue, flat dynamics, and a lack of bass.\nWe recommend purchasing a soundbar or a full surround sound system to get the best sound quality with your TV. Check out our soundbar and speaker guides to see our top recommendations:\n- Best soundbars\n- Best budget soundbars\n- Best Dolby Atmos soundbars\n- Best soundbars with subwoofers\n- Best Bose soundbars\n- Best surround sound systems\nFor more details on the latest advancements in immersive surround sound technology, check out our guide to Dolby Atmos.\nCan I watch free local channels on my TV?\nMost TVs include integrated digital tuners that can receive free over-the-air broadcasts when paired with an antenna and a coaxial cable. Reliable digital antennas can cost as little as $20. Check out our guide to the best indoor TV antennas to see our top recommendations.\nThe exact number of channels you'll be able to pick up relies heavily on where you live, but so long as you're within a certain distance from local broadcast towers, you should be able to watch channels like ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox. You can check the available channels in your community through the AntennaWeb tool.\nIf you live in an area with poor antenna reception but still want an alternative to cable that provides access to popular channels, check out our guide to the best live TV streaming services.\nShould I be worried about burn-in on my TV?\nIf you leave a static image on your TV for too long, some displays are susceptible to an issue called burn-in. When burn-in occurs, a faint outline of an image gets permanently stuck on your display. Thankfully, burn-in is rare on modern TVs, so most people don't need to worry about it. However, there are some considerations you should be aware of.\nFirst and foremost, OLED is the only current TV technology prone to burn-in. Though LCD-based TVs, like QLED and LED, are not 100% immune to burn-in, cases are so rare that they're not considered to be at risk like an OLED TV. But while OLED shoppers should be mindful of this risk, all OLED TVs have built-in features designed to prevent burn-in, including pixel-shift modes and pixel-refreshers.\nWebsites like Rtings have done long-term burn-in tests with various OLED models. Though their results prove that burn-in can technically occur on even top OLED TVs, their tests reveal that it's not really an issue for people with regular viewing habits. Burn-in only happens in extreme situations, like if you just watch the same cable channel with the same logo at the bottom of the screen all day.\nI've had an LG CX OLED TV in my own home theater setup for over three years. I stream various services, watch cable TV, and play video games (with plenty of static elements) regularly, and the TV shows no signs of burn-in. Unless you plan to stay tuned to the same cable news channel 24/7, we don't think burn-in should be a factor when deciding between an OLED TV and another display type.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "Shopping for a new TV can be daunting, especially if you're looking for an inexpensive display that doesn't cut corners. Plenty of TVs cost under $500, but very few are truly worthwhile. To help you find the right balance between value and performance, our experts have put together a carefully curated list of the four best TVs under $500. Our picks range from 50 to 70 inches, so all spaces are accounted for.\nWe've focused on selecting models that deliver the best performance available at each size while still meeting our price requirements. For instance, people who want a solid 65-inch TV for under $500 should check out the TCL Q65. The Q65 offers better color performance than most competing displays in its price range. Meanwhile, the Roku Plus Series is our favorite 55-inch TV for under $500. Thanks to its local dimming capabilities, the Plus Series has higher contrast than most competing TVs that cost the same.\nOur recommendations for the best TVs under $500 are based on a combination of hands-on testing and research informed by more than a decade of experience covering tech products.\nOur top picks for the best TVs under $500\nBest 50-inch: Amazon Omni QLED - See at Amazon\nBest 55-inch: Roku Plus Series - See at Amazon\nBest 65-inch: TCL Q65 - See at Amazon\nBest 70-inch: Insignia F50 - See at Best Buy\nBest 50-inch\nThough we think the larger versions of Amazon's Omni QLED TV are overpriced for what you get, the 50-inch model offers an excellent balance between cost and performance. It has handy Alexa features and is one of the only 50-inch TVs available with local dimming, which enables solid contrast performance.\n- One of the few 50-inch QLED models with local dimming\n- Lots of Alexa smart features, including hands-free voice control\n- VRR and ALLM gaming capabilities\n- Narrow viewing angles\n- Mediocre upscaling\n- Panel limited to 60Hz rather than 120Hz\nThe Amazon Omni QLED is the best TV under $500 for anyone who wants a 50-inch display that doesn't skimp on features. This model replaces our previous pick in this category, the Hisense U6HF. The U6HF remains a great value, but the 50-inch model appears to be discontinued and is no longer listed on Amazon's site. With that in mind, the Omni QLED is a good alternative with similar performance.\nAs its name implies, the Omni QLED uses a QLED panel, which enables the display to produce a wide range of colors. The TV can deliver decent brightness for its budget-friendly class, with a peak of around 500 nits. The Omni QLED is also one of the few 50-inch TV models to offer local dimming. This feature allows the display to control its light output across specific zones on its screen, giving the Omni QLED better contrast performance than many cheaper 50-inch TVs.\nHowever, this model uses regular-sized LEDs in its backlight rather than the Mini LEDs used on pricier models like the Samsung QN90D. As a result, black levels can't get as uniformly deep as they do on more advanced TVs. We also noticed some backlight fluctuations when bright scenes transitioned to darker ones in our tests. And like all our picks in this guide, the Omni QLED has narrow viewing angles and a 60Hz refresh rate. This means its colors will fade if you sit to the side of the display, and it can't support 120Hz gaming.\nBut despite those drawbacks, the Omni QLED has better overall image quality than a lot of other 50-inch TVs in this price range. Most competitors this size don't have local dimming at all, and many have a more limited range of colors. The TV also comes with a handy Alexa remote and has the added perk of hands-free voice control.\nRead our Amazon Omni QLED review.\nCheck out all our picks for the best 50-inch TVs and the best Fire TVs.\nBest 55-inch\nThe Roku Plus Series is the brand's budget-friendly QLED display. The TV has local dimming and quantum dots to provide solid contrast, color, and brightness capabilities. For under $500, the 55-inch model is a great value for anyone who wants a capable smart TV.\n- Good HDR brightness for the money\n- Convenient Roku smarts\n- Handy voice remote and app\n- Local dimming delivers solid black levels for this class\n- Picture quality suffers at off-center view\n- Missing motion processing options\n- Lacks Mini LEDs for more precise contrast control\n- Limited to 60Hz panel without variable refresh rate\nBuyers who want the best 55-inch TV for under $500 should check out the Roku Plus Series. It delivers good image quality for the money and boasts our favorite smart TV interface.\nLike the 50-inch Omni QLED, the 55-inch Roku Plus Series uses a QLED panel with local dimming to provide expanded colors and high contrast. However, the Plus Series has more zones to work with, and it can get a little brighter.\nDuring our tests, high-dynamic range (HDR) content came through with solid pop, making this a great budget TV for movie-watching. There are a few shortcomings, like poor viewing angles and a 60Hz screen, but those limitations are common on most sets under $500. Considering its low price, the Plus Series' image performance excels where it counts most.\nWe also like this model's Roku OS (operating system) more than rival interfaces, like Google TV and Fire TV. While those platforms place a heavy emphasis on content recommendations, Roku takes a simpler approach. The streamlined homepage focuses squarely on presenting all your TV apps upfront and center with large icons that make it easy to organize everything and jump right into your favorite services.\nThe TV's remote has a few nice perks as well, including a built-in battery that recharges over USB. The remote also supports hands-free voice search (with a dedicated mute switch) and has a tiny integrated speaker that can emit a chime if you ever misplace it.\nThe 55-inch Roku Plus Series has a full retail price of just under $500, but it's often on sale for even less. In this price range, buyers should also consider Hisense's 55-inch U6N. That model has a list price of over $500, but it's often discounted. The U6N has similar features but boasts a Mini LED backlight, which gives it better contrast control than the Plus Series. However, we still prefer the Roku OS over the Google TV interface that the Hisense uses.\nRead our Roku Plus Series TV review.\nCheck out all our picks for the best Roku TVs and best budget TVs.\nBest 65-inch\nThe TCL Q65 is the brand's entry-level QLED TV model. It's missing local dimming, so contrast performance isn't as good as pricier options, but it has quantum dots to enable a wide range of colors and decent HDR brightness for the money.\n- Wide color support with quantum dots\n- Solid HDR brightness for the money\n- Black levels and contrast control can't match those of TV's with local dimming\n- Display's 60Hz refresh rate isn't the best for gaming\n- Mediocre viewing angles\nAs one might expect, bigger TVs tend to cost more than smaller ones. This is especially true if you want advanced image quality perks like local dimming and Mini LEDs. However, there are some cheap 65-inch TVs that still manage to offer wide color support, and the TCL Q65 is the best value. The Q65 technically carries a list price of $550, but it's often on sale for under $400.\nThe Q65 is available with the Google TV OS or Fire TV OS, which should suffice for most streaming needs. Those systems aren't as streamlined as the Roku interface, but they offer access to many of the same services and integrate seamlessly with an existing Google or Amazon account. Buyers who prefer a different interface can always buy a separate media player, like a Roku Ultra or Apple TV. Check out our guide to the best streaming devices for top recommendations.\nThough it doesn't have local dimming like our 55- and 50-inch picks, the 65-inch Q65 can produce the expanded color gamut needed for HDR material, which is a rare perk at this price. Its full-screen peak brightness is also decent, but since it lacks local dimming, the TV isn't able to brighten or darken specific zones on its panel. This means it's not able to control its brightness precisely enough to create deep black levels or intense specular highlights (like explosions).\nSo, while the Q65 can offer good HDR color performance, its HDR contrast capabilities are lacking. To get better contrast performance, we recommend stepping up to the 65-inch Hisense U6N, which usually costs between $500 and $750. But if you have a hard budget you don't want to go beyond, the TCL Q65 is the best TV under $500 at this size.\nFor recommendations that cost more than $500, check out our full guide to the best 65-inch TVs.\nBest 70-inch\nThis Insignia LED TV is about as basic as 4K displays get, but it's one of the few 70-inch models available for less than $500. It isn't geared toward home theater fans, but casual viewers who just want a cheap big-screen set should be satisfied.\n- Affordable price for this size\n- Fire TV OS offers access to popular streaming apps\n- Included remote supports Alexa voice search\n- Contrast and black levels are poor compared to pricier sets\n- Lacks quantum dots for wide color\n- Dimmer picture than step-up models\nIt's rare to find 70-inch TVs that sell for under $500. In fact, this entry-level Insignia model is one of the very few options that fits that bill. When viewed in this specific context, it's a solid value-forward display.\nTo be clear, you get what you pay for here, as this model makes some big compromises to keep its cost down. As such, we only recommend this for casual buyers who prioritize a large screen and low price above all else. The F50 replaces our previous pick in this category, the F30. The F30 is no longer available, but the F50 carries very similar specifications. It has a standard 4K LED screen that omits any extra bells and whistles like Mini LEDs, quantum dots, or local dimming.\nAs a result, the F50's brightness, color, and contrast capabilities are limited. The TV can't control its light output across specific areas, so black levels will appear a bit elevated in a dark room. Though the F50 can technically process high-dynamic-range (HDR) videos, it doesn't have the ability to get bright or dark enough to really showcase the benefits of HDR content. It also can't display the full range of colors that a QLED TV can.\nBut that doesn't mean the F50 is a bad TV. As an entry-level LED set, it can still handle 4K standard-dynamic-range (SDR) streaming material just fine, as well as typical live TV broadcasts. Thanks to its built-in Amazon Fire TV operating system, it also offers a large selection of video streaming apps, and it supports Alexa voice search through its remote.\nBuyers should note that Insignia previously offered an F50 QLED model that implemented quantum dots for better color performance, but that edition is no longer sold. This new F50 only has a regular LED screen.\nUltimately, home theater fans are better off stepping down a size and paying a little more for something like TCL's Q65 QLED TV, which can deliver a nice upgrade in color. But as a casual channel-surfing display, the F50 is an affordable 70-inch option.\nHow we test TVs under $500\nOur guide to the best TVs under $500 was compiled using a combination of hands-on testing and research. Our team has been covering TVs and home entertainment products for more than a decade, and we use that expertise to inform our criteria and testing parameters.\nTo review displays, we examine a TV's clarity, HDR brightness, contrast capabilities, black-level performance, viewing angles, upscaling quality, smart TV interface speed, and extra features like voice control. To measure brightness, we use test patterns from the Spears & Muncil Benchmark 4K Blu-ray disc with an X-Rite iDisplay Plus colorimeter.\nBut while test patterns are useful for establishing certain performance thresholds, we find that real-world content is the best barometer for seeing how a TV performs during day-to-day viewing. We use a curated selection of scenes from various movies and TV shows, focusing on sequences that put each TV's shadow detail, specular highlight, and color performance to the test. We also use a mix of sources, including 4K Blu-rays, cable TV, and streaming videos. Contenders for the best TV under $500 are evaluated in both light and dark rooms to get a sense of day and nighttime viewing performance.\nFor more details on our review methodology, check out our breakdown of how we test tech products.\nFAQs\nAre 75-inch or larger TVs available for under $500?\nThough some models do dip below $500 during limited-time TV sales, 75-inch and larger TVs typically cost over $500. For that reason, we have not included any displays bigger than 70 inches in our guide to the best TVs under $500.\nIf you're looking for recommendations for those larger sizes, visit our guides to the best 75-inch TVs, best 85-inch TVs, and best 100-inch TVs.\nAre OLED TVs available for under $500?\nYou may have noticed that we haven't included any OLED displays in our guide to the best TVs under $500. The reason? There simply aren't any OLED TVs currently available for that amount.\nIn the past, smaller versions of LG's A-series OLEDs went on sale for around $500. But those models are no longer sold, and even when they were, we never saw them dip below the $500 mark.\nRight now, the most affordable OLED TV is the LG 48-inch B4, which sometimes goes on sale for $550. For more OLED recommendations, check out our guide to the best OLED TVs. And head over to our QLED vs. OLED comparison for details on the pros and cons of each panel type.\nShould you buy a soundbar to pair with a TV?\nMost TVs under $500 come with mediocre built-in speakers that lack bass, depth, and clarity. For better audio quality, it's worth investing in a dedicated soundbar. Reliable models can be found for as little as $100, and even these entry-level options can provide better sound than a typical TV can on its own. For the most immersive performance, we recommend soundbars with Dolby Atmos support, but those models cost more.\nVisit our soundbar and speaker guides to browse our top picks:\n- Best soundbars\n- Best budget soundbars\n- Best soundbars with subwoofers\n- Best Dolby Atmos soundbars\n- Best Sonos soundbars\n- Best Bose soundbars\n- Best surround sound systems\nAre TVs under $500 worth it?\nYes, the best TVs under $500 are worth the money, but you should be aware of certain performance limitations that are common when shopping for TVs in this price range.\nFirst, you'll need to settle on a TV with a QLED or LED panel rather than an OLED. Second, you should expect peak brightness for models in this price range to top out at around 600 nits. Third, you should focus on models that are 70 inches or smaller. And finally, there are certain companies that tend to offer better overall value in this class.\nAdvanced picture quality features like quantum dots, local dimming, and even Mini LED backlights can be found on TVs for under $500, but these models are usually sold by value-oriented brands like Hisense, TCL, Vizio, Roku, and Amazon.\nIn our experience, quality control from these companies isn't on the same level as that from more expensive brands like Samsung, Sony, and LG. But none of the slight inconveniences we've encountered are troublesome enough to prevent us from recommending their displays.\nSamsung, Sony, and LG also sell TVs for under $500, but their offerings provide worse image quality than similarly priced models from the competition. However, if you're willing to spend substantially more than $500, you can find excellent high-end TVs from those brands with better features and build quality than cheaper options.\nFor more TV recommendations across budgets and sizes, check out our other TV guides:"

      "text": "I review new TVs every year, and Samsung is consistently one of the top brands I recommend. The company sells a wide range of reliable displays across sizes and budgets, but some models are better than others. The best Samsung TVs provide an excellent balance between picture quality and smart features.\nTo help narrow your search, I've put together a list of the best Samsung TVs you can buy. My top pick is the Samsung S90D, which uses an OLED screen with quantum dots to deliver high contrast and bright colors. But if you're on a tighter budget, you should consider the entry-level Samsung U8000F. Its picture quality is limited, but it's an affordable smart TV that works well for casual viewing.\nMy picks for the best Samsung TVs are informed by more than a decade's worth of experience covering home entertainment products. Top recommendations also include colorful QLED displays and an anti-glare OLED with high-end image quality.\nOur top picks for the best Samsung TVs\nBest overall: Samsung S90D OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest on a budget: Samsung U8000F LED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest high-end set: Samsung S95F OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest QLED display: Samsung QN90D QLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest for your wall: Samsung LS03D Frame QLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nThe S90D is our favorite TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class.\n- Excellent peak brightness for a midrange OLED\n- High color volume with quantum dot technology\n- Wide viewing angles so picture doesn't degrade when sitting off center\n- Smart TV interface is OK but not the best\n- Issue with update notifications\n- Dolby Vision isn't supported\nWhen looking at overall value for your money, the S90D is the best Samsung TV I've tested. In fact, it's my pick for the best TV from any brand.\nThanks to its QD-OLED panel, the S90D delivers an infinite contrast ratio and better color performance than similarly priced OLEDs from LG and Sony. It also boasts a high 144Hz refresh rate when paired with a PC to enable smooth gameplay.\nLike all Samsung TVs, the display supports the HDR10 and HDR10+ high-dynamic-range (HDR) formats, and it looks stunning when playing compatible movies and TV shows. Highlights pop off the screen, and the S90D produces deeper, more precise black levels than any of Samsung's QLED displays. It also has wider viewing angles than a QLED, so you can sit to the side of the TV without any notable loss in image quality.\nThe S90D is also bright for a midrange OLED. I measured a peak of around 1,240 nits, which beats the older S90C by around 200 nits. This makes it an excellent fit for movie-watching in a dark home theater and casual TV viewing in a typical living room.\nHowever, the S90D's brightness still can't match the 2,000-nit max of Samsung's top QLEDs, like the QN90D, or its pricier S95F OLED. It also has a glossy screen rather than the anti-glare matte screen found on some of Samsung's other TVs. Higher brightness and a matte screen are both beneficial for viewers who struggle with reflections in their rooms. That said, I prefer glossy screens for most uses since this type of panel is better at preserving contrast.\nAll things considered, the S90D is the best Samsung TV for most people with typical viewing needs. Its image quality is nearly on par with sets that cost $1,000 more, and it often gets fantastic discounts during sales.\nBuyers should note that Samsung sells a new 2025 edition of this display, the S90F. The new model offers some improvements in performance, but it costs a lot more. With that in mind, the S90D remains the better value.\nNote: Samsung's 42- 48-, and 83-inch S90D models do not feature quantum dots, so their screens can't match the color performance of other sizes.\nBest on a budget\nThe U8000F is Samsung's latest entry-level 4K TV for 2025. It delivers decent performance for casual viewing needs, but its color, contrast, and brightness capabilities are severely limited compared to the brand's pricier QLED and OLED models.\n- Inexpensive\n- Lots of screen sizes available\n- Doesn't support local dimming so contrast is limited\n- Lacks quantum dots so it can't match the color performance of QLED TVs\n- The panel's 60Hz refresh rate isn't ideal for gaming\nWhile many of Samsung's high-end and midrange TVs deliver good value, its budget options tend to be lacking compared to similar TVs from Roku, TCL, and Hisense. But if you prefer the Samsung brand, the U8000F is the company's best entry-level option.\nThe U8000F is a new model for 2025, replacing my previous pick in this category, the CU7000, which is now hard to find in stock. The U8000F uses a regular LCD panel with a standard LED backlight. This is fine for casual viewing needs, but the TV is missing all of the step-up picture quality features you'd find on Samsung's QLED and OLED models.\nMost notably, the U8000F doesn't use quantum dots and lacks local dimming. As a result, the TV offers a more restricted range of colors, and its black levels aren't as deep or uniform across the screen. This is also one of the dimmest TVs in Samsung's lineup. It can technically process HDR10 and HDR10+ signals, but it can't get bright enough or control its contrast precisely enough to actually showcase the benefits of HDR.\nStill, the U8000F is capable of full 4K-resolution playback for a crisp, sharp image. It plays standard-dynamic-range (SDR) content in both 4K and high definition just fine, so HD cable channels and all of the best live TV streaming services look solid.\nThis is a decent entry-level model for casual viewers who just want a basic smart TV and don't care about paying extra for better picture quality. But keep in mind, if you're willing to go outside Samsung's lineup, you can find TVs with better contrast and color performance, like the Roku Plus Series, for around the same price.\nFor more cheap display recommendations from other brands, check out our guides to the best budget TVs and best TVs under $500.\nBest high-end set\nThe S95F is Samsung's latest flagship 4K TV. It's one of the top high-end displays of 2025 and uses an advanced QD-OLED panel with an anti-glare matte screen.\n- Nearly unmatched brightness and color volume for an OLED\n- Infinite contrast ratio and wide viewing angles\n- Glare-free screen greatly reduces reflections\n- High 165Hz refresh rate enables smooth gameplay\n- The matte screen elevates black levels in a bright room\n- Some new AI features have key limitations\n- Launch price is high compared to current deal prices on last year's model\nSamsung's S95F OLED is the brand's most impressive TV yet. That said, it's also one of its most expensive. Like the cheaper S90D, this OLED delivers an infinite contrast ratio and wide viewing angles. But this step-up model can get much brighter, enabling even more HDR impact when watching high-brightness movies and TV shows.\nI measured a peak of around 2,170 nits using the TV's most accurate HDR picture mode. That's almost 1,000 nits more than the S90D, which is a substantial bump. In fact, the S95F is one of the brightest OLED TVs available, second only to the LG G5.\nThe S95F uses Samsung's latest anti-glare matte screen, which could be a pro or con depending on your viewing needs. This feature significantly reduces reflections in rooms with ambient light, making it a perfect fit for people who struggle with glare in their space. Sports fans, in particular, should consider the S95F, as it's great for watching games during the day.\nHowever, this glare-free coating does have one negative side effect: it causes black levels to look a bit elevated in a bright room. As a result, dark scenes lose some of the inkiness that OLED TVs are known for. To be clear, black levels are still perfect in a dark room, but perceived contrast takes a hit when watching dim scenes with the lights on.\nUltimately, whether you favor a reflective or matte screen comes down to personal preference, but if you find glare to be a constant headache, the benefits of the S95F's screen outweigh its drawbacks.\nThe S95F is also a great gaming TV. It's one of the few models to support up to a 165Hz refresh rate for smoother motion when hooked up to a PC. I also like the TV's design, which has a thin profile that's less than an inch thick. It achieves this by using a separate One Connect Box to house all its HDMI ports, something that the brand's cheaper models lack.\nRead our full Samsung S95F 4K TV review.\nBest QLED display\nSamsung's premium QN90D QLED offers impressive brightness thanks to its Mini LED backlight. But while it can get brighter than many OLED sets, its contrast control isn't as precise.\n- High brightness with impressive HDR performance\n- Excellent color volume with quantum dots\n- Viewing angles are solid for a QLED\n- Some blooming and vignetting in certain scenes\n- Lacks Dolby Vision capabilities\nThough I favor Samsung's OLED TVs for their superior black-level performance, the company's QLEDs are still worthwhile options. My favorite is the QN90D, which is an especially good pick if you want a bright TV that costs less than the flagship S95F OLED.\nThe QN90D is part of Samsung's \"Neo QLED\" series, which means it uses quantum dots for expanded color and a Mini LED backlight with local dimming for improved contrast. The TV's Mini LEDs enable it to produce solid black levels with good brightness control.\nHowever, the QN90D's dimming isn't perfect, and it has flaws you won't see on an OLED. Some blooming (small halos around bright objects) and vignetting (darkening around the edges of bright objects) cropped up in a few scenes during my evaluation. For instance, one test sequence that featured candles burning against a black background had noticeable halos around the flames.\nBut on the plus side, the QN90D offers excellent brightness. I measured a peak of around 2,040 nits. This makes the TV well-suited for bright rooms and allows HDR content to look bold and punchy. The QN90D's viewing angles are also solid, but still not quite as wide as they are on an OLED, like the S90D or S95F.\nSamsung also sells a 2025 version of this TV, the QN90F, which offers some small improvements. When I tested the QN90F, it delivered a slightly higher peak brightness of 2,130 nits and produced fewer halos during my dimming tests. It also adds Samsung's glare-free tech, which greatly reduces screen reflections at the expense of raising black levels in a bright room. That said, the QN90F costs more. Given the current price difference, I recommend the QN90D as the better buy.\nBest for your wall\nSamsung's Frame TV can be mounted flush against your wall like a hanging piece of art. It also features a matte screen to make it look more like canvas, and you can purchase optional magnetic frame bezels in different colors and designs.\n- Art-frame bezel design with matte-finish screen\n- Mounts flush on wall\n- QLED panel for wide color support\n- Limited brightness and contrast compared to most competing QLED TVs\n- You're paying for design over picture quality\nSamsung's Frame TV is an excellent choice for anyone planning to mount their display on a wall. This unique TV is built to look like a piece of art hanging in your living room.\nThe Frame has a black border by default, but you can pay extra to get different bezel colors for the exact picture-frame look you want. Options include white, brown, teak, red, beige, and more. The add-on bezels magnetically snap onto the display for simple installation.\nLike Samsung's S95 series, the Frame TV uses an external One Connect Box to house its video ports, which enables the panel to maintain a one-inch profile from top to bottom. When paired with the included slim-fit wall mount, the TV can be hung flush on your wall, just like a framed work of art.\nThe display uses a matte finish that's similar but not identical to the one used on Samsung's flagship S95 series OLEDs. This finish helps prevent reflections and gives the screen a more canvas-like appearance. When you're not watching TV, you can have it enter \"Art Mode,\" which will cycle through various paintings and photographs you can pull from Samsung's Art Store (subscription required) or a USB drive. A built-in motion sensor can even toggle the Art Mode to activate when people are in the room.\nWhile the Frame's unique design is its main selling point, the TV also benefits from using a QLED panel, albeit without all the bells and whistles that Samsung's best QLEDs have. The Frame can't hit the same peak brightness levels as my high-end picks, and it lacks local dimming for precise contrast control.\nI don't recommend this TV for anyone focused on picture quality, but it still delivers a nice enough image for casual viewing. The Frame is really geared toward people who want the best Samsung TV that can double as an attractive design piece to hang in a living room, and in that sense, it excels.\nThe model highlighted here is the 2024 version of the Frame TV. Samsung does sell a newer 2025 model, but it costs more and doesn't offer a big upgrade. For now, the 2024 model is a better buy.\nNote: The 32-inch Frame TV features a Full-HD 1080p screen rather than a 4K panel.\nOther Samsung TVs we reviewed\nThough the five models highlighted above represent our picks for the best Samsung TVs, we also tested other worthwhile models from the brand. Here's a roundup of some other Samsung TVs we reviewed, along with details on why they didn't quite make it in as top picks.\nSamsung S90F 4K TV - See at Amazon\nThe S90F is Samsung's new 2025 edition of the S90D. This model offers a modest increase in brightness, which results in slightly punchier HDR quality when watching certain programs. But it's otherwise a very similar TV. Since the S90D is still available for less money, it remains our pick for the best Samsung TV overall. However, the S90F is likely to take that spot later this year once the S90D sells out.\nRead our Samsung S90F review.\nSamsung Frame Pro 4K TV - See at Amazon\nSamsung now offers a step-up version of its Frame TV, called the Frame Pro. The Pro adds an edge-lit Mini LED backlight for improved picture quality with higher contrast and brightness. It also has a wireless connect box so you can pair your media devices without any cables dangling from the display. Ultimately, we still give the standard Frame an edge in overall value, but the Pro has its benefits for certain use cases.\nRead our Samsung Frame Pro TV review.\nSamsung S95D 4K TV - See at Amazon\nThe S95D is an older version of Samsung's S95F TV, which is our pick for the brand's top high-end display. This 2024 model is also an excellent premium TV, but it can't get as bright. If you're an enthusiast after the best picture quality Samsung offers, the S95F is worth splurging on. But if you want to save some cash, the S95D remains a good alternative.\nRead our Samsung S95D 4K TV review.\nHow we test Samsung TVs\nOur picks for the best Samsung TVs are based on a combination of hands-on testing and research informed by more than a decade's worth of experience covering the home entertainment market. Our testing consists of several key evaluation points that we use to judge a TV's overall performance and value, including HDR quality, brightness, color gamut coverage, contrast, local dimming performance (if applicable), viewing angles, navigation speed, design, and price.\nWhen measuring a TV's brightness and evaluating other technical picture quality attributes, we use a colorimeter with test patterns on the Spears & Munsil UHD HDR Benchmark 4K Blu-ray disc.\nHowever, test patterns only show one part of the equation, so we rely on real-world content and day-to-day viewing to see how Samsung's TVs look when watching typical programs in bright and dark rooms. Our demo material is selected to feature scenes that show off black levels, highlights, color fidelity, and fine details with 4K Ultra HD, high definition (HD), and standard definition (SD) material. We also use various sources, including streaming services, cable channels, and a 4K Blu-ray player.\nGeneral usability and design are also considered. We get a feel for living with a TV for a few weeks while using its basic functions and smart TV features. If a TV has slow navigation or is missing key functions, that impacts our assessment, but we place expectations for each model within the context of its price range.\nFor more details on our testing methodology, check out our breakdown of how we review tech products.\nSamsung TV FAQs\nShould you buy a Samsung 2025 or 2024 TV model?\nSamsung's 2025 TV models are now shipping. The collection includes new OLED and QLED sets with brighter images, faster refresh rates, and bigger screen sizes. The brand is also emphasizing AI-powered smart features and audio-visual optimizations that it calls \"Vision AI.\" You can learn more in our full roundup of Samsung 2025 OLED and QLED TV prices and features.\nHowever, Samsung's 2024 TV models will continue to be available for most of the year, and they're a lot less expensive than their 2025 counterparts. With that in mind, we'll continue to recommend certain 2024 TVs while they remain the best value. For instance, the 2024 S90D, QN90D, and Frame TV all remain picks in this guide.\nFor more details on this year's new displays, visit our roundup of top TVs revealed at CES 2025 and our breakdown of 2025 TV trends.\nWhat kind of TVs does Samsung make?\nSamsung's TV lineup can be divided into three categories: OLED, QLED, and Crystal UHD.\nSamsung's OLED TVs use organic light-emitting diode panels with self-illuminating pixels. This means they don't need a backlight and can produce perfect black levels and an infinite contrast ratio. Most Samsung OLEDs also use quantum dots, which give them an expanded color range. On the downside, in extreme cases, OLED TVs are susceptible to burn-in, and even the best models can't get quite as bright as top QLED TVs.\nSamsung's QLED TVs use LCD (liquid crystal display) panels with LED backlights and quantum dots. They can't produce the pixel-level contrast and deep black levels of an OLED, but the best models can get brighter, and there's no risk of burn-in. Top Samsung QLEDs, branded as Neo QLED, also incorporate Mini LEDs with full-array local dimming, which enables them to get a lot closer to the contrast performance of an OLED.\nFor more details on how OLED and QLED TVs stack up, check out our full QLED vs. OLED comparison.\nFinally, Samsung's Crystal UHD TVs use entry-level LCD panels with LED backlights. These displays lack the color, brightness, and contrast capabilities of Samsung's OLED and QLED sets. This series is meant for casual buyers who just want a basic smart TV and don't care about advanced picture quality.\nAll of Samsung's displays are available in multiple sizes, often ranging from as small as 32 inches to as large as 100 inches. For TV recommendations at various screen sizes, check out our size-specific guides:\nDoes Samsung sell 8K TVs?\nYes, Samsung sells 8K TV models, and we've previously included 8K options in this guide. But given the current price and performance differences between the brand's top 4K and 8K offerings, we recommend that most buyers just stick with 4K.\nThough Samsung's 8K TVs are impressive displays, the benefits of 8K resolution are extremely subtle. Beyond a few YouTube clips, there is no 8K content available, so most of what you watch will just be 4K and HD sources that get upscaled. With upscaling, an extra-large 8K TV can look a bit sharper than a 4K model if you sit close to your screen, but the difference is too small to justify the price premium of an 8K TV. You can simply get better overall performance for your money by opting for one of Samsung's high-end 4K models.\nHowever, if you're dead set on buying an 8K TV, the Samsung QN900D and QN990F are the company's top options. We tested both TVs, and they deliver excellent image quality. The primary difference between them is that the QN990F has a new anti-glare screen. However, we still think most people are better off with Samsung's cheaper 4K OLEDs, as they provide better contrast performance despite their lower resolutions. High contrast offers a more noticeable benefit in overall image quality than 8K resolution.\nAre Samsung TVs better than LG TVs?\nSamsung and LG both make some of our favorite TVs, and it's difficult to say that one brand is better than the other. Instead, they both have pros and cons depending on your needs and which specific TV models you're looking at.\nRegarding LCD-based models, the best Samsung TVs are branded as QLED, while LG's are branded as QNED. There are some differences in the panel technology each uses, but they're similar in overall capabilities. Samsung's high-end QLEDs, however, have traditionally had an edge over LG's best QNEDs thanks to their higher brightness and better local dimming. Though this remains true in 2025, recent LG models, like the QNED 90T, are getting closer to matching the performance of Samsung's QLEDs.\nBoth companies also sell some of the best OLED TVs, and the competition gets tougher here. Most of Samsung's OLEDs use quantum dots, which give them an edge in brightness and color performance over LG's midrange OLEDs. But LG's top OLEDs, the G4 and G5, use other technologies to boost peak brightness, enabling them to achieve similar or higher levels than Samsung's top OLEDs. LG also sells OLEDs across more sizes, with options for more budgets.\nNo matter what type of TV you get, it's important to remember that LG's mid- and high-end displays support Dolby Vision, while Samsung's support the competing HDR10+ format. Both high-dynamic-range formats offer similar capabilities, with scene-by-scene guidance for displaying contrast and color, but Dolby Vision is used on more streaming services and 4K Blu-ray discs.\nYou can find LG recommendations in our guide to the best LG TVs.\nWhat smart TV interface does Samsung use?\nSamsung uses a proprietary smart TV interface built using the Tizen operating system (OS). Unlike other interfaces such as Roku OS, Android TV, Fire TV, or Google TV, Samsung's Tizen platform is not available on smart TV models or streaming devices from other brands.\nFor many years, Samsung's Tizen OS featured a pop-up screen that displayed apps across a horizontal bar at the bottom of the screen, but Samsung updated its interface in 2022. Now, Samsung smart TVs use a full-screen homepage that organizes your favorite services and presents you with content recommendations. There's also a Gaming Hub section that lets you access cloud services like Xbox Game Pass, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna.\nSamsung's smart TV interface works well across its lineup of TVs and offers access to all of the best streaming services, but it's not the smoothest OS we've used. Even high-end models, like the QN90D and S90D, are prone to hiccups and slight lag when navigating menus and content libraries.\nMost buyers should be satisfied with Samsung's smart TV performance, and no major services or features are missing. But if you prefer a different interface with slightly snappier navigation, we recommend checking out our guide to the best streaming devices for other options.\nFor display recommendations that use other systems, check out our full guide to the best smart TVs.\nAre Samsung TVs prone to burn-in?\nSamsung's QLED and Crystal UHD TVs are not susceptible to burn-in, but the company's OLED models can experience this issue in extreme cases. Burn-in occurs if a static image is left on an OLED screen for hours on end \u2014 the CNN or ESPN logo in the corner, for example \u2014 which can cause a faint, ghostly image to get stuck on the screen.\nThough Samsung OLED buyers should be aware of this risk, OLED TVs have built-in measures to prevent burn-in, including automatic pixel-shift modes and pixel-refreshers. Publications like Rtings have done long-term tests with many OLED TVs, including Samsung's models, and while results do show that burn-in is possible, the tests show that people with regular viewing habits don't need to worry about it.\nAs long as you don't plan on watching cable news channels all day, burn-in shouldn't be a factor when deciding whether to buy an OLED TV. But if you tend to watch just one cable channel for several hours daily, you're better off getting one of Samsung's QLED or Crystal UHD models so you don't have to think twice about burn-in.\nDo Samsung TVs support Dolby Vision?\nEven the best Samsung TVs lack Dolby Vision support. However, they do support a similar format called HDR10+. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ are both dynamic metadata high-dynamic-range formats. This means that compatible content can be encoded with specific instructions that tell your TV how to handle HDR contrast and color on a scene-by-scene basis.\nThis is in contrast to the standard HDR10 format, a static metadata format that can only include one set of instructions for an entire video rather than scene-by-scene details. In practice, Dolby Vision and HDR10+ can deliver a more refined HDR experience with video quality that better matches the specific capabilities of your TV. However, these benefits over standard HDR10 are often very subtle.\nThough Dolby Vision and HDR10+ offer similar capabilities, Dolby Vision is supported on more streaming services and 4K Blu-ray discs, which makes it the more desirable of the two formats.\nCheck out our HDR TV guide for more information about how these formats stack up.\nAre matte screens better than glossy ones?\nMost of Samsung's TVs use a glossy or semi-glossy screen, but the company has started to release more models that use a matte finish instead. They both have pros and cons that make them better suited for specific types of viewers.\nGlossy screens are great at preserving high contrast and deep black levels, but they're prone to mirror-like reflections. This can be a problem if your room has lots of lights or windows. On the other hand, Samsung's anti-glare matte screens significantly reduce reflections. On the downside, the matte filter causes black levels to look a bit elevated and washed out in a bright room.\nWhich style is right for you depends on your personal preferences and viewing needs. We tend to favor glossy screens for most uses since high contrast is a big part of preserving good picture quality, but matte screens are better for spaces where you can't control ambient light.\nNotable Samsung TVs that use matte screens include the S95D, S95F, QN90F, and Frame models.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "I've been testing audio products for over a decade, and in that time, Bose has cemented itself as one of the top brands I recommend. The company sells several home theater devices across budgets, including multiple soundbar models. The best Bose soundbars are ideal for buyers who want immersive audio but can't fit a large speaker system in their room.\nTo help you find the right model for your needs, I tested every Bose soundbar on the market. My top recommendation is the Bose Smart Soundbar. This midrange offering delivers full, clear audio but is still small enough to fit on most TV stands. It also supports Dolby Atmos to bounce sound effects off your ceiling and has Amazon Alexa built in. But if you want a more budget-friendly option that's even more compact, I suggest the Bose TV Speaker. That model doesn't support Dolby Atmos, but it costs less and still delivers solid audio quality.\nBelow, you can find a full breakdown of all the best Bose soundbars I've reviewed. I also included a subwoofer recommendation if you want to expand your system with more bass.\nOur top picks for the best Bose soundbars\nBest overall: Bose Smart Soundbar - See at Amazon\nBest high-end: Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar - See at Amazon\nBest for smaller spaces: Bose TV Speaker - See at Amazon\nBest add-on: Bose Bass Module 500 - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nThe new Bose Smart Soundbar is a refreshed version of the brand's Smart Soundbar 600. It carries over the same design and excellent Dolby Atmos audio performance while adding an AI enhanced dialogue mode and the ability to use Bose Ultra Open Earbuds as rear speakers.\n- Dolby Atmos support with up-firing drivers\n- Clear dialogue with new AI enhancement mode\n- Compact design\n- Built-in Alexa capabilities\n- Minimal inputs\n- Doesn't support DTS\n- Lacks separate subwoofer\nThe Bose Smart Soundbar isn't the brand's most advanced speaker, but it balances cost and performance the best. It offers rich sound, an extensive set of features, and Dolby Atmos support \u2014 all at a midrange price. This enables it to serve as a great audio upgrade for even the best TVs.\nThe Smart Soundbar is a refresh of Bose's now-discontinued Smart Soundbar 600. It's physically the same device, but it has two new software features: AI Dialogue Mode and the ability to use Bose Ultra Open Earbuds as rear speakers.\nThe Smart Soundbar can play 5.1.2 channels of audio via its 3.0.2 speaker configuration to spread effects all around your room. This driver array includes two Dolby Atmos up-firing speakers to bounce audio off your ceiling. I was impressed by the Smart Soundbar's wide sense of sound when watching movies and listening to music. In a moderate-sized living room, its volume is more than enough to encompass viewers and keep them engaged. Even if the content you're streaming doesn't support Dolby Atmos, Bose's TrueSpace processing can up-mix stereo and regular 5.1 surround sound to create a height effect.\nThe Smart Soundbar includes Bose's AI Dialogue Mode, which uses a real-time machine-learning algorithm to boost vocals separate from background effects like explosions. I was thoroughly impressed by this Dialogue Mode and ended up leaving it on most of the time. One of the primary reasons people upgrade to a soundbar is to improve the quality of speech when watching TV, and this solution is excellent.\nAnother cool perk is Bose's Personal Surround Sound feature. You can connect a pair of Bose Ultra Open Earbuds to use as rear speakers with the soundbar. I tested this while watching \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" and it worked flawlessly. The Ultra Open Earbuds left my ears exposed to hear the soundbar but accentuated the finer surrounding details of laser blasts, engine noise, and explosions. If you happen to already own Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, this is an interesting bonus, but it's not compelling enough to be the sole reason to buy those earbuds.\nBeyond playback from your TV via HDMI or optical cable, the Smart Soundbar offers plenty of wireless connection options with WiFi, Bluetooth, Apple AirPlay, Google Chromecast, and Spotify Connect, all supported. You can use Bose's mobile app to play music or send songs to the soundbar directly from one of your other devices. Amazon Alexa is also built in for voice control and digital assistant functionality, extending the soundbar's usefulness beyond just being tethered to a TV.\nFor more top picks from other brands, check out our guide to all the best soundbars.\nBest high-end\nThis is Bose's flagship soundbar and it delivers immersive Dolby Atmos audio with 5.1.2 channels of sound. It also comes with a headset that allows you to calibrate the bar's audio to suit your specific room.\n- Full and immersive Dolby Atmos sound\n- Supports room calibration with included headset\n- Black and white color options\n- Similar features available on the cheaper Bose Smart Soundbar\n- Doesn't support DTS:X\nThe Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar is the best option for movie lovers looking for big sound, robust up-firing Dolby Atmos performance, and a full suite of features. It expands on the Smart Soundbar's foundation with even more drivers and a larger footprint.\nThis model delivers 5.1.2 channels of audio via nine integrated speakers and a center tweeter. I found performance to be deep and expansive, with a wide sound field that seems to extend beyond the bar's physical size. The results are impressive and rival the home theater quality of similar Dolby Atmos soundbars like the Sonos Arc.\nThe Bose Ultra Soundbar also sets itself apart from the brand's cheaper models through the addition of ADAPTiQ calibration. This feature adjusts the sound profile to your specific room. This makes the biggest impact in oddly shaped spaces or ones with uncommon furniture placements. Be aware that you need to use the included wired microphone headset to complete the calibration process.\nFor people all in on Bose, the Ultra Soundbar also supports private listening with the company's headphones and earbuds. These audio devices can be grouped together for late-night binges. Like the Smart Soundbar model, the Ultra Soundbar features Bose's AI Dialogue Mode to enhance voices if you have trouble hearing them over other sounds.\nThe Ultra can also play music over WiFi, Bluetooth, AirPlay, Chromecast, and Spotify Connect. Amazon Alexa support is built in for voice control, making this a home theater soundbar and smart speaker in one. Unlike the company's other soundbars, which only come in black, the Ultra is also available in a white color option, so if aesthetics are important, the Ultra offers a bit more variety.\nBest for smaller spaces\nThis budget-friendly soundbar is ideal for casual TV viewing and its compact size is perfect for smaller rooms and apartments.\n- Solid audio despite compact size\n- Supports Bluetooth streaming\n- Includes remote\n- Limited light indicators for bass boost or volume control\n- No WiFi\n- Doesn't include HDMI cable\n- No Dolby Atmos support\nThe Bose TV Speaker is the brand's most compact and affordable soundbar. It's under two feet in length and just over two inches tall, which makes it the best Bose soundbar for smaller spaces like an apartment. Despite knowing its dimensions ahead of time, I was still a bit shocked at how compact the unit looked in person.\nThough it delivers less rumble and a lower max volume than Bose's larger models, don't let the TV Speaker's small size deceive you. This compact two-channel soundbar is still capable of producing compelling stereo audio via three speaker drivers.\nThough the TV Speaker doesn't have the same bass level or dynamic range as other Bose soundbars, it still delivered a huge upgrade to the speakers built into my smart TV. During testing, the dialogue was clearer, and the overall sound was more evenly balanced. The TV Speaker compares favorably to the Sonos Ray, a similar option that earned a spot in our guide to the best budget soundbars. The TV Speaker is a good alternative to the Ray for people who prefer the Bose brand.\nThat said, this isn't the best Bose soundbar to pick if you crave advanced features and big sound for larger spaces. There's no Dolby Atmos support or WiFI connectivity, for instance. However, it does support Bluetooth, so you can use it to play music from your phone. But be aware: While the TV Speaker does support connecting to a display via HDMI ARC, it doesn't come with an HDMI cable in the box. It comes with an optical cable instead. Check out our guide to the best HDMI cables if you need a good option.\nBest add-on\nThis subwoofer is an excellent addition to any Bose audio system. It can connect wirelessly or via a cable to compatible Bose devices like the Bose Smart Soundbar, Smart Ultra Soundbar, and Bose TV Speaker.\n- Relatively compact design\n- Connects wirelessly to Bose soundbars\n- Adds significant boost to low-end performance\n- Costs almost twice as much as Bose's entry-level soundbar\nBose offers several add-ons for its soundbars, including subwoofers and rear surround speakers. These products can all meaningfully enhance your audio experience, but I recommend starting with the Bose Bass Module 500 if you're looking for an initial upgrade.\nThis wireless subwoofer provides a big jump in deep low-frequency performance that makes movies rumble and brings more depth to music. The Bass Module 500 is compatible with all of the best Bose soundbars. Even if you're pressed for space, the subwoofer connects wirelessly, so it can be placed anywhere in the room (though it does need to plug into a power outlet).\nBose also sells a larger Bass Module 700, which offers extra oomph and power, but the more modest 500 unit is no slouch. It greatly enhances the low-end impact of movies when paired with Bose's smaller TV Speaker and Smart Soundbar, and it even adds a noticeable amount of bass to the larger Ultra Soundbar.\nIf you're craving a bit more kick from your Bose soundbar system, this is a worthy upgrade to invest in.\nHow we test Bose soundbars\nTo evaluate the best Bose soundbars, I conducted hands-on tests with each of the brand's current models to get a sense of how they perform individually and in relation to each other. When considering which Bose soundbar works best for different types of people, I focused on audio quality, physical size, connectivity, advanced software features, ease of use, and overall value for the money.\nI used each soundbar in different environments, from a bedroom at night to a living room during the day, to get a sense of how each performs in various spaces. I also used a variety of streaming video services to test audio performance when watching the latest blockbusters and classic hits. For models that support Dolby Atmos, I tested content with that format. I also streamed different songs from a wide range of music genres to get a sense of how the speakers performed for music lovers.\nWhere possible, I used different connection methods, but in most instances, I stuck with HDMI to get the best-quality audio signal. Similarly, when streaming music, I tested as many connection methods as possible but tried to evaluate the soundbars using the options that offer the highest quality, such as WiFi, when supported.\nBose soundbar FAQs\nCan you mount a Bose soundbar to the wall?\nThe Bose TV Speaker, Smart Soundbar, and Smart Ultra Soundbar can all be wall-mounted with the Bose Soundbar Wall Bracket. The mount costs $39 and is a great option for buyers who don't have a TV stand that can accommodate a soundbar.\nDo Bose soundbars include remotes?\nThe best Bose soundbars all include dedicated remote controls. This is a nice perk, since some competing brands solely rely on mobile apps or pairing with a TV remote to control their devices.\nCan you connect a subwoofer to a Bose soundbar?\nAll of the best Bose soundbars in this guide are compatible with the Bose Bass Module 500 and 700 subwoofers. Both of these subs can connect to Bose soundbars wirelessly, so you can place them anywhere in the room as long as they can reach a power outlet. If you prefer, you can also connect the subwoofer with a wire.\nBuyers interested in soundbar models that already include a subwoofer in the package can check out our guide to the best soundbars with subwoofers.\nCan you pair rear satellite speakers to a Bose soundbar?\nThe Bose Smart Soundbar and Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar both support wireless pairing with the Bose Surround Speakers or Bose Surround Speakers 700.\nFor speaker and soundbar recommendations that include rear satellites, visit our guide to the best surround sound systems.\nDo Bose soundbars support Dolby Atmos?\nThe Bose Smart Soundbar and Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar both support Dolby Atmos immersive audio. Dolby Atmos is a surround sound format that uses object-based mixing to spread audio effects in all directions, including above your head. Bose's soundbars use up-firing speaker drivers to bounce audio off the ceiling and back down to your ears.\nYou can learn more in our Dolby Atmos guide and our roundup of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars.\nCan Bose soundbars play DTS audio?\nThe Bose soundbars in this guide do not support DTS. Instead, they support Dolby and PCM audio formats. This shouldn't be an issue for most people, as Dolby is the most commonly used format on streaming services and live TV providers.\nHowever, some Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray discs have DTS audio mixes. To hear those tracks on a Bose soundbar, you'll need to change your Blu-ray player output settings to PCM.\nIs Bose better than Sonos?\nThe best Sonos soundbars compare well to Bose's top offerings as both lineups offer similar features and capabilities. However, we do give a slight edge to certain options over others.\nFor those who want premium Dolby Atmos performance, the Sonos Arc Ultra is a more robust device than the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar, thanks to Sonos' beefier built-in woofer system.\nHowever, we think the midrange Bose Smart Soundbar has a big edge over the competing Sonos Beam. Bose's device has up-firing audio drivers to provide Dolby Atmos height effects, while Sonos relies only on audio processing, which isn't as effective.\nOn the low end, the budget-friendly Bose TV Speaker and Sonos Ray are extremely similar, with only small differences. We like that the Bose TV Speaker has an HDMI port, which the Ray is missing. On the other hand, the Sonos Ray supports WiFi, while the Bose TV Speaker only has Bluetooth connectivity.\nYou can put together a wireless multi-room audio system with speakers from either brand, but you can't mix and match them. Sonos speakers are only compatible with other Sonos devices, and Bose only works with other Bose models. As such, we suggest picking one brand and sticking with it.\nWhat other audio devices does Bose sell?\nIn addition to soundbars, Bose also sells wireless speakers and headphones. The brand makes some of our favorite over-ear and earbud-style headphones, including the Bose QuietComfort Ultra.\nFor more details, visit our headphone guides:\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "If you want a full-fledged home theater, a dedicated surround sound system is a must-have. These systems use rear speakers to make it sound as if you're right in the middle of your favorite movies and TV shows. I've been using different surround sound systems in my living room for years, and the upgrade they offer over a typical pair of wimpy TV speakers is huge.\nBut finding the best surround sound system for your space and budget is no simple task. There's a lot to consider regarding size, format support, and general performance. I review home entertainment gear for a living, so I have lots of experience with all kinds of audio setups, big and small. I'm here to help break down the basics of surround sound and offer my top picks.\nIf you're looking for an entry-level option, I recommend the Klipsch 5.1-Channel Reference Pack, which comes with five compact speakers, a wireless subwoofer, and an AV receiver to power and process everything. But if you have the space and cash to invest in something larger, I recommend piecing together a system using Klipsch Reference Premiere series speakers. The Reference Premiere series delivers powerful audio that's a clear step above smaller speakers and soundbars I've tested. You can mix and match models to build the perfect setup for your room, but keep in mind that you'll need to buy an AV receiver separately to power the speakers.\nSince not everyone's familiar with surround sound terminology, I've also answered some frequently asked questions to explain some features you should keep in mind when shopping for an audio system. If you're unsure what speaker channels are or what Dolby Atmos is, this FAQ section will tell you everything you need to know.\nOur top picks for the best surround sound systems\nBest budget option: Klipsch 5.1-Channel Reference Theater Pack - See at Amazon\nBest high-end speakers: Klipsch 5.1.4-Channel Reference Premiere - See at Amazon\nBest soundbar model: Samsung 11.1.4-Channel Q990C - See at Amazon\nBest wireless setup: Sony 4.0.4-Channel Bravia Quad - See at Amazon\nBest budget option\nThis budget-friendly home theater bundle includes five compact speakers, a wireless subwoofer, and an AV receiver, offering everything you need for an affordable 5.1-channel surround sound system. You can also buy a bundle that omits the receiver if you already have one.\n- Affordable, entry-level surround sound performance\n- Convenient package includes speakers and AV receiver\n- Compact speakers work well in smaller spaces\n- Sound quality is limited compared to larger, pricier systems\n- Doesn't include Dolby Atmos overhead audio capabilities\nKlipsch's Reference Theater Pack is a great example of a budget-friendly home theater in a box, also called an HTIB. Though retailers have largely replaced HTIBs in favor of soundbars, these handy packages are great for people who want a compact multi-speaker surround sound system.\nSmall speaker systems like this have advantages over soundbars since you can spread their front left, front right, and center speakers farther apart. This creates a wider sense of distance, which enhances stereo effects. In comparison, soundbars have these front channels built into one unit, so there's less separation between them. This Klipsch package also includes dedicated rear speakers, while many soundbar systems rely on virtual processing to simulate rear effects rather than having true surround sound.\nIn total, the Reference Theater Pack comes with five compact speakers and a wireless eight-inch subwoofer to provide a full 5.1-channel system. The package I'm recommending here also includes a Denon AVR-S770H 7.2-Channel AV receiver to power the speakers and act as a hub for your connected devices. You can also get the speakers without the receiver for less money if you already have one or prefer to buy a different model.\nThe Reference Theater speakers are best described as entry-level, but they still have solid specs for their price. They also use a version of Klipsch's Tractrix Horn technology, which is found on all of the brand's higher-end offerings. Tractrix Horns can provide more precise directionality and better power efficiency compared to dome-style tweeters used by other brands.\nThis system's main drawback compared to my other picks is that it's missing the ability to create Dolby Atmos height effects. The Reference Theater package still delivers a full surround sound experience at ear level, but it doesn't spread any audio effects above your head.\nFor a budget-friendly alternative that does support Dolby Atmos overhead audio, I recommend the Vizio Elevate SE 5.1.2 soundbar system. The Vizio can't match the stereo separation you get from Klipsch's Reference Theater speakers, and it has a smaller six-inch subwoofer, but it does still have dedicated rear speakers. It also has the added benefit of up-firing audio drivers to create height sound effects.\nBest high-end speakers\nThese speakers are perfect for home theater enthusiasts who want high-end surround sound. Retailers sell models individually, in pairs, and in select bundles. We recommend piecing together a 5.1.4 Dolby Atmos setup with two RP-8060FAs, two RP-600Ms, a pair of RP-500SAs, an RP-504C, and an RP-1000SW.\n- Premium audio performance with exceptional clarity and range\n- Lots of options to choose from to piece together a setup that works for you\n- You need an AV receiver to power the speakers\n- Large size limits usability in smaller spaces\nThough all of the home theater packages included in this guide are great performers in their own right, Klipsch's Reference Premiere speakers are on another level. Designed for true enthusiasts, this is one of the best surround systems available if you want a full movie theater experience in your living room.\nYou can mix and match several Reference Premiere speakers, which are all sold separately through retailers like Amazon, to create a system that suits your needs. As a good starting point for a premium surround sound setup, I recommend this 5.1.4 Dolby Atmos configuration:\n- Two RP-8060FA II towers\n- A pair of RP-600M II bookshelf speakers\n- A pair of RP-500SA II Dolby Atmos modules\n- One RP-504C II center speaker\n- One RP-1000SW subwoofer\nThat adds up to nine speaker channels in total (plus the subwoofer), so you'll need a nine-channel AV receiver to power and process them. I recommend the Denon AVR-X3800H for its reliability and packed set of features. I use an older version of that receiver in my own home theater setup, and it delivers excellent performance. The X3800H also has multiple HDMI 2.1 ports so you can connect various media devices to the receiver and pass their signals to your TV, including support for gaming consoles with 4K/120Hz video.\nThe Reference Premiere speakers make good use of Klipsch's proprietary Tractrix Horn-loaded technology, which can provide better power efficiency and more precise directionality than traditional dome-style tweeters. Klipsch's Reference Premiere speakers first launched in 2014, and the company released second-generation models in 2022. The latest models use larger horns than the first-gen speakers and refined woofers that produce less distortion.\nPerformance is exceptional, with range, clarity, imaging, and bass that outclass all of the less expensive options in this guide. My recommended setup delivers 5.1.4 channels of audio, which means you get traditional left, center, right, surround left, surround right, and bass channels, plus front left height, front right height, surround left height, and surround right height channels. The result is sound from all sides \u2014 both at ear level and above your head.\nOf course, not everyone has a room large enough to accommodate a setup like this, and only the most serious home theater enthusiasts will want to spend several thousand dollars on speakers. The 5.1.4 configuration I recommend will set you back about $5,000, and that's before you add the receiver, which costs another $1,699. However, the Reference Premiere Series is hard to beat for those willing to make the investment, and you can always piece together components gradually by starting with two speakers and adding more over time.\nAs a slightly cheaper alternative, Klipsch sells a step-down lineup of home theater speakers called the Reference Series. These models aren't as advanced, but they offer a nice step up from any soundbar you'll find. If you were to piece together a similar 5.1.4 configuration with Reference speakers, the total would be about $3,300 (without a receiver). You can shop for Reference Series speakers on Amazon.\nBest soundbar model\nThis powerful 11.1.4 soundbar system has up-firing drivers, a dedicated subwoofer, and separate rear satellite speakers. It takes up more space than smaller options, but delivers the best Dolby Atmos performance we\u2019ve heard in a system like this.\n- Class-leading Dolby Atmos and DTS:X immersion\n- Quick and snappy setup\n- Rugged, minimalist design\n- No Chromecast or HDMI 2.1 support\n- Spotify Connect quirks with iPhone\n- Only minor upgrades compared to 2022 model\nThe Samsung Q990C is the best surround sound system for anyone who wants a convenient yet powerful Dolby Atmos soundbar with dedicated rear speakers. This package includes a 48-inch soundbar, two wireless rear speakers, and a wireless subwoofer to provide a genuine surround sound experience.\nDolby Atmos technology is supported with up-firing audio drivers built into the soundbar and satellites. This enables audio effects to bounce off your ceiling, making it seem as if they're coming from above your head. In total, the system provides a whopping 11.1.4 channels of audio, which results in a fantastic sense of immersion that envelops you in a dome of sound. Our reviewer was impressed by the system's warm and detailed audio, clean dialogue, and excellent balance across genres.\nHowever, this is still a soundbar rather than a full-sized speaker system, so there are limitations to keep in mind. The Q990C does its best to correct for distortion using software, but it occasionally had a slightly sharp sound during certain sequences in our testing. And though it's incredibly powerful for a soundbar, it can't match the presence and rumble of something like Klipsch's high-end Reference Premiere speakers.\nBut within this size and price range, the Q990C is an incredible-sounding system. It's also a lot more convenient than a traditional speaker setup since it doesn't require a separate AV receiver. Instead, the Q990C has built-in amplification, processing, and connectivity. It has an HDMI eARC port, an optical port, and a pair of HDMI inputs with 4K HDR passthrough (though it does not support HDMI 2.1 for 120Hz gaming).\nAlexa is also integrated for hands-free voice control, and the soundbar supports a feature called Q-Symphony. This function lets the soundbar pair with many of the best Samsung TVs, like the S95D 4K OLED and S95F 4K OLED, so you can use your TV's speakers with the Q990C. This is a cool bonus for those with a compatible TV, but the soundbar works great even without this feature enabled.\nBuyers should note that Samsung also offers a newer, more expensive version of this soundbar, the Q990F. The updated model is similar, but has a more compact subwoofer and adds HDMI 2.1 support to enable 4K/120Hz passthrough. If that's a must-have feature for your gaming setup, then the Q990F is worth the premium, but the cheaper Q990C is the better value for most people.\nRead our Samsung HW-Q990C soundbar review and Samsung HW-Q990F soundbar review.\nVisit our guides to all of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars.\nBest wireless setup\nThe Bravia Theater Quad is a slim four-speaker wireless audio system with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support. Though we wish it had deeper bass, the system provides an immersive sense of surround sound.\n- Immersive Dolby Atmos and DTS:X performance\n- Sleek and stylish wireless design\n- Control box has HDMI 2.1 pass-through with 4K/120Hz support\n- Lower midrange and bass lack depth\n- You still need to plug the speakers in for power\n- Lacks Chromecast streaming support\nSony's Bravia Theater Quad system is an ideal fit for people who want an easy-to-use wireless surround sound solution. It consists of four sleek speakers and a compact control box. The control box acts as the wireless receiver for the speakers and an HDMI 2.1 hub to plug into your TV.\nThe thin speaker units include tabletop bases for easy placement on a media console, and they can also be wall-mounted if you prefer. Though each speaker connects wirelessly to the control box, they still need to be plugged into a power outlet. This is the case for most wireless surround sound systems since built-in batteries are not yet practical for home theater use.\nEach speaker has front- and up-firing audio drivers to enable 4.0.4 channels of Dolby Atmos audio. In my testing, the Quad speakers offered fantastic sound quality, with natural separation between the left, right, and rear speakers, creating a spacious sense of surround sound. I was also impressed by the system's height channels, which produced a convincing sense of overhead audio when watching Dolby Atmos movies.\nSince the Bravia Quad uses four speakers, there is no dedicated center channel. However, the system supports Sony's Center Sync feature that lets you pair the Quad with a compatible Sony TV in order to use the TV's speakers as a center channel for dialogue. I tested this with a Bravia 9 4K TV, and it worked well, placing speech up front and center with the display. Center Sync isn't necessary to get good performance, but it's a cool perk if you happen to have a compatible TV.\nThe Quad speakers sounded great with a variety of movies, shows, and video games, but the system does have one notable weakness: low-frequency performance. The Quad's sound signature lacks weight in the deep bass registers, creating a thin quality in big action scenes, which left me craving a bit more oomph. You can fix this by adding one of Sony's wireless subwoofers, like the SW5. I was able to test the system with and without the SW5, and it offers a big upgrade. Bravia Quad packages that include an SW3 or SW5 subwoofer are usually sold for an extra $400 to $600, but these bundles are sometimes available at a nice discount.\nHowever, even when on sale, the Bravia Theater Quad is a pricey system compared to most soundbar alternatives. That said, the Quad's cool aesthetics and wireless connectivity give it a premium feel, which helps justify its price.\nHow we test surround sound systems\nTo select the best surround sound systems, our team of reviewers relied on a combination of hands-on testing and research informed by more than a decade of experience covering audio products. Our methodology includes evaluating key performance attributes related to audio quality for movies, TV shows, and music, as well as surround sound format support, connectivity, design, and overall value.\nTo test sound quality, we watch a variety of content across genres, including action films, sitcoms, concerts, and dialogue-driven dramas, to evaluate how speakers and soundbars perform with different kinds of material. We pay close attention to high-, mid-, and low-frequency performance to determine if a system is able to provide a balanced sound signature that avoids any overly bright, muddy, or boomy qualities. We also watch specific sequences and demo clips that we've curated to showcase surround sound effects, bass, and Dolby Atmos height channels (when applicable).\nOur testing material includes Blu-ray disc content with lossless audio, high-resolution music tracks, and compressed streaming audio, so we can hear how a surround sound system handles different levels of quality. Small and medium-sized systems are tested in a medium-sized home office space, while bigger systems with full-sized speakers are evaluated in a larger living room.\nSurround sound system FAQs\nWhat are surround sound speaker channels?\nWhen shopping for the best surround sound system, you'll often see a string of two to three numbers separated by decimal points listed somewhere in the product description. For example, many systems are listed as being 5.1 or 5.1.4 setups. This string of numbers refers to how many speaker channels the system supports, which basically translates to how many directions sound can come from.\nThe first number designates the number of standard ear-level speaker channels provided. The second number indicates how many subwoofers are supported for dedicated bass. The final number describes how many height speaker channels are supported for Dolby Atmos overhead audio.\nThe best surround sound systems are available in various channel configurations. Generally, the more speaker channels you get, the more enveloping and immersive the surround sound effect will be, since audio can come from more directions. The most traditional setup is a 5.1 configuration.\nIn a 5.1-channel system, you get front left, front right, center, surround left, surround right, and subwoofer speakers at ear level. If you have a Dolby Atmos-capable system, like a 5.1.4 setup, you get the same ear-level channels along with the addition of front left height, front right height, surround left height, and surround right height speakers. These speakers are either mounted on your ceiling or angled from the ground to bounce audio off your ceiling.\nSurround sound systems can start at three channels, and most consumer options max out at around 11 ear-level speakers and four height-level speakers.\nWhat is Dolby Atmos?\nDolby Atmos is a surround sound format supported on many modern audio systems. It uses a process called object-based audio mixing, which allows sound designers to create soundtracks with individual audio elements, like a buzzing bee or flying helicopter, that can be freely moved around a virtual environment. A Dolby Atmos sound system processes this location data and maps those locations to best match whatever speaker setup you have.\nSo, whether you have a 5.1.2 or 11.1.4 speaker setup, a Dolby Atmos audio track can scale to match the location and number of speakers in your room. Atmos mixing also allows audio designers to expand upon traditional surround sound with effects above your head.\nDolby Atmos height effects are best realized by actual in- or on-ceiling speakers, but those are complicated to set up. As an alternative, many soundbars and speakers use up-firing audio drivers. Up-firing drivers are built into ear-level speakers and angled in a specific way to bounce audio off your ceiling. This simulates the effect of sounds coming from above your head. The performance of up-firing speakers is affected by the size and shape of your room. For the best performance, Dolby suggests using a room with a flat ceiling between 7.5 and 12 feet high.\nFor more details about Dolby Atmos, visit our full Dolby Atmos guide.\nDo you need an AV receiver for surround sound?\nThere are two main types of surround sound systems sold in 2025: soundbar setups and multi-speaker setups. Soundbar systems do not require a separate AV receiver, but traditional multi-speaker systems do. These configurations use passive speakers that need to be hooked up to a receiver for amplification and audio processing.\nAn AV receiver provides power to your speakers and also serves as a connection hub for your media devices. Many receivers have multiple HDMI passthrough ports and an HDMI ARC (audio return channel) port. You can connect external components like a Blu-ray player, streaming player, or gaming console to your receiver's HDMI passthrough ports and then feed their signals to your TV through the HDMI ARC port. HDMI ARC also passes audio from your TV to the receiver. Many AV receivers include wireless connectivity for music streaming via Bluetooth or WiFi, and some also include phono inputs to connect to a record player.\nReceivers can power multiple speakers, and the number they support is designated by their channel specification. Common surround sound AV receiver options include 5.1-, 7.1-, 9.1-, and 11.1-channel models. Some receivers support multiple subwoofers as well, which would be designated by a .2 or .4 as the second number. Generally speaking, the more channels/speakers a receiver supports, the more expensive it is.\nDenon, Onkyo, Pioneer, Yamaha, Marantz, and Sony are all popular AV receiver brands that sell various models at different budget levels. You can browse AV receivers on Amazon.\nWhat is virtual surround sound?\nPhysical rear speakers provide the best surround sound quality, but some brands sell soundbar models that support virtual surround sound without actual rear speakers. Virtual surround sound relies on software and psychoacoustics to simulate the effect of rear audio through adjustments in sound frequencies, speed, and levels. Some soundbars with virtual surround sound also rely on side-firing audio drivers that can bounce effects off your walls.\nThough virtual surround sound systems can provide a more immersive experience than standard two-channel stereo systems, we've yet to come across any stand-alone soundbars that can effectively mimic the sound of actual rear speakers. These models create a wider sound field, and they're great for people who want to save space, but we recommend sticking with a system that has physical rear speakers to get the best surround sound performance.\nFor speaker recommendations with virtual surround sound, check out our guides to the best soundbars and best budget soundbars.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "As someone who reviews TVs for a living, I love big-screen displays, but some spaces just aren't large enough to cram in a giant screen. If you have a smaller living room or want an extra TV for a bedroom, a 50- or 48-inch TV is a perfect fit. To help you find a reliable model, I've picked the best 50-inch TVs that don't sacrifice performance.\nIf you want excellent image quality on a smaller screen, the LG C4 is my top recommendation. This OLED delivers perfect black levels in a compact form factor. But if you want a more budget-friendly set, I recommend the Amazon Omni QLED. It's typically sold for under $400 and delivers a better picture than most competing 50-inch TVs in its class.\nMy picks for the best 50-inch TVs were informed by more than a decade of experience testing home entertainment products. I've used my expertise to select options for all kinds of viewers and budgets. Whether you're a casual buyer, a gamer, or a home theater enthusiast, there's a 50-inch TV here to suit your needs\nNote: LCD-based TVs (including LED and QLED models) use a 50-inch screen size, while OLED TVs use a slightly smaller 48-inch size. For that reason, I've included a 48-inch OLED in this guide.\nOur top picks for the best 50-inch TVs\nBest overall: LG C4 - See at Amazon\nBest premium QLED: Samsung QN90D - See at Amazon\nBest on a budget: Amazon Omni QLED - See at Amazon\nBest entry-level option: TCL S5 - See at Amazon\nBest midrange for gaming: Vizio MQX - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nLG's C4 is one of the brand's top midrange 4K OLED TVs. The 48-inch model isn't quite as bright as its larger counterparts, but it still delivers an infinite contrast ratio. It also supports up to a 144Hz refresh rate, which makes it an excellent gaming set.\n- OLED panel offers pixel-level contrast and deep black levels\n- Only minimal image distortion from an angle\n- Up to a 144Hz refresh rate for smooth gaming performance\n- Not as bright as larger OLED models\n- Color performance can't match that of OLEDs with quantum dots\n- Pricey for its size\nThe LG C4 is the best 48-inch TV for people who want a smaller display that doesn't skimp on picture quality. It uses an OLED panel, which is rare for TVs under 55 inches. This type of screen gives it key benefits over the LED and QLED sets that round out the rest of this guide.\nThe C4 delivers all the advantages that OLED TVs are known for, including pixel-level contrast and wide viewing angles. On LED and QLED displays, black levels can look washed out when you watch TV with the lights off, and colors and contrast can fade if you sit to the side of the panel. But on the C4, black levels disappear into a dark room with perfect uniformity, and picture quality only skews slightly from an off-center view. Check out our QLED vs. OLED comparison for more details on how each panel type stacks up.\nThe 48-inch C4's peak brightness of around 700 to 800 nits is very respectable, especially compared to other displays in the 48-to-50-inch class. However, buyers should be aware that larger versions of the C4 have an extra brightness-boosting feature that allows them to get closer to 1,000 nits. But even with this limitation, the 48-inch C4 is easily one of the best-looking TVs available at this size, offering vibrant high-dynamic-range (HDR) images.\nIn addition to excellent image performance, the C4 offers solid smart TV capabilities via LG's webOS platform. I don't love how the interface emphasizes sponsored content so heavily, but it still provides reliable access to all of the best streaming services, along with built-in support for Alexa voice control. The C4 is equipped well for the latest consoles, too, with a 120Hz refresh rate that can support smooth gaming on a PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch 2. Unlike LG's previous C3 model, the C4 can enable an even higher 144Hz refresh rate when paired with a PC.\nAt a typical sale price of around $900, the C4 is pricey for a 48-inch TV, but the jump in picture quality over my cheaper picks is substantial. Buyers should note that LG also sells a newer version of this TV, the C5. The C5 OLED offers some small improvements in image quality, but the 48-inch model costs about $300 to $400 more than the C4. For now, the C4 remains the better value.\nRead our LG C4 TV review and LG C5 TV review.\nCheck out our guides to all the best smart TVs and best LG TVs.\nBest premium QLED\nThe QN90D is one of Samsung's flagship QLED displays. It's one of the only 4K Mini LED TVs available in a 50-inch size. Mini LEDs help the TV achieve high brightness and contrast, with image quality that's a clear step above cheaper QLEDs.\n- Mini LED panel enables high contrast\n- One of the brightest 50-inch TVs on the market\n- Fast 144Hz refresh rate for smooth gaming\n- Expensive for such a small size\n- Some minor blooming visible\n- Viewing angles not as wide as an OLED\nIt's rare to find high-end displays available in a 50-inch screen size, but the Samsung QN90D bucks that trend. This flagship QLED is pricey for such a small screen, but it pulls no punches when it comes to image quality.\nThe QN90D is part of Samsung's \"Neo QLED\" series, which means it has quantum dots for expanded color and local dimming with a Mini LED backlight. Though cheaper 50-inch QLEDs from Amazon and Vizio also have quantum dots and local dimming, they use regular-sized LEDs. The QN90D's Mini LEDs allow it to achieve a big boost in contrast, black-level performance, and brightness.\nI tested the 65-inch version of this TV and measured an excellent peak brightness level of about 2,040 nits. Though performance will differ a bit in smaller sizes, the 50-inch model should be able to hit a similar number. That's about two to four times as bright as the other TVs I recommend in this guide.\nThis level of brightness allows the QN90D to produce impressive HDR highlights that really pop and gives you ample headroom to pump up luminance to overcome glare in rooms with lots of light. Contrast control is also great, but black levels still aren't as precise as those on an OLED like the LG C4. I noticed some blooming (small halos around bright objects) in certain scenes, including a test sequence with burning candles. The 48-inch LG C4 has better image quality overall, but the QN90D is a strong performer for people who crave an extra-bright picture.\nThe TV also supports up to a 144Hz refresh rate for high-frame-rate gaming when paired with compatible gear. The smart TV interface even includes access to the Xbox app, so Game Pass members can stream games without a console.\nShoppers should note that Samsung also sells a 2025 edition of this set, called the QN90F. The new model offers very similar performance, but it uses an anti-glare matte screen rather than a glossy one. This type of filter is much better at reducing reflections, but it elevates black levels in a bright room. If you struggle with glare, the QN90F's matte screen is a better fit, but it costs a bit more, and opinions on this style are divided.\nWhile it remains in stock for less money, the glossy QN90D remains the best 50-inch TV for high-end QLED performance.\nCheck out our guide to all of the best Samsung TVs.\nBest on a budget\nThough we think the larger versions of Amazon's Omni QLED TV are overpriced for what you get, the 50-inch model offers an excellent balance between cost and performance. It has handy Alexa features and is one of the only 50-inch TVs available with local dimming, which enables solid contrast performance.\n- One of the few 50-inch QLED models with local dimming\n- Lots of Alexa smart features, including hands-free voice control\n- VRR and ALLM gaming capabilities\n- Narrow viewing angles\n- Mediocre upscaling\n- Panel limited to 60Hz rather than 120Hz\nThe Amazon Omni QLED replaces my previous pick in this category, the Hisense U6HF, as my recommendation for the best 50-inch TV on a budget. The U6HF is still a great TV in this class, but the 50-inch size is no longer available. As a result, the Omni QLED is a good alternative with similar performance.\nThe TV uses a QLED panel to offer a wide color gamut and a decent peak brightness of about 500 nits. That's dimmer than I generally recommend for larger TVs, but solid for this size and class. The Omni QLED also has local dimming to improve its contrast, enabling the panel to brighten and darken specific areas across its screen.\nBut unlike pricier QLED TVs, this model uses regular-sized LEDs instead of Mini LEDs in its backlight. This means it has fewer zones to work with, which makes black levels less uniformly deep. Our reviewer also noticed some delayed dimming that caused some pops in brightness levels here and there.\nStill, few 50-inch TVs can achieve this level of image quality at this price. Most competing budget models lack local dimming entirely, and many have a narrower range of colors.\nThat said, the Omni QLED isn't immune to other common drawbacks of TVs in this class. Namely, it has limited viewing angles, so contrast and colors distort at an angle. It's also limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, so you can't unlock 120Hz support on a gaming console or PC.\nThe Omni QLED uses Amazon's Fire TV operating system and comes with an Alexa voice remote. It also supports hands-free digital assistant functions like an Echo speaker, which is a nice perk to have in such a budget-friendly set.\nBut while I recommend the Omni QLED in a 50-inch screen size, this model is not my top budget pick in larger sizes. If you want a bigger TV on a budget, I generally recommend the TCL QM6K, which is currently sold in 55-inch and up sizes. The QM6K offers a higher refresh rate, brighter image, and better backlight control.\nRead our Amazon Omni QLED TV review.\nCheck out our guides to the best budget TVs, best TVs under $500, and best Amazon Fire TVs.\nBest entry-level option\nTCL's S5 is one of the brand's most budget-friendly TV models. It has limited brightness and contrast, but it offers solid color performance for the money and comes with an Alexa voice remote.\n- Wide color capabilities\n- Remote supports Alexa voice search\n- Limited brightness for HDR content\n- Mediocre contrast and viewing angles\nIf you're shopping for a 50-inch TV but don't want to spend too much, the TCL S5 is an excellent entry-level option. This set only offers basic image quality, but it's often sold for under $250, making it a good buy for people who want an inexpensive display for a smaller space.\nUnlike the pricier picks in this guide, the S5 uses a standard LED panel without local dimming. As a result, its brightness and contrast capabilities are limited. Dark scenes look more washed out when watching TV with the lights off, and though it supports HDR playback with solid color performance, it can't control its light output precisely enough to really show off the perks of high-dynamic-range content on streaming services and 4K Blu-ray discs.\nBut for casual TV watching, the S5 does the job just fine. It's even available in both Fire TV and Google TV models, so you can choose the system you prefer. The Fire TV option comes with an Alexa voice remote, while the Google TV model comes with a Google Assistant voice remote.\nHome theater fans and gamers are better off spending more to get one of my other recommendations, but the S5 is the best 50-inch TV for people who just want a cheap smart TV without any step-up image quality features.\nBest midrange for gaming\nThe 50-inch Vizio MQX is a budget-friendly QLED built with gaming in mind. It has a higher refresh rate than most competing sets this size, which can offer smoother gameplay when paired with a PS5, Xbox Series X, or PC.\n- 4K/120Hz or 1080p/240Hz refresh rate for smooth gaming\n- Decent HDR brightness\n- Low number of dimming zones leads to blooming\n- Poor viewing angles\nVizio's MQX is designed with gaming in mind. This midrange QLED is one of the most affordable 50-inch 4K TVs with a 120Hz refresh rate. It can even support up to 240Hz if you game in 1080p on a computer.\nThis enables a smooth experience when you play games with frame rates higher than 60 frames per second on a PS5, Xbox Series X, Switch 2, or PC. The TV also uses a QLED panel with wide color support and local dimming to help control contrast and black levels.\nHowever, the display only uses 16 dimming zones, which is low and can cause more noticeable blooming (halos around bright objects) than you'd see on QLEDs with more zones or on OLED TVs with pixel-level contrast. At a peak of around 400 to 500 nits, the MQX's brightness is decent for a TV in this class, but a bit under the minimum of 600 nits that I recommend for entry-level high dynamic range performance.\nIf gaming isn't a priority, I give the 50-inch Amazon Omni QLED an edge since it's usually cheaper and offers better contrast. However, the Omni QLED only has a 60Hz refresh rate, so the MQX has the clear upper hand with consoles and PCs. Both TVs have subpar viewing angles, so neither has an advantage there.\nHow we pick 50-inch TVs\nTo choose the best 50-inch TVs, our team of reviewers uses a combination of testing and research bolstered by more than a decade's worth of experience covering the home entertainment product industry.\nWhen we test TVs, we usually evaluate 65-inch models since most brands consider that size their flagship. However, if a specific TV model is offered in multiple sizes, that model's key specifications usually remain the same across the board. For example, a 48-inch LG C4 OLED and a 65-inch C4 OLED have the same basic specs and features. The only major differences are the sizes of their screens and their peak brightness.\nHowever, it's important to note that the best 50-inch TVs with local dimming, like the Amazon Omni QLED, Samsung QN90D, and Vizio QMX, use fewer dimming zones in smaller sizes versus larger ones. This can result in differences in contrast performance when comparing a 50-inch model to another size. Sometimes, there are bigger variations in features and design across sizes, so we note those instances when they pop up.\nWhen evaluating 50-inch TVs, we test parameters like clarity/sharpness, contrast, peak HDR brightness, color gamut, off-angle viewing, refresh rate, smart TV interface speed, and general value for the money. We use a colorimeter to assess brightness when we review TVs and use test patterns on the Spears & Munsil UHD HDR Benchmark 4K Blu-ray disc to check other objective image elements.\nWe also watch plenty of real-world content on every TV we test to get a feel for what it's like to use each display daily. We play key scenes from movies and TV shows to examine local dimming, HDR performance, upscaling, and more. Sources include Blu-ray discs, streaming services, and live TV at various resolutions, from standard definition to 4K. Testing is conducted in bright and dark rooms to see how a TV performs in different conditions.\nFor more info on our testing process, visit our breakdown of how we review tech products.\n50-inch TV FAQs\nIs 50 inches a good size for a TV?\nThe best 50-inch TVs are perfect for buyers who need a compact display that fits in a smaller room and on a smaller TV stand. However, there are fewer midrange and high-end TVs offered in this size compared to what you'd find when shopping for a larger display.\nFor instance, many of the best OLED TVs are only available in 55, 65, and 77 inches. Likewise, several of our favorite QLED TVs from brands like Hisense, TCL, and Roku, like the QM8K and Roku Pro Series, are not sold in a 50-inch size.\nThat said, there are a few exceptions, like our top pick in this guide, the LG C4, one of the few OLED TVs made in smaller sizes. But generally speaking, most 50-inch TVs are built with entry-level and lower-midrange performance in mind.\nIf you want a larger selection of mid-tier and premium display models to choose from, check out our guides focusing on larger TVs:\n- The best 55-inch TVs\n- The best 65-inch TVs\n- The best 75-inch TVs\n- The best 85-inch TVs\n- The best 100-inch TVs\nAnd if you need an even more compact display, check out our guide to the best 43-inch TVs.\nHow much should a 50-inch TV cost?\nThe best 50-inch TVs cost between $200 and $1,600, depending on the type of display you buy.\nEntry-level LED models from value-friendly brands like TCL, Hisense, and Vizio cost around $200 to $250. These options are good for casual viewing but often lack advanced features like quantum dots and local dimming. Lower-midrange QLED sets range from $300 to $550, and these options will deliver better color, higher contrast, and brighter panels. However, many of our favorite upper-midrange QLED models are not sold in 50 inches.\nLikewise, high-end 50-inch TVs are hard to come by, but you can find a couple of OLED models, like the LG C4, and top-tier QLED models, like Samsung's QN90 series, in this size for around $800 to $1,500.\nMany 50-inch TVs go on sale throughout the year, but we see the biggest savings during events like Prime Day and Black Friday and around sports championships like the Super Bowl and March Madness.\nIs 4K worth it on a 50-inch TV?\nThough the benefits of 4K resolution are best appreciated on larger TV sets, 50 inches is still big enough to make 4K worthwhile, especially if you plan to sit close to your display.\nHowever, the debate about whether 4K is worth it on a TV this size has become a moot point since major brands no longer sell 50-inch HDTVs. Most HDTV models are now restricted to 43 inches and under. If you're buying a 50-inch or larger TV in 2025, 4K is the standard.\nFor more 4K display recommendations in multiple sizes, check out our guide to the best 4K TVs.\nAre there 50-inch 8K TVs?\nThere aren't any 50-inch 8K TVs on the market. The smallest 8K TVs sold today are 65 inches, but the subtle benefits of 8K resolution are best appreciated on displays 75 inches and larger. From a regular viewing distance, the visible details on a 50-inch 4K TV would be nearly indistinguishable from a 50-inch 8K TV.\nDo 50-inch TVs have good sound quality?\nMost TVs, especially those in smaller sizes like 50 inches, offer mediocre sound quality. To keep costs down and fit speakers inside compact displays, manufacturers use small audio drivers that limit the range, depth, and clarity of a TV's built-in sound system. To get the best sound quality, we recommend buying a separate soundbar or speaker setup to pair with a 50-inch TV.\nCheck out our soundbar and speaker guides to see our top recommendations:\n- The best soundbars\n- The best budget soundbars\n- The best soundbars with subwoofers\n- The best Dolby Atmos soundbars\n- The best Bose soundbars\n- The best Sonos soundbars\n- The best surround sound systems\nLearn more about immersive surround sound in our Dolby Atmos explainer.\nDo you need HDMI 2.1 on a 50-inch TV?\nMany of the best TVs include HDMI 2.1 ports, but this feature isn't as common on smaller sizes. However, several of our best 50-inch TV picks \u2014 the LG C4, Samsung QN90D, and Vizio MQX \u2014 do include HDMI 2.1 support, which is useful for gaming enthusiasts.\nHDMI 2.1 connections can transmit signals at 4K/120Hz, along with variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM) when paired with a compatible gaming device, like a PS5 or PC. These features provide a smooth gaming experience with fast motion, minimal lag, and reduced screen tearing.\nTo enable HDMI 2.1 features, all of your home entertainment components must have HDMI 2.1 ports. So if you're hooking up a PS5 to a soundbar connected to your TV, all three devices must support HDMI 2.1. You also need to use ultra-high-speed HDMI cables rated for 48Gbps to pair everything together. Visit our guide to the best HDMI cables for recommendations and more details.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "If you're unhappy with the audio quality of your TV, a soundbar is a perfect solution. Though top models are pricey, you can still get solid performance without spending a ton. But with so many options out there, finding the best bang for your buck can be tricky. That's why our audio experts have tested dozens of popular models to find the best budget soundbars for all kinds of users.\nOur top pick for most people is the Vizio V21d-J8. This basic yet reliable model is ideal for anyone who wants a cheap soundbar that's capable of clear dialogue and solid stereo effects. But buyers who crave more robust performance should check out the Bose Smart Soundbar. It's one of the most affordable Dolby Atmos soundbars with up-firing drivers. This feature enables the bar to bounce audio effects off your ceiling, making it sound like they're coming from above your head.\nWe've been reviewing audio products for over a decade, and that extensive experience has helped us learn exactly which features you should and shouldn't look for in a budget soundbar. We've kept all our recommendations under $500 and curated each pick to suit different needs.\nOur top picks for the best budget soundbars\nBest overall: Vizio V-Series V21d-J8 - See at Walmart\nBest with Dolby Atmos: Bose Smart Soundbar - See at Amazon\nBest midrange pick: Yamaha YAS-209 - See at Amazon\nBest for apartments: Sonos Ray - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nWith a simple design and decent audio performance, Vizio's V-Series is a great pick for buyers looking to spend less.\n- Affordable price\n- HDMI ARC and Optical connections\n- Bluetooth for music streaming from a phone\n- Audio performance is very basic\n- No HDMI video passthrough\n- Doesn't include a subwoofer\nVizio's V21d-J8 is the best budget soundbar for people who want a simple, no-fuss speaker that they can set and forget. This all-in-one system offers solid entry-level sound in a sleek design that blends into any decor without needing space for extra components or a bulky subwoofer.\nThe V21 connects to your TV via HDMI ARC, letting you use your TV remote for power and volume controls. For those with older TVs that lack an HDMI ARC connection, an optical input is included as a backup, while support for Bluetooth lets you stream audio from a phone or tablet.\nThe included remote lets you switch through settings like sound modes, inputs, and EQ adjustments. The bar doesn't have a spare HDMI port for video pass-through, but it does have an analog input for legacy audio devices.\nThe V21 offers basic two-channel stereo playback with built-in woofers for low frequencies. It delivers a moderate yet still appreciable improvement over the audio quality offered by an average TV, with boosted dialogue and some added punch in action scenes. The lack of a separate subwoofer limits bass response, but support for DTS Virtual:X simulated surround sound helps the bar expand beyond its 36-inch frame to create a bigger soundstage.\nAs you might expect, the V21 doesn't perform as well as pricier soundbars or multi-speaker home theater setups, but Vizio's talent for delivering good sound at an affordable price is on full display. If all you need is a budget-friendly way to boost your TV's audio performance, this value-packed bar is a great entry point.\nBest with Dolby Atmos\nThe new Bose Smart Soundbar is a refreshed version of the brand's Smart Soundbar 600. It carries over the same design and excellent Dolby Atmos audio performance while adding an AI enhanced dialogue mode and the ability to use Bose Ultra Open Earbuds as rear speakers.\n- Dolby Atmos support with up-firing drivers\n- Clear dialogue with new AI enhancement mode\n- Compact design\n- Built-in Alexa capabilities\n- Minimal inputs\n- Doesn't support DTS\n- Lacks separate subwoofer\nThe Bose Smart Soundbar is the best Dolby Atmos soundbar you can buy on a budget. Dolby's popular audio format spreads sound in all directions, including above your head. And unlike the similarly priced Sonos Beam, the Bose Smart Soundbar includes dedicated up-firing drivers for more convincing overhead effects. This feature allows the bar to bounce sound off your ceiling to simulate audio coming from above.\nThe Smart Soundbar is a slightly refreshed version of Bose's older Smart Soundbar 600, which is now discontinued. This revised model is basically the same soundbar but with updated software to support a couple of new features.\nWith Bose's advanced acoustic design and virtual surround sound software, the soundbar provides a full and immersive spatial audio experience. But the Smart Soundbar offers much more than just Dolby Atmos. During our tests, its small but capable frame provided clear dialogue and balanced sound across genres and formats, making it a great system for whatever you play.\nIf you ever have trouble hearing speech, the bar supports a handy new AI Dialogue mode. This function emphasizes dialogue without affecting the quality of other sound effects.\nThere's also a unique personal surround sound feature, which lets you pop in a pair of Bose Ultra Open Earbuds to use as rear speakers with the soundbar. This worked well, allowing us to hear surround sound effects through the earbuds while still hearing the soundbar. But while this is a cool feature to try if you happen to own the Ultra Open Earbuds already, we don't consider it a big selling point.\nIt's also worth noting that the soundbar's bass response is a bit limited. With its compact size and lack of a dedicated subwoofer, powerful moments in your favorite films tend to lose some of their impact in the lower frequencies. You can upgrade the system with a wireless Bose subwoofer, but that adds a lot to the cost.\nLuckily, the Smart Soundbar has plenty of other tricks up its sleeve. Thanks to WiFi support and Bose's capable app, you can play your favorite tracks from many of the best music streaming services. Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay 2, Chromecast, and Bluetooth are all on offer, while the soundbar's built-in microphones support Amazon Alexa voice control to make it an effective smart speaker.\nLike many bars this size, the Smart Soundbar has limited connection options. It pairs with your TV through an HDMI eARC or optical port, but there are no spare HDMI pass-through inputs. It also lacks support for DTS sound formats, but its TrueSpace virtual surround still does an impressive job with most audio sent its way.\nThe Bose Smart Soundbar isn't the cheapest option in our guide, but its combination of immersive and musical sound, Dolby Atmos up-firing drivers, and chic design all add up to an investment that is (dare we say?) smart.\nVisit our guide to all of the best Bose soundbars and best Bose headphones.\nBest midrange pick\nYamaha's YAS-209 is a convenient 2.1-channel soundbar with great sound quality, a wireless subwoofer, and a reasonable price.\n- Room-filling sound\n- Alexa built-in\n- Sleek appearance\n- Wireless subwoofer included\n- No onboard display\n- Doesn't support Dolby Vision passthrough\n- No Atmos capabilities\nThe Yamaha YAS-209 is an excellent midrange soundbar and is one of the few budget-friendly options available with a dedicated subwoofer. In fact, the YAS-209 is the overall champ in our complete guide to the best soundbars you can buy.\nThis 2.1-channel model impressed us with its refreshingly full and balanced sound, offering a smooth and warm midrange, clear dialogue, and plenty of punch via its included wireless subwoofer. While there's no Dolby Atmos support, DTS Virtual:X processing is included to expand the sound beyond its frame. Even in its standard mode, the YAS-209 delivers engaging performance that will ramp up everything you play.\nThe YAS-209 offers easy connection to your TV over HDMI ARC while sprinkling in a surprising arsenal of extras, including Bluetooth and WiFi support, built-in Amazon Alexa for voice control, and even a spare HDMI input for connecting external devices. But while the bar can pass through 4K video with HDR, it doesn't support Dolby Vision or 120Hz signals. That said, we rarely see any spare HDMI ports at this price, so those exclusions are easy to forgive.\nThe 209's rounded frame is wrapped in acoustic fabric for subtle style points, with accessible touch commands up top. At less than 2.5 inches high and 36 inches across, it's an easy fit on most media consoles and blends smoothly into the background. We do wish there was a full display up front, but given that we rarely needed to make any audio adjustments, it's another forgivable omission.\nFor more soundbar recommendations with dedicated bass, check out our guide to all the best soundbars with subwoofers.\nBest for apartments\nThe Sonos Ray packs a thrilling punch of premium sound in a conveniently small package but begs some compromises when it comes to connection options.\n- Clear, full, and detailed sound quality\n- Small and stylish design\n- Connects and syncs with other Sonos speakers\n- No HDMI ARC\n- No Bluetooth or Dolby Atmos\n- No included remote\nWhen we first heard the Sonos Ray, we were all but bowled over by its audio quality. Its tiny frame makes it look more like a Bluetooth speaker than a soundbar, but Sonos proves that size doesn't always dictate performance. This is ideal for people who want big sound from a compact device that fits in small spaces.\nThe Ray's audio signature is full, clear, and smooth. Details pop with the kind of textural sparkle that borders on premium. Bass response is subtle, but there's more authority than we expected in the lower midrange, lending some muscle to action flicks and dramas. The Ray is also a talented musical companion, balancing everything from jazz to electronic tracks with a deft hand. The sound signature occasionally obscures midrange frequencies when pushed too hard, but that was rarely an issue in testing.\nThe bar's impressive sonic skills do come at a cost elsewhere. Most notably, there's no HDMI ARC connection, offering only an optical input. This means the bar can't accept high-bandwidth audio signals like Dolby Atmos. The other notable drawback is that you can't automatically use your TV remote for power and volume control. Instead, you must use the Sonos app to program your TV remote for IR commands.\nLuckily, most TV remotes are compatible, and the Sonos app walks you through the setup process. And since this is a Sonos device, the app can do much more, from controlling the bar's audio and settings to connecting it with other Sonos speakers as part of a multi-room audio system or a full surround configuration \u2014 something virtually nothing else at this price can match. The Ray also supports pairing with the Sonos Ace headphones, so you can switch to private listening.\nThough many users ran into issues with the Sonos app after an update last year, most of these problems have been fixed. The app still isn't perfect, but in our experience, its lingering shortcomings are not a dealbreaker.\nThe Ray doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity, but the bar's WiFi support enables higher quality from wireless sources. The Ray's unique functionality takes some getting used to, but this mini bar's killer sound makes it an excellent budget proposition for those who want room-filling audio in an apartment.\nVisit our guide to all of the best Sonos soundbars.\nHow we test budget soundbars\nTo find the best budget soundbars, our experts tested multiple models in various use cases. Our biggest focus is sound quality, but we also weigh supported audio formats, connectivity, ease of use, and advanced features like WiFi streaming and smart assistant compatibility.\nWe also evaluate factors for daily use, from setup and size to reliability and convenience perks like an app for adjusting EQ and other settings. As often as possible, we live with each soundbar for multiple days, using it in various scenarios as our main audio device to discover what it's truly like to own.\nWe use a carefully selected list of scenes from familiar films and TV shows for testing material. We look for a well-blended system across bass, midrange, and treble frequencies. We carefully consider dialogue delivery, especially when things get chaotic and during quiet moments.\nWe also listen to a dedicated song list of tracks from multiple music genres and streaming services, including Spotify and high-resolution files on platforms like Amazon Music. We make sure to test each system for Bluetooth and WiFi reliability, as well as the responsiveness and convenience of smart assistants like Amazon Alexa.\nSince our goal for this guide is to highlight the best budget soundbars, we also emphasized overall value, with an eye toward selecting models that closely match the performance of pricier options.\nWhat to look for in a budget soundbar\nWhen shopping for the best budget soundbar, consider the bar's connectivity carefully. HDMI ARC (or eARC) is preferred for pairing with a TV, as it offers higher bandwidth than a digital optical connection. HDMI also enables CEC (Consumer Electronics Control), so you can automatically use your TV's remote to control basic functions on your soundbar. Some budget soundbars, like the Sonos Ray, are limited to a digital optical connection rather than HDMI. An optical connection still works with modern TVs, but you must go through a few extra steps to use your TV's remote to control your soundbar.\nNext, we recommend looking at available audio channels. Many budget models will be limited to 2.0 (stereo audio) or 2.1 channel configurations (which include a low-frequency channel or separate subwoofer for bass). Some models go further, supporting an integrated center channel (denoted as 3.0 or 3.1) or even 5.1-channel surround sound with rear speakers. Moving up in price can get you into soundbars with Dolby Atmos support. Bose's Smart Soundbar, for instance, supports a 3.0.2-channel speaker configuration, which means it offers three front channels and two \"height\" channels to create a more immersive soundstage.\nMany budget soundbars will support both PCM and Dolby Digital stereo as a baseline, while some go further, including DTS formats. Many of the best budget soundbars we test also include virtual surround sound formats like DTS Virtual:X, which uses digital software to create an expanded soundstage. This can offer a notable bump in scope but won't be as effective as true multi-channel surround sound support.\nSoundbars are also great for streaming music. The vast majority of budget soundbars offer at least some form of Bluetooth support to stream from your phone. At the same time, more advanced models include WiFi connectivity for streaming at higher quality from services like Spotify or Apple Music. WiFi connectivity may also enable support for digital assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. If smart features are important to you, you'll want to see if your bar offers built-in voice control via onboard microphones.\nBudget soundbar FAQs\nAre budget soundbars better than your TV's speakers?\nIn short, yes. While some of the best TVs can offer audio quality that competes with cheap soundbars, for the most part, the best budget soundbars will deliver a notable upgrade over TV sound. This is due to various factors, including a soundbar's location in front of the screen, its size and acoustic properties, and dedicated amplifiers and drivers. For these reasons, we recommend shoppers add a soundbar (or full-fledged speaker system) to their TV setup for an improved experience.\nIf you're shopping for a new TV to pair with your soundbar, check out our guides to the best 4K TVs, best smart TVs, best OLED TVs, and best budget TVs.\nHow much should I spend on a budget soundbar?\nOur top pick in this guide costs just over $100, which we consider the baseline when shopping for the best budget soundbar. However, if you're picky about sound, you'll want to consider investing at least $200 to $300 for beefier audio performance. If you want more advanced features and support for Dolby Atmos, expect to spend even more, but you can still get a great experience for under $500.\nThe best budget soundbars often get discounts during big sales like Prime Day and Black Friday.\nWhat is HDMI ARC?\nHDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) is a connection type that transmits audio and video signals. It's integrated into many TVs, soundbars, and AV receivers.\nIf your TV and soundbar have an HDMI ARC port, you can use an HDMI cable to pair them together to send audio signals back and forth. HDMI ARC connections can handle stereo signals and compressed surround sound formats like Dolby Digital, DTS, and even Dolby Atmos via Dolby Digital Plus.\nSome devices use an upgraded version of HDMI ARC, called HDMI eARC (Enhanced Audio Return Channel). This version supports higher-bandwidth audio signals to enable the transmission of lossless Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD MA, and DTS:X tracks to get the best audio quality.\nHDMI ARC and eARC connections also enable a feature called CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) on most modern TVs. This lets you use your display's remote to control basic functions on your soundbar, like power and volume.\nCheck out our guide to the best HDMI cables for recommendations to use with an HDMI ARC connection.\nCan budget soundbars support Dolby Atmos?\nYes, our guide includes a budget-friendly soundbar model with Dolby Atmos support. One thing to note is that while budget-friendly Dolby Atmos soundbars can offer a height element for overhead sound effects, most models in this price range lack separate surround speakers.\nTherefore, entry-level Atmos models may not be as immersive as less expensive soundbar and speaker packages that include actual rear satellites but omit Atmos support. For recommendations with rear speakers, check out our guide to the best surround sound systems.\nFor more information on Atmos technology, check out our guide to all the ins and outs of Dolby Atmos.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "TVs are sold in many sizes, but 65-inch models are among the most popular. This size hits just the right sweet spot for a lot of spaces, offering a big-screen experience that's still suitable for most living rooms. It's also a plus that brands often use 65 inches as the premier size for their flagship displays. However, performance varies a lot depending on the model you buy. That's why I've rounded up the best 65-inch TVs available.\nBased on extensive testing, the Samsung S90D 4K TV earns my highest recommendation overall. Thanks to its OLED panel and quantum dot technology, it delivers stunning contrast and vibrant colors. But if you're looking for a more affordable option, the TCL QM6K is my pick for the best 65-inch TV on a budget. Its image quality isn't as good as pricier displays, but it's impressive for the money.\nI've been reviewing home entertainment products for over a decade and have used that experience to inform my 65-inch TV testing process. My recommendations include various display types, so you're sure to find something here to suit your needs.\nOur top picks for the best 65-inch TVs\nBest overall: Samsung S90D - See at Amazon\nBest on a budget: TCL QM6K - See at Amazon\nBest premium display: LG G5 - See at Amazon\nBest midrange model: TCL QM7K - See at Walmart\nBest anti-glare screen: Samsung S95D - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nThe S90D is our favorite TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class.\n- Excellent peak brightness for a midrange OLED\n- High color volume with quantum dot technology\n- Wide viewing angles so picture doesn't degrade when sitting off center\n- Smart TV interface is OK but not the best\n- Issue with update notifications\n- Dolby Vision isn't supported\nWhen factoring in performance and price, the Samsung S90D is the best 65-inch TV \u2014 and my pick for the best TV period \u2014 that you can buy. It aced all my tests, and it can often be found for around $1,300 to $1,600, which is fantastic for such an impressive display.\nPart of what makes the 65-inch S90D so impressive is the display's use of an OLED panel with quantum dots. Similarly priced LG OLED TVs are missing quantum dots, and this feature enables the S90D to produce brighter colors. Coupled with the TV's infinite contrast ratio, the S90D's quantum dot filter leads to gorgeous high-dynamic-range (HDR) images. In my testing, I measured a peak brightness of around 1,240 nits, which is excellent for a midrange OLED and about 200 nits more than Samsung's older S90C TV.\nAnd though it's disappointing that Samsung doesn't support the Dolby Vision format, which can provide a more fine-tuned HDR image, the S90D's HDR10 and HDR10+ capabilities are so strong that most people won't notice a difference. You can learn more about how various HDR formats compare in our HDR TV guide. The S90D also upscales lower-resolution content well, but it can't match the picture processing of high-end Sony displays.\nWhether you're watching 4K movies in a dark room or channel surfing in an average living room during the day, the S90D looks great. It also has wide viewing angles, so you can sit to the side without a loss in image quality. The smart TV interface is solid as well, though its navigation speed isn't as consistent as I'd like. I also ran into some glitches related to notification pop-ups and automatic app start-ups, but these issues should be easy to fix with firmware.\nOn the plus side, Samsung's OS is one of the few smart TV platforms supporting Xbox Game Pass, which lets members stream high-end games without a console. The TV also supports a high 144Hz refresh rate when paired with a PC, making this an ideal gaming display.\nBuyers should note that a 2025 version of this TV, the S90F, is also available. The new model is a bit brighter but costs a lot more. Given current sale prices, the S90D remains the better value of the two. You can learn more in our full Samsung S90F TV review.\nCheck out our full guide to the best Samsung TVs.\nBest on a budget\nThe QM6K is an excellent entry-level Mini LED TV with solid contrast, vibrant colors, and decent black levels. However, its HDR brightness capabilities are limited compared to step-up models.\n- Solid HDR performance for an entry-level Mini LED TV\n- Local dimming enhances contrast with minimal blooming\n- Google TV navigation is quick and responsive\n- Brightness is limited compared to midrange and high-end QLEDs\n- Viewing angles are improved over older models but are still narrow\nThe QM6K is proof that budget-friendly TVs don't have to sacrifice performance. This QLED set is one of the most affordable displays available with a Mini LED backlight, and this feature helps it stand out from similarly priced competitors.\nThough the QM6K's original launch price was a bit high, the 65-inch model has dropped to a typical cost of around $650, which is an excellent value. Many 65-inch TVs in this tier have low contrast, dim images, and limited color capabilities. But the QM6K offers a wide range of vivid colors, and it's capable of solid contrast and brightness for its class. Picture quality still isn't at the level of pricier TVs, but TCL has managed to pack in several advanced features while maintaining an attractive price.\nDuring my review, the TV hit a peak of 557 nits using a 10% HDR test pattern and about 736 nits on a 50% test pattern. Those are respectable numbers for a budget TV, and they're good enough for a solid entry-level HDR experience. That said, the TV isn't the best fit for rooms with lots of ambient light. For a brighter image, I recommend stepping up to the QM7K, which offers more than double the peak brightness.\nThe QM6K's Mini LED local dimming enables good contrast control, so dark portions of the image stay relatively dark. However, black levels appear a bit lighter than they do on midrange and high-end QLED models, and they're not as precise as an OLED. This is most evident when watching TV with the lights off. And though viewing angles are a bit wider than last year's Q65 model, the QM6K's image still gets washed out when you sit off-center.\nBut while most TVs in this price range are limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, the QM6K can reach a maximum of 144Hz, making it an excellent gaming TV on a budget. This means you get full support for 120Hz modes on a PS5 or Xbox Series X, which enables smoother motion in compatible games.\nI was also impressed by how quick the QM6K's Google TV operating system is. It offers access to all of the most popular streaming apps, and I didn't run into any notable glitches or major hiccups.\nRead our TCL QM6K TV review.\nCheck out our guides to all the best budget TVs and best TVs under $500.\nBest premium display\nThe G5 is LG's flagship OLED TV for 2025. It's one of the brightest OLED TVs we've ever seen, delivering high-end image quality and an elegant design that can hang flush on your wall.\n- Industry-leading OLED brightness\n- Deep black levels with an infinite contrast ratio\n- Wide off-axis viewing\n- High 165Hz refresh rate with a PC\n- Expensive, even compared to other top OLEDs\n- Minor banding in isolated sequences\n- Pedestal stand is not included\n- Some issues with voice search that resolved over time\nThe LG G5 is the high-end TV to beat. This premium OLED dethrones my previous pick in the category, the Sony A95L. The A95L is still an incredible TV, but the G5 bests it in overall image performance.\nThe G5's biggest benefit over other top OLED TVs is its amazing brightness. Though OLEDs used to struggle with brightness, the G5 can actually outperform several flagship QLED sets. On an industry-standard 10% test pattern, I measured a peak of 2,410 nits using the set's most accurate picture mode. That's a whopping 900 nits more than last year's G4 OLED and the highest measurement I've ever recorded on an OLED.\nThis high luminance gives bright HDR highlights, like explosions and shimmering reflections, a noticeable bump in overall impact. At the same time, the G5's OLED screen maintains perfect black levels and pixel-level contrast control, so there's none of the blooming or backlight patchiness that you might see on even the most expensive QLED TVs. Check out our QLED vs. OLED comparison for more details.\nThe G5 also has wide viewing angles, so the image doesn't fade or wash out if you sit to the side of the TV. Gaming capabilities are strong, thanks to a max refresh rate of 165Hz with a PC or 120Hz with a current-gen console like the PS5 and Xbox Series X. LG also now supports the Xbox app, which lets Game Pass members stream games without an Xbox system.\nOf course, the G5 isn't perfect. The TV had some issues with posterization (blocky rather than smooth gradations of colors and shadows), but LG released firmware updates to address this. During my testing, I found this flaw to be so rare that I don't consider it to be a notable drawback.\nLike all LG TVs, the G5 uses the webOS smart TV system, which works well enough for most people's streaming needs. However, I don't love how much the interface emphasizes shopping recommendations, and its content curations aren't the best. The G5's fantastic image quality far outweighs any of these software hiccups, but you can get a more reliable smart TV experience from other platforms like Roku and Google TV.\nFrom a design perspective, the G5 features a premium aesthetic, high-quality materials, and a flush wall mount that allows you to hang it up with no gap. On the downside, unlike last year's G4, this model does not include a pedestal stand. If wall mounting isn't possible in your space, you'll need to buy a stand separately.\nWhile the G5 is my top pick for the best high-end TV right now, there are alternatives that promise similar image quality. Sony just launched a new flagship 65-inch OLED called the Bravia 8 II that could beat the G5 in some areas. Likewise, Panasonic recently released a similar OLED called the Z95B. I'll be testing both models to see how they stack up. But for now, the G5 is the reigning champ.\nRead our LG G5 4K TV review.\nCheck out our guide to the best LG TVs.\nBest midrange model\nThe TCL QM7K is an excellent midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED backlight delivers high brightness, and it has better contrast control and wider viewing angles than last year's model.\n- Excellent HDR brightness for a midrange TV\n- Fantastic backlight control with virtually no blooming\n- Improved viewing angles over last year's model\n- Supports up to a 144Hz refresh rate for PC gamers\n- Black levels aren't quite as deep as we've seen on other Mini LED models\n- Pedestal stand's depth could be an issue for soundbar placement\n- Though decent for a QLED, viewing angles still can't match those of an OLED\nThe QM7K is one of the best midrange 65-inch TVs available. This model replaces last year's QM7, which is now hard to find in stock, and it offers improved contrast control and viewing angles.\nLike TCL's cheaper QM6K, the QM7K has a QLED panel with a Mini LED backlight, up to a 144Hz refresh rate, and support for the Google TV operating system. But the QM7K sets itself apart with much higher brightness.\nI measured a peak of around 1,800 nits, which is impressive for this price range. Such high brightness gives HDR content sparkling intensity and gives you plenty of headroom to pump up SDR (standard dynamic range) luminance to fight glare. This is especially useful when watching sports in a room with lots of windows.\nThe QM7K also has local dimming to adjust its light output across specific zones. This model has more zones than the QM6K, and its dimming system has been upgraded over the older QM7. During my testing, the TV produced excellent contrast without any notable blooming or halos. I encountered some patchiness in dark scenes when reviewing the 2024 QM7, which caused an uneven look in shadows, but the QM7K is able to handle these sequences without any issues.\nHowever, the QM7K's black levels are a bit lighter than I've seen on some higher-end QLED models. Though still deep, they don't entirely disappear in a dark room, and they still lack the pixel-level precision of an OLED. Likewise, the TV's viewing angles aren't as wide as those of an OLED, but TCL has made improvements in this regard. The image still washes out a bit from an off-center position, but not nearly as much as it did on last year's QM7.\nThough its initial list price was a bit high, the 65-inch QM7K is often on sale for around $900. At that price, this is easily one of the best 65-inch TVs you can get for under $1,000.\nCheck out our guide to the best sports TVs.\nBest anti-glare screen\nSamsung's S95D is the brightest OLED we\u2019ve ever tested. It features a new matte screen that nearly eliminates reflections, making it ideal for rooms that struggle with glare. However, the matte design gives black levels a slightly faded look in direct light.\n- The brightest OLED we've tested\n- Matte screen significantly reduces glare and reflections\n- 144Hz refresh rate for smooth PC gaming\n- Slim design with One Connect Box\n- Doesn't support Dolby Vision\n- Glare-free coating elevates black levels in bright rooms\n- Pricey compared to 2023 counterpart\nReflections are tricky to deal with in rooms that let in a lot of light. Most TVs use glossy panels, and while this type of screen offers great contrast, it creates a mirror-like effect with glare. To solve this, the Samsung S95D uses a unique matte coating.\nThe S95D's screen nearly eliminates direct reflections. Seriously, this set is a game changer for rooms where glare is unavoidable. The S95D is also quite bright for an OLED, offering a peak of about 1,700 nits with HDR content and nearly 800 nits with SDR. This makes it ideal for people who like to watch TV during the day.\nHowever, the S95D's matte screen isn't perfect, and it has one notable drawback. When light hits the screen, it scatters in such a way that it elevates black levels. This isn't noticeable when watching bright content, but dim scenes take on a slightly faded look. Thankfully, in a dark room with the lights off, black levels look just as deep as they do on any OLED.\nThere's a clear tradeoff here, and ultimately, whether the S95D is the right fit for your needs comes down to your personal preferences as a viewer. But if reflections are a big problem in your space, this could be the solution you're looking for.\nSamsung also sells a 2025 version of this TV, the S95F, that gets a bit brighter. The new model is an excellent high-end TV with similar anti-glare performance, but it costs a lot more, so I only recommend it to big TV enthusiasts.\nRead our Samsung S95D 4K TV review and Samsung S95F 4K TV review.\nHow we test 65-inch TVs\nTo pick the best 65-inch TVs, our reviewers relied on hands-on testing bolstered by more than a decade's worth of experience covering home entertainment products. To test displays, we evaluate general picture clarity, contrast performance, HDR peak brightness, color, off-axis viewing, smart TV features, and value for the money.\nBrightness is measured using a colorimeter. Other objective display capabilities are evaluated using test patterns found on the Spears & Munsil UHD HDR Benchmark 4K Blu-ray disc.\nBut while test patterns are important to get a sense of a display's capabilities, they only tell part of the story. What's even more important is how a TV actually looks when displaying real-world content. With that in mind, we also use these displays for day-to-day viewing and watch lots of scenes from movies and TV shows with clips specifically selected to emphasize black levels, highlights, color capabilities, and upscaling. Our demo material includes a mix of 4K, 1080p high-definition (HD), and standard-definition (SD) content from streaming devices, cable TV, and Blu-ray discs. We also watch content in different lighting conditions to evaluate bright-room and dark-room performance.\nThe best 65-inch TVs will also have excellent smart TV features, so we test overall navigation speed and app stability, voice search, digital assistant integration, and extra perks like game streaming support.\nFor more info on our review process, visit our page detailing how we test tech products.\n65-inch TV FAQs\nIs it worth buying a 65-inch TV?\nIf you have the space for it, we think 65 inches is the ideal size to start looking at when shopping for a new TV, especially a 4K model. Many brands use 65 inches as their flagship size to showcase their best 4K TVs, and this size is great for delivering big-screen immersion without taking up too much room. If you're looking for a media console or mount to use with a 65-inch TV, check out our guides to the best TV stands and best TV wall mounts for our top picks.\nOf course, you can still find excellent TV models in smaller sizes if you need something more compact. Likewise, top displays are available in larger sizes if you want an even more immersive screen.\nCheck out our other size-specific guides for more display recommendations:\nShould you buy a 2025 or 2024 65-inch TV?\nAll of the major TV brands have released new display models for 2025. However, many 2024 TVs remain available and are expected to stay in stock for the better part of the year. These older models are often much cheaper than their 2025 counterparts.\nThough there are exceptions, most 2024 TVs offer very similar performance when compared to their 2025 successors. For that reason, we continue to recommend certain 2024 TV models as top picks. For instance, the Samsung S90D and S95D in this guide are both 2024 models.\nFor more details on new 65-inch displays, check out our 2025 TV roundups:\n- Samsung 2025 QLED and OLED TV details\n- LG 2025 OLED TV details\n- Top TVs announced at CES 2025\n- A breakdown of 2025 TV trends\nHow much should you spend on a 65-inch TV?\nExactly how much you should spend on a 65-inch TV depends on your viewing needs. The best 65-inch TVs range in price from around $500 to over $3,000. You can also find cheaper entry-level 65-inch TVs for under $400, but we generally recommend paying more for one of our above-mentioned picks.\nBuyers shopping for a midrange 65-inch TV should expect to spend $500-$1,000. In this price range, you can find 65-inch QLED TVs that offer advanced picture quality features, like local dimming, and good brightness performance that can reach 600-1,800 nits.\nBuyers who want an upper-midrange or high-end 65-inch TV should be looking to spend $1,000-$4,000. You can find advanced 65-inch QLED TVs that deliver up to 3,000 nits of brightness in the $1,000-$2,000 range, while the best OLED TVs with infinite contrast ratios tend to sell for $1,500-$4,000.\nThe best 65-inch TVs often go on sale throughout the year, but the lowest prices are available during sales events like Prime Day and Black Friday and around major sports championships like the Super Bowl.\nHow far should you sit from a 65-inch 4K TV?\nThe benefits of a 4K screen become most noticeable when you sit at a distance of around one to 1.5 times the size of your TV. At that distance, you'll be able to see the extra detail that 4K resolution offers compared to a 1080p high-definition screen. The ideal viewing distance for a 65-inch 4K TV should be between 5.4 and 8.1 feet from your TV.\nYou can sit farther away and still enjoy a 65-inch 4K TV, but that range will yield the best visible detail. Otherwise, you'll want a bigger screen to get the full benefits of 4K.\nShould you purchase a 65-inch 8K TV?\nThough some brands sell 65-inch 8K TVs, we don't recommend buying one in this screen size. When viewing it at a reasonable distance, 65 inches just isn't big enough to show off the benefits of an 8K resolution screen.\nA 75-inch or larger 8K TV is better suited for highlighting the additional detail you get with 8K resolution, but even then, the benefits are subtle. We recommend saving money and going with a 4K model if you want a 65-inch TV.\nDo TVs have good sound quality?\nThough the best 65-inch TV models have better built-in speaker systems than smaller displays, performance is still limited compared to a separate soundbar or surround sound setup. Speakers integrated into most TVs use small audio drivers that can lead to weak bass and muddy dialogue.\nWe recommend buying a soundbar to improve audio performance. For the most immersive experience, look for models that support Dolby Atmos, a spatial audio format that can spread sound effects around your room.\nCheck out our speaker and soundbar guides to see our top recommendations:\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "There's nothing worse than sitting down for movie night only to be greeted with muddy dialogue you can't understand and tiny bass that lacks oomph. Even some of the most expensive TVs suffer from wimpy sound, with built-in speakers that lack depth and clarity. To improve performance, we suggest investing in a soundbar. The best soundbars can be a game changer for your home entertainment setup, making it easier to hear your favorite TV shows and movies while delivering a more immersive soundfield.\nOur team has been reviewing audio products for over a decade, and we've used that experience to recommend the best soundbars for a variety of needs. Based on extensive testing, our top pick is the Samsung HW-Q990C. This powerful Dolby Atmos system spreads sound in all directions, complete with separate surround speakers and a wireless subwoofer. But if you want something with a more modest footprint, we recommend the midrange Yamaha YAS-209. This affordable soundbar is perfect for anyone who wants a simple yet versatile audio solution.\nBelow, you can browse all of our picks for the best soundbars of 2025. We have models for every budget and use case, from entry-level stereo soundbars to premium systems with 11.1.4 audio channels.\nEditor's note: Ryan Waniata contributed to the FAQ section in this guide.\nOur top picks for the best soundbars\nBest overall: Samsung HW-Q990C - See at Amazon\nBest midrange: Yamaha YAS-209 - See at Amazon\nBest on a budget: Vizio V-Series V21d-J8 - See at Walmart\nBest all-in-one option: Sonos Arc Ultra - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nThis powerful 11.1.4 soundbar system has up-firing drivers, a dedicated subwoofer, and separate rear satellite speakers. It takes up more space than smaller options, but delivers the best Dolby Atmos performance we\u2019ve heard in a system like this.\n- Class-leading Dolby Atmos and DTS:X immersion\n- Quick and snappy setup\n- Rugged, minimalist design\n- No Chromecast or HDMI 2.1 support\n- Spotify Connect quirks with iPhone\n- Only minor upgrades compared to 2022 model\nSamsung's Q990C is the best soundbar for anyone who wants cinematic performance at a reasonable price. This powerful 11.1.4-channel system isn't as space-saving as some of our other picks, but it fully engulfs you in sound from all directions.\nDolby Atmos support is one of the Q990C's key features. This technology is designed to spread audio effects all around your room, including above your head. To accomplish this, the Q990C has four up-firing drivers to bounce sound effects off your ceiling, four side-firing drivers, a pair of dedicated rear speakers, a beefy subwoofer, and an array of additional drivers.\nThese components come together to fuel a killer sound system that places you directly into the action of your favorite movies, TV shows, and video games. But the Q990C isn't just about raw power. During our testing, it also delivered excellent balance and natural transitions between speakers, helping it enhance a wide range of genres, from sitcoms and action flicks to jazz and hip-hop.\nThe Q990C is also packed with additional features, like support for hands-free Alexa voice control. It's compatible with all the major audio formats, including Dolby Atmos' primary rival, DTS:X, as well as many high-resolution audio files. An HDMI eARC port, optical port, and a pair of HDMI inputs with 4K HDR passthrough are built in, so you get plenty of connection options. However, the HDMI inputs lack HDMI 2.1 support, so they can't deliver 120Hz gaming signals from a PS5 or Xbox.\nThe soundbar is also designed to pair with many of the best Samsung TVs, like the S95D and S95F 4K OLED, via a feature called Q-Symphony. This lets you use your TV's speakers as part of a combined audio system with the Q990C. The soundbar still sounds fantastic without this mode engaged, but it's a cool bonus for Samsung TV owners.\nBuyers should note that Samsung sells updated versions of this soundbar, including the new Q990F. The latest model adds a few features, including HDMI 2.1 support for 4K/120Hz passthrough. The Q990F also has a more compact subwoofer with a revised design. The Q990F impressed us during our review, but given the current price difference between models, the cheaper Q990C is a better value while it remains in stock.\nRead our Samsung HW-Q990C soundbar review and Samsung HW-Q990F soundbar review.\nVisit our guide to all the best Dolby Atmos soundbars.\nBest midrange\nYamaha's YAS-209 is a convenient 2.1-channel soundbar with great sound quality, a wireless subwoofer, and a reasonable price.\n- Room-filling sound\n- Alexa built-in\n- Sleek appearance\n- Wireless subwoofer included\n- No onboard display\n- Doesn't support Dolby Vision passthrough\n- No Atmos capabilities\nThe YAS-209 isn't as immersive as pricier soundbar models, but it delivers good audio quality for the money and includes a wireless subwoofer for dedicated bass. This is the type of classic, space-saving audio setup many think of when shopping for a soundbar, and it makes for a nice, no-fuss upgrade to built-in TV speakers.\nThe 2.1-channel system delivers native stereo playback with left and right separation. It also has DTS Virtual:X processing to create a simulated surround sound effect. It's not as convincing as more expensive systems that feature side-firing audio drivers or actual rear speakers, but it does a decent job. With or without virtual surround, the system provides clear and balanced audio for various types of content.\nThe YAS-209 connects to your TV using its HDMI ARC port, and the soundbar has a handy HDMI-in port that supports passing through video at up to 4K resolution at 60Hz with HDR (but not Dolby Vision) from a connected device, like a gaming console or Blu-ray player.\nAn optical audio port is also featured for older TVs without HDMI ARC, and you can wirelessly stream music via Bluetooth or WiFi. Thanks to its built-in microphones, the YAS-209 has integrated support for Amazon Alexa, enabling voice control for functions like volume.\nThis model has been around for several years, and it's missing some advanced features like Dolby Atmos support that you'd find on some newer options, but it's still hard to beat the overall value that the YAS-209 offers. The audio quality here is great for the price, making this one of the best soundbars available for under $500.\nBest for budget shoppers\nWith a simple design and decent audio performance, Vizio's V-Series is a great pick for buyers looking to spend less.\n- Affordable price\n- HDMI ARC and Optical connections\n- Bluetooth for music streaming from a phone\n- Audio performance is very basic\n- No HDMI video passthrough\n- Doesn't include a subwoofer\nThe Vizio V-Series V21d-J8 is a simple 2.1-channel soundbar built for buyers on a budget. It doesn't offer advanced audio performance or Dolby Atmos support, but this affordable bar still delivers a decent upgrade over the built-in speakers found on most midrange TVs.\nThe soundbar has integrated woofers, meaning you'll get two main channels for left and right stereo sound plus a little extra bass, even though the system doesn't have a separate subwoofer unit. Vizio also uses DTS Virtual:X processing to simulate surround and height effects. The tech employed here is nowhere near as convincing as what you'd get on a high-end soundbar like the Sonos Arc Ultra, but it still expands the device's soundstage.\nStanding out from the typical boxy design we see on most soundbars, the V-Series has angled sides that slope down to create a hexagonal profile. Buttons for various controls, including volume, source, Bluetooth audio, and power, rest on the side of the bar.\nThe soundbar has an HDMI ARC port for easy connection to modern smart TVs, and you also get an optical audio port if your TV doesn't have an HDMI connection. There's no HDMI video passthrough, but you can hook up older audio sources to the bar's 3.5mm auxiliary port.\nThe V-Series supports Bluetooth for wireless playback, making it easy to stream music from your smartphone, but you can't stream via WiFi. An included remote handles all your needs for adjusting volume, accessing basic equalizer options, and toggling various modes.\nCheck out our guide to all the best budget soundbars.\nBest all-in-one option\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra carries over everything we loved about the original Arc soundbar while offering bigger bass, improved Dolby Atmos immersion, and cleaner dialogue. It's pricey, but few stand-alone soundbars can match its performance.\n- Noticeable bass increase over the previous Arc\n- Exceptional dialogue clarity\n- Detailed spatial effects with Dolby Atmos\n- Slightly sleeker design\n- More expensive than original Arc soundbar\n- Sonos app still experiencing occasional bugs and glitches\n- Optical connection requires additional adapter\n- No DTS:X support\nIn many ways, the Sonos Arc Ultra is the quintessential all-in-one soundbar. It offers a slick design, immersive Dolby Atmos audio performance, and a simplified setup that gets you up and running in minutes \u2014 all from a single bar that rests in front of your TV.\nThe Arc Ultra doesn't come with a separate subwoofer or rear speakers, but it still delivers impressive sound without them. This model is the successor to the standard Sonos Arc, and the Ultra offers a nice upgrade in bass and overall clarity.\nTo accomplish its beefier performance, the Ultra uses Sonos' new Sound Motion driver, which packs powerful woofers into a compact space while freeing up room to add additional tweeters in other parts of the bar. With 14 drivers total, including both side- and up-firing ones, the Arc Ultra provides a 9.1.4-channel Dolby Atmos experience that surrounds you in a dome of sound. You can even stream Atmos music from supported services like Amazon via the Sonos app.\nThe app also lets you tune the sound, connect to other Sonos speakers, and initiate the brand's TV Swap feature. TV Swap lets you transition to private listening when paired with Sonos Ace headphones. Though many users ran into issues with a Sonos software update last year, many of those problems have been corrected. The app still isn't perfect, but our reviewer didn't encounter any major hiccups and didn't find the app's flaws to detract from the overall value of the Arc Ultra.\nThe Arc Ultra's minimalist design is appealing, but it does have some downsides. Like its predecessor, it has limited inputs. There's no spare HDMI connection or optical port, though you can buy an optical adapter. And though standard DTS 5.1 audio is supported, the Arc Ultra does not support DTS' 3D surround sound format, DTS:X.\nOn the plus side, the Arc Ultra does add one notable feature that was missing from the original Arc: Bluetooth support. It also has a new Advanced Speech Enhancement mode that can emphasize dialogue without affecting the quality of other sound effects.\nThe Arc Ultra's $999 asking price is a bit high, but we think its performance justifies its cost. With excellent sound and many modern features, it's one of the best soundbars we've reviewed and a convenient way to upgrade your audio setup.\nRead our Sonos Arc Ultra review.\nCheck out our guide to the best Sonos soundbars.\nHow we test soundbars\nTo determine the best soundbars, our reviewers test various factors, including audio quality, format support, connectivity options, and smart features. We've been covering home theater products for more than a decade and use that experience to inform our testing parameters.\nWe also evaluate factors like overall value, build quality, aesthetics, and ease of use. After all, convenience is a big advantage of choosing a soundbar over a more traditional speaker system. The best soundbars should be simple to set up and integrate into your entertainment setup.\nWhen reviewing soundbars, we evaluate low-, mid-, and high-frequency performance using a mix of test movies and shows across different genres. We also pay attention to how easy it is to hear dialogue using multiple settings, and we test audio at numerous volume levels to ensure the soundbar can get loud without losing quality.\nWe also listen to various music tracks that have been selected to showcase different frequencies. This helps us determine if the soundbar sounds tinny or distorted and maintains good sonic detail and instrumental definition for various styles, such as rock, pop, acoustic music, and hip-hop.\nBeyond specific demo material, we use each soundbar we test in our daily TV watching, gaining a sense of how the bar performs in general use. For more information about our testing process, check out our breakdown on how we review tech products.\nWhat to look for in a soundbar\nWhen shopping for a soundbar, pay close attention to various specs, including size and the number of audio channels supported.\nEntry-level soundbars tend to be smaller and limited to basic two-channel stereo sound, while more expensive soundbars are larger and support more channels for surround sound. Some models consist of a single soundbar unit, others include a separate subwoofer, and some even have extra rear speakers. Bigger, multi-speaker soundbar systems will deliver the best audio performance, but they'll take up more room.\nAll of the best soundbars support basic stereo PCM and Dolby Digital audio formats at the very least. But if you want a more immersive experience, you should look for soundbars that support DTS Virtual:X or true spatial audio formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.\nThe best soundbars have HDMI ARC or eARC ports to connect to your TV, but it's also nice when models include additional wired options like optical and 3.5mm to connect to older TVs or additional audio components. Extra HDMI ports to pass through video from connected devices like a Blu-ray player or gaming console are also great, but shouldn't be expected on entry-level models.\nBluetooth music streaming is common on many of the best soundbars, but options supporting WiFi streaming will deliver even better sound quality. If you want a soundbar that can double as a smart speaker, you should find one with built-in microphones and Alexa or Google Assistant.\nHow do I connect a soundbar?\nMost soundbars we test connect to a TV with an HDMI cable via an HDMI ARC or eARC port. This is the most convenient connection type and the only way to source high-quality formats like Dolby Atmos from your TV directly. In most cases, the HDMI ARC connection also allows you to use your TV remote to control a soundbar's volume and power, reducing clutter.\nEven if you're using a TV that's several years old, there's a good chance it supports HDMI ARC. You can find out by checking your TV's input section and looking for an HDMI port labeled \"HDMI ARC\" or \"HDMI eARC.\"\nCheck out our guide to the best HDMI cables for our top recommendations to use with soundbars and TVs.\nIf your TV does not allow for an HDMI ARC or eARC connection, you must use an alternative connection like an optical digital port. This still allows for good sound quality but doesn't support 3D audio formats like Dolby Atmos. In that case, you may also want to consider upgrading your TV.\nEntry-level 4K TVs with HDMI ARC can now be purchased for about $500 or less, depending on size. Check out our TV buying guides for top recommendations across different price ranges:\nSoundbar FAQs\nAre soundbars worth it?\nEven cheap soundbars deliver better audio quality than the speakers you'll find built into most displays. To keep costs down and ensure that the speakers fit within a flat-screen design, TVs usually include small drivers and poor placement that can result in thin, muddy sound. The best soundbars add more dimension, clarity, and bass to your TV-watching experience.\nSoundbars can also improve the definition of dialogue and other effects for those with hearing issues. That's especially true for soundbars with a dedicated center channel, where most dialogue and other important movie and TV sound effects are directed.\nWhat size soundbar should I get?\nSize is an important factor to consider when shopping for a new soundbar. Many single-unit soundbars are built with a width of around 25 inches, while some ultra-compact models can be as small as 14 inches wide. On the other end of the spectrum, high-end soundbar models can be as big as 50 inches wide.\nGenerally speaking, bigger soundbar models deliver better sound quality since they can incorporate more speaker drivers with larger dimensions. But smaller bars are often cheaper, more convenient, and easier to set up.\nIf you plan to put your soundbar on an entertainment console with your TV, you should measure that area before purchasing. This way, you can ensure that the soundbar you choose won't be too wide to rest on your TV stand and that its height won't block your display.\nCan soundbars do surround sound?\nMany of the best soundbars can support multiple audio channels for surround sound. These channels refer to how many directions sound can be sent through the device.\nEntry-level soundbars often support two channels for basic left and right stereo playback, but many midrange and high-end models support surround sound with five or more channels. These channels generally include a center channel for dialogue and rear channels via extra audio drivers, satellite speakers, or virtualization techniques.\nChannel specifications are listed as a string of up to three numbers separated by decimal points. The first number represents how many standard ear-level channels are included (left, right, center, surrounds). The second number indicates if the device includes a dedicated low-frequency channel or a separate subwoofer for extra bass. The final number indicates how many height channels are included for Dolby Atmos support.\nBuyers who just want a simple upgrade from their TV's integrated audio will likely be satisfied with a compact 2.0 or 2.1 soundbar system. But if you're looking for a more complete home theater experience, you'll want to opt for a 5.1 surround sound system or above.\nFor more recommendations, check out our complete guide to the best surround sound systems.\nWhat is Dolby Atmos?\nDolby Atmos is an immersive surround sound format that uses object-based audio mixing. In practice, this means that sounds can be more precisely positioned around your room, with effects placed in all directions, including overhead. For instance, when rain falls from the sky or a helicopter flies overhead, you can actually hear the sound coming from above.\nDolby Atmos soundbars can use one of two methods to create overhead sound effects. The first involves audio processing to create a simulated sense of height from regular ear-level speakers. The second method uses up-firing drivers angled up instead of forward to bounce sound effects off your ceiling. Good up-firing drivers provide a much more convincing sense of overhead sound than audio processing can produce alone.\nFor more specifics, see our What is Dolby Atmos explainer.\nDo I need a subwoofer?\nA subwoofer can be an integral part of your cinematic and musical experience. Due to basic physics, soundbars alone can't offer the deep bass frequencies you'd get from a subwoofer. If you're looking for earth-rattling thunder, hefty boom from explosions, and powerful bass beats, you'll want to consider a soundbar that either includes a subwoofer or, at the very least, allows you to add one later.\nFor our top recommendations, check out our guide to the best soundbars with subwoofers.\nWhat are the top soundbar brands?\nSeveral audio brands make excellent soundbars, but certain companies are better at specific performance tiers than others.\nVizio, Roku, TCL, and Hisense are solid companies to consider when shopping for an entry-level soundbar. Meanwhile, brands like Yamaha, Sonos, and Bose offer several great midrange and upper-midrange soundbars. Samsung and Sony offer reliable soundbars across a range of budgets, but sell particularly good high-end models. Sennheiser is also a good brand to keep in mind if you're looking for a premium soundbar.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "The Samsung S90F OLED TV is the successor to the brand's S90D, which is the reigning champ in Insider Reviews' guide to the best TVs. This new 2025 model is yet another excellent television, and it delivers a brighter image than its predecessor. Unlike most OLEDs in this class, the S90F uses quantum dot color technology, which results in a more vibrant picture.\nOut-of-the-box color accuracy is fantastic, exceeding many comparably priced rivals. While the S90F isn't the absolute brightest OLED on the market, it has more than enough luminance for a typical room and deep black levels that provide amazing contrast in a dim home theater.\nHowever, as impressive as the S90F is, it's important to remember that last year's similar S90D is still available and often on sale for a lot less. Though the S90F is a worthy successor, most people are still better off snagging the cheaper S90D while it remains in stock. But as the year goes on, the S90D will sell out, and the S90F will drop in price, making it a top contender to seize the crown as the best TV overall.\nThe S90F is an impressive midrange OLED and one of our favorite new displays of 2025. It gets a bit brighter than last year's S90D and offers better color volume than similar LG OLED models.\n- QD-OLED panel offers excellent peak brightness\n- Great gaming performance with up to 144Hz refresh rate and VRR support\n- High color volume for rich, accurate saturation\n- Wide viewing angles\n- Smart interface can be frustrating to navigate\n- No Dolby Vision support\n- Not all sizes use a QD-OLED panel\n- Black levels lift a bit in bright rooms\nThe TV has a great design, but beware that not all sizes are created equal\nThe S90F is available in six screen sizes \u2014 42, 48, 55, 65, 77, and 83 inches. However, it's important to note that only the 55-, 65-, and 77-inch versions use a QD-OLED panel. The others use a non-quantum dot OLED, so their color performance isn't quite as advanced. My sample was a 65-inch S90F, so my impressions also apply to the 55- and 77-inch sizes.\nAll sizes have an incredibly thin frame that looks sleek and stylish. The S90F's profile is notably slimmer than many competing Mini LED TV models, like the TCL QM8K, since its OLED panel doesn't require space for a separate backlight. Its thickest point is only 1.6 inches, where its back panel protrudes to house the TV's electronics and connections.\nThe majority of the display's ports are either side- or down-facing, which allows the TV to be mounted very close to the wall if desired. Despite requiring no screws to assemble, the included pedestal stand feels stable and holds the S90F well. It measures 14.4 inches wide by 10.4 inches deep, so it still comfortably fits on a thinner credenza or table.\nThere are four HDMI inputs, and they're all version 2.1 with support for up to a 4K/144Hz signal. But to get full bandwidth capabilities, it's important to make sure Input Signal Plus is activated in the TV's menu. The setting can be found by navigating to General & Privacy, then External Device Manager, then Input Signal Plus. You can turn this on for each HDMI input, and it enables the port to receive high-bandwidth signals. If it's set to off, the TV will not be able to display at 4K/120Hz (or 144Hz for PC gaming).\nThe S90F comes with Samsung's compact SolarCell remote with Alexa and Bixby voice control. There's an additional AI button at the top of the remote this year, but otherwise, its face is identical to previous models. The small size of the remote keeps all of its functions easily within thumb's reach, but the tiny buttons could be mildly frustrating to use if you're someone with large hands.\nThe remote's rear has a solar panel for charging, so you don't need batteries, and it has a USB-C port as a backup if you ever run out of juice from light sources.\nThe S90F's excellent color volume delivers vibrant images\nAs I mentioned above, I reviewed the 65-inch S90F, which uses a QD-OLED panel. One of the benefits of a QD-OLED screen over regular OLED (called WOLED) is color volume. WOLEDs rely on white light that passes through a color filter. But QD-OLEDs use blue light with red and green quantum dots. Without getting too into the weeds with technical details, this process enables a QD-OLED to produce higher color volume with brighter, purer saturation.\nUsing my X-rite i1 Pro 3 spectrophotometer, C6 HDR5000 colorimeter, Murideo Seven-G 8K pattern generator, and Calman calibration software from Portrait Displays, I measured the S90F's P3 color gamut coverage at 99.78% in Filmmaker Mode (the TV's most accurate setting). That's an exceptional number at the top end of what TVs can achieve. The P3 color gamut is what modern high dynamic range (HDR) movies and TV shows use, so the S90F is capable of displaying the full range of colors that Hollywood productions are graded for. On top of that, its color accuracy is excellent. This all results in bright, realistic colors that look stunning on screen.\nI watched several HDR videos to test the TV's real-world performance. The explosions in \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" burst in swirls of red, orange, and yellow. Skin tones looked natural and not overblown. The TV's accurate, vibrant hues accentuated the film's changing color palette, starkly delineating the red and yellow day sequences from the rich blue scenes at night. The S90F allowed the film's stylistic look to shine through and create a highly engaging cinematic experience.\nHowever, like all Samsung TVs, the S90F doesn't support Dolby Vision HDR, instead opting for HDR10+, a competing royalty-free HDR format originally developed by 20th Century Studios, Panasonic, and (surprise) Samsung. Both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ do the same thing \u2014 adjust the picture on a scene-by-scene or frame-by-frame basis to offer the most accurate HDR image your TV is capable of. But Dolby Vision content is more widespread, and it allows more fine-tuning in post-production that could lead to better performance. You can learn more about the pros and cons of different high dynamic range formats in our HDR guide. Ultimately, the benefits of Dolby Vision are too subtle to be considered a must-have, but this is one area where the S90F is a step behind OLEDs from LG and Sony.\nWhen it comes to brightness, though, the S90F edges out other OLEDs in this price range while also delivering a decent upgrade over last year's S90D. The S90D offered around 1,240 nits of brightness on a standard 10% window. The S90F improves that number by a couple of hundred nits, with a max of around 1,457 nits on a 10% window. Smaller window sizes can hit an even higher peak of around 1,620 nits. This allows specular highlights (like explosions and light sources in movies and TV shows) to really pop. For example, a scene with stars against a black night sky sparkles with a wonderful intensity on the S90F.\nThe S90F's OLED panel also enables perfect black levels when watching TV in a dark room, completely free from any of the patchiness or uneven backlighting that can pop up on QLED and Mini LED sets. That said, ambient light causes those black levels to slightly elevate, which makes them look a little gray in a bright room. This is due to the TV's QD-OLED panel lacking a polarizing layer, which is something that LG's WOLEDs have. A TV's overall brightness is higher without this filter, but it also allows light to reflect internally and adversely affect the screen's black levels.\nDuring regular viewing, this rise in black level is only slightly apparent, and it's not as distracting as it is on TVs that use a matte screen coating, like the flagship Samsung S95F. Even in a room with ambient light, I found myself able to sit back and enjoy TV shows without any major issues. And though it does have a glossy finish, the S90F handles direct reflections well.\nThe S90F also has extremely wide viewing angles, which is a benefit found on all OLED displays. There's no visual degradation to the color or brightness, even from more than 60 degrees off-axis. If you have a large group over to watch TV or a movie, you can be sure everyone is getting a similar experience.\nAs a whole, the S90F's picture performance is remarkable for its price. Compared to other 2025 TV models, its closest competitor is the LG C5, which is often sold for around the same amount. Performance between the two is a trade-off as you get better color and brightness on the S90F, but better daytime black level performance and Dolby Vision support on the C5.\nThe interface is quick, but a bit frustrating to navigate\nSamsung uses the Tizen smart TV operating system, and the company has made some improvements over the past couple of years that have made navigation far more responsive than it used to be. I have an older S90C in my bedroom, and even with a consistent flow of updates to the OS over the years, moving the cursor around the home screen can be frustrating, as it stutters or fails to respond right away. The S90F, on the other hand, is zippy and smooth, and apps load quickly.\nBut I find Tizen's organization to be cumbersome, and it requires a good amount of setup and customization to work well. The S90F autoplays the last app that was used if you let it sit idle for a few seconds, and the setting to turn this off is buried within the Smart Features menu. In order to add new apps to the home screen, it takes a bunch of clicks and searching to find them in the Apps tab, move them to the main page, and then shift them from the end of the apps bar to a more accessible spot toward the beginning.\nIf you have external devices attached to the TV, there isn't an input select button on the remote, so you need to navigate to Connected Devices and then scroll over to the desired input. Everything feels like it takes a few more button presses than it needs to.\nFor gamers, though, Tizen's centralized gaming screen is a useful feature. All gaming options, including cloud gaming services like Nvidia GeForce Now and Xbox Game Pass, are in one place that can be easily accessed by clicking on the side-bar menu's Gaming Hub. If you have a console connected, it will be shown on that page as well.\nThe TV also supports a suite of AI features that Samsung has dubbed \"Vision AI,\" including image and audio enhancements, but none of these functions are all that noteworthy. I generally recommend just keeping the TV in Filmmaker mode to get the most accurate picture.\nShould you buy the Samsung S90F TV?\nThe Samsung S90F is one of 2025's top upper-midrange TVs. It has great contrast and a bright, detailed picture that's incredibly color accurate. The high refresh rate and cloud gaming support also make it an excellent gaming TV.\nThe TV's black levels are perfect in a dark room but slightly compromised in a brighter space, and the Tizen OS isn't my favorite smart TV interface. But those strikes are small compared to the S90F's many strengths.\nWhen it comes to direct OLED competitors, the LG C5 is a worthy alternative for people who prefer the LG brand. Ignoring limited-time discounts, both TVs are typically sold for around the same price. I prefer the C5's interface, and its black levels are better than the S90F's when viewed in a bright room. But the C5 can't match the S90F's color volume or overall brightness. So, the choice between the two comes down to whether you prioritize color and brightness over daytime black levels and navigation.\nIt's also key to remember that last year's S90D can still be found for a lot less money. It's a little dimmer, but it's otherwise a very similar display. With that in mind, the S90D still remains the better buy for most people. But as stock of the S90D runs out and the S90F's price comes down later this year, this newer model will take the upper hand. Based on past price trends for similar Samsung models, I expect the 65-inch S90F to drop down to as low as $1,600 in the fall. So, you may want to hold off until deals pop up over the coming months.\nFor more recommendations, check out our guide to all of the best Samsung TVs.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "The popularity of 75- and 77-inch TVs has surged over the last few years. They're now available from every major brand, and the best 75-inch TVs are a lot more affordable than they used to be. In fact, I have a 75-inch TV in my living room, and I love the sense of scope and immersion it offers for movie nights, gaming sessions, and big sports events.\nBut you shouldn't buy just any TV simply because it's big. Certain models offer better features, image quality, and overall value than others. That's why I've rounded up my top five picks for the best 75-inch TVs on the market. The Samsung S90D earns my highest recommendation for most people thanks to its high-contrast OLED screen and excellent color performance. But if you're looking for something more budget-friendly, I recommend the 75-inch TCL QM6K. The QM6K's QLED screen isn't as advanced, but it still delivers solid image quality and smooth Google TV navigation.\nI've been reviewing home entertainment products for over a decade, and all of my picks for the best 75-inch TVs are based on extensive testing. Just note that while LCD-based TVs (LED, QLED, Neo QLED) have a 75-inch screen size, OLED displays have a slightly larger 77-inch size. For that reason, I've included 77-inch OLED TVs in this guide.\nOur top picks for the best 75-inch and 77-inch TVs\nBest overall: Samsung S90D 4K OLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest for picture quality: LG G5 4K OLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest on a budget: TCL QM6K 4K QLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest anti-glare model: Samsung S95D 4K OLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest high-end QLED: TCL QM8K 4K QLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nThe 77-inch S90D is a fantastic extra-large TV. Its QD-OLED screen delivers an infinite contrast ratio and bright colors, offering some of the best image quality you can get at this price range.\n- Great peak brightness for an OLED in this class\n- High color volume with quantum dot tech\n- Viewing angles are wide\n- Navigation speed is inconsistent\n- Encountered a few signal glitches and issues with update notifications\n- Lacks Dolby Vision support\nWhen it comes to balancing picture quality and price, Samsung's S90D OLED is the best 77-inch TV you can buy.\nThe S90D uses a QD-OLED screen to enable pixel-level contrast control and a wide range of colors. This gives the TV deep black levels that avoid the washed-out and uneven look that some QLED and LED sets have in dark scenes. The TV also uses quantum dot technology (where the \"QD\" comes from in QD-OLED), and this feature helps it produce brighter colors than competing LG OLEDs.\nDuring my tests, I measured a peak brightness of 1,240 nits, which is excellent for a midrange OLED and 200 nits more than Samsung's previous S90C TV model. That level of brightness is more than enough to deliver fantastic high-dynamic-range (HDR) performance. HDR movies and shows look stunning, with sharp images and rich colors that come close to rivaling many pricier TVs.\nYou can also sit toward the side of the screen without any major loss in image quality. QLED and LED sets struggle with viewing angles, so this is a key perk of an OLED like the S90D. Gamers will appreciate the TV's 120Hz refresh rate (144Hz with a PC), which enables smooth motion when paired with a PS5, Xbox Series X, or Switch 2. Samsung TVs also have built-in access to the Xbox app. This app enables Game Pass subscribers to play games without a console via cloud streaming.\nThe TV's Tizen operating system is solid, with all the streaming apps you could want, but its navigation speed isn't as consistent as the best streaming devices I've reviewed. Though smooth most of the time, lag occurs here and there. I also ran into an issue with frequent notifications popping up for various updates despite disabling notifications in the menu. However, I expect this to be easily fixed in a software update.\nLike all of Samsung's TVs, the S90D lacks Dolby Vision support. Dolby Vision is an HDR format that can offer a more accurate picture when playing compatible videos from apps like Disney Plus. It's a nice perk, but its benefits are subtle, so I don't consider it a must-have. Visit our HDR TV guide for more information about the pros and cons of different HDR formats.\nAll things considered, few similarly priced 75- and 77-inch TVs can match the S90D's performance. It's not the most affordable option out there, but if you have the budget, it's well worth the money. A 2025 version of this TV, called the S90F, is also available. The S90F is a slightly better TV, but it's more expensive. For now, the 2024 version remains the best value. You can learn more in our Samsung S90F 4K TV review.\nCheck out our guides to all the best TVs, best smart TVs, and best Samsung TVs.\nBest for picture quality\nThe G5 is LG's most impressive consumer TV. It's the brightest OLED on the market, and it offers exceptional image quality. It's pricey, but few high-end TVs can compete with the G5's overall picture performance.\n- Unmatched HDR brightness for an OLED\n- Pixel-level contrast control and deep black levels\n- Picture doesn't degrade from an angled view\n- Expensive compared to step-down models\n- WebOS voice search glitches\n- Doesn't include a stand\nThe G5 is LG's latest flagship OLED TV. Like all OLED displays, it provides an infinite contrast ratio with deep black levels, but this model can also get exceptionally bright, beating every other OLED I've tested.\nI previously recommended the Sony A95L in this spot, and though that model remains an excellent high-end TV, the G5's bump in brightness is substantial enough to dethrone it. While the A95L peaked at around 1,500 nits in small highlights, I measured a peak of 2,410 nits on the G5 using the TV's HDR Filmmaker Mode (its most accurate setting).\nThat's a notable jump, and it makes a difference when watching high-brightness HDR content. Specular highlights like explosions, laser blasts, shimmering reflections, sunsets, and lightning bolts pop from the screen with more impact. Though some QLED TVs can get even brighter, they lack the pixel-level contrast control that the G5's OLED panel enables. Check out our QLED vs OLED comparison for more details.\nThis combination of high brightness and high contrast creates a nearly flawless image with black levels that disappear into a dark room and bright elements that shine with precision, free from any backlight imperfections like blooming or vignetting. Like all OLEDs, the G5 also has wide viewing angles, so you get fantastic image quality even if you're sitting to the side of the screen. The G5 even supports a 165Hz refresh rate for PC gaming, while most competing high-end displays max at 144Hz.\nThat said, the G5 isn't perfect. When watching some HDR videos, the TV initially had issues with posterization (blocky instead of smooth gradations of shadows and colors). Thankfully, LG released firmware updates to address this. In my testing, this flaw was so rare and tied to such specific conditions that I don't consider it a major con.\nThe G5 uses LG's webOS smart TV system, which is a decent platform with plenty of apps and smooth navigation. I ran into some initial glitches with the TV's voice search, but this ironed out as I tested the set more. Still, I do find other operating systems like Roku and Google TV to be more user-friendly.\nDesign-wise, the G5 offers an elegant look with a mount that can be hung flush on your wall with virtually no gap. But unlike LG's step-down OLED models, the G5 doesn't include a traditional stand. If wall mounting isn't an option for your room, you need to buy a TV stand separately.\nThough the G5 is the current high-end 77-inch OLED to beat, Panasonic just released a similar OLED, the Z95B. I'll be testing the Z95B soon to see how it compares.\nRead our LG G5 4K TV review.\nCheck out our guide to the best LG TVs.\nBest on a budget\nTCL's QM6K is the brand's new entry-level Mini LED model. It offers great performance for its class, making it one of the best values out there for people who want a budget-friendly 75-inch TV that doesn't sacrifice image quality.\n- Solid entry-level HDR performance\n- Mini LED local dimming enables good contrast control\n- Google TV operating system is smooth\n- Can't get as bright as midrange and high-end TV models\n- Off-axis viewing is wider than last year's model but still not great\nTCL's 75-inch QM6K is a budget TV that punches way above its class. This QLED display has a Mini LED backlight with local dimming and wide color capabilities, which most competing 75-inch TVs in this price range lack.\nAs a result, the QM6K offers better image quality than a lot of its direct rivals. When reviewing the set, I loved the TV's rich colors, and it offered solid contrast with excellent backlight control. Most budget-friendly TVs with local dimming are prone to brightness fluctuations and halos around bright objects, but the QM6K does a great job of minimizing these quirks.\nThe TV also gets decently bright for a display in this tier. I measured a peak of around 557 nits on a 10% HDR test pattern and around 763 nits on a 50% test pattern. Those numbers are high enough to provide a good entry-level HDR picture. However, this is the dimmest TV in this guide, so it's not the best fit for people with a lot of ambient light in their room. Viewing angles are also a bit limited, as image quality washes out from an off-center view. That said, this has been improved compared to last year's Q65.\nAnother improvement comes in the TV's gaming capabilities. The QM6K is one of the most affordable 75-inch TVs that can support up to a 144Hz refresh rate, which enables smoother motion during gameplay. I was also impressed by the QM6K's Google TV interface. In the past, I've run into glitches and lag on some TCL Google TVs, but the QM6K was snappy and free from any notable bugs.\nThe QM6K makes some concessions to bring its price down, but it's easily one of the best 75-inch TVs you can buy on a budget.\nRead our TCL QM6K 4K TV review.\nCheck out our guide to all the best budget TVs.\nBest anti-glare model\nSamsung's high-end S95D uses a unique matte screen that can nearly eliminate glare and reflections. It's also the brightest OLED we've ever tested. However, the anti-glare design can give black levels a slightly faded look in bright rooms.\n- Highest peak brightness we've measured on an OLED\n- Anti-glare display nearly eliminates most reflections\n- Smooth 144Hz refresh rate when paired with a gaming PC\n- Thin design with One Connect Box for cable management\n- Lacks Dolby Vision support\n- Matte screen hurts black-level performance in bright rooms\n- The cheaper 2023 S95C offers similar performance for a lot less\nIn addition to being an excellent high-end OLED TV, the Samsung S95D has a unique feature that's ideal for solving one specific frustration: screen reflections. Though not a problem in every room, certain spaces with lots of lights and windows can be a headache for viewers since most displays have glossy screens that show lots of glare. This can be especially irritating when trying to watch sports during the day.\nHowever, the S95D has a matte screen that nearly eliminates this issue. There are some drawbacks, but if you struggle with reflections in your room, the S95D could be a game changer. The only notable TVs with similar matte finishes are Samsung's Frame TV and QN90F, Hisense's CanvasTV, and TCL's NXTFrame TV, but those models can't match the overall image quality of the S95D. In my testing, the 77-inch S95D's matte screen worked exactly as advertised, and I didn't encounter any of the typical mirror-like reflections I see on other TVs.\nOn the downside, the S95D's matte screen does have a negative side effect: it leads to elevated black levels in bright rooms. The S95D's black levels look perfect with the lights off, but in a bright environment, blacks can take on a slightly gray and hazy look. This is especially true when watching dimmer scenes in movies and TV shows. Glossy screens, like those used on every other TV in this guide, are much better at preserving black levels in a bright environment, but the tradeoff is that they suffer from more reflections. Ultimately, whether you prefer the S95D's matte screen over a glossy screen comes down to your needs as a viewer.\nOutside its unique screen, the S95D also offers great brightness for an OLED. I measured a peak of 1,700 nits. It's also got a 144Hz refresh rate for smooth PC gaming, and a premium design that uses a separate box for inputs rather than having them built into the back of the TV.\nSamsung also sells a newer version of this TV, the S95F, which can get even brighter. However, the S95F costs a lot more, so I only recommend it to big enthusiasts. For most people, the S95D remains the better value.\nRead our Samsung S95D 4K TV review and our Samsung S95F 4K TV review.\nCheck out our guide to the best sports TVs.\nBest high-end QLED\nTCL's QM8K is the brand's top-tier QLED TV for 2025. It has an improved backlight system and wider viewing angles than last year's model. It can also get exceptionally bright, which leads to impressive HDR images and great daytime performance.\n- Fantastic brightness performance\n- Excellent contrast control nearly eliminates blooming\n- Viewing angles are better than typical QLED models\n- Limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports\n- Missing the 165Hz gaming mode that some competing sets have\nThe QM8K is a high-end QLED TV that's often on sale for a midrange price. This premium 75-inch display rivals top QLEDs from Sony and Samsung but costs considerably less. Most notably, it is an excellent fit for buyers who want an extra-bright 75-inch screen.\nLike TCL's budget-friendly QM6K, this pricier flagship model uses a QLED panel with Mini LED local dimming. However, the QM8K has a more advanced backlight with more dimming zones, which helps it achieve a much brighter image with even better black levels.\nOur reviewer measured a peak of 3,648 nits on a 10% window, which makes the QM8K the brightest TV in this guide and one of the brightest TVs on the market. Of course, raw luminance on a test pattern is meaningless if the TV can't control its light output well when displaying actual content. Thankfully, the QM8K can harness its brightness to deliver fantastic HDR image quality. This high brightness also helps to overcome glare in rooms with lots of ambient light.\nThe TV's advanced dimming system also wowed our reviewer with some of the best contrast control he's seen on a Mini LED TV. Halos around subtitles were absent, and blooming in test scenes that typically have them were completely free from this issue. OLED TVs are still capable of more precise contrast, but the QM8K QLED is helping to close that gap.\nThe QM8K's viewing angles are also wide for a QLED, with less color and contrast degradation when the screen is viewed off-center. Again, OLED TVs still have an edge here, but the difference isn't as large as it has been in the past.\nGaming capabilities are also great, with up to a 144Hz refresh rate. However, the QM8K isn't capable of 165Hz, which is something that a few competing high-end TVs, like the LG G5, do support.\nIf you want a premium 75-inch QLED with great contrast control and exceptional brightness, the QM8K is a fantastic value.\nRead our TCL QM8K 4K TV review.\nHow we test 75-inch TVs\nWe picked the best 75-inch TVs through hands-on testing with various display models. We've been reviewing home entertainment products for over 10 years and used that expertise to inform our testing parameters and requirements.\nWhen evaluating TVs, we typically review the 65-inch option since that's the industry's flagship size. However, overall performance for a specific TV model usually stays the same across sizes 50 inches and up. For example, a 77-inch LG G5 OLED and a 65-inch G5 OLED have the exact same specifications. The only difference is the panel's size. As such, general test results for 65-inch TVs also apply to their 75- and 77-inch counterparts.\nHowever, some QLED displays with local dimming, like the TCL QM6K, have more zones in larger screen sizes than in smaller ones. This can cause slight differences in contrast performance when comparing a 75-inch model to a 65-inch one, but not enough to change our overall takeaway. In rare cases, some TV models have more dramatic differences across sizes. We consider those differences when recommending displays and note those instances when applicable.\nWhen we test TVs, we evaluate picture clarity, color quality, contrast performance, peak HDR brightness, gaming features, navigation speed, off-axis viewing, and general value. To measure brightness, we use a colorimeter in combination with test patterns on the Spears & Munsil UHD HDR Benchmark 4K Blu-ray disc.\nTest patterns are great for objective measurements, but watching real-world content is the only way to fully evaluate how a TV looks. We sample plenty of shows and movies to see how a display performs in both dark and bright environments. Part of our evaluation involves watching the same assortment of scenes on each TV we review to compare performance. Sequences are chosen to show off HDR highlights, shadow detail, black levels, upscaling, and motion. We also mix up the quality of our material to see how a TV handles 4K, 1080p, and standard definition (SD) programs from Blu-ray discs, streaming services, and cable TV.\nFor more information about our testing process, check out our page detailing how we review tech products.\n75-inch TV FAQs\nIs 75 inches a good TV size?\nA 75-inch screen is an excellent option for anyone who wants a display to fill a big space or offer an especially immersive experience in a smaller room. Big screen sizes fill more of your field of view, so your eyes can focus on the image and not the rest of your room. This creates a viewing experience that's closer to what you'd get in a movie theater.\nMany of our picks for the best 4K TVs and best OLED TVs are sold in the 75- and 77-inch screen class, so you have plenty of options.\nThat said, you need to consider certain logistics when buying a large TV. Most notably, you'll need a stand or mount that can accommodate a 75-inch TV's width and weight. If you need a new entertainment console or mount that supports a 75-inch TV, visit our guides to the best TV stands and best TV wall mounts, where we have several picks that can fit large displays.\nBut if you don't have the space for a 75-inch TV, check out our guides to the best 65-inch TVs, best 55-inch TVs, best 50-inch TVs, and best 43-inch TVs to see our top recommendations for smaller sizes.\nIf you want something even bigger, check out our guides to the best 85-inch TVs and best 100-inch TVs.\nShould you buy a 2024 or 2025 75-inch TV?\nMost brands released new TV models in the spring and summer of 2025. However, it's key to remember that 2024 TV models will stay in stock for a good portion of the year, and they cost less than their successors.\nWith that in mind, we continue to recommend certain 2024 models as top picks. For instance, the 77-inch Samsung S90D and S95D in this guide are 2024 models.\nFor more details on new TV models, visit our 2025 TV roundups:\n- LG 2025 OLED details\n- Samsung 2025 OLED and QLED details\n- Top TVs revealed at CES 2025\n- Top 2025 TV trends\nHow much should you spend on a 75-inch TV?\nDepending on the performance class you choose, the best 75-inch TVs can cost as little as $600 or as much as $5,000.\nBudget-friendly 75-inch QLED TVs, like the TCL QM6K, are sometimes on sale for as low as $700. Midrange QLED options with higher brightness typically sell for $800 to $1,400, while high-end models start at around $2,200.\nIf you want an OLED TV (made in 77 inches rather than 75), you'll need to pay a bit more. The cheapest 77-inch OLED TVs start at around $1,600, while premium options can cost over $4,000.\nThe best 75-inch and 77-inch TVs periodically go on sale, but the biggest discounts appear during shopping events like Black Friday and Prime Day and around major sporting events like the Super Bowl and March Madness.\nFor cheaper TV recommendations in smaller sizes, check out our guide to the best TVs under $500.\nDo 75-inch TVs have good sound quality?\nEven the best 75-inch TVs have mediocre built-in audio performance. Some of our pricier recommendations, like the LG G5, have better clarity and a bit more bass than our entry-level picks, like the Roku Plus, but they still lack the depth and range that you'd get with a separate audio system.\nCompanies typically build their displays with small speaker drivers to keep costs down and screens slim, and this leads to a lack of low-frequency performance and overall fidelity. To get more powerful and crisp sound quality, we recommend purchasing a separate soundbar or surround sound system, especially one with Dolby Atmos support.\nCheck out our soundbar and speaker guides to see our top recommendations:\n- Best soundbars\n- Best Dolby Atmos soundbars\n- Best budget soundbars\n- Best soundbars with subwoofers\n- Best Sonos soundbars\n- Best Bose soundbars\n- Best surround sound systems\nHow far should you sit from a 75-inch 4K TV?\nA large screen size of 75 inches enables you to sit farther away from your display while still getting an immersive experience. To start seeing the benefits of 4K resolution with an optimal field of view, the recommended distance is about one to 1.5 times the size of your TV.\nSo, for a 75-inch 4K TV, you should aim to sit between 6.25 and 9.38 feet from your screen.\nHowever, for your eyes to be able to make out the full benefits of a 4K resolution image, you'd need to sit just 4.9 feet away from a 75-inch screen. Of course, most people don't sit that close to their displays, and you can still enjoy a 75-inch 4K TV from a greater distance.\nShould you buy a 75-inch 8K TV?\nSome brands, like Samsung, sell 75-inch 8K TV models. However, in most cases, 8K TVs aren't worth the extra money they cost. Outside of some YouTube videos, there's no 8K content available to watch. Though 8K TVs benefit from upscaling and higher pixel density, which can provide a slightly sharper image if you sit very close to your screen, this benefit is subtle.\nAs it stands, most people are better off buying a 75-inch 4K set with high-end features than they are spending a similar amount or more on an 8K model.\nThat said, if you're dead set on making the jump to 8K, we suggest taking a look at the Samsung QN900D. This QLED TV delivered impressive contrast and brightness in our testing. But again, if you're willing to sacrifice resolution, we think a good 4K TV, like the 77-inch Samsung S90D, actually offers a better overall image for less money.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "The S95D is one of the best Samsung TVs you can buy and one of the most impressive high-end displays from any brand this year. It's Samsung's latest flagship OLED, improving upon last year's already excellent S95C. Most notably, it delivers the highest peak brightness I've ever recorded on an OLED display.\nIt also offers top-notch color performance and incorporates a new anti-glare filter that cuts down reflections better than any display of this type. The matte screen does hurt black-level performance in bright rooms, but the S95D is the only OLED I've seen that can handle glare this well.\nCompetitors in this class, like the LG G4 and Sony A95L, perform a bit better in certain areas (and worse in others), but there's no doubt the Samsung S95D is a top contender in the premium TV market.\nSamsung's S95D is the brightest OLED we\u2019ve ever tested. It features a new matte screen that nearly eliminates reflections, making it ideal for rooms that struggle with glare. However, the matte design gives black levels a slightly faded look in direct light.\n- The brightest OLED we've tested\n- Matte screen significantly reduces glare and reflections\n- 144Hz refresh rate for smooth PC gaming\n- Slim design with One Connect Box\n- Doesn't support Dolby Vision\n- Glare-free coating elevates black levels in bright rooms\n- Pricey compared to 2023 counterpart\nA new benchmark for OLED TV brightness\nThe Samsung S95D is a picture performance champ with all the bells and whistles that buyers should expect from a TV in this price range. Thanks to its QD-OLED panel (OLED with quantum dots), the display offers pixel-level contrast and a wide range of vibrant colors, which leads to exceptional high-dynamic-range (HDR) images. And on top of that, the S95D is the brightest OLED I've ever measured.\nI put the TV in Filmmaker mode for testing purposes, which offers the most accurate picture settings. Using an X-Rite colorimeter, I measured a peak brightness of around 1,700 nits on a 10% HDR test pattern (a white box that takes up 10% of the screen). That's about 350 nits more than last year's version of this TV, the Samsung S95C, and about 200 nits more than the S95D's top competitors, including the LG G4.\nHowever, the S95D can only hit 1,700 nits in short bursts before dimming significantly. On the 10% test pattern, the TV gradually fell to around 750 nits and dropped more over time. I've seen this kind of behavior on a few other OLED TVs, but it's more extreme on this model than on competitors. But while that might sound like a major drawback, it actually isn't that big of a deal. It's rare for HDR videos to call for sustained brightness that high. Most highlights that actually need to get very bright (like a gunshot or an explosion in a movie) only flash on the screen quickly, and the S95D can handle those instances well.\nAs it stands, the S95D's brightness capabilities help the TV produce a vibrant image and give you plenty of headroom to pump up luminance and adjust settings to suit spaces that let in a lot of light. It also helps the TV display high-brightness HDR videos closer to how filmmakers intended them to look. And the results are fantastic.\nThe S95D delivers impressive image quality when watching actual movies and TV shows. During my testing session, I sampled various film sequences I use across all the TVs I evaluate, including scenes from 4K Blu-ray discs like \"The Matrix,\" \"Aquaman,\" \"Ex Machina,\" \"Blade Runner,\" \"Game of Thrones,\" and \"La La Land,\" as well as HDR streaming demos from YouTube.\nWith high-quality 4K material, the TV simply stuns. Fine details are sharp, contrast is high, and saturation is rich with bold hues that pop from the screen when called for. That said, while most demo material came through with the kind of bright saturation I expect from a QD-OLED with such high color volume, the climactic battle in \"Aquaman\" looked a bit more subdued than I was expecting. I have a hunch something wonky was going on with the settings, so I'll revisit that sequence when I conduct extended testing and update this section with additional findings.\nThe opening scene from \"The Matrix\" is a great showcase for the S95D's contrast performance in a dark room. Bright specular highlights, like a police officer's flashlight, pop off the screen while black levels remain deep. And since each pixel on the TV's OLED panel can dim and brighten independently, the S95D is completely free from the kind of backlight blooming issues you'd see on competing QLED TVs. With the lights on, however, this scene reveals some of the drawbacks associated with the S95D's matte-screen finish (more on that in the next section).\nThe S95D handles gradients smoothly with minimal instances of banding. Our go-to real-world test scene from \"Ex Machina\" only revealed tiny hints of banding in the extreme red shades around one character's shoulder, which is about equal to what I've seen on other high-end sets.\nI also sampled a few regular HD videos in standard dynamic range and some lower-quality streams from Samsung's free live TV service, Samsung TV Plus, and the S95D handled them well. That said, upscaling isn't quite as good as you'll see on Sony's flagship TVs, so you'll get a slightly softer image with more source-related flaws visible.\nNote: The S95D is available in 55-, 65-, and 77-inch screen sizes, and they all offer the same display specifications. Samsung says all S95D models being shipped to retailers in the US right now use QD-OLED panels. However, there is speculation that the brand could sell versions of its 2024 OLED TVs with WRGB panels instead. WRGB OLED panels don't incorporate quantum dots, so any S95D TV with that panel type would offer reduced color and brightness capabilities. Again, this shouldn't be a concern for anyone shopping for an S95D now, but I'll update this review if WRGB variants end up being released in the US.\nThe matte screen nearly eliminates reflections, but black levels suffer\nOne of the S95D's most striking features is its new glare-free screen filter. Virtually every other TV sold right now (including last year's S95C) uses a glossy finish that causes a reflective quality when you watch TV in a bright room. But, the S95D has a matte finish that significantly reduces glare and reflections. In fact, it almost eliminates them entirely.\nSeriously, this is one of the best screens I've seen for handling glare. The only other notable TV with a similar matte coating is Samsung's own Frame, but that model can't match the S95D's overall image quality. And when you add in the TV's high brightness capabilities, the S95D cements itself as a great option for rooms that let in a lot of light. However, the TV's glare-free screen does have a negative effect on black-level performance.\nInstead of having the deep, inky quality that OLED black levels are known for, blacks look a bit elevated, hazy, and gray when watching TV with the lights on. This was very evident when viewing dark scenes, like the opening sequence of \"The Matrix,\" in a bright room.\nI'm a bit torn about this side effect, and while I know that many buyers will love the perks of the S95D's matte screen, I lean toward preferring a glossier look that preserves black levels. I studied filmmaking and am a huge movie buff, so picture accuracy is one of the most important aspects of a TV to me. Deep black levels are a huge part of preserving the intended look of a movie, so the matte screen's negative impact on contrast is disappointing. That said, there's no denying how well the filter works at reducing reflections, so if you have a big issue with glare in your room, the pros here will outweigh the cons.\nOutside the matte screen, the S95D's design looks a lot like the 2023 S95C, and that's not a bad thing. This 2024 model carries over its predecessor's uniformly thin profile and has a similar pedestal stand, as well as a One Connect box, which houses all of the TV's video and audio ports instead of having them built into the panel. Build quality is also sturdy and a clear step up from cheaper designs used on sets from more budget-friendly brands.\nThe smart TV interface is solid, and you can stream Xbox games with a subscription\nSamsung's smart TV interface, which runs on the Tizen operating system, has received a few minor design tweaks for a slightly more streamlined look, but by and large, it offers a similar experience compared to last year's offering.\nNavigation through menus was snappy during my initial time with the TV and seemed a bit more consistent than last year's model. Some apps can still take a little longer to load than they do on dedicated streaming devices I've tested, but I like how there's now a loading bar that appears when opening apps.\nAs with last year's model, the interface features a dedicated Gaming Hub section, and Samsung is still the only TV brand to offer built-in support for the Xbox app. This means you can stream Xbox games directly to the TV without a console, so long as you have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership and a Bluetooth controller.\nXbox streaming performance relies heavily on your internet connection and is limited to HD resolution in standard dynamic range with two-channel sound, but the feature gets the job done. It's not how I'd recommend playing top-tier releases, but it's solid for more casual titles.\nMeanwhile, when playing video games via a connected console or PC, the S95D has all the premium features you should look for, including a variable refresh rate and support for up to 4K/144Hz to enable smooth gameplay.\nShould you buy it?\nThe Samsung S95D is one of the best 4K TVs on the market and an excellent option for anyone who wants a glare-free OLED. It delivers fantastic image quality with the highest peak brightness I've seen on a display of this type, and its matte-screen filter is a game changer for buyers who struggle with glare and reflections in their living rooms.\nHowever, that glare-free screen does hurt black-level performance with the lights on, so there's a definite tradeoff. If your room doesn't have issues with reflections, I recommend last year's S95C as the better buy. It's cheaper and uses a glossy coating. And though the S95C's peak brightness is about 30% dimmer than the S95D's, it still gets bright enough for most needs. Check out our full S95D vs. S95C comparison for more details on how the two models stack up.\nIn this class, you should also consider the LG G4 and Sony A95L as alternatives. They both use glossy screens and have some other pros and cons compared to the S95D. Neither can get quite as bright as Samsung's flagship, but the G4 can sustain high brightness levels for a longer period of time, and the A95L benefits from Sony's superior picture processing to provide a slightly more accurate image. And they both support Dolby Vision, while the S95D does not. Check out our guide to HDR and Dolby Vision for details on why that feature could be a worthwhile perk.\nUltimately, buyers seeking a premium viewing experience can't go wrong with any high-end OLED TV. But, the S95D's matte screen and exceptionally high brightness do give it an edge for viewers who want an OLED that's uniquely suited for combating glare and reflections in rooms that let in a lot of light.\nFor more recommendations for various needs and budgets, check out our guide to the best OLED TVs.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "Powerful bass is an essential part of a high-quality sound system. Without it, movies and TV shows can sound too thin and deflated, lacking the weight and depth that dedicated low frequencies bring. Many soundbars use integrated woofers to provide bass, but this method has limitations. That's why we've rounded up the best soundbars with full-fledged subwoofers. These models include separate subwoofer units to offer room-shaking oomph while watching your favorite action flicks.\nAfter extensive hands-on testing, we recommend the Samsung HW-Q990C as the best soundbar with a subwoofer. This powerful multi-piece system offers immersive surround sound with Dolby Atmos support and deep bass via its eight-inch subwoofer. If you're looking for a more affordable and compact option, we also recommend the Yamaha YAS-209. This 2.1-channel system stands out thanks to its reasonable price and balanced low-end performance.\nOf course, the best soundbars with subwoofers do more than just pump up the bass. Our picks also offer clean upper frequencies, a rich midrange, and helpful features like wireless streaming.\nTop picks for the best soundbars with a subwoofer\nBest overall: Samsung HW-Q990C - See at Amazon\nBest midrange: Yamaha YAS-209 - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nThis powerful 11.1.4 soundbar system has up-firing drivers, a dedicated subwoofer, and separate rear satellite speakers. It takes up more space than smaller options, but delivers the best Dolby Atmos performance we\u2019ve heard in a system like this.\n- Class-leading Dolby Atmos and DTS:X immersion\n- Quick and snappy setup\n- Rugged, minimalist design\n- No Chromecast or HDMI 2.1 support\n- Spotify Connect quirks with iPhone\n- Only minor upgrades compared to 2022 model\nThe Samsung HW-Q990C is more of a full-fledged home theater system than a typical soundbar. This multi-piece package includes dual wireless satellite speakers, a primary soundbar with up-firing and side-firing drivers, and, of course, a powerful subwoofer. And thanks to the system's Dolby Atmos support, it spreads audio all around your room, including above your head.\nDuring our tests, the Q990C offered fantastic sound for movies, TV shows, and music. Its dynamic performance even auto-adjusts in real time using Samsung's Adaptive Sound feature to ensure the best quality in your room. The system's 11.1.4-channel playback is spread effortlessly across components, moving between traditional surround sound and overhead effects with impressive fluidity.\nThe subwoofer also stands out with a side-firing eight-inch cone that digs into the lowest frequencies. This leads to robust, full-bodied performance that reaches deeper levels of bass than a typical stand-alone soundbar could.\nThe system supports every major sound format, including Dolby Atmos and its primary rival, DTS:X. You also get many connection options, from dual HDMI inputs to WiFi, with Apple AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect support. We're disappointed that Google Chromecast isn't supported (an odd omission for a brand that makes Android phones), but Bluetooth is available as a backup.\nSystem settings can be adjusted with the snazzy remote or via Samsung's SmartThings app. You also get Amazon Alexa or Bixby voice assistant control and a few Samsung-only features like Q-Symphony. That latter perk lets the bar work in concert with the built-in speakers on some of the best Samsung TVs, including top OLEDs like the S95D and S95F.\nBuyers should note that Samsung also sells slightly updated versions of this soundbar, including the new Q990F. That model adds HDMI 2.1 pass-through, which allows the bar to output gaming features like VRR (variable refresh rate) and 4K/120Hz when connected to a compatible console or PC. Its subwoofer also features a more compact design while still offering similar performance.\nHowever, the Q990C is often sold for much less, which makes it a better overall value for most people. If you're after top-notch performance with dedicated bass, the Samsung Q990C is the best soundbar with a subwoofer to get.\nCheck out our Samsung Q990C soundbar review and Samsung Q990F soundbar review.\nCheck out our guides to all the best soundbars, best Dolby Atmos soundbars, and best surround sound systems.\nBest midrange\nYamaha's YAS-209 is a convenient 2.1-channel soundbar with great sound quality, a wireless subwoofer, and a reasonable price.\n- Room-filling sound\n- Alexa built-in\n- Sleek appearance\n- Wireless subwoofer included\n- No onboard display\n- Doesn't support Dolby Vision passthrough\n- No Atmos capabilities\nWith versatile features and excellent sound quality, Yamaha's YAS-209 is an ideal midrange audio system. The package includes a stereo soundbar unit and a wireless subwoofer for dedicated bass.\nAffordable soundbar and sub combos like this are difficult to find since many brands now favor modular systems that require you to buy an add-on subwoofer separately. Yamaha's YAS-209 bucks that trend with everything you need right in the box.\nThe YAS-209's design is sleek and simple, with a rounded body wrapped in acoustic fabric. The device's 2.1-channel playback offers balanced sound across frequencies. You don't get Dolby Atmos support, but Atmos isn't expected at this tier, and the system does offer DTS Virtual:X processing to simulate surround sound.\nThe 209's wireless subwoofer connects automatically, and its tall frame makes it easy to fit into various spaces. The bar and sub blend well together, moving seamlessly between registers to bring clarity to the high frequencies and a formidable punch down low. This provides a serious upgrade for virtually any TV's built-in speakers, and thanks to the HDMI ARC connection, you can control the bar with most TV remotes.\nYou also get features like WiFi support for high-quality streaming, built-in Alexa voice control with an integrated microphone, and even an HDMI pass-through input, something many entry-level and mid-tier soundbars omit. The one caveat is that the extra port doesn't support Dolby Vision HDR or 120Hz signals, but it's still a handy inclusion. Other connection options include a digital optical port for older TVs and Bluetooth for streaming.\nYou can spend a lot more on other soundbar and subwoofer combos, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a better deal for this much good stuff. Yamaha's YAS-209 is a reliable set-it-and-forget-it option with strong performance at a very accessible price.\nCheck out our complete guide to all of the best budget soundbars.\nHow we test soundbars with subwoofers\nTo find the best soundbars with subwoofers, our experts tested multiple models for several days with various sources. We've been reviewing home audio devices for over a decade and use that extensive experience to inform our testing parameters.\nSound quality is our top priority, with a particular emphasis on potent and foundational bass. We also consider other factors, including supported audio formats, how easy each soundbar is to set up, and whether they provide advanced features like WiFi streaming, smart assistants, and multiple HDMI inputs.\nWe assess each soundbar's design, considering its aesthetic qualities and how well it fits into the average TV room. We then spend multiple days with each bar we evaluate, putting them through various tests with familiar material, from movies and TV shows to specific music playlists. We use different sound sources, from streaming services to physical media, with compressed and lossless audio tracks via apps like Amazon Music. We also use each bar for regular daily listening, striving to get a feel for what it is like to own it from a buyer's perspective.\nWhen testing sound quality, we look at many elements, from dynamics and dialogue clarity to tonal balance across the treble, midrange, and bass registers. To find the best soundbar with subwoofer pairings, we look closely at low-frequency performance, with an ear toward smooth, accurate, and musical bass with good balance and fluidity between the subwoofer and soundbar. Any obvious difference between the tonal color of the subwoofer and the bar is grounds for dismissal.\nFinally, we test parameters like WiFi and Bluetooth reliability, navigation of connected apps and settings, and the responsiveness and accuracy of smart assistants, where applicable.\nFor more info on our review methodology, visit our page detailing how we test tech gear.\nWhat to look for in a soundbar with a subwoofer\nOnce you've established that you want a soundbar with a subwoofer, there are a few factors we recommend focusing on as you hone your search. First, you'll want to check the connectivity options. Most modern soundbars have HDMI ARC or eARC, which makes it simple to connect to an HDMI ARC-compatible TV and use its remote to control power and volume.\nAll of the best TVs sold today have this feature, but if you have an older TV that doesn't have HDMI ARC or eARC (it should be labeled in the inputs cubby), you can often use an optical connection as an alternative. However, HDMI ARC is required to play Dolby Atmos. Check out our guide to the best HDMI cables for top recommendations to use with soundbars and TVs.\nVirtually every modern soundbar includes Bluetooth support, but higher-quality systems also have WiFi for over-the-air updates and better streaming quality. Features like AirPlay 2 for iPhones, Chromecast for Android devices, and Spotify Connect are also relatively standard, making it easy to play songs from the best music streaming services. The more options your bar supports, the better.\nSoundbars may also offer built-in voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. If you're interested in using your soundbar as a smart home hub or controller, you'll want to ensure the bar has built-in microphones for voice commands.\nWith a soundbar subwoofer combo, you'll find 2.1-channel configurations at the low end, and advanced systems with Dolby Atmos multi-channel configurations like 5.1.2 at the high end. The first number in the series represents the ear-level channels in the soundbar, the middle number represents the subwoofer (bass) channel, and the last number defines how many height or up-firing channels the bar supports (if any) for Dolby Atmos.\nSpeaking of Dolby Atmos, you'll pay a premium to get a soundbar that supports it or its primary rival, DTS:X. Sometimes called 3D, spatial, or object-based audio, these advanced formats include traditional surround sound channels on the horizontal plane and height channels to add a vertical element that creates a deeper sense of immersion. Check out our Dolby Atmos guide for more details.\nSoundbar with subwoofer FAQs\nWhy should I get a soundbar with a subwoofer?\nThe simple answer is physics. Though advanced acoustics and digital processing can deliver solid bass, they're no match for bigger speaker drivers. The larger drivers inside dedicated subwoofers can physically move more air, which helps recreate the low-frequency waveforms that eventually make their way to our ears with authenticity and accuracy. A subwoofer is all but necessary if you're looking for powerful explosions, floor-rattling thunder, and rich, low musical performance.\nCan I add a subwoofer to a soundbar later?\nSome soundbars offer the option to add a subwoofer or surround sound speakers after the fact. These are called modular systems, allowing you to buy extra components later.\nSome soundbars, including options from Klipsch and Sennheiser, even have a standard subwoofer output, letting you connect a traditional subwoofer from any brand. Others, like the Sonos Arc Ultra and Bose Smart Soundbar, require the purchase of a specific subwoofer made by the same company. Check out our guides to the best Bose soundbars and best Sonos soundbars for subwoofer recommendations specific to those brands.\nOn the downside, many brands charge a major premium for soundbar models that use modular designs. If you're on a budget and bass is an important factor, we recommend buying a soundbar and subwoofer combo from the start to get the best value.\nWhat size soundbar and subwoofer should I get?\nSize is always an important factor when purchasing a soundbar. The first thing to consider is whether your entertainment console is long enough to support your soundbar of choice. Typical soundbars range from 36 to 46 inches or longer, especially for high-performance bars with many drivers, such as those that support Dolby Atmos. Check out our guide to the best TV stands for wide console recommendations.\nYou'll also want to ensure your soundbar won't block your TV screen, especially if your TV sits on a stand rather than being mounted on a wall. Most soundbars are designed to sit around three inches tall or less, but you'll want to do some measurements to avoid an issue.\nFor the soundbars on this list, you'll also want to ensure you have space for your subwoofer. Subwoofers can range from tall and skinny to short and stout, so again, do some measurements to ensure you've got good placement options. Most setups work well with the subwoofer placed on the ground to the left or right of the TV console, but it's best to have some room to experiment.\nFinally, if you want a soundbar with separate surround sound (or satellite) speakers, make sure you've got stands or shelves that will allow you to properly place the speakers slightly behind and to the sides of the main listening position. Dolby offers some helpful speaker configuration guides for this purpose. You'll also want to ensure you have power outlets in reach for wireless surround speakers or long enough cables to plug in wired options comfortably.\nWhat is an HDMI ARC connection?\nAn HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) connection can send audio signals to and from connected devices. HDMI Arc ports are found on many of the best smart TVs, soundbars, and AV receivers.\nStandard HDMI ARC connections can transmit stereo audio signals and compressed surround sound formats like Dolby Digital, DTS, and lossy Dolby Atmos via the Dolby Digital Plus format.\nMany newer components feature an HDMI eARC (Enhanced Audio Return Channel) connection, an updated version of HDMI ARC that can support higher-bandwidth audio for better sound quality. Though specific format support varies by device, HDMI eARC connections can transmit lossless Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD MA, and DTS:X tracks.\nMost TVs and soundbars with HDMI ARC and eARC connections also support a related feature known as CEC (Consumer Electronics Control). This handy function lets you use your TV's remote to control power and volume on a connected soundbar.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "The days of old \"dumb\" TVs are over. If you're shopping for a new display, smart TVs are the norm. This kind of television connects to the internet, allowing it to serve as a central part of any smart home. The best smart TVs let you watch all your favorite streaming services and offer features like voice search.\nI've been covering tech products for over a decade, and have extensive experience with every smart TV platform on the market. My recommendations include models that use each of the most popular smart TV interfaces available: Roku OS, Samsung Tizen, Vizio Home, Google TV, Amazon Fire TV, and LG webOS. For instance, if you want a TV with Samsung's Tizen operating system, I recommend the Samsung S90D OLED, which offers excellent picture performance and seamless integration with other Samsung products. Meanwhile, if you want a more affordable display that uses Roku's user-friendly interface, I suggest checking out the Roku Pro Series QLED.\nBelow, you can find all of my best smart TV picks. Each display represents my recommendation for the top value available with that specific interface. Models are sold in multiple screen sizes, so be sure to select the size you want from each retailer's page.\nTop picks for the best smart TVs\nBest Tizen model: Samsung S90D OLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest Roku TV: Roku Pro Series QLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest Vizio Home set: Vizio Quantum Pro QLED TV - See at Walmart\nBest Google TV: TCL QM7K QLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest webOS display: LG C4 OLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest Amazon Fire TV: Amazon Omni Mini LED TV - See at Amazon\nBest Tizen model\nThe S90D is our favorite TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class.\n- Excellent peak brightness for a midrange OLED\n- High color volume with quantum dot technology\n- Wide viewing angles so picture doesn't degrade when sitting off center\n- Smart TV interface is OK but not the best\n- Issue with update notifications\n- Dolby Vision isn't supported\nPeople who want an excellent Samsung TV should look no further than the S90D OLED. Like all of the company's displays, the S90D uses the brand's proprietary smart TV interface, which is powered by the Tizen operating system. Though Samsung sells more expensive OLEDs that can get a bit brighter, the S90D's picture quality is unmatched for the money, and it has a robust set of smart features.\nThe Tizen OS offers access to popular streaming apps, seamless integration with other Samsung smart devices, and a few extra perks you won't find on most TVs from other companies. The homepage has a top row with an icon for your most recently used service/connected device next to icons for popular content searches. This is followed by a row of icons for your favorite TV apps and then various rows of recommended programs. It's a fairly standard layout that gets the job done, but I prefer the more streamlined approach used by Roku and the superior recommendations offered by Google.\nOn the Tizen sidebar, you can access dedicated pages for search, ambient mode, Samsung Daily+ (where you can find health, work, and smart device control apps), and a gaming hub. The gaming hub is particularly noteworthy since it offers access to cloud services like Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna, and Xbox Game Pass.\nSamsung is one of two TV brands that support the Xbox streaming app, and this feature lets Game Pass members play Xbox games without a console. In my experience, performance can be hit or miss since playability is highly dependent on your internet speed. Likewise, games played this way are limited to HD resolution, standard dynamic range (SDR), and stereo sound. So, while not the ideal way to experience high-end titles, it's still a cool perk.\nWhen it comes to voice search, users can choose between Alexa or Samsung's own Bixby assistant. As a whole, Tizen is reliable across all Samsung TVs, but it's prone to slight lag, particularly when first booting up a display. Likewise, I've run into a few small quirks. For instance, when I tested the S90D, the OS automatically opened the last app or device I used, despite having this behavior disabled in the settings menu. I also encountered update notifications about Samsung's privacy policies despite turning notifications off. Thankfully, these types of glitches are easy to fix with firmware.\nBut while the OS has some drawbacks, the S90D's image quality leaves nothing to complain about. The TV's OLED panel enables pixel-level contrast with deep black levels that disappear into a dark room. The S90D also uses quantum dots, offering a brighter and wider range of colors than you'd get on competing LG OLEDs in this price range. The results are spectacular, with a peak brightness of around 1,240 nits. This leads to vivid HDR images that wow with bold, precise highlights.\nSamsung does sell a newer 2025 edition of this TV, the S90F, which has some improvements. That said, it costs about $1,000 more, so the S90D remains a better value. In fact, when it comes to balancing price and picture performance, the S90D is my top pick for the best TV period.\nNote: The 42-, 48-, and 83-inch versions of the S90D don't use quantum dots, so their color performance can't match that of the 55-, 65-, and 77-inch models.\nCheck out our guide to all the best Samsung TVs.\nBest Roku TV\nRoku's flagship Pro Series TV is a great all-around 4K QLED. Though similarly priced TCL and Hisense models have an edge in image quality, Roku's intuitive smart TV interface, handy backlit voice remote, and easy assembly make the Pro Series a worthy competitor.\n- Great black levels and contrast for a QLED\n- Good brightness and quantum-dot color performance\n- Simple and intuitive Roku smart TV interface\n- Voice remote is rechargeable and backlit\n- Narrow viewing angles\n- Minor motion and picture processing issues\n- Notable screen reflections in bright rooms\n- No dedicated gaming bar feature\nThe Roku Pro Series is the brand's best smart TV overall. It delivers impressive midrange picture quality with advanced features like quantum dots, a Mini LED backlight, and one of the most user-friendly interfaces I've tested.\nThe Roku OS is my favorite system for accessing apps since it presents a clean, no-fuss design that puts all your favorite streaming services up front and center. Unlike other operating systems, which have homepages cluttered with content recommendations, Roku cuts out all the fat and focuses on the essentials with big icons for your apps and connected devices. Navigating through menus and services is quick, and our reviewer didn't run into any glitches or lag when testing the display.\nThe included Voice Remote Pro 2 is also a joy to use. It features an integrated battery that recharges via USB-C and can last for around three months per charge. It supports voice search by pressing a button or through a hands-free \"wake\" word. (A dedicated microphone mute switch is included for privacy.) And though Roku TVs don't come with integrated support for Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri, they can pair with smart speakers that use those digital assistants.\nOur reviewer especially loved the remote's backlit keys, which make it easy to use when watching movies in a dark room. That's a feature that even high-end Samsung and LG remotes lack, so it's great to see on a midrange model like this. Another cool perk is the \"lost remote finder,\" which you can activate via a button on the TV or through the Roku app. This feature plays a chime through the remote so you can locate it.\nBeyond smart TV conveniences, the Roku Pro Series delivers great picture quality. The display can reach over 1,000 nits of brightness, which is the standard for a lot of high-dynamic-range (HDR) content. Specular highlights, like explosions, pop from the screen with realistic intensity. And though black-level control isn't on par with pricier TVs or OLED models, the Pro Series' Mini LED backlight and local dimming enable solid contrast. Our reviewer only noticed small instances of light bleed in dark environments.\nThat said, the display's picture processing isn't as clean and smooth as options from other brands. Some blocky colors and jerky motion showed up here and there during testing. Likewise, the screen is prone to reflections, and colors distort a lot if you sit to the side of the panel. However, these flaws are common for QLED displays in this price range.\nDespite a few drawbacks, the Pro Series is one of the best-looking TVs available with Roku's operating system, and in that context, it's an excellent option for anyone who favors the brand's streamlined smart TV experience. This model is available in 55-, 65-, and 75-inch sizes. Roku also sells an updated 2025 version of this TV that promises some performance improvements, but it costs more. For now, the older model is the better buy.\nRead our Roku Pro Series 4K TV review.\nVisit our guide to all of the best Roku TVs.\nBest Vizio Home set\nVizio's Quantum Pro is a solid midrange 4K QLED TV with impressive viewing angles for its class. But similar TVs from Hisense and TCL provide better image quality for the money.\n- Bright HDR performance with expanded color support\n- Solid screen uniformity with slim bezels\n- Wide viewing angles for a QLED TV\n- Poor black levels limit contrast\n- Local dimming creates noticeable blooming\n- Only one HDMI 2.1 port\nLike Samsung and LG, Vizio uses its own smart TV system rather than licensing one from Google, Roku, or Amazon. The brand previously used an OS called \"SmartCast,\" but its latest TVs use a revamped interface called \"Vizio Home.\" The Quantum Pro (VQP65C-84) was one of the first displays to launch with the new design, and it remains the top model in the company's lineup.\nThe Vizio Home layout is most reminiscent of Google TV, with features like a \"Trending Now\" section and a prominent row for your favorite apps. Navigation speed is responsive and smooth, which isn't always a given on TVs in this class. The interface also has a well-organized layout for various settings, which is less cluttered than other options like Samsung's Tizen OS.\nHowever, our reviewer didn't love the Home interface's heavy emphasis on Vizio's Watch Free+ TV service. Other brands include similar ad-supported internet TV apps, but Vizio pushes its content a bit more, and the selection isn't exactly top-caliber. One of the homepage's biggest pieces of on-screen space is dedicated to recommendations of forgotten movies like 2005's \"Bewitched\" reboot. There's also no \"Continue Watching\" section on the homepage, which is a convenience that most smart TV interfaces include.\nThe Quantum Pro does include a voice remote that works well, but like Roku TVs, the system doesn't feature integrated support for Alexa or Google Assistant. Thankfully, you can still pair the TV with a separate smart speaker from those brands. The remote itself is compact and ergonomic, with a simplified set of controls that's similar to Roku's design.\nWith a bright image that peaks at about 1,000 nits, the Quantum Pro offers solid picture performance, especially when watching TV during the day. It has quantum dots to produce a wide range of colors and local dimming to darken specific portions of its screen. That said, the TV uses regular-sized LEDs rather than Mini LEDs, and it has an IPS-style panel rather than a VA-type panel. VA panels are used on most competing QLEDs since they provide a higher contrast ratio.\nThese two factors lead to a slightly washed-out look when watching the Quantum Pro in a dark room. Vizio released a firmware update to improve contrast, but if deep black-level performance is a priority, I still recommend going with a Mini LED model instead, like the Roku Pro or TCL QM7K.\nOn the plus side, the IPS-style panel does help in one area where a lot of other QLEDs struggle with: viewing angles. Colors and contrast shift a bit when you sit to the side of the Quantum Pro, but the loss of quality is far less severe than it is on QLEDs from Roku, Hisense, and TCL. So, while not the best smart TV for home theater environments, the Quantum Pro is a solid option for casual viewing in a lighter living room with seats in various spots around the TV.\nRead our Vizio Quantum Pro QLED review.\nBest Google TV\nThe TCL QM7K is an excellent midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED backlight delivers high brightness, and it has better contrast control and wider viewing angles than last year's model.\n- Excellent HDR brightness for a midrange TV\n- Fantastic backlight control with virtually no blooming\n- Improved viewing angles over last year's model\n- Supports up to a 144Hz refresh rate for PC gamers\n- Black levels aren't quite as deep as we've seen on other Mini LED models\n- Pedestal stand's depth could be an issue for soundbar placement\n- Though decent for a QLED, viewing angles still can't match those of an OLED\nThe Google TV operating system is available on displays from several brands, including models made by TCL, Hisense, and Sony. But when it comes to overall value, the TCL QM7K stands out from the pack. This TV is the 2025 version of my previous pick in this category, the QM7. The QM7 remains an excellent TV, but it's hard to find in stock, and the newer QM7K offers some improvements in backlight control and viewing angles.\nThe QM7K's Google TV interface has a homepage with a row for top-pick curations, followed by your favorite apps, a continue-watching section, and additional rows of recommendations across various categories. It's not exactly a unique design, but it's more user-friendly than similar layouts from Amazon, LG, and Samsung. I've also found its content recommendations to be more in line with titles I'd actually want to watch.\nAs you might expect, the system also seamlessly integrates with an existing Google account, so you can sync your photos for screensavers, share account data with the display, and pair with other Google smart devices. For instance, I can view my Google Nest camera feeds right on the TV's screen.\nGoogle TV navigation speed and app stability can vary depending on which model and brand you buy. For instance, our reviewers have encountered slower performance on some Hisense Google TVs compared to options from Sony. But the TCL QM7K is one of the smoothest Google TVs I've used, and I didn't run into any notable bugs or glitches. Voice control with Google Assistant works well, whether you use it hands-free or via a button on the remote. The remote is also backlit, which is a nice touch.\nThe QM7K is also the brightest TV on this list, with an impressive peak of around 1,800 nits. This helps it produce intense HDR images with vivid colors, and makes it an excellent choice for watching sports during the day. And though the image does fade a bit when you're off-center from the screen, the QM7K's viewing angles are wider than last year's model. The TV also has an improved Mini LED local dimming system, which results in notably better control over its light output. Though I noticed some backlight fluctuations and uneven brightness when testing the 2024 QM7, the 2025 QM7K is almost entirely free from these quirks. In fact, this TV has some of the best blooming control I've ever seen.\nThat said, the TV's black levels aren't quite as deep as they are on some pricier QLED models, and they're still not as precise as they are on an OLED. But given typical sale prices, this display punches way above its class. The 65-inch model is often sold for around $900, which makes the QM7K one of the best smart TVs you can get for under $1,000. I also love that it's available in extra-large sizes, including a 98-inch version and a gigantic 115-inch option.\nBut buyers who want a premium Google TV with better black levels and processing should consider the Sony A95L OLED or Bravia 8 II OLED, which are two of the best high-end TVs available. However, those sets cost about three to four times as much as the QM7K. For the money, the QM7K is tough to beat.\nBest webOS display\nThe C4 is LG's midrange 4K OLED TV from 2024. It delivers excellent contrast and black levels, along with solid HDR brightness. Though a newer C5 model is available, the C4 is a better value for most needs.\n- Pixel-level contrast with perfect black levels and wide viewing angles\n- Lots of different sizes to choose from\n- Plenty of HDMI 2.1 ports for other devices\n- Not as bright as Samsung's competing midrange OLED\n- Color performance can't match that of an OLED with quantum dots\n- WebOS is cluttered with promos and an update caused temporary issues with apps\nAll of LG's TVs use the brand's webOS system, and the LG C4 OLED is the best smart TV value of the bunch. The C4 also has some perks you won't find on Samsung OLEDs, like Dolby Vision support and a remote with motion controls. I also like how it's available in a bunch of sizes, ranging from 42 inches to 83 inches.\nLG's webOS has undergone several iterations over the years. The interface used to work purely as a pop-up menu that appeared at the bottom of the display, but LG now offers a full-screen homepage like competing platforms. The organization is similar to other systems, with rows of icons for apps and content recommendations, as well as specific pages that focus on categories like home office, games, and music. As is the case with many smart TV systems, some ads are visible by default, but you can disable the top ad from showing up on the home screen.\nHowever, even when the main ad banner is disabled, I still don't like how the home screen emphasizes sponsored content and shopping options so high on the page. You have to scroll further down to find useful recommendations that are placed higher up on competing systems like Google TV. Our reviewer also ran into a glitch with a software update that caused some apps and services to stop working, but this was eventually fixed.\nThankfully, navigation speed is solid across LG's entire lineup, and you can choose between using LG's assistant or Amazon Alexa through hands-free controls or the remote. The remote itself stands out from other brands since it supports motion controls. In addition to navigation with standard buttons and a click wheel, you can point the remote at the screen to move a virtual cursor around, similar to a Nintendo Wii controller. This is a love-it or hate-it feature, but it's there for those who want it.\nThe LG C4 is a winner when it comes to image performance, with picture quality that almost matches the Samsung S90D as the best-looking TV in this guide. Its OLED panel provides wide viewing angles and an infinite contrast ratio with pixel-level dimming, so black levels truly disappear in a dark room. But, unlike Samsung's OLED, the C4 doesn't use quantum dots. As a result, the C4 has a slightly narrower range of colors and can't get quite as bright, with a peak of around 1,000 nits versus 1,240 on the S90D. Even so, it still has fantastic HDR performance, and it has the added bonus of including Dolby Vision support, which Samsung TVs lack.\nDolby Vision can give the TV more detailed guidance on how to render colors and contrast to best match the capabilities of its panel. The differences between Dolby Vision and other HDR formats are subtle, especially on high-end TVs, so I don't consider it a must-have feature. But it's still a nice perk. Check out our HDR TV guide for more details.\nLG also sells a 2025 version of this TV, the C5, which can get a little brighter and has a couple of new AI-powered features. That said, it costs more, so I still recommend the C4 as the better value. However, if you're a big enthusiast willing to spend top dollar, the premium LG G5 OLED is worth considering. It's expensive, but that high-end model offers a more substantial upgrade over the C4 and delivers the best image performance I've seen on a consumer TV.\nRead our LG C4 4K TV review and our LG C5 4K TV review.\nCheck out our guide to the best LG TVs.\nBest Amazon Fire TV\nThe Omni Mini LED is Amazon's flagship smart TV model. It uses a Mini LED backlight to provide a bright, high-contrast image. The display also has a fast 144Hz refresh rate for smoother gaming performance.\n- Mini LED backlight provides good contrast with minimal blooming\n- Hands-free Alexa support is integrated for controlling your smart home\n- Fire OS is littered with too many ads and sponsored content\n- Cheaper midrange TVs from TCL and Hisense have better picture quality\nAmazon has been licensing its Fire TV operating system to budget-friendly manufacturers like Insignia and Toshiba for many years, but the company didn't start making its own smart TVs until 2021. The brand's latest flagship offering is called the Fire TV Omni Mini LED. This model offers some improvements in picture performance compared to the company's cheaper options while still providing an extensive suite of Alexa-powered features.\nThe Fire TV OS is used across all of the company's smart TVs and streaming devices, including its Fire TV sticks. The interface has received a few welcome refreshes over the years to help alleviate some of the clunkiness of earlier iterations, but it's still one of my least favorite layouts.\nMy main gripe is that Amazon only puts a handful of app icons up-front and center at the top, so you have to go through some extra steps to access your entire lineup of downloaded streaming services. I also don't love how ads, sponsored recommendations, and picks geared toward Prime Video are emphasized so heavily on the home screen.\nHowever, those drawbacks aren't dealbreakers. Functionally, the interface works fine and offers all of the basic features found on competitors. Amazon even has an \"Ambient Experience\" mode with screensavers and widgets for the time and weather. One of the Omni Mini LED's main selling points is support for hands-free Alexa voice control. In practice, this allows the TV to perform a lot like an Echo speaker.\nThe Omni Mini LED also delivers good image quality for an upper-midrange TV, and its performance is close to that of similar Mini LED models from TCL and Hisense. However, it can't quite match rivals like the TCL QM7K in overall value for your dollar.\nOur reviewer measured a peak brightness of about 1,400 nits in HDR, which is a respectable number and more than double what the brand's step-down QLED model offers. Black levels were also solid during testing, but the TV measured a bit under expected brightness levels for low-to-medium shades of gray.\nThough the Omni Mini LED is the best smart TV in Amazon's lineup, I don't recommend it if picture quality is your top priority. Viewers who want a Fire TV display with truly premium image performance should venture outside Amazon's lineup and check out one of Panasonic's Fire TV OLED models. Panasonic's collection includes the flagship Z95 OLED and midrange Z85 OLED. Though more expensive than Amazon's Omni Mini LED, these Panasonic models are the most high-end smart TVs available with Amazon's interface.\nRead our Amazon Fire TV Omni Mini LED review.\nCheck out our guide to all the best Amazon Fire TV devices\nHow we test smart TVs\nTo choose the best smart TVs, our team tested various models from every major brand. We focused on selecting displays that represent the best overall value across each of the main smart TV platforms. We've been reviewing TVs for over a decade and have used that experience to develop our testing methodology. Our review process involves evaluating key performance areas, including operating system speed, smart features, picture clarity, contrast, brightness, color capabilities, and viewing angles.\nWe use a colorimeter to record a TV's peak brightness. Various test patterns from the Spears & Munsil UHD HDR Benchmark 4K Blu-ray disc are also used to check other objective metrics.\nBut grids and color bars can only reveal so much, so we place a big emphasis on real-world content and day-to-day viewing in our testing. We use a curated selection of scenes from movies and TV shows specifically chosen to demonstrate a TV's HDR performance, black levels, color, and fine detail. Demo material includes a mix of native 4K resolution (Ultra HD), high definition (HD), and standard definition (SD) programs through streaming, Blu-ray disc, and cable. This helps us see how a display's processing handles both high- and low-quality sources. Testing is done in both dark and bright conditions.\nWhen reviewing the best smart TVs, we also focus on putting each display's operating system to the test. Navigation speed is evaluated to see how long it takes for apps to load and to determine how smooth and consistent each interface is when adjusting settings and moving between menus. We note if any major TV apps are missing and take into account extra perks, like Alexa or Google Assistant support, ambient modes, smart home integration, and cloud gaming support.\nLearn more about our tech product review process.\nSmart TV FAQs\nWhich smart TV system is best?\nThe best smart TVs all have built-in operating systems, but different brands use different platforms. Here's a breakdown of popular smart TV systems and the brands that use them:\n- Fire TV: Amazon, Panasonic, Hisense, Toshiba, Insignia, Pioneer\n- Google TV: Sony, TCL, Hisense\n- Roku TV: Roku, TCL, Hisense, Sharp\n- Vizio Home: Vizio\n- Tizen: Samsung\n- webOS: LG\nThough app selection and general functionality are similar across each OS, their interface style, personalization options, digital assistants, and extra features vary. Ultimately, which smart TV system is best for your needs largely comes down to personal preference and whether you're already invested in a specific smart home ecosystem.\nFor instance, a Google TV or Fire TV will pair more seamlessly with existing Google or Amazon accounts, and they're built to work well with other devices from those brands.\nWhen it comes to overall interface design, I generally favor Roku's system the best since it's the most straightforward and reliable. However, its design is a little outdated compared to other platforms that offer a slick, content-focused style.\nFor more TV recommendations across various smart TV systems, check out our full suite of display guides:\n- Best 4K TVs\n- Best OLED TVs\n- Best budget TVs\n- Best TVs under $500\n- Best TVs for sports\n- Best 43-inch TVs\n- Best 50-inch TVs\n- Best 55-inch TVs\n- Best 65-inch TVs\n- Best 75-inch TVs\n- Best 85-inch TVs\n- Best 100-inch TVs\nShould you buy a 2024 or 2025 smart TV model?\nAll of the major brands have released new 2025 TV models. But while many 2025 TVs offer improved specifications and new features, 2024 models will remain available for the better part of the year, and they cost a lot less than their successors. With that in mind, we'll continue to recommend certain 2024 TVs as long as they remain in stock and provide the best value.\nLearn more about new smart TVs in our 2025 breakdowns:\n- LG C5 and G5 OLED TV details\n- Samsung QLED and OLED TV details\n- Top TVs revealed at CES 2025\n- Top 2025 TV trends\nDo any TVs use Apple's tvOS interface?\nApple does not license its tvOS interface to display manufacturers. As a result, there are no smart TVs with the Apple interface built in. The only way to get the tvOS interface on your display is to purchase a separate Apple TV streaming device.\nDo all smart TV platforms offer access to the same streaming apps?\nJust a few years ago, app selection varied a lot between different smart TV systems. Certain popular services \u2014 like HBO, Peacock, and Apple TV Plus \u2014 were only available via select smart TV systems. However, this is no longer the case. Generally speaking, all smart TV systems now offer access to the same core selection of video apps.\nFor instance, all of our picks for the best streaming services are available across all of the main TV operating systems, from the Roku OS to Samsung Tizen. That said, there are still exceptions when it comes to smaller services and niche offerings. For example, LG's webOS lacks access to the Criterion Channel app, while the Fire TV and Google TV OS don't support the Spectrum app to stream live TV if you have a Spectrum cable plan.\nIf you're shopping for a new smart TV and you frequently use a specific streaming app, check that service's device support page to ensure that it's available on the model you choose. But thankfully, even if you end up with a smart TV that's missing one of your favorite apps, you're not out of luck. Chances are that the service in question is available via a stand-alone streaming device, which you can purchase separately.\nHow do smart TVs compare to stand-alone streaming devices?\nThe best smart TVs all deliver solid streaming performance, and most buyers will be satisfied with their built-in interfaces, app catalogs, and features. However, navigation speed and overall app stability tend to be a bit snappier when using a separate streaming device. Likewise, some people may prefer a different interface or digital assistant than the ones that come built into their TV.\nIf you're unhappy with your smart TV's navigation speed, service selection, or visual design, check out our guide to the best streaming devices. Picks include set-top boxes and streaming sticks from Amazon, Google, Roku, and Apple. Reliable entry-level options are frequently on sale for under $20, while flagship models tend to cost between $70 and $150.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "If you're shopping for a new soundbar, Sonos is one of the top brands to consider. The company sells several models designed for different budgets and spaces. The best Sonos soundbars deliver good audio quality for movies and TV shows and support wireless music playback so you can enjoy your favorite songs.\nI've tested every Sonos soundbar available and can confidently recommend the Sonos Arc Ultra as the best. This high-end model offers excellent Dolby Atmos performance and uses new Sound Motion technology, which enables bigger bass without the need for a separate subwoofer. Meanwhile, buyers who want something more affordable and compact should check out the Sonos Ray, a smaller, budget-friendly model better suited for apartments and bedrooms.\nAll of Sonos' soundbars support the brand's mobile app, which allows you to control settings, play music, and pair speakers together for multi-room playback. This app received some updates over the last year, which initially caused widespread glitches. Thankfully, most of these bugs have been corrected, but the app still isn't perfect. Though there are some lingering software flaws, Sonos soundbars still deliver great audio performance and remain good options for anyone looking to upgrade their TV speakers.\nBelow, you can find all my picks for the best Sonos soundbars and recommendations for add-on speakers and subwoofers that can further enhance your audio experience.\nOur top picks for the best Sonos soundbars\nBest overall: Sonos Arc Ultra - See at Amazon\nBest on a budget: Sonos Ray - See at Amazon\nBest midrange model: Sonos Beam (Gen 2) - See at Amazon\nBest subwoofer add-on: Sonos Sub 4 - See at Amazon\nBest rear speaker add-on: Sonos Era 300 - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra carries over everything we loved about the original Arc soundbar while offering bigger bass, improved Dolby Atmos immersion, and cleaner dialogue. It's pricey, but few stand-alone soundbars can match its performance.\n- Noticeable bass increase over the previous Arc\n- Exceptional dialogue clarity\n- Detailed spatial effects with Dolby Atmos\n- Slightly sleeker design\n- More expensive than original Arc soundbar\n- Sonos app still experiencing occasional bugs and glitches\n- Optical connection requires additional adapter\n- No DTS:X support\nThe Arc Ultra is the best Sonos soundbar available. It replaces the brand's original Arc from 2020 and delivers some notable improvements. The Ultra is an absolute beast of an audio system and is the perfect fit for anyone who wants a powerful, all-in-one Dolby Atmos soundbar with deep bass.\nThis single soundbar unit can produce up to 9.1.4 channels of Dolby Atmos surround sound. It also has dedicated up-firing audio drivers to bounce sound off your ceiling, resulting in audio coming from all around the room, including above your head. In my tests, the Arc Ultra delivered an incredibly immersive experience, whether watching movies or listening to music. The sound is so expansive that I had a hard time believing it all came from just one device under my TV.\nOne of the Arc Ultra's secret ingredients is its new Sound Motion driver. This component packs multiple woofers into a compact space, offering deeper bass than the original Arc without making the soundbar any larger. The Sound Motion driver can't quite match the performance of a dedicated subwoofer, but it gives movies and shows more low-end presence and depth with a full, rich quality that few stand-alone soundbars can beat.\nThe Arc Ultra also has exceptional dialogue clarity. The device offers an optional AI speech enhancement mode, but I rarely had to rely on it because the bar's internal drivers are already so well-tuned for delivering clear speech. If you do find yourself needing an extra boost, the speech enhancement emphasizes dialogue even more without muddying explosions or altering other sound effects. It offers four levels of adjustments to choose from, including one designed for listeners with hearing loss\nOn the downside, the Arc Ultra is Sonos' most expensive soundbar, and it's disappointing that it doesn't support DTS:X, another 3D audio format that rivals Dolby Atmos. It also lacks HDMI video passthrough, so you can't use the bar to route extra devices to your TV, like a gaming console or streaming player. But these shortcomings are small compared to all the Arc Ultra gets right. If you want a single, powerful speaker in your living room that's capable of handling all your home theater needs, the Arc Ultra is the best Sonos soundbar there is.\nRead our Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar review.\nCheck out our guide to all of the best soundbars.\nBest on a budget\nThe Sonos Ray packs a thrilling punch of premium sound in a conveniently small package but begs some compromises when it comes to connection options.\n- Clear, full, and detailed sound quality\n- Small and stylish design\n- Connects and syncs with other Sonos speakers\n- No HDMI ARC\n- No Bluetooth or Dolby Atmos\n- No included remote\nThe Sonos Ray is the brand's most affordable and compact soundbar. Thanks to its small footprint, it's the best Sonos soundbar for bedrooms and apartments. For comparison, it's less than half the width of the Arc Ultra and a few inches shorter and less deep than the Beam (Gen 2). Despite its stature, it far outdoes the capabilities of most speakers embedded in TV sets, especially lower-end models.\nIn terms of audio quality, you can expect a smooth experience that brings any movie to life. You won't get the window-rattling lows or all of the flourishes offered on Sonos' pricier soundbars, but the Ray is impressive for its size, with a surprisingly detailed sound signature.\nStreaming music on the Ray over WiFi is great, too, offering better quality than a Bluetooth connection would provide. That said, it is a bummer that the Ray doesn't also include Bluetooth support as an alternative for those instances when WiFi might not be an option.\nThe Ray is also a bit lacking in wired connectivity. It doesn't include an HDMI port and can only connect to a TV (or PC) via an optical cable. This does mean it has wide compatibility among older televisions, but it also means that it doesn't support lossless audio formats, Dolby Atmos, or automatic pairing with your TV remote.\nStill, the Ray is a solid performer for the money, with audio quality that defies its small footprint.\nCheck out our guide to all of the best budget soundbars.\nBest midrange model\nWith the Sonos Beam, your living room becomes the center of a blissful smart home. It delivers big, balanced sound, and is a serious improvement over the built-in speakers in most TVs.\n- Big sound from a compact speaker\n- Dolby Atmos support\n- Decent surround sound simulation\n- No up-firing drivers\n- Pricey compared to similar competitors\n- No Bluetooth support\nThe Sonos Beam (Gen 2) serves as a middle ground between the brand's flagship Arc Ultra and entry-level Ray. It's powerful enough to fill a medium-sized space with sound, but it isn't that much bigger than the Ray, so it still works well in a bedroom or smaller living room. (That's where I predominantly use it.)\nBeyond size, the midrange Beam really differentiates itself from the cheaper Sonos Ray by adding an HDMI eARC connection and support for Dolby Atmos. This means it automatically works with many modern TV remotes, and it has a wider sound stage. For under $500, the Beam punches well above its weight class. It's a proper home theater in a box, perfect for most living rooms or other places that could use an audio upgrade.\nBut while the Beam supports decoding multi-channel audio formats with boisterous and vibrant performance, it doesn't feature any up-firing drivers. Instead, it relies on virtual processing to simulate a sense of overhead audio, which isn't as effective. As a result, you won't get the same kind of atmospheric overhead sound effects as you would on the more expensive Arc Ultra.\nStill, movies sound impactful, and the Beam fills my space well, even when set to under 50% volume. \"Dune\" is a great showcase for the Beam, with booming effects and a drum-heavy soundtrack that pounds along.\nMusic also sounds rich and full. It's impressive enough to serve as the DJ for home gatherings. Streaming music via WiFi through the Sonos app works well and encompasses a vast amount of services, but the soundbar also supports AirPlay for a more immediate listening experience. That said, like the Ray, the Beam is missing Bluetooth support.\nBest subwoofer add-on\nThe Sub 4 is Sonos' latest flagship subwoofer. It can pair wirelessly with Sonos speakers to enable bigger, deeper bass performance.\n- Intense bass performance\n- Vertical or horizontal orientation\n- Works with most Sonos speakers\n- Not compatible with speakers from other brands\n- Premium price (costs more than a Ray and Beam soundbar combined)\nIf you crave more bass, the best add-on you can buy for your Sonos soundbar is a subwoofer, specifically the Sonos Sub 4. It can wirelessly connect to the Ray, Beam, or Arc Ultra, so you can hide it in the back of a room or even on its side under a couch.\nThe subwoofer's force-canceling drivers produce deep, commanding bass for intense, dramatic effect during movies. But the woofer never becomes unwieldy in reverberations or rattling.\nIf you're an especially big bass head, you can even pair the Sonos Sub 4 with a second Sub 4 or Sub 3 unit. You can learn more about dual subwoofer compatibility on the Sonos website.\nGiven its premium performance, the Sub 4 works best with an Arc Ultra, though you can still use it with the smaller Beam or Ray. But for those more compact bars, the less expensive Sonos Sub Mini is a great alternative. It's not ported, so it doesn't have the same audio characteristics as the Sub 4 \u2014 it's a little tighter and more punchy \u2014 but it can still add extra dimension to your home theater setup.\nBest rear speaker add-on\nThis premium wireless speaker features up-firing and side-firing drivers to spread Dolby Atmos music around your room. It also has built-in support for Amazon Alexa and can serve as a rear speaker when paired with a Sonos soundbar.\n- Excellent atmospheric sound\n- Lots of power and volume headroom\n- Two Era 300 speakers can be a little bulky to put behind a couch\n- Pricey for a wireless speaker\nThe Sonos Era 300 is built to work as a stand-alone wireless speaker or as an add-on speaker for select Sonos soundbars. Two Era 300 units can be paired together and used as rear speakers in conjunction with an Arc Ultra or Beam to enable a true surround sound experience. (The Ray is not compatible with the Era 300.)\nThe Era 300 has built-in drivers firing in all directions, including upward. This allows it to provide genuine Dolby Atmos support with audio effects that bounce off your ceiling. If you have a Beam (Gen 2) or Arc Ultra, the Era 300 will work with them to provide an even more convincing sense of overheard audio and a wider Dolby Atmos sound stage.\nHowever, adding a pair of Era 300 speakers to your Sonos soundbar setup does require a fair amount of physical space, and they're a bit pricey.\nIf that's a problem for your room and budget, a pair of smaller, cheaper Era 100 speakers can also do a solid job as wireless rear speakers. The Era 100 even works with the Sonos Ray. That said, the Era 100 does not have up-firing Dolby Atmos drivers.\nHow we test Sonos soundbars\nI've been testing Sonos soundbars since the brand's first model, the Playbar, was released in 2013, so I have extensive experience with all of the company's offerings. For this guide, I reviewed all of the brand's current soundbars to determine what kind of user each is best for.\nMy evaluation involved pairing each soundbar to the same TV. This way, I could gauge how they performed independently and compare them all in the same environment. I focused on aspects like audio quality, physical size, connectivity, software features, and ease of use to help inform my decisions about what circumstances they work best for.\nIn my hands-on time, I also used the best Sonos soundbars in other rooms around my house to get a sense of how they worked in different spaces. I based a lot of my assessments on how the soundbars performed while watching movies with high-quality surround sound mixes. But I also watched sitcoms and older films to hear how they sounded with more modest tracks and lower quality sources. For music, I streamed songs from my phone and used the Apple Music app on my Apple TV streaming box.\nWith the exception of the Sonos Ray, which only supports a digital optical connection, I stuck with an HDMI eARC connection to get the best-quality audio on each soundbar.\nSonos soundbars FAQs\nCan you wall-mount a Sonos soundbar?\nThe best Sonos soundbars included in this guide all support wall mounting. Sonos makes mounts for each of its speakers, and you can also find third-party mounts, which usually cost less.\nCan you pair a subwoofer to a Sonos soundbar?\nAll of Sonos's current soundbar models support the brand's Sub 4 or Sub Mini subwoofers. The Arc Ultra even supports dual subs, as long as you pair a Sub 4 and/or Sub 3. However, Sonos soundbars are not compatible with subwoofers made by other brands.\nFor soundbar recommendations that include a subwoofer in the box, visit our guide to the best soundbars with subwoofers.\nCan you pair rear speaker units to a Sonos soundbar?\nYes, Sonos soundbars can pair with Sonos' rear speaker units, but only certain models are compatible. You can pair two Sonos Era 100 speakers with a Sonos Arc Ultra, Sonos Beam (Gen 2), or Sonos Ray to use them as wireless rear speakers. The Beam and Arc Ultra soundbars also support using Sonos Era 300 speakers as rear surrounds.\nFor more speaker and soundbar recommendations that use rear satellites, visit our guide to the best surround sound systems.\nCan you pair Sonos soundbars with the Sonos Ace headphones?\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra, Ray, and Beam are all compatible with Sonos's TV Swap feature. This function allows you to connect the soundbar to a pair of Sonos Ace headphones and seamlessly switch between them while watching TV.\nCan Sonos soundbars play Dolby Atmos surround sound?\nBoth the Sonos Arc Ultra and Sonos Beam (Gen 2) support Dolby Atmos. However, only the Ultra has up-firing audio drivers to produce overhead Atmos sound effects. In contrast, the Beam uses processing to simulate overhead sounds, which isn't as convincing.\nTo learn more about the format, check out our Dolby Atmos guide. For more soundbar recommendations with Atmos support, visit our roundup of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars.\nIs the Sonos app reliable?\nSonos released a new mobile app in May 2024, and many customers reported issues with various glitches and missing features. However, the company has since fixed many of those problems.\nWhen reviewing the Arc Ultra, we encountered minor issues with delayed speaker switching, but didn't encounter any major bugs. Though the Sonos app still isn't perfect, its lingering flaws aren't big enough to be a dealbreaker.\nIs Sonos better than Bose?\nSonos and Bose sell similar soundbars, but certain models are slightly better than others. On the high end, we think the Sonos Arc Ultra has an edge over the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar thanks to Sonos' newly improved bass support.\nHowever, the midrange Bose Smart Soundbar offers better Dolby Atmos performance than the rival Sonos Beam since the former has up-firing audio drivers.\nThe entry-level Sonos Ray and Bose TV Speaker are very evenly matched, with minor pros and cons. We like that the Sonos Ray supports WiFi, but some users may prefer the Bose TV Speaker's HDMI connection, which the Ray lacks.\nBoth brands support wireless multi-room audio systems, but their speakers can only pair with other models made by the same company. For that reason, we recommend sticking with one brand rather than mixing and matching.\nYou can learn more about Bose's speakers in our guide to the best Bose soundbars.\nWhat other audio products does Sonos sell?\nIn addition to soundbars, Sonos sells wireless speakers, including the Sonos Era 100, Era 300, Move 2, Roam 2, and Five. The brand also sells over-ear headphones called the Sonos Ace.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "High dynamic range (HDR) is a feature found on many modern TVs, and it can dramatically enhance picture quality. HDR allows a display to produce images with higher brightness, better contrast, and expanded colors. In other words, HDR can make images pop more intensely, appear more realistic, and look closer to how content creators intended.\nBut while HDR is now a common feature on many of the best TVs, performance varies greatly across different models. Just because a display says it supports HDR doesn't mean it's capable of fully taking advantage of the feature. Some budget-friendly sets, like the Roku Plus Series, do a solid job of offering entry-level HDR performance, but to get the most impressive HDR experience, you'll need a top OLED display, like the Samsung S95F, or a bright QLED TV with Mini LEDs, like the TCL QM7.\nTo help sort through all the ins and out of high-dynamic-range technology, we've put together a comprehensive guide detailing everything you need to know about HDR TVs and different formats.\nWhat is HDR for TVs?\nHigh dynamic range (HDR) is a display technology that enables a TV or monitor to produce enhanced contrast levels when playing HDR-encoded videos. This allows bright elements of an image to look brighter and dark elements to look darker while preserving more detail in all the steps between both ends of the spectrum.\nThe enhanced contrast of HDR creates an added sense of depth with more visible details and realistic intensity in specular highlights and shadows. A good example would be a scene featuring sunlight glimmering off the ocean. Without HDR, a sequence like this could look comparatively dull with lost detail and clipped highlights, but with the expanded range that HDR allows, extreme highlights like this are given room to breathe and really pop. The reflecting light can look more radiant and more detailed simultaneously.\nBrightness levels for HDR are measured in a unit called nits. The more nits a TV can produce, the brighter its HDR highlights can look. In general, most HDR movies and TV shows are mastered with a max of 1,000 to 4,000 nits in mind, though HDR videos can technically be mastered for up to a whopping 10,000 nits. However, very few consumer displays can hit such a high number. Most premium HDR TVs max out at around 1,500 to 4,000 nits, while midrange models achieve 700 to 1,500 nits, and entry-level options offer around 400 to 700 nits.\nWhat is Wide Color Gamut?\nHDR is often bundled with another display feature called Wide Color Gamut (WCG), which enables a TV to produce an expanded range of colors. Though technically two separate things, a wide color gamut is almost always used when mastering a video in HDR, so WCG is often considered part of HDR tech.\nWhen using WCG, HDR videos are encoded within a color space called Rec. 2020, though most HDR movies and TV shows are actually graded for a narrower standard called DCI-P3. DCI-P3 is the same range of colors used for modern digital theater projection, while Rec. 2020 can offer an even wider range than that.\nSo, with HDR and WCG, you can enjoy the full spectrum of colors you see in theaters at home.\nHow does HDR compare to SDR?\nBefore the first consumer HDR displays hit the market in 2015, TVs were built to adhere to a standard dynamic range (SDR) specification. SDR displays and content are designed with a max of only 100 nits in mind, and they're typically produced for a limited color gamut called Rec. 709. Compared to the DCI-P3 color space used on most HDR videos, Rec. 709 offers a more restricted gamut of colors.\nThis means that SDR displays produce comparatively dim and low-contrast images with a narrower range of colors when compared to an HDR TV playing HDR programming. As a result, an SDR version of a movie or TV show will often look a bit flat and muted compared to its HDR counterpart.\nThough less common nowadays, SDR TVs in HD and 4K resolution are still manufactured, and all HDR-compatible TVs can still display SDR signals accurately. While HDR mastering has become a popular choice for new on-demand streaming content and 4K Blu-ray movies, SDR is still the norm for cable, satellite, live TV streaming, and over-the-air broadcasts.\nHow do I watch HDR movies and TV shows?\nTo watch HDR videos, you need an HDR-capable display and access to HDR-encoded content. Every element in your home entertainment chain also has to support HDR, so if you watch videos through a streaming stick, it needs to be HDR compatible, and if you connect your media player to your TV through an AV receiver or soundbar, those components need to support HDR passthrough. Likewise, all devices need to be paired together using premium- or ultra-high-speed HDMI cables. Check out our guide to the best HDMI cables for recommendations.\nHDR videos are available on all the best streaming services, including Disney Plus, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. HDR is also used on most 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. Some live sporting events are also shown in HDR through certain providers, but the vast majority of cable, satellite, and livestreaming broadcasts are still presented in SDR.\nWhat should I look for in an HDR TV?\nAll of the best 4K TVs include some level of HDR support, and some HDTVs even have HDR capabilities. However, performance varies dramatically between cheaper models and more expensive displays.\nIf you want the best HDR performance, you'll want to buy either an OLED TV or a QLED display with local dimming and expanded colors. Some top QLED models are sometimes called Mini LED TVs since they use smaller LEDs in their backlights to enable more precise dimming capabilities.\nThese display options all offer the contrast control, peak brightness, and color capabilities needed to really showcase the benefits of HDR playback. For details on the differences between OLED and QLED TVs, check out our QLED vs. OLED comparison.\nWhen it comes to brightness, you'll want to choose a display model that comes close to outputting 1,000 nits or higher to get the most impactful HDR quality. However, TVs with that level of performance tend to be a bit pricey, and you can still get worthwhile entry-level HDR out of cheaper models that max out in the 500 to 600 nits range.\nSome top premium HDR TVs available right now include the LG G5 OLED, Samsung S95F OLED, Sony Bravia 9 QLED, and Hisense U9N QLED. Top midrange options include models like the Samsung S90D OLED, LG C4 OLED, and TCL QM7 QLED. Meanwhile, the Hisense U6N QLED and Roku Plus Series QLED are both great budget options.\nFor more recommendations, check out our various TV buying guides:\n- Best budget TVs\n- Best TVs under $500\n- Best smart TVs\n- Best OLED TVs\n- Best 100-inch TVs\n- Best 85-inch TVs\n- Best 75-inch TVs\n- Best 65-inch TVs\n- Best 55-inch TVs\n- Best 50-inch TVs\nAre there different HDR formats?\nYes, there are four primary HDR video formats: HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and HLG.\nHDR10 is the most basic and common HDR format. It's supported on all HDR TVs and is used as the standard HDR format on all 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray discs and streaming apps with HDR content. In other words, it can be thought of as the default HDR base layer that more advanced HDR formats can be added on top of.\nHDR10 videos can be mastered for a peak of up to 10,000 nits, though most HDR10 content has been graded for 1,000-4,000 nits. HDR10 videos are encoded with information called \"static metadata.\" This metadata tells a TV what colors to show and how bright the TV's images are supposed to look. Static metadata is a bit limited, however, as it can only provide information that addresses the video as a whole instead of each individual scene.\nWhen an HDR10 movie is played on an HDR TV that can't support the full range of brightness and color that its metadata calls for, the display must adapt on its own to scale highlights and color volume to land within its capabilities. This kind of adjustment is called \"tone mapping,\" and different display manufacturers handle tone mapping differently.\nIn practice, this can lead to issues with certain scenes in HDR10 videos appearing too blown out or too dark since a TV's tone mapping may not match what a content creator intended. And this is where Dolby Vision and HDR10+ come in.\nDolby Vision and HDR10+ are both \"dynamic metadata\" HDR formats. This means that HDR brightness and color information can be detailed on a scene-by-scene or even shot-by-shot basis. As a result, Dolby Vision and HDR10+ videos can provide more detailed tone mapping instructions to a TV so that the creators' original intent is more accurately preserved. These formats are supported on select TVs, discs, and streaming services.\nFinally, HLG is an HDR format used for TV broadcasts. This format does not use metadata at all, and it's backward compatible with SDR displays, so broadcasters can send an HLG signal to all customers and have it look correct on both SDR and HDR TVs. If an HDR TV broadcast were sent to an SDR TV using any of the other HDR formats we've discussed, it would display with inaccurate colors and contrast.\nAre Dolby Vision and HDR10+ better than HDR10?\nYes, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision can both deliver a more accurate high-dynamic-range image than the standard HDR10 format. However, their improvements are often subtle and are best appreciated on entry- and midlevel HDR TVs, which can benefit the most from their dynamic tone mapping instructions.\nPopular HDR TV models typically include support for one or both of these dynamic metadata formats. But in most cases, we don't think it's a dealbreaker if one is supported and the other isn't.\nIs Dolby Vision better than HDR10+?\nDolby Vision and HDR10+ offer the same primary benefits compared to HDR10, and neither format has a major technical advantage over the other. However, Dolby Vision has traditionally had an edge in industry support. That said, HDR10+ support has been expanding.\nSix of the seven major TV brands in the US sell TVs with Dolby Vision capabilities, while five of those seven support HDR10+. Here's a chart detailing which TV brands sell models with Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support.\n| Brand | Dolby Vision | HDR10+ | HDR10 |\n| Hisense | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| LG | \u2713 | \u2713 | |\n| Panasonic | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| Samsung | \u2713 | \u2713 | |\n| Sony | \u2713 | \u2713 | |\n| TCL | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| Vizio | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\nWhen it comes to content, Dolby Vision movies and TV shows are also more prevalent than HDR10+ programs. More studios support Dolby Vision on Ultra HD Blu-ray discs, and more streaming services use it. However, several platforms, including Netflix and Disney Plus, have recently announced the addition of HDR10+ support. Here's a breakdown of Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support among major streaming services.\n| Streaming service | Dolby Vision | HDR10+ | HDR10 |\n| Amazon Prime Video | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| Apple TV Plus | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| Disney Plus* | \u2713 | \u2713 | |\n| Max | \u2713 | \u2713 | |\n| Hulu | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| Paramount Plus | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| Peacock | \u2713 | \u2713 | |\n| Netflix | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n*Disney Plus has announced plans to launch HDR10+ support later this year.\nDo video games support HDR?\nHDR gaming is supported on PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox One X/S, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and compatible computers. However, only some games are designed with native HDR output.\nWindows PCs can support games using the HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision formats. Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S support HDR10 and Dolby Vision. The PS5 is limited to HDR10 only.\nIf you're using a PC, you'll need an operating system, monitor, and graphics card that all support HDR to display HDR games properly.\nThe Nintendo Switch does not support HDR, but the new Nintendo Switch 2 will support HDR10 gaming in handheld and docked modes when it launches in June.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "As far as I'm concerned, there's no such thing as a TV that's too big. Extra-large displays are growing in popularity, and many brands now sell massive 100-inch screens across budgets. The best 100-inch TVs offer a theater-like experience from the comfort of your couch, with an expanded sense of immersion for movies, sports, and video games. Though displays this large used to be outrageously expensive, prices are now more reasonable, with options starting at around $1,500.\nI've been reviewing home entertainment gear for over a decade and used that experience to pick the best 100-inch and 98-inch TVs you can buy. My top recommendation for most people is the Hisense U76N. This QLED is typically sold for under $2,000 and delivers solid brightness and a wide range of colors. But those willing to spend more should consider the upper-midrange TCL QM7K. Though pricier, the QM7K has more precise contrast control and an even brighter picture, enabling better picture quality.\nBelow, you can find full details on all of my picks for the best 100-inch TVs. Keep in mind that TV sizes vary slightly depending on the manufacturer and display type, with 97, 98, and 100 inches being popular options. With that in mind, this guide includes picks from 97 to 100 inches.\nOur top picks for the best 100-inch TVs\nBest overall: Hisense U76N QLED 4K TV- See at Amazon\nBest midrange: TCL QM7K QLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest high-end QLED: TCL QM8K QLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest on a budget: TCL Q65 QLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest OLED: LG G5 OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nThis 100-inch TV is a whopping size that will allow you to catch every inch of every movie and every game. With up to 800 nits of HDR brightness, local dimming, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate, it is one of the best values at this size.\n- Great value for such a huge size\n- Solid HDR brightness capabilities\n- Fast refresh rate for smooth gaming\n- Mediocre viewing angles\n- Lacks Mini LED backlight for more precise contrast control\nWhen weighing overall performance for the money, the Hisense U76N is the best 100-inch TV available right now. It's often sold for under $2,000, which is a great deal for such a large QLED with these specifications.\nThe U76N uses a QLED display with full-array local dimming. This feature enables it to produce higher contrast and better black levels than cheaper TVs this big, like the TCL Q65. It's also capable of displaying a wide range of colors, and its brightness capabilities are solid for a set in this class.\nThe panel's luminance is rated for a peak of around 800 nits. That's not as high as the 1,800+ nits delivered by pricier QLED models like the TCL QM7K and QM8K, but it's still enough to see the benefits of high-dynamic-range (HDR) content. The U76N also supports up to a 144Hz refresh rate, which allows it to unlock high frame rate modes when gaming on a PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X.\nI also like that the U76N uses the Google TV operating system. This interface has become one of my favorites thanks to its clean layout, easy access to your favorite services, solid content recommendations, and full integration with a Google account.\nOn the downside, like most QLED TVs in this class, the U76N's viewing angles are mediocre, so colors and contrast distort if you sit off-center. On extra-large screens like this, viewing angles also become an issue if you sit very close to the display, as color and contrast can shift on the far left and right of the TV. But it's rare to find wider viewing angles in this price range, so I don't consider this a dealbreaker.\nThere are pricier 100-inch TVs with better image quality, but the Hisense U76N balances solid performance and an incredible level of immersion for a reasonable price. It's a great fit for anyone who wants a gigantic TV for movies, sports, and video games for under $2,000.\nBuyers should note that Hisense recently launched several new midrange 100-inch TVs for 2025, including the U65QF and U75QG. Both models have better specifications than the U76N but cost more.\nBest midrange\nThe QM7K is TCL's latest midrange QLED TV model with a Mini LED backlight. This model can get brighter than the cheaper QM6K, offering more impact in contrast and colors. It also has excellent local dimming performance.\n- Great HDR brightness for a midrange TV\n- Impressive contrast control with minimal backlight flaws\n- Black levels are good but can't match those of pricier Mini LED TVs\n- Though better than last year's model, viewing angles can't match those of an OLED\nIf you're willing to spend more than $2,000, TCL's new 98-inch QM7K is an excellent option. This midrange QLED is a strong performer for its class and typically sells for around $2,600 to $2,800.\nLike the Hisense U76N, the TCL QM7K uses a QLED panel with local dimming. But this model has a more precise Mini LED backlighting system, which helps deliver higher brightness and better contrast control. When reviewing the 65-inch model, I measured a peak brightness of around 1,800 nits, and the 98-inch size should be comparable. That's more than double the brightness of the U76N. This higher luminance enables HDR highlights to look more vibrant and impactful. It also helps the TV better overcome glare in rooms with ambient light.\nThe QM7K's backlight system is impressive as well, with some notable improvements over last year's QM7 model. Though I noticed some uneven patches of contrast in dark scenes when testing the older QM7, the QM7K is able to nearly eliminate this flaw. Black levels are still a tad elevated compared to what you'd see on an OLED or some pricier QLED displays, but the TV does an excellent job of minimizing halos and light bleed.\nViewing angles are still limited, but they're wider than I've seen on most QLED TVs in this tier. Contrast and colors fade a bit from an off-axis view, but the effect is notably less severe than it was on last year's QM7.\nThe QM7K's smart TV and gaming capabilities are also great, with smooth Google TV navigation and support for up to a 144Hz refresh rate. Though I've encountered software glitches on some TCL TVs in the past, the QM7K was free from any major bugs.\nBest high-end QLED\nThe QM8K is TCL's top QLED TV for 2025. It gets incredibly bright and offers even better local dimming performance than step-down models. This massive model is a great choice for people who want a high-end 98-inch QLED.\n- Incredibly bright with impressive backlight control\n- Better viewing angles than most QLEDs\n- Much more affordable than similar 98-inch TVs from Samsung, LG, and Sony\n- Limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports\n- Missing 165Hz support found on some rival high-end sets\nThe TCL QM8K QLED is the best 98-inch TV for people who want high-end image quality without paying an outrageous amount of money. This model is typically sold for around $4,000, but dropped to as low as $3,000 during Prime Day. Though that's still a big investment in a TV, it's a lot less than similar 100-inch sets from brands like Samsung, Sony, and LG.\nThe QM8K replaces my previous pick in this category, the 100-inch Hisense U8K. Hisense's display is still an excellent TV, but it's an older model, so it's hard to find in stock, and its performance is beaten by newer sets. Hisense sells an improved 2025 model, called the U8QG, but it's more expensive than the TCL QM8K.\nThe QM8K has the same basic capabilities as the brand's cheaper QM7K, including a QLED panel with Mini LED backlighting, a 144Hz refresh rate, and smooth Google TV navigation. However, this model can get substantially brighter, and its contrast control is even better.\nOur reviewer measured a peak of 3,648 nits on a 10% window, which makes the QM8K the brightest TV in this guide by a large margin. This level of brightness enables HDR videos to truly shine. It also gives viewers ample headroom to pump up the TV's luminance in order to overcome reflections in rooms with lots of sunlight.\nThough the TV's Mini LED backlight can't quite match the pixel-level precision of an OLED, the QM8K has the best contrast control our reviewer has seen on a QLED. Blooming, halos, and light bleed were virtually nonexistent during testing, even when sampling especially tricky scenes. Viewing angles are also really good for a QLED TV. There are still shifts in color and contrast when you view the display from an angle, but not enough to make the image look washed out.\nCompared to pricier QLED sets from other companies, the QM8K delivers exceptional high-end value. For instance, the 98-inch QM8K actually has better performance than Samsung's 98-inch QN90D and QN90F in several areas, but those competing TVs typically cost a whopping $6,000 to $11,000 more. Samsung's TVs are known for better build quality, but it's hard to justify such a gigantic price gap when image quality is so similar.\nRead our TCL QM8K 4K TV review.\nBest on a budget\nTCL's Q65 is one of the most affordable 98-inch TVs on the market. It uses quantum dot tech to provide a wide range of colors, but its contrast ratio is lower than pricier QLED TVs.\n- One of the most budget-friendly 98-inch TVs available\n- Quantum dots enable a wide color gamut\n- Up to a 144Hz refresh rate for smooth gaming performance\n- Contrast and black levels are limited without local dimming\n- Poor viewing angles\n- Dimmer than pricier QLED models\nIf you're buying a 100- or 98-inch TV, you should be prepared to spend a good amount of money, but sets in this tier have come down in price a lot over the last couple of years. Budget models are now regularly sold for around $1,500 to $1,600, and the 98-inch TCL Q65 is the best option.\nLike the other TCL and Hisense displays in this guide, the Q65 uses a QLED panel with great color performance. However, this model doesn't have a Mini LED backlight or local dimming. Without those features, it can't match the contrast, brightness, or black-level capabilities of my pricier picks. As a result, the Q65 looks more washed out and uneven when watching TV in a dark room, and it can't overcome glare as well in a bright room. It's also prone to narrow viewing angles, like most QLEDs in this class.\nBut that's not to say that the Q65 has bad image quality. It's just that this is closer to an entry-level TV than a midrange or high-end set. The Q65 is a great budget pick for people who want a giant screen size instead of paying a similar amount to get a smaller TV with better picture performance.\nThe 98-inch Q65 actually has a higher refresh rate than its 50-, 55-, 65-, and 75-inch counterparts, so it's a solid gaming TV, too. This model supports up to 144Hz, VRR, and ALLM. The Q65's built-in Google TV operating system is also solid, and you get a Google Assistant voice remote.\nBest OLED\nThis is one of the few 97-inch OLED TVs available. The G5 offers premium image quality that bests every other TV at this size but the 97-inch model can't get as bright as its smaller counterparts. Though it has an incredibly high price tag, it delivers the ultimate movie-watching experience for buyers with deep pockets.\n- Pixel-level contrast ratio\n- Deep black levels\n- Wide viewing angles\n- Included mount hangs flush on your wall\n- Prohibitively expensive for most buyers\n- Not as bright as smaller G5 models\n- Does not include a traditional stand\nOLED TVs larger than 83 inches are rare. This is because OLED panels are difficult to produce in extra-large sizes, which makes them very expensive. This brings us to LG's 97-inch G5 OLED TV. Though this set is one of the most impressive-looking displays available at this size, it costs a head-spinning $25,000.\nA list price of $25,000 is hard to stomach, even if you have deep pockets. But if money is no object, the 97-inch G5 is a home theater dream come true. Unlike my other picks, which use QLED panels that need a backlight, the G5's OLED screen has an infinite contrast ratio with perfect black levels that disappear into a dark room. High contrast is one of the most important elements of premium picture quality, and contrast doesn't get any better than this.\nViewing angles are also exceptional, with no major loss in color or contrast if you sit to the side of the screen or up close. However, it's important to note that the 97-inch version of this TV does not use the new four-stack panel design that its smaller counterparts use. This means the 97-inch G5 can't match the brightness and color performance of the 83-, 77-, 65-, and 55-inch sizes. Its peak brightness capabilities are also lower than those of premium QLED models like the TCL QM8K.\nBut the 97-inch G5 still gets bright enough for most use cases. Likewise, it offers better HDR performance than any competing QLED thanks to the pixel-level dimming capabilities of its OLED screen. The G5 also has high-end styling, with a thin profile that can be mounted flush on your wall. But remember that the G5 only comes with a mount and does not include a stand.\nLG's webOS smart TV platform rounds out the package with access to all the major apps most users need. This year's software adds some cool AI-powered functions and enhanced features. Most notably, the G5 has a voice recognition system that automatically switches profiles and swaps curated recommendations when it hears who is speaking commands.\nThe G5 also supports a 120Hz refresh rate with a PS5, Xbox Series X, or Nintendo Switch 2, but it falls short of the 165Hz capabilities supported by smaller sizes. This limitation is only noteworthy if you're a PC gamer with a rig that's powerful enough to play games at high frame rates.\nMost people are much better off saving money by going with one of the cheaper 100-inch QLED models I recommend or by stepping down to an 83-inch G5, which costs a lot less and gets brighter. But for big home theater enthusiasts with equally big wallets, the 97-inch G5 is unmatched at this size.\nRead our LG G5 4K TV review.\nVisit our guides to the best OLED TVs and best LG TVs.\nWhat else we considered\nThough the models above represent our top picks for the best 100-inch TVs, there are other options worth considering for specific needs and budgets. Here's a rundown of some other quality 100-inch displays with details on why they didn't quite make the cut for this guide.\nSamsung 100-inch QN80F QLED TV - See at Amazon\nThe QN80F is one of Samsung's upper midrange QLED TVs for 2025, and it's now available in a 100-inch screen size. Like the TCL QM7K and QM8K, this display uses a Mini LED backlight with local dimming to produce great contrast and solid brightness. However, the QN80F costs substantially more than the QM7K, and it can't get quite as bright. This is a good buy if you're willing to pay extra because you favor Samsung as a brand, but otherwise, we give an edge to more affordable models with similar specs.\nTCL 98-inch QM6K QLED TV - See at Amazon\nThis is TCL's latest entry-level Mini LED model, and it performs favorably against the Hisense U76N, the current top pick in this guide. The QM6K offers better contrast control, but its brightness capabilities are similar. Given the current cost difference, the U76N remains the better value. However, that could change in the near future, as we expect the QM6K's price to drop as the year goes on.\nRead our full TCL QM6K TV review.\nHow we select 100-inch TVs\nTo choose the best 100-inch TVs, our team relied on a combination of hands-on testing and research informed by years of TV review experience. When we review TVs, we usually evaluate 65-inch models since many brands consider that their premier size. However, most TV models carry over the same general specifications across sizes 55 inches and up.\nWith that in mind, general performance results for a 65-inch TV will also apply to its 100-inch counterpart. Some larger TVs do have more pronounced differences compared to their smaller versions, but we've detailed those differences when applicable.\nTo evaluate a TV's image quality, we rely on day-to-day viewing, demo material, test patterns, and a colorimeter to measure brightness. We use specific clips from various movies and shows to review different picture quality attributes, like contrast, black levels, HDR highlights, clarity, and color. We also sample material across different quality levels, from standard definition to 4K, in both standard dynamic range (SDR) and HDR.\nWe try to use each TV we test as we would if we had it as our regular daily display by watching streaming content, cable channels, and Blu-ray discs in both bright and dark environments. We also test smart TV features, like navigation speed and digital assistant functions, to ensure they work properly.\n100-inch TV FAQs\nHow much should you spend on a 100-inch TV?\nThe best 100-inch TVs don't come cheap. However, 100- and 98-inch QLED displays have come down dramatically in cost compared to when they first launched several years ago. This is especially true if you shop from brands like Hisense and TCL, which have made huge strides toward bringing 100-inch TVs to the mainstream.\nWhen on sale, the best 100-inch TVs from Hisense and TCL start at around $1,500 for entry-level models, $2,000 to $2,800 for midrange options, and around $3,000 to $5,000 for high-end sets. Brands like Sony, Samsung, and LG also sell a few 98- and 100-inch QLED TV models, but they cost a lot more and don't offer a big jump in image performance.\nUnfortunately, extra-large OLED TVs have not come down in price like their QLED counterparts have. The few OLEDs available in sizes over 83 inches remain prohibitively expensive for most people, but if you have deep pockets, you can find 97-inch OLED TVs for around $20,000 to $25,000. You can learn more about the benefits of an OLED in our QLED vs. OLED comparison.\nShould you buy a 100-inch TV or a projector?\nIf you're shopping for the best 100-inch TV, chances are you're also considering a projector to handle your big-screen needs. Projectors have some perks over TVs this large and some key drawbacks.\nWhen it comes to benefits, projectors are capable of producing even larger images, with many models supporting up to 300 inches. Depending on your room, setting up a thin projector screen could be much simpler than finding a place to rest or mount a heavy 100-inch TV. You can also find many budget-friendly projectors for under $1,000, while entry-level 100-inch TVs start at around $1,500 when they're on sale.\nHowever, there are some notable cons to keep in mind. Many affordable projectors still use Full HD (1080p) resolution rather than 4K, and some options advertised as 4K actually use pixel-shift methods to approximate a higher resolution rather than deliver a true native 4K image. Projectors must also be placed at a certain distance from the screen to enable certain image sizes. Though short-throw projectors can be placed very close, long-throw models must be at a greater distance, which can be tricky for certain spaces.\nProjectors also struggle with brightness compared to TVs. Many entry- and mid-tier models lack the luminance necessary for daytime viewing in a bright room. In most cases, a typical consumer projector's contrast performance and HDR capabilities are also noticeably worse than those of a midrange TV, which leads to a more washed-out and less dynamic image with elevated black levels. Gamers should also note that it's rare to find projector models that support a 4K/120Hz refresh rate.\nHigh-end projectors, especially those from brands like Sony and JVC, can still deliver exceptional image quality, but the best 100-inch TVs will yield better picture performance than any projector you can buy at a comparable price.\nAre TVs available in sizes larger than 100 inches?\nYes, some brands sell TVs that are even bigger than 100 inches. Most notably, Hisense has the 116-inch TriChroma LED TV (116UX) and the 110-inch UX QLED TV, while TCL has the 115-inch QM7K and 115-inch QM89 QLED TV.\nLater this year, Hisense is set to release another TV that's larger than 100 inches: the 136-inch MicroLED TV (136MX). You can learn more in our CES 2025 TV roundup and our breakdown of 2025 TV trends.\nFor buyers who want something smaller than 100 inches, be sure to check out our other TV guides:\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "I test TVs for a living, so I review all kinds of display types. While there's a lot to like about LED and QLED models, OLED displays continue to impress me the most. They're pricey, but the best OLED TVs deliver better black levels, higher contrast, and wider viewing angles than other types of TVs. If picture performance is your priority, there's no substitute for an OLED.\nTo help you find the right model for your needs, I used my expertise to put together a guide to the four best OLED TVs available. My top pick for most people is the Samsung S90D, which offers a wide range of vivid colors at an attractive midrange price. But if you're willing to spend top dollar, the premium LG G5 delivers the best overall image quality I've seen on any consumer display.\nBelow, you can find all my picks for the best OLED TVs, with options for different budgets and uses.\nOur top picks for the best OLED TVs\nBest overall: Samsung S90D 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest high-end display: LG G5 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest on a budget: LG B4 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest anti-glare screen: Samsung S95D 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nThe S90D is our favorite TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class.\n- Excellent peak brightness for a midrange OLED\n- High color volume with quantum dot technology\n- Wide viewing angles so picture doesn't degrade when sitting off center\n- Smart TV interface is OK but not the best\n- Issue with update notifications\n- Dolby Vision isn't supported\nThe Samsung S90D is the best OLED TV for most people. In fact, it's my pick for the best TV across all display types. There are pricier sets with better image performance, but when it comes to overall value, the S90D is tough to beat.\nLike all OLED TVs, the S90D has pixel-level black levels that disappear into a dark room, wide viewing angles, and an infinite contrast ratio. However, this model stands out from similarly priced competitors thanks to its use of quantum dot color technology.\nQuantum dots enable the 55-, 65-, and 77-inch S90D models to produce a brighter image with better color performance than a typical OLED. In my tests, I measured a peak brightness of around 1,240 nits on the 65-inch S90D. That's a decent step up from the 1,000-nit max of this model's predecessor, the S90C, and most competing midrange OLEDs from LG and Sony.\nThe TV also sustains vivid saturation at high brightness levels better than LG's C-Series OLEDs. As a result, high-dynamic-range (HDR) content really pops. HDR10 and HDR10+ videos look great through streaming services and 4K Blu-ray discs. On the downside, it's disappointing that Samsung still doesn't support Dolby Vision, a popular HDR format. However, I don't consider that a dealbreaker for a TV in this performance class. Check out our HDR TV guide for details on how Dolby Vision stacks up to other HDR formats.\nSmart TV capabilities are also solid, but navigation can lag a little, and I ran into some glitches with notifications and apps automatically booting up. These are small hiccups, though, and likely to be corrected with firmware. On the plus side, the interface includes a cool Gaming Hub that lets you use services like Xbox Game Pass to stream games without a console.\nSamsung does sell a newer version of this TV, the S90F, that offers some improvements in performance. But it costs substantially more. For now, the S90D remains the better buy.\nCheck out our guides to the best Samsung TVs and the best smart TVs.\nNote: The 42-, 48-, and 83-inch S90D models don't use quantum dots, so those sizes can't offer the same color performance as the 55-, 65-, and 77-inch models.\nBest high-end display\nThe G5 is LG's flagship OLED TV for 2025. It's one of the brightest OLED TVs we've ever seen, delivering high-end image quality and an elegant design that can hang flush on your wall.\n- Industry-leading OLED brightness\n- Deep black levels with an infinite contrast ratio\n- Wide off-axis viewing\n- High 165Hz refresh rate with a PC\n- Expensive, even compared to other top OLEDs\n- Minor banding in isolated sequences\n- Pedestal stand is not included\n- Some issues with voice search that resolved over time\nI've tested many impressive displays, but none can match the LG G5's overall image performance. This premium set is the best OLED TV for people willing to splurge on high-end picture quality.\nThe G5 replaces my previous pick in this category, the Sony A95L. While the A95L is still an incredible TV, the G5 surpasses it in a few key areas, most notably brightness. Though the G5 doesn't use quantum dots like those found on flagship OLEDs made by Sony and Samsung, it uses a new four-stack panel design to achieve similar performance gains over a typical OLED.\nWith the TV set in its most accurate HDR picture mode, I measured a peak of 2,410 nits. That's a record for an OLED and almost 1,000 nits more than the highest measurement I got on the A95L. In practice, this high luminance leads to stunning HDR performance. Highlights in bright HDR content pop from the screen with dazzling intensity, offering more visual impact than less expensive OLEDs, like the S90D, are capable of.\nNow, it's important to remember that only certain HDR movies and TV shows require the kind of high brightness levels that the G5 delivers. But if you're a home theater enthusiast who wants to watch bright HDR content the way it's meant to be seen, the G5's combination of pixel-level contrast and high luminance is nearly unmatched. Likewise, if you struggle with glare in your room, the G5's high brightness can help overcome this.\nHowever, that's not to say the G5 is flawless. Even with brightness maxed out, its glossy screen is still prone to some reflections, though it preserves black levels better than matte-screen options like Samsung's S95D. The G5's webOS smart TV platform is decent enough, but it places too much emphasis on shopping recommendations. I also encountered some intermittent errors with hands-free voice recognition. This wasn't troublesome enough to be a major problem, but it's still worth noting.\nThe TV initially had issues with image banding, which caused color gradations to look blocky instead of smooth in some HDR material. Thankfully, a firmware update has fixed the vast majority of these artifacts. Some banding still pops up from time to time, like in a tricky test scene I use from \"Ex Machina\" that features harsh red light, but these lingering imperfections are subtle and in line with what I'd expect from a TV like this. No display is perfect, but the G5's strengths outweigh its shortcomings.\nThe G5 comes with a flush wall mount that lets you hang the display up with virtually no gap. The TV looks gorgeous set up this way, but keep in mind that it doesn't include a stand. So, if you can't wall mount it in your room, you'll need to buy a stand separately.\nThough it's my current pick in this category, the G5 has some competition. Sony has a new high-end OLED called the Bravia 8 II that could match the G5 in some areas. However, it's more expensive and is only available in 55- and 65-inch sizes, while the G5 goes up to 97 inches. In addition, Panasonic just launched a similar four-stack OLED, but it's also limited to fewer sizes, with 77 inches being the largest. I'll be testing the Sony and Panasonic soon for consideration in this guide.\nRead our LG G5 4K TV review.\nCheck out our guide to the best LG TVs.\nBest on a budget\nThe B4 is LG's entry-level OLED TV. Though it can't get as bright as pricier models, it still offers an infinite contrast which makes it a great budget OLED for watching movies in a dark room.\n- One of the most affordable OLED models\n- Pixel-level contrast with deep black levels\n- Dolby Vision support\n- LG's pricier OLED models have superior image processing\n- Dimmer than competing mid- and high-end OLEDs\n- Lacks 144Hz mode for PC gaming\nOLED TVs aren't known for being budget-friendly, but the LG B4 is one of the most affordable OLEDs available. LG's pricier C- and G-Series TVs can both get brighter and offer better image processing, but the B4 still has all of the contrast, black level, and viewing angle perks that OLEDs are celebrated for.\nAt a max of about 650 to 700 nits, the B4 is notably dimmer than step-up OLED models. As a result, extreme highlights (like explosions) won't pop with the same intensity that you'd see on pricier sets, and the B4 is less suited for living rooms that let in a lot of light. However, the TV is still capable of pixel-level contrast and perfect black levels, which gives it an advantage in overall image quality over even the priciest QLED TVs.\nDespite being LG's entry-level OLED, the B4 is also well-equipped for gaming. It has HDMI 2.1 support and a 120Hz panel, which means it can support advanced gaming features like variable refresh rate (VRR) and 120 frames-per-second output on a PS5 and Xbox Series X. That said, it can't support the higher 144Hz or 165Hz modes that the brand's C- and G-Series models provide.\nSamsung also sells a competing entry-level OLED, the S85D, which is sometimes discounted for less money. Since the S85D doesn't use quantum dots, its picture quality is nearly identical to the B4's. However, I give a slight edge to the B4 since it supports Dolby Vision, which has a bigger impact on HDR quality on dimmer OLED models like this.\nCheck out our guide to all the best budget TVs.\nBest anti-glare screen\nSamsung's S95D is the brightest OLED we\u2019ve ever tested. It features a new matte screen that nearly eliminates reflections, making it ideal for rooms that struggle with glare. However, the matte design gives black levels a slightly faded look in direct light.\n- The brightest OLED we've tested\n- Matte screen significantly reduces glare and reflections\n- 144Hz refresh rate for smooth PC gaming\n- Slim design with One Connect Box\n- Doesn't support Dolby Vision\n- Glare-free coating elevates black levels in bright rooms\n- Pricey compared to 2023 counterpart\nMany OLED TVs claim to have anti-reflective screen filters, but the Samsung S95D's glare-free coating is in a class of its own. The S95D uses a matte finish instead of a glossy one. This feature enables it to greatly reduce glare and reflections, which can be problematic in rooms with many windows and indoor lights.\nOther OLEDs are prone to a mirror-like effect when hit with light from certain angles, but the S95D nearly eliminates this issue. During my testing in a bright room, I saw no troublesome reflections, making this set a game changer for buyers who want an OLED free from glare. It's an especially great option for people who like to watch sports during the day.\nHowever, the S95D's anti-glare screen has a drawback: it hurts black-level performance in a bright room. So, while you no longer have to deal with distracting reflections, the S95D's black levels take on a more gray and hazy look instead of the deep and inky quality you'd see on other OLEDs. Thankfully, this isn't an issue when viewing the TV with the lights off, so the S95D still offers all the black-level benefits OLEDs are known for in a dark setting.\nIn addition to its anti-glare screen, the S95D offers great brightness, with a peak of around 1,700 nits. This helps the display deliver exceptional HDR performance. That said, it can't match the peak luminance of LG's pricier G5 TV.\nThe S95D has all the other bells and whistles I expect from a flagship Samsung TV, including support for a 144Hz refresh rate for smooth PC gaming. Unlike the cheaper S90D, it has a uniformly thin design and a One Connect Box to house all its video ports.\nUltimately, the S95D's matte screen is a divisive feature with clear pros and cons. For most buyers, I recommend sticking with a traditional glossy TV since you get better black levels. But if you need an OLED uniquely suited for combating glare and reflections, this is the model to get.\nSamsung also sells a newer version of this TV, the S95F, which can get even brighter and delivers a slightly higher 165Hz refresh rate. But the S95F costs a lot more, so I only recommend it to big enthusiasts who crave the most impactful HDR image.\nRead our Samsung S95D 4K TV review and Samsung S95F review.\nVisit our guide to the top sports TVs.\nBest OLED TVs compared\nHere's a rundown of key specs and test results for each of our best OLED TV picks to provide a quick look at how they compare.\n| Samsung S90D | LG G5 | LG B4 | Samsung S95D | |\n| Typical price (65 inch) | $1,500 | $3,300 | $1,200 | $2,400 |\n| Panel type | QD-OLED | Four-stack OLED | OLED | QD-OLED |\n| Screen coating | Glossy | Glossy | Glossy | Matte |\n| HDR support | HDR10, HDR10+, HLG | HDR10, Dolby Vision, HLG | HDR10, Dolby Vision, HLG | HDR10, HDR10+, HLG |\n| Peak brightness | 1,200 nits | 2,400 nits | 700 nits | 1,700 nits |\n| Smart TV OS | Tizen | webOS | webOS | Tizen |\n| HDMI | Four HDMI 2.1 | Four HDMI 2.1 | Four HDMI 2.1 | Four HDMI 2.1 |\nOther OLED TVs we considered\nThe picks above represent our top recommendations, but there are other OLED TVs out there that are still worth considering. Here are a few notable models, along with details on why they didn't quite make the cut in our guide.\nLG C4 OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nThe C4 is LG's mid-tier 2024 OLED, and it's still a fantastic TV. In many ways, it can be thought of as a runner-up to the Samsung S90D. Both TVs offer very similar performance and are often sold for around the same price, but we ultimately give the edge to Samsung's model. Unlike the C4, the 55-, 65-, and 77-inch S90D TVs use quantum dots, which give those sizes higher brightness and better color performance. LG also has a newer 2025 version of the C4, called the C5, and while it can produce a slightly brighter image, it's more expensive and still falls short of the S90D in color capabilities.\nRead our LG C4 review and LG C5 review.\nSony A95L OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nThe A95L was our previous pick for the best high-end OLED. It's still an excellent premium TV, but the newer LG G5 has some key performance benefits that make it a better display overall. Sony also sells a brand-new successor to this model, the Bravia 8 II, that could go toe-to-toe with the G5. However, it's more expensive and is only available in 55- and 65-inch sizes, while the G5 ranges from 55 to 97 inches. We'll test the Bravia 8 II soon to see how it stacks up.\nSony Bravia 8 OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nThe Bravia 8 is Sony's midrange OLED, sitting right below the Bravia 8 II and A95L in its lineup. Its specs put it in a similar performance class as LG's more affordable C-series and below Samsung's S90 series. Given current price differences, we give the edge to the LG C4 and Samsung S90D as better options for the money.\nRead our breakdown of Sony Bravia TVs.\nPanasonic Z95 OLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nPanasonic recently re-entered the US TV market, and its flagship offering is the Z95 Series OLED. The brand's 2024 model, the Z95A, is a great display, but its picture quality is beaten by the LG G5. A 2025 model, called the Z95B, was just released, and it could match or surpass the G5. We'll test the new model soon.\nHow we test OLED TVs\nTo test the best OLED TVs, our reviewers evaluate several factors, including peak brightness, HDR performance, smart TV features, navigation speed, and value.\nTo measure the brightness of a TV's panel, we use an X-Rite iDisplay Plus colorimeter with test patterns on the Spears & Munsil UHD HDR Benchmark 4K Blu-ray disc. We also use this disc's patterns to evaluate other objective display qualities. However, test patterns can only reveal so much, so we also use real-world content to get a better sense of how an OLED actually looks when watching regular TV.\nWe use the same assortment of demo movies and shows on each display to help test each OLED's overall image performance, with a specific focus on scenes that showcase shadow detail, specular highlights, color fidelity, and sharpness with native 4K, high-definition (HD), and standard definition (SD) content through Blu-ray players, cable TV, and all the best streaming services. We also evaluate OLED TVs in various lighting conditions to see how each model performs in bright and dark rooms.\nWe try to live with each OLED TV we review as we would if we owned it as our personal display. This way, we can see if any quirks or glitches pop up during general day-to-day use. We also evaluate smart TV features and navigation to ensure there are no major issues.\nFor more details on our review process, check out our page detailing how we test tech products.\nWhat to look for in an OLED TV\nThe best OLED TVs all share similar performance capabilities, but there are a few factors to consider when selecting a specific model. In particular, you'll want to decide what type of OLED panel is right for your needs, how big you want your screen to be, and how much money you want to spend. Here's some key info to help inform your purchase.\nWhat is an OLED TV?\nOLED stands for \"organic light-emitting diode.\" Instead of using a traditional LCD panel with a backlight, like those found on QLED and LED TVs, OLED TVs are self-illuminating. This means that each pixel on an OLED can emit its own light or turn off completely, enabling an infinite contrast ratio. Because of this high contrast performance, OLED displays are among the best 4K TVs you can buy.\nLG, Samsung, Sony, and Panasonic all sell OLED TV models in the US. Though there are a few different types of OLED panels, they all share the same key benefits of pixel-level contrast and wide viewing angles. Some OLED subtypes, however, have extra perks that make them even more desirable.\nQD-OLED panels, for instance, have the added benefit of quantum dot technology, which enables them to produce an even wider and brighter range of colors. Sony and Samsung use QD-OLED panels in their top TVs, like the S90D/F, S95D/F, A95L, and Bravia 8 II.\nThough LG and Panasonic don't use QD-OLED, their most expensive OLED TVs use other advanced technologies to achieve a similar boost in performance. The LG G5 and the Panasonic Z95B both use a four-stack OLED panel design, which can optimize brightness and color to compete with QD-OLED.\nYou can learn more about how OLEDs stack up against QLEDs in our full QLED vs. OLED comparison.\nWhat size OLED TVs can you buy?\nOLED TVs are sold in various screen sizes ranging from 42 to 97 inches. The most commonly available options are 55, 65, and 77 inches. Both QD-OLED and standard OLED panels are manufactured at those sizes.\nA few OLED models are also available in larger 83- and even 97-inch options. However, OLED panels with quantum dots are not currently manufactured at those sizes.\nLG, Sony, and Samsung also sell 48- and 42-inch OLED TVs, but only for a limited assortment of their models, and, once again, these options do not use QD-OLED panels.\nSome 4K OLED displays smaller than 42 inches are also available, but these sizes are limited to PC monitors, like the 32-inch Alienware AW3225QF.\nFor OLED TV recommendations specific to certain screen sizes, check out our size-specific guides:\nHow much should you spend on an OLED TV?\nThe best OLED TVs don't come cheap. In general, OLED TVs cost more than other display types, with 65-inch models starting at around $1,100 and maxing out at about $4,000.\nEntry-level 65-inch OLEDs under $1,200 aren't as bright as their more expensive counterparts, with most options in this price range peaking at around 700 nits. Models in the $1,300 to $2,000 range, like the Samsung S90D, can hit around 1,200 nits. Meanwhile, flagship OLEDs in the $3,000+ range, like the LG G5, can get as bright as 2,400 nits.\nUnfortunately, it's rare to find OLEDs for under $1,000. However, some OLEDs in smaller sizes, like the 48-inch LG B4, do occasionally go on sale for around $600. In general, we recommend that budget buyers consider a QLED or LED model instead of an OLED. Check out our guide to the best TVs under $500 for our top picks in that price range.\nOLED TV FAQs\nShould OLED TV buyers worry about burn-in?\nEven the best OLED TVs are technically susceptible to an issue known as burn-in. If you leave a static image on an OLED TV for an extended period \u2014 a news station's chyron bar, for example \u2014 a faint after-image can get stuck on the screen.\nThough it sounds alarming, burn-in is not a new phenomenon. Many past TV technologies, including plasma and CRT displays, were also prone to this issue. While OLED buyers should be mindful of this risk, OLED TVs have built-in measures to combat burn-in, including automatic pixel-shift modes and pixel-refreshers.\nPublications like Rtings have done long-term tests with many OLED TV models. While the results do show that burn-in is possible in extreme use cases, the tests show that it shouldn't be a problem for people with regular viewing habits.\nI've had an LG CX OLED TV in my own home theater setup for over three years, and the screen shows no burn-in. In my experience, as long as you don't plan on watching the same cable news channel all day, burn-in shouldn't be a deciding factor when choosing whether to get an OLED TV.\nShould you buy a 2025 or 2024 OLED TV model?\nLG, Samsung, Sony, and Panasonic are now selling new 2025 OLED TV models. However, it's important to remember that 2024 OLED models will remain available to buy throughout much of the year, and they're a lot cheaper than their 2025 counterparts. In many (but not all) cases, the performance differences between a 2024 and and 2025 OLED model are subtle.\nWith that in mind, we continue to recommend certain 2024 OLED TVs in this guide, and will continue to do so as long as they remain available and provide the best value.\nFor more details on new OLED TV models, check out our 2025 TV roundups:\nDo OLED TVs have good sound quality?\nThe best OLED TVs all include built-in speakers, but they typically offer mediocre sound quality and lack bass response. If you're unhappy with your TV's audio performance, we recommend buying a separate soundbar, particularly one with Dolby Atmos support. Dolby Atmos is a spatial audio format that can spread sound effects around your room with simulated overhead audio, so soundbars with this feature tend to offer the most immersive performance.\nCheck out our various soundbar and speaker guides to see our top recommendations:\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "Though there are plenty of affordable TVs on the market, you shouldn't buy just any random model because it's cheap. Certain entry-level sets are missing key features, and in many cases, you can find better options without spending more. But sorting out the best budget TVs from the duds can be tricky. That's why I've used my extensive experience as a tech product reviewer to highlight the top cheap TVs that are actually worth the money.\nThe TCL QM6K earns my highest recommendation. This budget-friendly QLED TV has a Mini LED backlight, which helps it produce better picture quality than most displays in its class. But if you want an OLED display on a budget, I recommend the LG B4. Though pricier than QLED models, the B4 has higher contrast and wider viewing angles.\nBelow, you can find all of my picks for the best TVs on a budget, including an entry-level LED and an easy-to-use set with my favorite smart TV interface. My recommendations are based on a combination of hands-on testing and research, with an aim to highlight the best cheap TVs with benefits that many competing models lack.\nOur top picks for the best budget TVs\nBest overall: TCL QM6K - See at Amazon\nBest OLED: LG B4 - See at Amazon\nBest entry-level model: TCL S5 - See at Amazon\nBest smart TV interface: Roku Plus Series - See at Walmart\nBest overall\nThe QM6K is an excellent entry-level Mini LED TV with solid contrast, vibrant colors, and decent black levels. However, its HDR brightness capabilities are limited compared to step-up models.\n- Solid HDR performance for an entry-level Mini LED TV\n- Local dimming enhances contrast with minimal blooming\n- Google TV navigation is quick and responsive\n- Brightness is limited compared to midrange and high-end QLEDs\n- Viewing angles are improved over older models but are still narrow\nThe TCL QM6K is the best budget TV I've tested. Though this model was a bit pricier when it initially launched, recent price drops have made it a fantastic value. Even extra-large 85- and 98-inch QM6K models are often discounted to surprisingly low prices for their size.\nMost budget-friendly TVs suffer from poor contrast, which causes dark scenes to look washed out and flat, especially when you watch TV in a dark room. The QM6K, however, uses a Mini LED backlight with local dimming to greatly enhance its contrast. It also delivers a wide range of colors thanks to its use of quantum dots. These features are rare to find on TVs this cheap.\nIn my tests, the TV produced excellent backlight control. Though black levels aren't as deep as they are on pricier models, they're still a lot inkier and much more uniform than they are on most cheap TVs. The QM6K is also good at minimizing blooming, which is a common flaw on Mini LED sets that results in halos around bright objects.\nThat said, bright HDR videos don't pop as intensely as they do on midrange and high-end TVs. I measured a peak brightness of 557 nits on a 10% HDR test pattern and 736 nits on a 50% test pattern. Those numbers are nothing to scoff at, but they're under the 1,000-nit range that I recommend as the minimum for the best HDR experience.\nViewing angles are also limited, so image quality does degrade if you sit to the side of the screen. That said, this area has been improved compared to last year's model, the Q65, so the drop in color and contrast accuracy isn't as large as I typically see on entry-level models. Meanwhile, gaming capabilities have received a big upgrade, thanks to a notable bump in refresh rate. The QM6K can support up to a 144Hz signal when paired with a PC, or 120Hz when paired with a compatible gaming console. This results in smoother motion in games that support high refresh rate modes.\nGeneral smart TV navigation and usability are also solid via the QM6K's built-in Google TV interface. Though I've run into intermittent glitches on older TCL TVs I've reviewed, the QM6K was free from any notable bugs, offering a painless experience for streaming apps and adjusting settings.\nThe QM6K is now available in sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches. A 50-inch model was also announced earlier this year but has yet to hit the market. For now, my pick for the best 50-inch TV on a budget remains the Amazon Omni QLED. That TV is similar to the QM6K, but its contrast performance isn't quite as good.\nRead our TCL QM6K 4K TV review.\nBest OLED\nThe B4 is LG's entry-level OLED TV. Though it can't get as bright as pricier models, it still offers an infinite contrast which makes it a great budget OLED for watching movies in a dark room.\n- One of the most affordable OLED models\n- Pixel-level contrast with deep black levels\n- Dolby Vision support\n- LG's pricier OLED models have superior image processing\n- Dimmer than competing mid- and high-end OLEDs\n- Lacks 144Hz mode for PC gaming\nThe best OLED TVs are celebrated for delivering the most impressive picture quality on the market, but they're not exactly known for their affordability. In fact, the term \"budget\" is a bit of a stretch for any OLED model. However, LG's B4 is one of the most budget-friendly options out there.\nThe B4 delivers all of the contrast benefits that OLED TVs are known for. Thanks to its emissive panel, the display has pixel-level contrast control, which beats even the best Mini LED backlights on high-end QLED TVs. This leads to deep black levels that disappear into a dark room without any halos around bright objects. Check out our QLED vs. OLED comparison for more details on how each panel type stacks up.\nViewing angles are also far superior to any QLED, so picture quality remains good even if you sit to the side of the screen. The TV also supports a 120Hz refresh rate, so it's capable of smoother motion when playing high-frame-rate games on a compatible console or PC. That said, the B4 stops short of 144Hz or 165Hz support, which you can get with some of LG's step-up OLED TVs.\nCompared to more expensive OLEDs, the B4 also lags behind in brightness and color volume. The TV can hit a peak of around 650 to 700 nits, which is still respectable. However, as a point of reference, many midrange OLED models can hit 1,000 to 1,400 nits, while high-end models can get as bright as 2,400 nits. Flagship OLEDs from Samsung and Sony also incorporate quantum dots, which the B4 lacks. Ultimately, this means that some HDR videos won't look as impactful or vivid on the B4 as they would on a more expensive OLED.\nThat said, the B4's image performance is still a clear step above the TCL QM6K and every other budget TV I recommend in this guide. LG sells the B4 in 48-, 55-, 65-, 77-, and 83-inch sizes.\nBuyers who want an alternative OLED on a budget should also consider Samsung's S85D TV. The S85D and B4 offer very similar image quality, but I give the B4 a slight edge thanks to its Dolby Vision capabilities. Dolby Vision isn't a must-have feature for higher-end TVs, but it can improve HDR performance on dimmer OLED models.\nCheck out our guide to the best LG TVs.\nBest entry-level model\nThe S5 is one of TCL's upper entry-level TVs, so its contrast and brightness capabilities are limited. But it's still able to produce a wide range of colors and it has Amazon's Fire TV interface with Alexa built-in.\n- Supports wide color gamut\n- Includes Alexa voice remote\n- Not bright enough to really showcase HDR content\n- Lacks local dimming so contrast is limited\nTCL's S5 doesn't wow with advanced picture features, but it's one of the best cheap TVs for basic viewing needs. It's also ideal for people who want an affordable secondary display for a bedroom.\nThe S5 is a newer version of my previous pick in this category, the S4. The S4 is now hard to find in stock, and this revised model offers some improvements. Most notably, the S5 can provide a wider range of colors. However, unlike the more expensive QLED models I recommend, the S5 still uses a standard LED panel without local dimming.\nThis means it can't get as bright as my other picks, and its black levels look more elevated and washed out when watching dark scenes with the lights off. And though it can technically support every major HDR format, it can't control its contrast precisely enough to really showcase the benefits of high-dynamic-range content.\nWhile those limitations are notable, the S5 is still solid for casual viewing needs, especially if you're someone who mostly watches cable TV and SDR (standard dynamic range) streaming content. Home theater enthusiasts and gamers should look elsewhere, but the S5 is a good fit for those who just want a reliable, cheap TV that gets the job done.\nBuyers also have their pick of smart TV interfaces, with S5 options available in Fire TV or Google TV models. The S5 is also a particularly good choice for shoppers who want a smaller display since it comes in 50- and 43-inch sizes.\nBest smart TV system\nRoku's Plus Series is the company's budget-friendly QLED TV. The display boasts local dimming and quantum dots to deliver solid contrast, color, and brightness performance for the money. It also uses our favorite smart TV interface and includes a handy rechargeable remote.\n- Solid HDR performance on a budget\n- Intuitive Roku smarts\n- Great remote and app\n- Poor off-axis viewing\n- Local dimming not as effective as that of Mini LED models\n- No VRR or 120Hz support\nThough the TCL QM6K has an edge in overall image quality, the Roku Plus Series is a good budget QLED for buyers who prioritize smart TV conveniences. This display uses the Roku OS, my favorite operating system, thanks to its ease of use.\nRoku's streamlined interface runs smoothly and features a simple home screen with large tiles for all your favorite TV apps. I prefer this style over the more cluttered, content-focused approach of rival systems like the Fire TV OS. But if you want to see personalized content recommendations, you can simply navigate to the \"What to watch\" section on the sidebar menu.\nThe TV's remote has a few cool features you won't find on many displays in this price range. Most notably, there's a hands-free voice search function and a built-in battery that recharges using USB. You can also use the Roku app to activate an audio chime on the remote to easily find it if it ever gets lost.\nWhen it comes to image quality, the Roku Plus Series is a solid-looking display. Like the TCL QM6K, it uses a QLED panel and has local dimming. But unlike that model, the Roku Plus Series uses regular LEDs instead of Mini LEDs, which means it has fewer dimming zones and less precise contrast control. Still, the Roku Plus Series delivers solid HDR performance, and it should please most viewers.\nHowever, viewing angles are subpar, and the panel's refresh rate is limited to 60Hz. But for buyers who want an affordable and reliable smart TV, the Plus Series delivers a smooth streaming experience that's a bit more user-friendly than the competition.\nRoku also sells a second-generation version of the Plus Series. The new model has an upgraded Mini LED backlight system, but it's still limited to a 60Hz screen. Since the first-gen model is still available for less money, it remains the better budget TV.\nRead our Roku Plus Series TV review.\nCheck out our guide to the best Roku TVs.\nHow we test budget TVs\nTo select the best budget TVs, our team relies on a combination of hands-on testing and research informed by more than a decade of experience covering home entertainment products.\nTo review TVs, we evaluate key performance parameters, including picture clarity, contrast, black levels, HDR brightness, color range, viewing angles, and smart TV navigation. Brightness is measured using an X-Rite iDisplay Plus colorimeter with test patterns from the Spears & Muncil Benchmark 4K Blu-ray disc.\nBut test patterns only reveal so much, so we also sample an assortment of scenes from specific movies and TV shows on every TV we test. Sequences have been selected to showcase HDR highlights, shadow detail, upscaling, and other picture-quality attributes. We watch displays in both dark and bright environments to evaluate nighttime and daytime viewing conditions. Our demo material comes from various sources and includes 4K, HD, and SD content from Blu-ray discs, streaming services, and cable TV.\nTo learn more about our review process, visit our breakdown of how we test tech products.\nBudget TV FAQs\nHow much should you spend on a budget TV?\nThe best budget TVs vary in price depending on the size and panel type you choose. Standard LED TVs are the cheapest, followed by QLED TVs, and then OLED TVs on the higher end.\nIn general, a 65-inch 4K LED TV on a budget will cost around $300 to $400. Meanwhile, budget-friendly 65-inch QLED TVs with better color and contrast capabilities can be found for around $500 to $900. Finally, OLED TVs are a lot pricier, with the cheapest 65-inch models starting at around $1,200.\nIf you're on a strict budget and don't want to spend more than $500, check out our guide to the best TVs under $500.\nWhat are the most reliable cheap TV brands?\nHisense, TCL, and Vizio are known for being the best budget TV brands. These companies sell many affordable entry- and midlevel TVs that often deliver better image quality than similarly priced displays from LG, Samsung, Sony, and Panasonic. Likewise, Roku and Amazon have recently entered the value TV market, and their latest budget TVs are solid options, particularly when they're on sale.\nHowever, budget TVs from value-oriented brands tend to offer cheaper builds, more glitches, and worse quality control than pricier TVs. That said, none of the inconveniences we've run into on TCL, Hisense, or Vizio TVs have been big enough to prevent a recommendation.\nWhat are the downsides to buying a budget TV?\nThe best cheap TVs offer impressive performance for the money, but displays in this class must make some compromises to keep costs down. Most notably, brightness, color range, contrast, and build quality are often limited compared to pricier sets.\nWhen buying an LED TV on a budget, you'll often miss out on picture-quality features like local dimming and wide color support. This translates to a dimmer image with lighter black levels and less vivid HDR performance than you'd get on a pricier display. If you step up to a budget QLED, you can find some models with those aforementioned features, but brightness and contrast control will still be less advanced than you'd see on a high-end model. Likewise, designs tend to be flimsier, and operating system speeds are often slower.\nHowever, entry-level OLED TVs make far fewer concessions in performance and build quality compared to midrange and high-end options. This is because even the cheapest OLED displays are still expensive compared to budget QLED and LED models. That said, budget OLEDs can't get quite as bright as premium ones, and their picture processing is less advanced.\nDo budget TVs have good sound quality?\nEven the best budget TVs are often equipped with mediocre built-in speakers. Though these integrated sound systems can get the job done for casual viewing, we recommend upgrading to a soundbar to get a better experience. Reliable budget soundbars can be found for as little as $100, and these entry-level offerings will still offer a decent improvement in audio quality compared to most TV speakers. Models with advanced surround sound and Dolby Atmos capabilities cost more but provide a bigger jump in immersion.\nCheck out our soundbar and speaker buying guides to see our top recommendations:\n- Best soundbars\n- Best budget soundbars\n- Best Dolby Atmos soundbars\n- Best soundbars with subwoofers\n- Best Bose soundbars\n- Best Sonos soundbars\n- Best surround sound systems\nCan you get a cheap TV with 120Hz gaming support?\nThough not common, there are a few budget-friendly TVs that include HDMI 2.1 support with a 120Hz refresh rate. In this guide, both the LG B4 and the TCL QM6K have those features. This enables those models to support advanced gaming capabilities when paired with a PS5, Xbox Series X, Switch 2, or PC.\nHDMI 2.1 ports let a display receive a 4K/120Hz signal, along with ALL (auto low latency mode) and VRR (variable refresh rate). When used with a compatible gaming system, these features provide smoother motion with minimized screen tearing and lag.\nTo receive an HDMI 2.1 signal, every device in your home entertainment chain needs to support HDMI 2.1. Likewise, you need to connect all of your components with an ultra-high-speed HDMI cable capable of 48Gbps transmission. Visit our guide to the best HDMI cables for top picks.\nWhen are TVs the cheapest to buy?\nThe best cheap TVs often drop to their lowest prices during big deals events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day. Likewise, we see great TV discounts on holidays like Memorial Day, Fourth of July, and Presidents Day, as well as around big sporting events like the Super Bowl and March Madness.\nFor more TV recommendations across budgets and sizes, check out our other display guides:\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "I've been reviewing TVs for a long time, and it's exciting to see more extra-large 85- and 83-inch options on the market. The best 85-inch TVs offer a viewing experience that smaller screens simply can't match. But TVs this size tend to be pricey, so you'll want to make sure you're getting the best value for your money.\nTo help you find the perfect display for your needs, I've selected the best 85-inch TVs available right now. The TCL QM7K is my top pick for most people. This midrange QLED balances price and performance better than most competing 85-inch models. It offers a colorful image and solid contrast. But if you're willing to pay more, I recommend stepping up to the Samsung S90D. This model is pricey, but it benefits from using an OLED panel, which delivers deeper black levels and wider viewing angles.\nNote: LCD-based TVs (LED, QLED) are manufactured in 85- or 86-inch screen sizes, but OLED displays are made in a slightly smaller 83-inch size. For that reason, I've included 83-inch OLED TVs in this guide.\nOur top picks for the best 85-inch TVs\nBest overall: TCL QM7K 4K QLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest midrange OLED: Samsung S90D 4K OLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest on a budget: TCL QM6K QLED 4K TV - See at Amazon\nBest premium model: LG G5 4K OLED TV - See at Amazon\nBest overall\nTCL's QM7K is an impressive midrange QLED TV and one of the top 85-inch values on the market. It has excellent contrast control and solid viewing angles for a Mini LED set. It also delivers high brightness for HDR content and rooms with ambient light.\n- Impressive brightness for a midrange model\n- Advanced contrast control minimizes blooming\n- Viewing angles are wider than last year's model\n- Gamers get support for up to a 4K/144Hz signal\n- Black levels aren't quite as deep as they are on pricier TVs\n- The depth of the display's pedestal stand could get in the way of some soundbars\n- While solid for a QLED, the TV's viewing angles can't match an OLED's\nWhen it comes to overall value, the TCL QM7K QLED is the best 85-inch TV for most people. It's often on sale for around $1,800, which is a great price for such a big display in this class. The QM7K replaces my previous pick in this category, last year's QM7. The QM7 is still a fantastic TV, but it's hard to find in stock, and the new QM7K offers some improvements in backlight control and viewing angles.\nThanks to its QLED panel and Mini LED dimming, the QM7K delivers a bright image while maintaining good contrast and solid black levels. I measured a peak of around 1,800 nits, which is enough to enjoy the full impact of most high-dynamic-range (HDR) content.\nBold highlights (like explosions) pop from the screen, and the TV's contrast control in dark scenes is excellent. Though I noticed some light bleed and backlight patchiness on last year's QM7 model, the QM7K is able to nearly eliminate these flaws. That said, the TV's black levels never quite disappear into a dark room like they do on OLED TVs or some pricier QLEDs I've reviewed.\nThe QM7K's viewing angles are quite decent for a QLED. Colors and contrast fade and distort a bit from an angle, but the effect isn't as bad as it was on the 2024 QM7. I also love the QM7K's Google TV interface, which is smooth and easy to navigate. After weeks of testing, I didn't encounter any notable software glitches.\nGamers also get a full suite of features, including a handy pop-up menu that displays details about the video signal and game settings. The QM7K supports up to a 144Hz refresh rate when paired with a PC, or up to 120Hz with a PS5 and Xbox Series X.\nThere are better-looking 85-inch TVs on the market, but the price jump to reach the next performance tier is substantial. For the money, few 85-inch TVs can match the QM7K's overall quality.\nCheck out our guides to all the best smart TVs and the best TVs for sports.\nBest midrange OLED\nThe 83-inch S90D is a great midrange OLED that offers pixel-level contrast and wide viewing angles. However, unlike smaller versions of this model, the 83-inch size does not use quantum dots, so it's not quite as bright or colorful.\n- Infinite contrast ratio with perfect black levels\n- Wide viewing angles\n- Xbox Game Pass supporrt\n- Lower peak brightness than its smaller counterparts\n- Color volume is more limited than it is on TVs with quantum dots\n- More expensive than competing QLED TV models this size\nSamsung's 83-inch S90D OLED isn't cheap, but its picture quality is a clear step above less expensive QLED TVs.\nThe S90D's OLED panel enables pixel-level contrast control with better black levels and wider viewing angles than any QLED. This leads to a notable jump in overall image performance, especially if you like to watch TV in a dim home theater.\nI still recommend my top pick, the TCL QM7K QLED, as a better overall value at this size, but if you're willing to spend more, this midrange OLED has big benefits. In a dark room, the S90D's infinite contrast ratio beats the QM7K, offering one of the best movie-watching experiences you can get from an 83-inch TV.\nThough not as bright as some of my other picks, the S90D still gets bright enough for a typical room. However, unlike smaller versions of the S90D, the 83-inch model does not use quantum dots. This means bright colors won't look quite as vivid as they do on the 77-, 65-, and 55-inch sizes.\nOn the plus side, the 83-inch S90D does support a 144Hz refresh rate for smooth gaming. The S90D also has the bonus of supporting the Xbox Game Pass app directly through its smart TV interface. With this app, Game Pass members can stream Xbox games without a console.\nFor HDR playback, the S90D is compatible with the HDR10 and HDR10+ formats but not Dolby Vision. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ offer similar performance, but Dolby Vision is more widespread on streaming services. Check out my HDR TV guide for more details on each format. Ultimately, in this performance class, I think Dolby Vision is a cool perk but not a must-have feature.\nVisit our guides to all the best TVs and the best Samsung TVs.\nBest on a budget\nThe QM6K is TCL's entry-level Mini LED TV model for 2025. It offers some of the best image quality you can get on a set this cheap. This 85-inch model also features a matte screen to reduce reflections.\n- Great entry-level HDR quality\n- Good local dimming performance with minimal backlight issues\n- Google TV interface is smooth and reliable\n- Matte screen helps to minimize glare\n- Can't match brightness of pricier TV models\n- Though better than older models, viewing angles are still limited\n- Matte coating could reduce contrast in certain lighting\nThe best 85-inch TVs don't come cheap. Even entry-level models rarely dip below $700, and those sets make key sacrifices to cut costs. However, TCL's QM6K is a bit of an outlier. The 85-inch size is often on sale for just under $1,000, and it manages to keep advanced features that most budget-friendly sets omit.\nLike the pricier QM7K, the QM6K uses a QLED panel with a Mini LED backlight and up to a 144Hz refresh rate. This gives the TV a wider range of colors, higher contrast, a brighter picture, and smoother gaming performance than regular LED sets that lack those features. The TV's contrast control is great for a display in this class, and its black levels are solid.\nHowever, dark scenes aren't quite as inky as they are on OLED TVs or pricier QLED models, and this is the dimmest TV in this guide. I measured a peak of around 560 to 730 nits on various test patterns. Those are decent numbers for the money, but bright HDR content lacks the impact I've seen on TVs with higher luminance.\nLike most QLED displays, the QM6K's viewing angles are also limited, though they are a bit better than last year's Q65. If wide viewing angles are a priority over contrast and color gamut, I recommend going with an alternative budget model like the 86-inch LG UQ75. That model uses a different kind of LED panel that has better off-axis viewing, but much lower contrast.\nThe TV's Google TV interface is a breeze to use, and I didn't run into any major lag or glitches. The included Google Assistant voice remote even has backlit keys, which is a nice perk that Samsung and LG remotes are missing.\nThough performance between all QM6K sizes is comparable in most areas, the 85- and 98-inch models have one notable feature that smaller sizes lack. The 85-inch QM6K has a matte screen coating, which reduces reflections. This is great if you plan to use the TV in a room that struggles with sunlight. However, matte screens tend to reduce contrast under certain lighting conditions, so if you don't have glare in your room, you might prefer a traditional glossy-style TV.\nRead our TCL QM6K TV review.\nVisit our guide to all of the best budget TVs.\nBest high-end model\nThe G5 is the most impressive 83-inch TV available. This high-end display delivers the brightest image we've seen on an OLED, enabling gorgeous HDR images with stunning contrast.\n- The brightest OLED on the market\n- Infinite contrast ratio with perfect black levels\n- Wide viewing angles\n- Pricey compared to step-down OLED models\n- Some issues with webOS voice search\n- Stand sold separately\nLG's 83-inch G5 OLED is the ultimate high-end TV in this size. It's the most advanced OLED available at 83 inches, besting the overall picture quality of all my other picks. Of course, it also has the highest price tag of any TV you'll find in this guide.\nThe 2025 G5 replaces my previous pick in this category, last year's G4 OLED. This new model offers a big jump in brightness performance. In fact, the G5 is the brightest OLED TV on the market. While testing the 65-inch model using the TV's HDR Filmmaker Mode (its most accurate setting), I measured a peak of 2,410 nits. The 83-inch model should deliver the same performance. The 2024 G4 maxed out at 1,550 nits, so this model offers a substantial upgrade.\nThis exceptional brightness, combined with the OLED panel's infinite contrast ratio and perfect black levels, produces stunning HDR images without any of the blooming or backlight imperfections you'd get on a QLED TV. The G5 also has wide viewing angles, giving you a great image no matter where you sit.\nBut as impressive as the G5 is, it's not quite perfect. The TV initially had issues with posterization (blocky instead of smooth gradations of color and shadows) in some isolated HDR content, but LG released firmware updates to address this. With that in mind, I don't consider this a major problem. Through my weeks of testing, I only spotted minor flaws, and the G5's strengths far outweighed those shortcomings.\nLG's webOS smart TV interface rounds out the package with solid navigation speed, access to every major streaming app, and nice perks like hands-free voice control. However, the interface emphasizes shopping recommendations too prominently, and I find other systems, like Google TV, to be more stable and consistent.\nBuyers should also note that the G5 is designed with wall mounting in mind, so much so that it doesn't include a traditional TV stand. Instead, you get a bracket that lets you mount it flush to your wall with virtually no gap. It looks beautiful hung up this way, but you need to buy a stand separately if wall mounting isn't an option for your room.\nThis set is expensive, but if budget isn't a concern and you want the most impressive image quality at this size, the LG G5 is the best 83-inch TV available.\nRead our LG G5 4K TV review.\nCheck out our guide to the best LG TVs.\nHow we test 85-inch TVs\nTo choose the best 85-inch TVs, our team of experts relies on a combination of hands-on testing and research informed by more than a decade of experience covering the home entertainment product market.\nWhen reviewing TVs, we typically evaluate each model's 65-inch option since that's the industry's flagship size. However, a specific model's overall performance often remains comparable across sizes 55 inches and up. For example, an 83-inch LG G5 OLED and a 65-inch G5 OLED have the same specs. The only notable difference is the size of each panel.\nHowever, there are instances when certain TV models have more dramatic differences across their sizes. For instance, the Samsung S90D OLED uses quantum dots on its 55-, 65-, and 77-inch models but does not use quantum dots on its 83-inch model. This means the 83-inch model can't match the color performance of its smaller counterparts. We take these differences into account when recommending TVs and detail these instances when they pop up.\nTo evaluate displays, we look at key picture quality elements like color performance, clarity/sharpness, contrast control, HDR brightness, refresh rate, smart TV interface speed, off-angle viewing, and overall value. We use a colorimeter and test patterns on the Spears & Munsil HDR Benchmark 4K Blu-ray disc to check brightness and other objective image attributes.\nWe also use each TV we test for day-to-day viewing across multiple weeks, and rely on various movies and TV shows to look at real-world performance in bright and dark rooms. We've selected specific scenes to compare quality across TVs with black levels, shadow detail, HDR capabilities, and upscaling in mind. Sources include 4K, 1080p, and standard definition (SD) material from Blu-rays, streaming services, and cable TV.\nFor more info on our review process, check out our page detailing how we test tech products.\n85-inch TV FAQs\nIs 85 inches a good TV size?\nThe best 85-inch TVs can provide a level of immersion that smaller displays can't achieve. They're especially good for larger rooms since you can sit farther away and still get a cinematic experience. Though there are fewer 85-inch models to choose from compared to smaller screen sizes, several of our picks for the best 4K TVs are sold in 83 to 85 inches.\nHowever, many rooms simply can't accommodate a TV this big, and 85-inch sets are typically pricey. If you need a smaller display, check out our guides focused on other sizes:\nAnd if you want an even larger display, check out our guide to the best 100-inch TVs.\nHow much should you spend on an 85-inch TV?\nGenerally, you should expect to pay at least $900 to snag one of the best 85-inch TVs, though high-end models can cost $5,000 or more.\nWe've seen entry-level 85-inch LED TVs on sale for as low as $750, but budget QLED models typically start at around $900, and midrange options with local dimming and higher brightness capabilities sell for around $1,200 to $1,800. High-end 85-inch QLED 4K TVs with the best performance usually cost around $2,000 to $4,000, and 8K models can be between $4,000 and $7,000.\nIf you want one of the best OLED TVs in this class, 83-inch options start at around $3,000, while high-end OLEDs this big can cost as much as $6,500. Check out our full QLED vs. OLED guide for details on how the panel technologies compare.\nUnfortunately, 85-inch TVs below $500 are virtually nonexistent unless there happens to be a particularly great deal during a big sales event.\nIf you're shopping for a cheaper set and are willing to step down in size, check out our guide to the best TVs under $500 for our top recommendations.\nIs 4K resolution enough for an 85-inch TV?\nIn general, 4K resolution is plenty to deliver a sharp and detailed image on an 85-inch TV. That said, the higher pixel density of an 8K display can slightly improve picture clarity if you sit very close to your TV.\nImprovements in pixel smoothness on an 85-inch 8K set should become most visible if you sit less than five feet from your display. However, for typical viewers, this subtle benefit is not worth the extra money that an 8K TV costs.\nBut if you're dead set on buying an 85-inch 8K TV, Samsung's QN900D QLED is our top pick. The QN900D impressed us with its bright, high-contrast image. But we still think cheaper 83-inch 4K OLEDs, like the Samsung S90D, deliver better picture performance overall.\nDo 85-inch TVs offer good sound quality?\nThough there are exceptions, even the best 85-inch TVs tend to offer middling audio performance. Built-in TV speakers typically use small drivers placed in areas that muffle sound. They can get the job done for casual viewing, but we recommend that shoppers invest in a dedicated speaker system or soundbar to get the best audio performance. We especially like models that support Dolby Atmos since this format can provide an immersive surround sound experience.\nCheck out our various soundbar and speaker guides to see our top recommendations for different needs:\n- Best soundbars\n- Best soundbars with subwoofers\n- Best budget soundbars\n- Best Dolby Atmos soundbars\n- Best Bose soundbars\n- Best Sonos soundbars\n- Best surround sound systems\nDo you need an 85-inch TV with HDMI 2.1?\nMany midrange and high-end 85-inch TVs include at least one video port that supports the HDMI 2.1 specification. HDMI 2.1 enables a 4K/120Hz signal (some brands support up to 144Hz), along with support for auto low latency mode (ALLM) and variable refresh rate (VRR). These features are designed for gaming enthusiasts, allowing for smoother motion with less lag when paired with a compatible gaming console or PC.\nTo enable HDMI 2.1 features, all your home entertainment products need to support HDMI 2.1. So, if you have a console hooked up to a soundbar plugged into your display, all three components must be HDMI 2.1 compliant. Likewise, you need to connect them all with an ultra-high-speed HDMI cable rated for 48Gbps. Visit our guide to the best HDMI cables for our top recommendations.\nAll of our best 85-inch TV picks include HDMI 2.1 support.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "The Samsung S95F is the brand's flagship OLED TV for 2025, and it's a stunner. During a recent visit to Samsung's New Jersey facility, I spent a day with the S95F and a few of the company's other new TVs. The S95F left the strongest impression by far.\nI review all of the latest and greatest displays every year, and this model's image quality is nearly unrivaled. It also has a glare-free matte screen that does an excellent job of fighting pesky reflections. However, the matte coating has a negative effect on the panel's black levels. And though Samsung is touting several of the TV's new Vision AI features, none of these functions are as revelatory as the company's marketing materials would have you believe.\nBut while there are some drawbacks here and there, the S95F's many strengths outweigh its flaws. Based on my initial hands-on testing with the TV, the S95F is easily a contender for the best premium display of 2025.\nThe S95F is Samsung's latest flagship 4K TV. It's one of the top high-end displays of 2025 and uses an advanced QD-OLED panel with an anti-glare matte screen.\n- Nearly unmatched brightness and color volume for an OLED\n- Infinite contrast ratio and wide viewing angles\n- Glare-free screen greatly reduces reflections\n- High 165Hz refresh rate enables smooth gameplay\n- The matte screen elevates black levels in a bright room\n- Some new AI features have key limitations\n- Launch price is high compared to current deal prices on last year's model\nA thin profile and convenient connection box elevate the TV's design\nThe Samsung S95F is available in 55-, 65-, and 77-inch screen sizes. All three sizes use Samsung's latest-generation QD-OLED panel. The \"QD\" stands for quantum dots, a color technology that enables a wider and brighter range of colors than a traditional OLED screen.\nSamsung will also launch a larger 83-inch S95F in the coming months. This is notable since last year's S95D was unavailable in such a big size. However, it's not yet clear if the 83-inch S95F will match the color performance of its smaller counterparts. Historically, Samsung hasn't manufactured QD-OLED panels that large, so it's unlikely that the 83-inch S95F will use quantum dots.\nAt less than half an inch thick, the S95F's profile is notably thinner than most competing QLED displays, which require thicker panels to accommodate their backlighting systems. All sizes also feature the brand's \"One Connect Box.\" This separate component houses the TV's inputs rather than having them built into the panel. This approach gives users more flexibility with cable management, as you can either mount the box on the back of the TV or hide it out of view in a media console.\nThe S95F's bright, high-contrast picture is nearly flawless\nTo evaluate the S95F's picture performance, I put the TV through my typical testing process. This involves measuring brightness with a colorimeter and sampling various scenes I've curated from movies and TV shows that highlight different image quality attributes. For most of my testing, I used the TV's \"Filmmaker Mode\" since this preset offers the most accurate out-of-box picture, but I also sampled other modes to get a sense of how they look.\nInitially, something seemed off about the S95F's picture. The colors were oddly dull in certain sequences, and the display's contrast looked flatter than expected. Another reviewer who attended the same session noticed similar issues. Samsung gave the TV a factory reset, and voila, those problems disappeared, and the S95F looked appropriately stunning. I'm not sure what the issue was, but the TV I tested was technically a pre-production unit, so it's not unusual for there to be some lingering software kinks.\nThe important thing is that the S95F ultimately blew me away with its image quality. This is one of the brightest OLED TVs I've tested, and it's second only to LG's brand-new G5, which gets a bit brighter. On a 10% test pattern (a white box that takes up 10% of the screen), the TV put out an impressive 2,170 nits, which is nearly 500 nits more than I measured on last year's S95D. The S95F was also able to sustain that brightness for a longer period of time.\nSince the brightest elements of most movies and TV shows tend to be small highlights, a 10% test pattern is the most important for evaluating a display's high-dynamic-range (HDR) impact. A lot of HDR content is mastered for 1,000 nits, but titles produced for 2,000 and 4,000 nits are becoming more common. An OLED that can hit over 2,000 nits is a major accomplishment, as it can offer a more accurate representation of how HDR movies and TV shows are supposed to look.\nScenes from \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" and \"Aquaman\" on 4K Blu-ray were perfect showcases of the S95F's capabilities. Both are mastered for high brightness beyond 1,000 nits, and the S95F was able to produce specular highlights, like lightning blasts, fiery explosions, and shimmering armor, with greater intensity than previous-generation OLEDs. And the TV's colors were also vibrant, bringing the vivid underwater world of Atlantis to life with rich saturation.\nSince this is an OLED, the S95F's contrast performance is as good as it gets. The OLED panel's pixel-level dimming enables an infinite contrast ratio with deep black levels that completely disappear into a dark room. Scenes from \"The Matrix\" and \"1917\" were perfect examples of this: shadows appeared inky while bright elements of the image, like a flashlight or exploding flare, popped against black backgrounds without any troublesome blooming.\nEven top QLED TVs with high-end Mini LED panels are prone to some backlight fluctuations and halos during tricky sequences, like the burning church scene in \"1917,\" but the S95F handled this type of content without any issues. You can learn more about the pros and cons of OLED tech in our QLED vs. OLED comparison.\nBeyond high-quality 4K content, I also sampled lower-resolution HD sources from YouTube and Samsung TV Plus (the brand's free ad-supported streaming app). Though Sony often gets heralded for its industry-leading upscaling and picture processing, Samsung and LG have made big strides in this regard, and the S95F is further proof of that. Sure, lower-quality material still looks noticeably softer and compressed than native 4K content, but the S95F's processing is a clear step above that of TVs from cheaper brands like TCL, Hisense, and Roku.\nThe S95F's gaming capabilities are on par with what shoppers should expect from a flagship set in this class. You get variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM) support to enable smooth gameplay and low input lag. But the S95F offers an even higher refresh rate than last year's S95D, jumping from 144Hz to 165Hz. This feature only benefits PC gamers with a high-end graphics card, but it's still an impressive feat.\nAs for the competition, only LG's new G5 OLED can go toe-to-toe with the S95F's picture capabilities. However, the G5 can get even brighter, which gives highlights in certain HDR content a bit more intensity. That said, the S95F has an edge in color volume, giving especially bright colors more saturation.\nThe TV's glare-free tech is great for reducing reflections, but gives dark scenes a faded look\nLike last year's S95D, the S95F uses Samsung's glare-free technology, which relies on a matte screen rather than a glossy one. Glossy screens are used on most competing TVs, like LG's G5, and though they're great for preserving high contrast, they can lead to mirror-like reflections when watching TV in a bright room.\nThe S95F's matte screen can scatter and diffuse glare in a way that nearly eliminates direct reflections. Samsung says this second-generation glare-free screen offers even better performance than last year's version. I couldn't compare the S95D and S95F side-by-side, but the S95F certainly does an incredible job of reducing glare. With the lights on, I didn't notice any bothersome reflections on the screen. Sure, if you shine light directly on the panel, you will see some hazy glare, but this effect is nothing like the mirror quality of a glossy-style OLED.\nUnfortunately, the S95F's matte screen is still prone to the same key drawback I encountered with last year's S95D: it elevates black levels in a bright room. The way the anti-glare filter scatters light causes black levels to lose their inkiness and take on a slightly faded look. This is most evident when watching content with many dim scenes. In a dark room, however, the S95F's black levels are as deep as on competing OLED TVs with glossy screens.\nThough this effect was still evident on the S95F, it bothered me slightly less than it did on last year's S95D. I'm not sure if the new screen handles contrast a bit better or if I've just become more accustomed to the look of matte panels, but I appreciated the overall benefits of the S95F's glare-free tech more than I did on the S95D. Ultimately, I still much prefer the deeper black levels you get with a glossy panel, but if your room is plagued by reflections that you can't (or don't want to) fix with curtains, the S95F is a great solution.\nSamsung's smart TV system is solid, but the new AI features are underwhelming\nThe S95F uses the latest version of Samsung's Tizen smart TV operating system. This platform is decent overall, with solid navigation and all the major functions you could need. In general design and usability, I put it on par with LG's similar webOS system and a step above Amazon's Fire TV OS, which I find too cluttered and filled with sponsored content. However, I still prefer the Google TV and Roku OS systems thanks to their more streamlined interfaces.\nThe S95F's sidebar panel offers access to dedicated pages for search, ambient mode, Samsung Daily+ (health, work, and smart device control apps), and a gaming hub. The gaming hub is where you'll find cloud services like Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna, and Xbox Game Pass. Samsung and LG (via a future update) are the only brands that support the Xbox app, which lets subscribers play Xbox games without a console. Performance heavily depends on your internet connection, but it's a cool feature.\nFor voice control, you can choose between Samsung's Bixby virtual assistant or Amazon Alexa. Spoken commands can be given hands-free with a wake word or via a button press on the included SolarCell remote. The remote is similar to past models with a compact design and the ability to charge via sunlight or indoor lights, so you never need to replace batteries (it can also be recharged much quicker via USB-C). However, it's disappointing that it isn't backlit, which has become a common feature on remotes from brands like Hisense and TCL.\nIn the brand's marketing materials, Samsung has been emphasizing its Vision AI suite of smart features across its 2025 TVs. However, most of these AI-powered functions are just upgraded versions of features that the company's older TV models already supported. Various AI upscaling and image/audio enhancement modes have been improved, but are nothing new. These features can be useful for users unhappy with the TV's image or audio quality, but they often introduce unnecessary adjustments. Generally, I recommend avoiding these settings and just using Filmmaker or Standard mode. Meanwhile, the few AI features that are genuinely new for 2025 are underwhelming.\nFirst, there's a Live Translate function that uses AI to offer real-time subtitles in one of seven languages. That sounds cool, but this feature only works with live broadcasts from an over-the-air (OTA) antenna. Many people watch TV via cable or streaming, so that's a notable limitation. Since I didn't have an antenna handy during my review session, I could not test this feature, but I'll try it when I review Samsung's other TV models in the coming months. That said, given this restriction to OTA broadcasts, I can't imagine this being a big selling point in its current form.\nSamsung has also been touting a new Click to Search feature that lets you click a button on the remote to pull up info about the content you're viewing, including details about the cast on screen. This sounds similar to the X-Ray feature that Amazon supports on Prime Video, but it only works with live OTA broadcasts, cable TV, and Samsung TV Plus. So, it won't work when streaming popular apps like Netflix or Disney Plus.\nEven with compatible sources, Click to Search is kind of lame. I tested this function while channel surfing through Samsung TV Plus and pulled it up while \"La La Land\" was playing. A side panel displayed the name of the movie, its IMDB score, and a list of other titles coming up on the same channel. Another tab listed the main actors in the film and showed some other movies they're in. That's all fine, but pretty limited compared to what Prime Video's X-Ray can do. X-Ray will pull up all of the actors in the specific scene you're watching, not just the top-billed people in the movie as a whole. With its limited compatibility and info, I can't see many people using this function too often.\nI still want to dive more deeply into Vision AI features when I review other Samsung TVs this year, but based on my initial time with these functions, I don't see a major evolution in the brand's smart TV capabilities compared to last year's models. But honestly, that's OK. Samsung's smart TVs have already been plenty smart, so the S95F's advancements are fine. But the idea that Samsung's 2025 models are ushering in a new phase of \"AI TVs\" seems overblown.\nShould you buy the Samsung S95F?\nThe Samsung S95F is the most impressive consumer TV the brand has ever made. It offers a solid bump in brightness over last year's already stellar S95D, some refinements to its glare-free screen, and a couple of new AI-powered features.\nHowever, those AI functions aren't as innovative or useful as the brand's marketing materials make them sound. And the TV's matte panel remains a divisive feature that most people will love or hate. With that in mind, I recommend the LG G5 as a great top-of-the-line OLED alternative for buyers who prefer a glossy panel.\nMeanwhile, shoppers who want a less expensive matte-screen OLED should consider last year's S95D. The S95D can't get as bright as the S95F, but it offers similar performance in other respects and is being heavily discounted. At the time of writing, the 65-inch S95D is about $1,000 less than the S95F.\nThe S95F's jump in HDR brightness is nothing to scoff at, but is it worth an extra $1,000 over last year's model? Well, that depends on what kind of buyer you are. If you're an AV enthusiast with deep pockets, I'd argue the answer is yes. After all, the S95 series is Samsung's flagship offering geared toward those willing to pay top dollar for top picture quality. In that context, the S95F is undoubtedly the better TV.\nEven then, it's important to remember that sets like this tend to get great deals as the year goes on. Tariffs could impact the potential for a big price drop, but I still expect this model to get discounted during sales like Prime Day and Black Friday. At full price, I can only recommend the S95F to big TV enthusiasts. But its appeal will broaden if its price comes down later in the year.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.
