      "summary": "The article traces the decline of desktop PCs as laptops, tablets, and mobile devices become the dominant personal computing platforms, driven by portability, convenience, and the rise of AI and cloud gaming. Desktop sales are shrinking, with laptops overtaking them globally for the first time in Q3 2023 and continuing to grow, while niche segments like gaming desktops and mini PCs retain a loyal base. Market forecasts project modest PC growth into 2025, but anticipate a gradual slowdown as Windows 11 adoption stabilizes and AI-enabled PCs face budget constraints. The piece also highlights the impact of U.S. tariffs, AI PC adoption, and commercial demand on future PC volumes.",
