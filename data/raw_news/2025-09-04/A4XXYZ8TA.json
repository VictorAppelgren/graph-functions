  "description": "AJ Gosselin: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s Second Quarter Fiscal 2026 Earnings Results.  With me on today's call are Rick Wilmer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Manzi Katani, Chief Financial Officer.",
  "content": "Rick Wilmer: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call. We are pleased to report solid results for the quarter. Second quarter revenue was $99 million, landing at the top of our guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margin improved sequentially, with Q2 results coming in at 33%. This figure is notable as the highest gross margin we have reported since becoming a public company, and we successfully mitigated tariffs to achieve it. Cash management was exceptional, with our ending balance at $195 million, only $2 million below Q1's close, largely driven by structural OpEx changes we have been making over the last year.\n\nAlso, please note that we use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which we reconcile to GAAP in our earnings release and for certain historical periods in the investor presentation posted on the Investors section of our website. And finally, we will be posting a transcript of this call to our investor relations website under the Quarterly Results section. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wilmer.\n\nThese forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after the call. For a more detailed description of certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on June 6, 2025, and our earnings release posted today on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K.\n\nAJ Gosselin: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s Second Quarter Fiscal 2026 Earnings Results. This call is being webcast and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.chargepoint.com. With me on today's call are Rick Wilmer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Manzi Katani, Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, we issued our press release announcing results for the quarter ended July 31, 2025, which can be found on our website. We would like to remind you that during the conference call, management will be making forward-looking statements, including our outlook for 2026.\n\nOur collaboration with GM is also progressing, with nearly a dozen sites and more than 50 new fast charging ports and many more scheduled to launch this year. Overall, ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. now manages over 363,000 ports, including more than 37,000 DC fast chargers and 123,000 located in Europe. Globally, ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. drivers can access nearly 1,300,000 charging ports. We achieved this performance despite the uncertainty, particularly in North America. Within the US, passenger EV sales growth slowed to a 3% year-over-year increase. The forthcoming expiration of the Consumer 30D EV tax and 30C alternative fuel vehicle refueling credit are also sources of concern for future EV adoption.\n\nAlong with the evolving tariff landscape, this has translated into delays for major projects we have won extended expansion build-outs, but no project cancellations. So we are making solid progress on our path, as we saw over the past year, to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven. Considering these delays and their impact on revenue, we have determined we will be best positioned if we push out our EBITDA breakeven beyond this year. This is to ensure we can fund product innovation and commercialization efforts, which we expect to drive durable revenue growth. Uncertainty aside, we believe our go-to-market strategy and innovation put us on a firm footing to drive growth, win market share, and hit EBITDA positive in the coming quarters.\n\nRegarding our go-to-market strategy, we are rapidly operationalizing our partnership with Eaton, and that work will be largely completed this quarter. Since this partnership was announced in May, we continue to build confidence that together we will accelerate the deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across North America and Europe. We have already introduced our co-branded product, expanded our channel reach, accessed new strategic accounts, and started generating new streams of revenue together. We are delivering innovation, which has been accelerated and expanded because of our partnership with Eaton.\n\nThe express line of DC charging solutions powered by Eaton and announced last week combines the strength of both companies to deliver more power in less space with massive scalability along with the easiest and fastest installation. It features Eaton hardware for grid connectivity plus B2G capabilities. The net result will be substantially lower CapEx and operating costs and faster deployment timelines. It will change the game in terms of the economics of DC fast charging for our customers. We are also co-developing a bidirectional home charging solution with advanced energy management.\n\nThe integration of ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s Flex Plus chargers with Eaton's Able Edge smart panels and breakers enables vehicles to supply backup power to homes and also automatically adjust EV charging based on the home energy usage. To allow homeowners to install EV charging, the behind-the-meter insights will help utilities manage grid stress and transformer loads. We expect this synergistic type of innovation will deliver real value to homeowners, utilities, and auto OEMs while at the same time driving market share gains. Both the new express line of DC solutions and flex product line are designed to not only deliver market differentiation but also cost-effectiveness. We expect both product lines to have a positive impact on our hardware gross margins.\n\nMoving to markets, Europe seems promising going forward. Roadmotion reports a 26% year-over-year increase in European EV sales during the first half of the year, which is a strong indicator of future charging demand in Europe. We believe the current infrastructure cannot support such growth. With the innovation and new products we are delivering, we will be well situated to capture much of this demand. In summary, despite an uncertain environment causing delays, we delivered strong results. We are operationalizing our strategic Eaton partnership, which accelerates innovation and expands our reach. We are delivering game-changing products poised to strengthen our market share and profitability. Internally, the team continues to execute with excellence.\n\nOur long-term thesis remains intact, validated by the strength of our pipeline, the positive reaction to our new products, and the new partners and customers we are actively signing. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Manzi Katani.\n\nManzi Katani: Thanks, Rick. As a reminder, please see our earnings press release where we reconcile our non-GAAP results to GAAP. Our principal exclusions are stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and certain costs related to restructuring settlements, and nonrecurring legal expenses. Revenue for the second quarter was $99 million at the high end of our guidance range, sequentially higher than the prior quarter and down 9% year-on-year. Network charging systems at $50 million accounted for 51% of second quarter revenue. Subscription revenue at $40 million was 40% of total revenue, 5% higher sequentially and up 10% year-on-year as our total installed base continued to increase. Other revenue at $8 million was 8% of total revenue.\n\nTurning to verticals, which we report from a billings perspective, second quarter billings percentages were commercial 75%, fleet 11%, residential 10%, and other 4%. From a geographic perspective, North America made up 84% of revenue, and Europe was 16%. This was relatively consistent with the first quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, growing by three percentage points sequentially and eight percentage points year-on-year. This is attributable to higher hardware margins, higher subscription margins, as well as subscription revenue growing as a percentage of total revenue. I would like to point out that this was our seventh straight quarter of sequential non-GAAP gross margin improvement. Hardware gross margin increased 1% sequentially despite the impact of higher tariffs.\n\nSubscription margin continued to grow, reaching another record high of 61% on a GAAP basis and was even higher on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting economies of scale and continued optimization of support costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $59 million, up 3% sequentially and down 12% year-on-year. The small sequential increase this quarter was mainly due to a temporary increase in R&D spend as a result of higher NRE and contractor spend related to the development of our recently announced new AC and DC charging product architecture. This increase will persist in the third quarter, but we should see the spend gradually coming down in Q4 and then further reducing next year.\n\nWe are continuing to closely manage operating expenses, balancing investments that we believe will lead to significant future growth and margin expansion while also being mindful of current constraints. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss was $22 million. This compares with a loss of $23 million in the prior quarter and a loss of $34 million in the second quarter of last year. Stock-based compensation was $18 million, flat to last quarter and down from $19 million in the second quarter of last year. Our inventory balance remained virtually flat to the prior quarter at $212 million.\n\nWhile this balance did not decrease due to existing commitments with contract manufacturers, we continue to drive towards a gradual reduction in inventory over the next few quarters, which will free up cash. Speaking of cash, we ended the quarter with $195 million of cash on hand versus $196 million in the prior quarter, resulting in cash usage of less than $2 million. This compares with $49 million of cash usage in Q2 of last year and $29 million in Q1 this year. We have been able to significantly reduce cash burn over the past few quarters mainly due to spend reductions and working capital management.\n\nOur $150 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn, and we have no debt maturities until 2028. Turning to guidance, for 2026, we expect revenue to be between $90 million to $100 million. While we continue to guide cautiously given the challenging and constantly changing macro backdrop, delivering revenue growth, and ultimately reaching non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven and generating positive cash flow remain our primary focus areas.\n\nAs Rick mentioned, given the macroeconomic headwinds, the trajectory of revenue growth required to get to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven in a quarter will take longer to materialize than this year, but we expect to continue to make progress towards profitability and reducing cash burn, which we have managed to do well over the past year. We will now open the call for questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. We also ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nColin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Now, can you just talk a little bit about what the trajectory is on OpEx? Obviously, R&D is remaining at some elevated levels along with G&A. Just want to get a sense of how that should trend over the balance of this fiscal year.\n\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Colin. I will take that one. Yes. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, OpEx is slightly higher than Q1 because of some investment we did on the R&D front. We have spent on prototyping as we are releasing these new products and releasing the new AC and DC architecture. Those are temporary one-time, if you will, NRE costs. And then we also had elevated expenses on the contractor side this quarter. Now we expect this to persist in the next quarter because we are really in the middle of releasing all of these products. There is a lot of activity going on around that. But I think it should come down gradually in Q4.\n\nAnd then we will manage it better next year.\n\nColin Rusch: Great. And then just from a sales perspective, you know, we all know what is going on in North America and then, you know, kind of a digestion of the new policy. But I am curious, you know, in Europe, other geographies where you are seeing any potential higher growth opportunities, you know, particularly with this Eaton relationship and global footprint there? Are there other areas that you see, you know, the products ending up that could surprise us in some way around the growth trajectory?\n\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. I think hey, Colin. I think the overall macro conditions in Europe are looking better right now than they are in North America. Hopefully, things will start to clarify in North America once we get through the tax credit expiration in September. But in Europe, a lot of the products that are driving some of the incremental OpEx spend that Manzi alluded to are targeted at Europe, where we did not have solutions to serve those use cases in the past. So the flex product line that we have announced a month or so ago will launch in Europe. Here soon. In fact, we have now got inventory position in Europe to begin fulfilling early sales.\n\nAnd then the new DC Express architecture that we also announced will be targeted at Europe, where in the past we have not had a DC product that was developed by us available in Europe. So we are as we move forward into the new year. It is a combination of a more positive macro environment and new products to serve that market that we believe are quite differentiated.\n\nColin Rusch: Great. Thanks so much, guys. I will hop back in queue.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Dendrinos with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Dendrinos: Hi. Good evening, and thank you. I guess maybe to start here, just wanted to follow-up on that question in regards to the AC architecture or the new AC launch in Europe. Can you maybe speak to the initial kind of interest levels there? And mentioned inventory? I guess, maybe what is the channel like, and what has been the response from the dealerships? Dealer channel there? Thanks.\n\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. So it is very early, Chris. We have just moved the first bit of inventory into Europe. We have had successful early access customers. And we are beginning to build up our channel interest and target our end customer base in three major geographies in Europe. The UK, France, and Germany. We have got all the approvals to serve all the markets, all those different product configurations based on the requirements in each of those major European geos. So we will be really getting clarity on the overall demand that we expect early on with this new product as we move through this quarter, but early indications have been positive.\n\nChris Dendrinos: Got it. Okay. And then, you know, maybe as a follow-up here, you know, we are only, I guess, a month or two removed from the passage of the OB3, but just kind of thinking about the demand outlook in sort of, call it, lower for longer outlook in the US. I guess, how are you thinking about, you know, the company's positioning here just given the changes in that dynamic? Are you financially in the right place? Do you need to change personnel or strategy at all or slow down maybe some of the development going forward? Thanks.\n\nRick Wilmer: No. I think just the opposite. I mean, within the constraints of our OpEx envelope, I really believe the path to success is to deliver innovation to the market, which we have clearly been doing as we have moved through the year with some of the more significant innovations just announced recently that we mentioned a minute ago. You know, the market, this whole industry went through a hype cycle. It collapsed in 2023. I think there is going to be ongoing demand for EVs. There are indications of that happening.\n\nI think I have seen data from Cox that July will be a record sales for EVs in North America, largely as a result of the tax credit expiration coming up this month. But what that tells us is that there is interest in EVs and demand for EVs if the price point is right. And I think we are seeing a lot of good innovation on the vehicle side. You can look at Ford's new platform announcement. Slate Auto, they announced their new vehicle.\n\nThere is just a bunch of things happening out there that are going to bring the selection up and the price down on EVs, which we believe will drive overall demand for EVs and thus charging going forward into the future. This down cycle is obviously putting pressure on everybody. And I think the industry is going to ultimately consolidate as a result of that. And I believe we are in the best position to capitalize on that. We are the biggest company with the biggest balance sheet. We serve both North America and Europe.\n\nWe have got a strong product portfolio spanning from home all the way up to DC fast charge, along with all the software to manage it for every use case. So I think we are in a great position going forward.\n\nChris Dendrinos: Got it. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Was hoping first you could elaborate more on what you are hearing from customers with respect to their project plans, in particular for North America. Rick, you mentioned some projects are being delayed but not canceled. Can you share more on what you think it would take for customers to move forward with those delayed projects? Then any context they are sharing about how they are thinking about project timing, especially with the 30C tax credits for charging stations set to go away.\n\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. Good question. And I think there is, you know, like, we have got, you know, some being cautious about our look forward. I think our customers are as well. They all again, remain committed to their projects. We have literally not heard of one project cancellation, but I think once the tax credits go away and we see what that means to EV sales, you will see some more decisive in the market regarding moving forward and hopefully not, you know, canceling or pausing, but we are waiting for that to happen, you know, to provide some clarity. Beyond that, it is the typical stuff that causes project delays. It is getting grid upgrades. It is construction timelines.\n\nIt is all the things that we have historically seen in the past where customers that are doing big projects, particularly often have kind of best-case timelines as if everything goes well, and then a permit gets delayed, the weather disrupts a construction project, and all of a sudden things are moving out. So that factor continues to persist, but it has not changed much.\n\nMark Delaney: Okay. Thank you for that detail, Rick. My other question was for you, Manzi, on the gross margin. Nice to see the improvement you reported this quarter. You have spoken in the past about the potential for the hardware gross margins to continue to improve as you work off inventory of older products and shift your mix toward the lower-cost product that you are building with contract manufacturers. Maybe you can share more where you are in that process and as you fully make the transition, how much do you think it could help the hardware gross margins? Thank you.\n\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Mark. So what we saw this quarter was, you know, hardware margins improved sequentially by a percentage point. By a percentage point, and this was because we actually did see some products coming from Asia, lower cost, but we also saw improvement in warranty cost. And we saw efficiencies in non-bomb related cost, which drove the margins up. Going forward, I think those factors will continue to benefit us. And then depending on inventory and sell-through, we should start seeing the benefit of the Asia manufacturing as well.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mickey Legg with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\n\nMickey Legg: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wanna dig in on the competitive landscape and how that is evolving a little bit. Could you talk about how you view your software and the moat you built around that, now that peers to be moving a bit harder into operation and software platforms?\n\nRick Wilmer: Thanks. Yeah. Hi, Nikki. Good question. I think we have got a state-of-the-art software platform that continues to evolve and modernize. We have now got a hybrid cloud solution. The amount of AI that we are integrating into the product is very interesting and exciting. I think it is going to unleash some real value for our customers. I also believe and know, quite frankly, that we can unlock all kinds of value by having our software work with our hardware. While we are happy to have our software manage third-party hardware, which we do all the time, which is oftentimes a requirement for customers, we will continue to do that.\n\nBut we remain committed to developing hardware as well because we know that our hardware plus software can create more value and do things that cannot be done with just stand-alone software.\n\nMickey Legg: Okay. Great. That is all for me. Thanks.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pearce with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Pearce: Hey. Good afternoon, Rick and Manzi. I was just curious. At least out in California, we are seeing a lot of increased DC charging setups, money going into DC charging. Yeah. I was curious, do you think that is taking share from level two where people thought level two might have higher share in, you know, if we look back a couple of years to what people might see now or what are you guys doing around that, or do you think the idea behind the question is wrong? I just kind of like a sense of level two demand, DC charging demand, how you are kind of fitting both those buckets and what you are seeing.\n\nRick Wilmer: We do not see, you know, DC cannibalizing AC demand. I mean, there are different use cases and as we have talked about more than once, the vast majority of charging is done at home and at work, which is typically level two charging. On the financial side, though, we are seeing a lot of interest or a reasonable amount of interest, I would say increased interest, from financing partners behind, you know, DC fast charging for general public charging. We have had some good success with partners that we have found that want to work with us to deploy DC fast charging for the general public.\n\nChris Pearce: And then if we go back to the inventory, Manzi, this one is sort of be for you. Is that something you have in the inventory now? And I guess with the inventory dollars staying where they are, but things are changing under the surface, I just wanted to kind of check-in on any outsourcing risk or DCAC, new product versus old product, you kind of frame all that?\n\nManzi Katani: Yeah. No. I mean, you know, our inventory balance has, you know, a variety of different products and different volumes of all the different products. And we are managing that, you know, based on the arrival of the new products. We are watching that closely. Again, the release date of the new product and the, you know, the general availability and, you know, increased volume is going to take some time, and we are kind of watching each product level with their release dates and inventory balance. And managing that.\n\nBut in terms of if your question is about, you know, shortage or, you know, any kind of movement needed from one product to the other or the need to kind of source more. We do not see any of that.\n\nChris Pearce: Okay. Thank you for your time.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Irwin with Roth Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Irwin: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So cash use this quarter was really tight, right? You guys have been squeezing a lot of cash out of, you know, receivables, inventories, prepaid, I mean, payables, everything was a contribution this quarter. Can you talk about the ability to continue squeezing the balance sheet for cash and, you know, the new products that are launching for the end of the year, did they need a cash contribution for inventory for us to see the revenue start to ramp? Or, you know, can that be offset by continued progress bringing down balances from other products?\n\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Craig. And so I think, you know, there may be quarterly fluctuations in cash usage. Obviously, Q2 was fantastic in terms of cash usage, use less than $2 million, but there may be slight quarterly fluctuations depending on the timing of receivables, pay of sale of inventory, etcetera. But we do anticipate that the overall trend of declining annual cash usage will continue and it is entirely possible that because of our capitalized business model, we might get to the point where we generate cash in a quarter before we achieve EBITDA profitability. And we anticipate that we will particularly benefit from this when we start to bring inventory balance down.\n\nIn terms of the new products, I do not think it will impact inventory because, I mean, I think the overall inventory reduction trajectory should still happen, and it should release cash because obviously, the inventory number as it stands now is pretty high.\n\nRick Wilmer: The other comment I will make, Craig, is that the supply chain timeline or lead time is pretty balanced with the sales cycles now in many cases. So you would be, unlike the COVID days, for example, we do not need to build far in advance of demand such that we can adhere to customer lead time requirements. We can balance that pretty effectively now.\n\nCraig Irwin: Understood. And if I could squeeze another one in on the gross margin side. Can you maybe talk about the commonality of parts in the new products that you are launching? You know, I know a lot of your products introduced to date have had substantial commonality in the architecture and components to drive purchasing leverage. You know, is there maybe a change in architecture or an evolution here? How much do the new products benefit from the pre-existing buy? And, you know, would you expect these products to potentially be margin accretive heading into the end of the year?\n\nRick Wilmer: Yes. So at a part level, there is probably not that much commonality between the old products and the new. There are some exceptions. For example, charging cables or charging cables. They do not change very much from product to product depending on level two, level three, for example. What is common is the vendor base. And the leverage we have with the supply base is really driven by the amount of business we concentrated in certain suppliers as opposed to specific individual parts that we buy from them. That may change as we move on from product generation to product generation.\n\nCraig Irwin: Thank you for that. Congratulations again on the progress this quarter.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Sings with B. Riley. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Sings: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I will just ask a couple of follow-ups on Europe. Looks like it is almost 20% of revenue right now. I am curious where you think Europe could go in terms of ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s overall revenue mix over the next few years? And could you remind us if there are any material differences in terms of your economics in Europe compared to in North America?\n\nRick Wilmer: The economics are a lot different. The different European countries have different regulations and requirements, which makes it a bit more complex from an standpoint to make sure you have the right product for the right country, for example. But that is fairly minor relative to the overall dynamics of the business comparing North America to Europe. We are not guiding, you know, revenue beyond this quarter. But the fact that we have got hardware products going into Europe that are our products that we have not been able to offer previously implies that, you know, Europe will definitely be growing for us.\n\nRyan Sings: Got it. Appreciate that color, Rick.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBill Peterson: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I would like to follow-up on gross margins. Been asked a few different ways. But just looking ahead, how should we think about steady-state margins for hardware when you are really past any sort of existing inventory and you are on, I guess, an optimized platform, what should that look like over the long term or, I guess, on a go-forward basis? As well as subscriptions? Could you been doing some work there to optimize that part of the business as well. I am just trying to get a sense for how we should think about steady-state margins.\n\nAnd I guess, you mentioned you are navigating tariffs, but could you quantify the impact so we can at least understand what level of impact there is? Should we get any relief? Or conversely, if tariffs become more, I guess, impactful?\n\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Bill. I will take that one. So I started this margins. I think subscription margins should continue to improve with economies of scale and ongoing efficiency in our support organization. Our, you know, revenue keeps growing, but we do not have to scale costs up. So that the improvement should continue. As you said, it is, you know, more than 61% on a non-GAAP basis this quarter. I think that trend continues. On the hardware side, again, as we see products coming in from Asia, it, you know, margins should get better. We saw improvement in warranty cost. Other efficiencies, and non-bomb cost, all of that could help.\n\nHowever, on the hardware side, the overall margin really depends on the mix of products sold, which is difficult to predict. So it is hard to call out an ideal state. There are a lot of moving parts there. And also overall, for margins, there is a factor of subscription revenue as a percentage of overall revenue. If that improves, obviously, go up. But as we start selling more hardware, that could impact overall margins.\n\nRick Wilmer: The other comment I will make, Bill, is that the new products we expect to have higher baseline margin profiles than any of our existing products. We have been very focused on not only designing for features, functionality, broad applicability, but also for cost profile.\n\nManzi Katani: Yep. And then on the tariffs, so we have a lot of tariff mitigation already in place. We have, you know, a spread-out manufacturing base across the globe, which we are kind of leveraging to manage tariffs. It was not really meaningful within this quarter, and like I said, we were able to mitigate the tariffs that we had and whatever we did incur, we actually, you know, we had improvements that kind of overcame that. So I do not think there is that much of an impact on what we know today. Of course, if that tariff environment changes, then things could change.\n\nBill Peterson: Okay. Thanks for that. One of the\n\nOperator: My apologies. Please repress star one. Your next question comes from John Winham with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Winham: Hi. This is John. Hopefully, you can hear me okay?\n\nJohn Winham: Yeah. Perfect. You have mentioned a potential for consolidation in the industry. I was wondering if you could talk through if there have been any early signs of that in Europe or the US or anywhere you can sort of point to. Appreciate it. Thanks.\n\nRick Wilmer: Yeah, John. I cannot talk to anything specifically, but it seems like it is quite active. There are a lot of interesting conversations going on.\n\nJohn Winham: Maybe just ask the question sort of a little bit differently. And without asking anything specific, in terms of where it would be, what would you see the advantages as an analyst, when we are looking at this, it is taking out OpEx as a percentage of revenue, greater network scale. If you could just talk to what you think the advantage of consolidation would be, I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much.\n\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. I think it is pretty typical after you go through a hype cycle and you end up with, you know, a lot of companies getting started during that hype cycle with what looks like a, you know, an exciting fast-growing market, then you get overcrowding in terms of the competitive landscape. And you have got people that are trying to survive and they tend to try and fight on price. And they race each other to the bottom. And they end up in a situation where they just do not have an economic model that no longer makes sense.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Pfingst with B. Riley.

  "summary": "ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. is set to discuss its second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call, with a strong Q2 revenue of $99 million and a 33% non-GAAP gross margin, the highest since becoming a public company, and we successfully managed to mitigate tariffs. The company's cash balance was exceptional at $195 million, only $2 million below Q1's close, largely due to structural OpEx changes made over the last year. Despite uncertainty surrounding passenger EV sales growth in North America, the company has seen solid growth and expects to push out its EBITDA breakeven beyond this year to fund product innovation and commercialization efforts. The firm's collaboration with GM is also progressing, with nearly a dozen sites and over 50 new fast charging ports set to launch this year. It now manages over 363,000 ports, including over 37,000 DC fast chargers and 123,000 located in Europe. Despite delays for major projects and potential losses, the firm believes its go-to-market strategy and innovation puts them on a strong footing to drive growth, win market share, and hit EBTDA positive in the coming quarters. The call is being webcast on the Investors section of our website at investors.com.",

Management confirmed that all major project delays are postponements, not cancellations, though revenue growth trajectories were impacted in fiscal Q2 2026. The new express line of DC charging solutions and bidirectional home charging -- developed with Eaton -- are expected to improve hardware gross margins (non-GAAP) and broaden the company\u2019s addressable markets. Subscription gross margin reached a GAAP record high of 61% in fiscal Q2 2026, and management indicated further expansion is likely due to economies of scale and support cost optimization. Annual cash burn has declined sharply over the past few quarters, attributed to improved working capital management and lower spending, with CFO Katani noting the possibility of generating cash in a quarter before non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA profitability is reached.\n- Initial deployments from the Eaton partnership began generating revenue in fiscal Q2 2026, and early Flex Plus and DC solutions are strategically positioned for growth in European markets.\n- CEO Wilmer described the macro conditions in Europe as \"looking better right now than they are in North America,\" indicating a shift of focus and stronger pipeline overseas.\n- CFO Katani stated, \"Our $150 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn, and we have no debt maturities until 2028,\" providing additional financial flexibility.\n- Management reported the ongoing industry consolidation, with Wilmer describing the landscape as \"quite active,\" though no specific transactions were disclosed during the call.\nIndustry glossary\n- DC fast charger: Direct current charging station capable of rapidly replenishing electric vehicle batteries, typically used for public or high-throughput locations.\n- 30D EV tax credit: U.S. federal tax credit for consumers purchasing electric vehicles, scheduled for expiration and referenced as a source of market uncertainty.\n- 30C alternative fuel vehicle refueling credit: U.S. federal tax credit for installing alternative fuel vehicle refueling infrastructure, including EV charging stations, also approaching expiration as noted on the call.\n- OpEx: Operating expenses, including R&D and G&A, crucial for understanding company cost management priorities stated in the call.\n- NRE: Non-recurring engineering -- one-time R&D costs, referenced in context to elevated spend for new product development.\n- B2G: Bidirectional-to-grid, enabling energy transfer between a vehicle and the grid, cited as a feature of the new DC express line.\nFull Conference Call Transcript\nAJ Gosselin: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s Second Quarter Fiscal 2026 Earnings Results. This call is being webcast and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.chargepoint.com. With me on today's call are Rick Wilmer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Manzi Katani, Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, we issued our press release announcing results for the quarter ended July 31, 2025, which can be found on our website. We would like to remind you that during the conference call, management will be making forward-looking statements, including our outlook for 2026.\nThese forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after the call. For a more detailed description of certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on June 6, 2025, and our earnings release posted today on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K.\nAlso, please note that we use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which we reconcile to GAAP in our earnings release and for certain historical periods in the investor presentation posted on the Investors section of our website. And finally, we will be posting a transcript of this call to our investor relations website under the Quarterly Results section. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wilmer.\nRick Wilmer: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call. We are pleased to report solid results for the quarter. Second quarter revenue was $99 million, landing at the top of our guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margin improved sequentially, with Q2 results coming in at 33%. This figure is notable as the highest gross margin we have reported since becoming a public company, and we successfully mitigated tariffs to achieve it. Cash management was exceptional, with our ending balance at $195 million, only $2 million below Q1's close, largely driven by structural OpEx changes we have been making over the last year.\nOur collaboration with GM is also progressing, with nearly a dozen sites and more than 50 new fast charging ports and many more scheduled to launch this year. Overall, ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. now manages over 363,000 ports, including more than 37,000 DC fast chargers and 123,000 located in Europe. Globally, ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. drivers can access nearly 1,300,000 charging ports. We achieved this performance despite the uncertainty, particularly in North America. Within the US, passenger EV sales growth slowed to a 3% year-over-year increase. The forthcoming expiration of the Consumer 30D EV tax and 30C alternative fuel vehicle refueling credit are also sources of concern for future EV adoption.\nAlong with the evolving tariff landscape, this has translated into delays for major projects we have won extended expansion build-outs, but no project cancellations. So we are making solid progress on our path, as we saw over the past year, to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven. Considering these delays and their impact on revenue, we have determined we will be best positioned if we push out our EBITDA breakeven beyond this year. This is to ensure we can fund product innovation and commercialization efforts, which we expect to drive durable revenue growth. Uncertainty aside, we believe our go-to-market strategy and innovation put us on a firm footing to drive growth, win market share, and hit EBITDA positive in the coming quarters.\nRegarding our go-to-market strategy, we are rapidly operationalizing our partnership with Eaton, and that work will be largely completed this quarter. Since this partnership was announced in May, we continue to build confidence that together we will accelerate the deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across North America and Europe. We have already introduced our co-branded product, expanded our channel reach, accessed new strategic accounts, and started generating new streams of revenue together. We are delivering innovation, which has been accelerated and expanded because of our partnership with Eaton.\nThe express line of DC charging solutions powered by Eaton and announced last week combines the strength of both companies to deliver more power in less space with massive scalability along with the easiest and fastest installation. It features Eaton hardware for grid connectivity plus B2G capabilities. The net result will be substantially lower CapEx and operating costs and faster deployment timelines. It will change the game in terms of the economics of DC fast charging for our customers. We are also co-developing a bidirectional home charging solution with advanced energy management.\nThe integration of ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s Flex Plus chargers with Eaton's Able Edge smart panels and breakers enables vehicles to supply backup power to homes and also automatically adjust EV charging based on the home energy usage. To allow homeowners to install EV charging, the behind-the-meter insights will help utilities manage grid stress and transformer loads. We expect this synergistic type of innovation will deliver real value to homeowners, utilities, and auto OEMs while at the same time driving market share gains. Both the new express line of DC solutions and flex product line are designed to not only deliver market differentiation but also cost-effectiveness. We expect both product lines to have a positive impact on our hardware gross margins.\nMoving to markets, Europe seems promising going forward. Roadmotion reports a 26% year-over-year increase in European EV sales during the first half of the year, which is a strong indicator of future charging demand in Europe. We believe the current infrastructure cannot support such growth. With the innovation and new products we are delivering, we will be well situated to capture much of this demand. In summary, despite an uncertain environment causing delays, we delivered strong results. We are operationalizing our strategic Eaton partnership, which accelerates innovation and expands our reach. We are delivering game-changing products poised to strengthen our market share and profitability. Internally, the team continues to execute with excellence.\nOur long-term thesis remains intact, validated by the strength of our pipeline, the positive reaction to our new products, and the new partners and customers we are actively signing. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Manzi Katani.\nManzi Katani: Thanks, Rick. As a reminder, please see our earnings press release where we reconcile our non-GAAP results to GAAP. Our principal exclusions are stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and certain costs related to restructuring settlements, and nonrecurring legal expenses. Revenue for the second quarter was $99 million at the high end of our guidance range, sequentially higher than the prior quarter and down 9% year-on-year. Network charging systems at $50 million accounted for 51% of second quarter revenue. Subscription revenue at $40 million was 40% of total revenue, 5% higher sequentially and up 10% year-on-year as our total installed base continued to increase. Other revenue at $8 million was 8% of total revenue.\nTurning to verticals, which we report from a billings perspective, second quarter billings percentages were commercial 75%, fleet 11%, residential 10%, and other 4%. From a geographic perspective, North America made up 84% of revenue, and Europe was 16%. This was relatively consistent with the first quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, growing by three percentage points sequentially and eight percentage points year-on-year. This is attributable to higher hardware margins, higher subscription margins, as well as subscription revenue growing as a percentage of total revenue. I would like to point out that this was our seventh straight quarter of sequential non-GAAP gross margin improvement. Hardware gross margin increased 1% sequentially despite the impact of higher tariffs.\nSubscription margin continued to grow, reaching another record high of 61% on a GAAP basis and was even higher on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting economies of scale and continued optimization of support costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $59 million, up 3% sequentially and down 12% year-on-year. The small sequential increase this quarter was mainly due to a temporary increase in R&D spend as a result of higher NRE and contractor spend related to the development of our recently announced new AC and DC charging product architecture. This increase will persist in the third quarter, but we should see the spend gradually coming down in Q4 and then further reducing next year.\nWe are continuing to closely manage operating expenses, balancing investments that we believe will lead to significant future growth and margin expansion while also being mindful of current constraints. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss was $22 million. This compares with a loss of $23 million in the prior quarter and a loss of $34 million in the second quarter of last year. Stock-based compensation was $18 million, flat to last quarter and down from $19 million in the second quarter of last year. Our inventory balance remained virtually flat to the prior quarter at $212 million.\nWhile this balance did not decrease due to existing commitments with contract manufacturers, we continue to drive towards a gradual reduction in inventory over the next few quarters, which will free up cash. Speaking of cash, we ended the quarter with $195 million of cash on hand versus $196 million in the prior quarter, resulting in cash usage of less than $2 million. This compares with $49 million of cash usage in Q2 of last year and $29 million in Q1 this year. We have been able to significantly reduce cash burn over the past few quarters mainly due to spend reductions and working capital management.\nOur $150 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn, and we have no debt maturities until 2028. Turning to guidance, for 2026, we expect revenue to be between $90 million to $100 million. While we continue to guide cautiously given the challenging and constantly changing macro backdrop, delivering revenue growth, and ultimately reaching non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven and generating positive cash flow remain our primary focus areas.\nAs Rick mentioned, given the macroeconomic headwinds, the trajectory of revenue growth required to get to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven in a quarter will take longer to materialize than this year, but we expect to continue to make progress towards profitability and reducing cash burn, which we have managed to do well over the past year. We will now open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. We also ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nColin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Now, can you just talk a little bit about what the trajectory is on OpEx? Obviously, R&D is remaining at some elevated levels along with G&A. Just want to get a sense of how that should trend over the balance of this fiscal year.\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Colin. I will take that one. Yes. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, OpEx is slightly higher than Q1 because of some investment we did on the R&D front. We have spent on prototyping as we are releasing these new products and releasing the new AC and DC architecture. Those are temporary one-time, if you will, NRE costs. And then we also had elevated expenses on the contractor side this quarter. Now we expect this to persist in the next quarter because we are really in the middle of releasing all of these products. There is a lot of activity going on around that. But I think it should come down gradually in Q4.\nAnd then we will manage it better next year.\nColin Rusch: Great. And then just from a sales perspective, you know, we all know what is going on in North America and then, you know, kind of a digestion of the new policy. But I am curious, you know, in Europe, other geographies where you are seeing any potential higher growth opportunities, you know, particularly with this Eaton relationship and global footprint there? Are there other areas that you see, you know, the products ending up that could surprise us in some way around the growth trajectory?\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. I think hey, Colin. I think the overall macro conditions in Europe are looking better right now than they are in North America. Hopefully, things will start to clarify in North America once we get through the tax credit expiration in September. But in Europe, a lot of the products that are driving some of the incremental OpEx spend that Manzi alluded to are targeted at Europe, where we did not have solutions to serve those use cases in the past. So the flex product line that we have announced a month or so ago will launch in Europe. Here soon. In fact, we have now got inventory position in Europe to begin fulfilling early sales.\nAnd then the new DC Express architecture that we also announced will be targeted at Europe, where in the past we have not had a DC product that was developed by us available in Europe. So we are as we move forward into the new year. It is a combination of a more positive macro environment and new products to serve that market that we believe are quite differentiated.\nColin Rusch: Great. Thanks so much, guys. I will hop back in queue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Dendrinos with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nChris Dendrinos: Hi. Good evening, and thank you. I guess maybe to start here, just wanted to follow-up on that question in regards to the AC architecture or the new AC launch in Europe. Can you maybe speak to the initial kind of interest levels there? And mentioned inventory? I guess, maybe what is the channel like, and what has been the response from the dealerships? Dealer channel there? Thanks.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. So it is very early, Chris. We have just moved the first bit of inventory into Europe. We have had successful early access customers. And we are beginning to build up our channel interest and target our end customer base in three major geographies in Europe. The UK, France, and Germany. We have got all the approvals to serve all the markets, all those different product configurations based on the requirements in each of those major European geos. So we will be really getting clarity on the overall demand that we expect early on with this new product as we move through this quarter, but early indications have been positive.\nChris Dendrinos: Got it. Okay. And then, you know, maybe as a follow-up here, you know, we are only, I guess, a month or two removed from the passage of the OB3, but just kind of thinking about the demand outlook in sort of, call it, lower for longer outlook in the US. I guess, how are you thinking about, you know, the company's positioning here just given the changes in that dynamic? Are you financially in the right place? Do you need to change personnel or strategy at all or slow down maybe some of the development going forward? Thanks.\nRick Wilmer: No. I think just the opposite. I mean, within the constraints of our OpEx envelope, I really believe the path to success is to deliver innovation to the market, which we have clearly been doing as we have moved through the year with some of the more significant innovations just announced recently that we mentioned a minute ago. You know, the market, this whole industry went through a hype cycle. It collapsed in 2023. I think there is going to be ongoing demand for EVs. There are indications of that happening.\nI think I have seen data from Cox that July will be a record sales for EVs in North America, largely as a result of the tax credit expiration coming up this month. But what that tells us is that there is interest in EVs and demand for EVs if the price point is right. And I think we are seeing a lot of good innovation on the vehicle side. You can look at Ford's new platform announcement. Slate Auto, they announced their new vehicle.\nThere is just a bunch of things happening out there that are going to bring the selection up and the price down on EVs, which we believe will drive overall demand for EVs and thus charging going forward into the future. This down cycle is obviously putting pressure on everybody. And I think the industry is going to ultimately consolidate as a result of that. And I believe we are in the best position to capitalize on that. We are the biggest company with the biggest balance sheet. We serve both North America and Europe.\nWe have got a strong product portfolio spanning from home all the way up to DC fast charge, along with all the software to manage it for every use case. So I think we are in a great position going forward.\nChris Dendrinos: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Was hoping first you could elaborate more on what you are hearing from customers with respect to their project plans, in particular for North America. Rick, you mentioned some projects are being delayed but not canceled. Can you share more on what you think it would take for customers to move forward with those delayed projects? Then any context they are sharing about how they are thinking about project timing, especially with the 30C tax credits for charging stations set to go away.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. Good question. And I think there is, you know, like, we have got, you know, some being cautious about our look forward. I think our customers are as well. They all again, remain committed to their projects. We have literally not heard of one project cancellation, but I think once the tax credits go away and we see what that means to EV sales, you will see some more decisive in the market regarding moving forward and hopefully not, you know, canceling or pausing, but we are waiting for that to happen, you know, to provide some clarity. Beyond that, it is the typical stuff that causes project delays. It is getting grid upgrades. It is construction timelines.\nIt is all the things that we have historically seen in the past where customers that are doing big projects, particularly often have kind of best-case timelines as if everything goes well, and then a permit gets delayed, the weather disrupts a construction project, and all of a sudden things are moving out. So that factor continues to persist, but it has not changed much.\nMark Delaney: Okay. Thank you for that detail, Rick. My other question was for you, Manzi, on the gross margin. Nice to see the improvement you reported this quarter. You have spoken in the past about the potential for the hardware gross margins to continue to improve as you work off inventory of older products and shift your mix toward the lower-cost product that you are building with contract manufacturers. Maybe you can share more where you are in that process and as you fully make the transition, how much do you think it could help the hardware gross margins? Thank you.\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Mark. So what we saw this quarter was, you know, hardware margins improved sequentially by a percentage point. By a percentage point, and this was because we actually did see some products coming from Asia, lower cost, but we also saw improvement in warranty cost. And we saw efficiencies in non-bomb related cost, which drove the margins up. Going forward, I think those factors will continue to benefit us. And then depending on inventory and sell-through, we should start seeing the benefit of the Asia manufacturing as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mickey Legg with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nMickey Legg: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wanna dig in on the competitive landscape and how that is evolving a little bit. Could you talk about how you view your software and the moat you built around that, now that peers to be moving a bit harder into operation and software platforms?\nRick Wilmer: Thanks. Yeah. Hi, Nikki. Good question. I think we have got a state-of-the-art software platform that continues to evolve and modernize. We have now got a hybrid cloud solution. The amount of AI that we are integrating into the product is very interesting and exciting. I think it is going to unleash some real value for our customers. I also believe and know, quite frankly, that we can unlock all kinds of value by having our software work with our hardware. While we are happy to have our software manage third-party hardware, which we do all the time, which is oftentimes a requirement for customers, we will continue to do that.\nBut we remain committed to developing hardware as well because we know that our hardware plus software can create more value and do things that cannot be done with just stand-alone software.\nMickey Legg: Okay. Great. That is all for me. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pearce with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.\nChris Pearce: Hey. Good afternoon, Rick and Manzi. I was just curious. At least out in California, we are seeing a lot of increased DC charging setups, money going into DC charging. Yeah. I was curious, do you think that is taking share from level two where people thought level two might have higher share in, you know, if we look back a couple of years to what people might see now or what are you guys doing around that, or do you think the idea behind the question is wrong? I just kind of like a sense of level two demand, DC charging demand, how you are kind of fitting both those buckets and what you are seeing.\nRick Wilmer: We do not see, you know, DC cannibalizing AC demand. I mean, there are different use cases and as we have talked about more than once, the vast majority of charging is done at home and at work, which is typically level two charging. On the financial side, though, we are seeing a lot of interest or a reasonable amount of interest, I would say increased interest, from financing partners behind, you know, DC fast charging for general public charging. We have had some good success with partners that we have found that want to work with us to deploy DC fast charging for the general public.\nChris Pearce: And then if we go back to the inventory, Manzi, this one is sort of be for you. Is that something you have in the inventory now? And I guess with the inventory dollars staying where they are, but things are changing under the surface, I just wanted to kind of check-in on any outsourcing risk or DCAC, new product versus old product, you kind of frame all that?\nManzi Katani: Yeah. No. I mean, you know, our inventory balance has, you know, a variety of different products and different volumes of all the different products. And we are managing that, you know, based on the arrival of the new products. We are watching that closely. Again, the release date of the new product and the, you know, the general availability and, you know, increased volume is going to take some time, and we are kind of watching each product level with their release dates and inventory balance. And managing that.\nBut in terms of if your question is about, you know, shortage or, you know, any kind of movement needed from one product to the other or the need to kind of source more. We do not see any of that.\nChris Pearce: Okay. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Irwin with Roth Capital. Please go ahead.\nCraig Irwin: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So cash use this quarter was really tight, right? You guys have been squeezing a lot of cash out of, you know, receivables, inventories, prepaid, I mean, payables, everything was a contribution this quarter. Can you talk about the ability to continue squeezing the balance sheet for cash and, you know, the new products that are launching for the end of the year, did they need a cash contribution for inventory for us to see the revenue start to ramp? Or, you know, can that be offset by continued progress bringing down balances from other products?\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Craig. And so I think, you know, there may be quarterly fluctuations in cash usage. Obviously, Q2 was fantastic in terms of cash usage, use less than $2 million, but there may be slight quarterly fluctuations depending on the timing of receivables, pay of sale of inventory, etcetera. But we do anticipate that the overall trend of declining annual cash usage will continue and it is entirely possible that because of our capitalized business model, we might get to the point where we generate cash in a quarter before we achieve EBITDA profitability. And we anticipate that we will particularly benefit from this when we start to bring inventory balance down.\nIn terms of the new products, I do not think it will impact inventory because, I mean, I think the overall inventory reduction trajectory should still happen, and it should release cash because obviously, the inventory number as it stands now is pretty high.\nRick Wilmer: The other comment I will make, Craig, is that the supply chain timeline or lead time is pretty balanced with the sales cycles now in many cases. So you would be, unlike the COVID days, for example, we do not need to build far in advance of demand such that we can adhere to customer lead time requirements. We can balance that pretty effectively now.\nCraig Irwin: Understood. And if I could squeeze another one in on the gross margin side. Can you maybe talk about the commonality of parts in the new products that you are launching? You know, I know a lot of your products introduced to date have had substantial commonality in the architecture and components to drive purchasing leverage. You know, is there maybe a change in architecture or an evolution here? How much do the new products benefit from the pre-existing buy? And, you know, would you expect these products to potentially be margin accretive heading into the end of the year?\nRick Wilmer: Yes. So at a part level, there is probably not that much commonality between the old products and the new. There are some exceptions. For example, charging cables or charging cables. They do not change very much from product to product depending on level two, level three, for example. What is common is the vendor base. And the leverage we have with the supply base is really driven by the amount of business we concentrated in certain suppliers as opposed to specific individual parts that we buy from them. That may change as we move on from product generation to product generation.\nCraig Irwin: Thank you for that. Congratulations again on the progress this quarter.\nRick Wilmer: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Sings with B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nRyan Sings: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I will just ask a couple of follow-ups on Europe. Looks like it is almost 20% of revenue right now. I am curious where you think Europe could go in terms of ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s overall revenue mix over the next few years? And could you remind us if there are any material differences in terms of your economics in Europe compared to in North America?\nRick Wilmer: The economics are a lot different. The different European countries have different regulations and requirements, which makes it a bit more complex from an standpoint to make sure you have the right product for the right country, for example. But that is fairly minor relative to the overall dynamics of the business comparing North America to Europe. We are not guiding, you know, revenue beyond this quarter. But the fact that we have got hardware products going into Europe that are our products that we have not been able to offer previously implies that, you know, Europe will definitely be growing for us.\nRyan Sings: Got it. Appreciate that color, Rick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBill Peterson: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I would like to follow-up on gross margins. Been asked a few different ways. But just looking ahead, how should we think about steady-state margins for hardware when you are really past any sort of existing inventory and you are on, I guess, an optimized platform, what should that look like over the long term or, I guess, on a go-forward basis? As well as subscriptions? Could you been doing some work there to optimize that part of the business as well. I am just trying to get a sense for how we should think about steady-state margins.\nAnd I guess, you mentioned you are navigating tariffs, but could you quantify the impact so we can at least understand what level of impact there is? Should we get any relief? Or conversely, if tariffs become more, I guess, impactful?\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Bill. I will take that one. So I started this margins. I think subscription margins should continue to improve with economies of scale and ongoing efficiency in our support organization. Our, you know, revenue keeps growing, but we do not have to scale costs up. So that the improvement should continue. As you said, it is, you know, more than 61% on a non-GAAP basis this quarter. I think that trend continues. On the hardware side, again, as we see products coming in from Asia, it, you know, margins should get better. We saw improvement in warranty cost. Other efficiencies, and non-bomb cost, all of that could help.\nHowever, on the hardware side, the overall margin really depends on the mix of products sold, which is difficult to predict. So it is hard to call out an ideal state. There are a lot of moving parts there. And also overall, for margins, there is a factor of subscription revenue as a percentage of overall revenue. If that improves, obviously, go up. But as we start selling more hardware, that could impact overall margins.\nRick Wilmer: The other comment I will make, Bill, is that the new products we expect to have higher baseline margin profiles than any of our existing products. We have been very focused on not only designing for features, functionality, broad applicability, but also for cost profile.\nManzi Katani: Yep. And then on the tariffs, so we have a lot of tariff mitigation already in place. We have, you know, a spread-out manufacturing base across the globe, which we are kind of leveraging to manage tariffs. It was not really meaningful within this quarter, and like I said, we were able to mitigate the tariffs that we had and whatever we did incur, we actually, you know, we had improvements that kind of overcame that. So I do not think there is that much of an impact on what we know today. Of course, if that tariff environment changes, then things could change.\nBill Peterson: Okay. Thanks for that. One of the\nOperator: My apologies. Please repress star one. Your next question comes from John Winham with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Winham: Hi. This is John. Hopefully, you can hear me okay?\nRick Wilmer: Yep.\nJohn Winham: Yeah. Perfect. You have mentioned a potential for consolidation in the industry. I was wondering if you could talk through if there have been any early signs of that in Europe or the US or anywhere you can sort of point to. Appreciate it. Thanks.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah, John. I cannot talk to anything specifically, but it seems like it is quite active. There are a lot of interesting conversations going on.\nJohn Winham: Maybe just ask the question sort of a little bit differently. And without asking anything specific, in terms of where it would be, what would you see the advantages as an analyst, when we are looking at this, it is taking out OpEx as a percentage of revenue, greater network scale. If you could just talk to what you think the advantage of consolidation would be, I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. I think it is pretty typical after you go through a hype cycle and you end up with, you know, a lot of companies getting started during that hype cycle with what looks like a, you know, an exciting fast-growing market, then you get overcrowding in terms of the competitive landscape. And you have got people that are trying to survive and they tend to try and fight on price. And they race each other to the bottom. And they end up in a situation where they just do not have an economic model that no longer makes sense.\nJohn Winham: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Pfingst with B. Riley. Please go ahead. And we have no further questions in our queue at this time. And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

Most services eligible for a Transfer Credit will allow an exchange for a different service using the Transfer Credit within 30 days of the initial purchase, and there are services that do not allow for credits of any kind.\nIf you are unsure whether or not your service is eligible for a Transfer Credit please contact [email protected].\nIf you take advantage of a Transfer Credit guarantee, please also note that you will lose access to any product(s) and benefits included in the original promotional offer, including additional services or reports that may have been included as a bonus or incentive for taking advantage of the offer.\nIf the list price of the service you would like to transfer into is more than the amount of Transfer Credits you have, you will receive a partial term of the service. If the list price of the service you would like to transfer into is less than the amount of Transfer Credits, you will be given a service extension such that all Transfer Credits are consumed. In both cases the usual automatic renewal notice will be emailed a month prior to the adjusted end-date.\nWhen using a Transfer Credit, the term length of the service being transferred into cannot extend beyond three years. In the event your Transfer Credit would result in a service term greater than three years, your subscription will be extended to three years and the remaining Transfer Credits will immediately expire.\nSome purchases may include a temporary bonus credit (the \u201cBonus Credit\u201d) that can be applied to a future purchase. These Bonus Credits are valid for 30 days from the date of purchase, and multiple Bonus Credits may be combined for a single purchase. If any Bonus Credits is used on a purchase, the remaining value of all active Bonus Credits immediately expires. Bonus Credits may not be used to early renew a service or extend an existing subscription.\nTransfer and Bonus Credits may be combined for a single purchase. In the event they are combined, the combined credit may only be used for a single purchase, after which all Transfer and Bonus Credits will immediately expire.\nProducts obtained using Transfer Credits and Bonus Credits must be obtained at the list price of the product being transferred into, and cannot be combined with any promotional offers or discounts. Products and services obtained using Transfer or Bonus Credits of any kind are not eligible for exchange, refund, swaps, or any other action that would result in the creation of any Bonus Credits.\nThe Motley Fool reserves the right to disallow Transfer Credits, discounts, or Bonus Credits into certain services depending on insufficient credit, product openings, investment timelines, a member's history of transfers or prior refunds, or for any other reason at The Motley Fool\u2019s sole discretion.\nAt certain times we may offer subscriptions or upgrades to services that may contain components of other services you might currently subscribe to. These offers may include prorated Transfer Credit value for your existing subscriptions. If you purchase one of these subscriptions or upgrades the prorated Transfer Credit value from any existing subscription(s) on your account will be used in its entirety towards the purchase, and the prior-existing subscription will be cancelled upon purchase of the new subscription.\n4. Affiliate Marketing Programs\nSome of our brands such as Motley Fool Money, review various products and services. We may be compensated by third parties whose products we review. This compensation may impact where reviews and offers appear, with higher paying partners appearing higher on a page or in a more prominent position. None of our brands can or does promise to be comprehensive with their reviews of any particular marketplace, and the companies covered may heavily tilt towards partners.\nThat being said, we take try to make sure that our editorial opinions are not affected by our compensation, and no partner or advertiser will review, edit, endorse, or approve editorial content. We also make sure that the editorial teams of any brand remains distinct from the editorial team writing content for Fool.com or our premium services.\nNo reviews of products or services should be construed as an endorsement or guarantee of any kind. We do the best we can to make sure that the information we rely upon for our reviews is true and current, but we cannot and will not warranty that it actually is, or that we have not been confused or misled before or after publication.\nAny service or product not offered by The Motley Fool is subject to its own terms and conditions, including about how they may use the information you provide to them, which should be provided by the company through which you are receiving the product or service, and any use of a product or service not offered by The Motley Fool is done so at your own risk.\n5. Additional and Third-Party Terms of Use\nPlease note that certain individual Services or products may have their own, or additional, terms and conditions. In the event of a conflict, the terms for the individual Service will control with respect to the Service in question. So please be sure to review any additional terms and conditions with respect to any specific Service before subscribing.\nSome portions of our site use Google Maps APIs, or other Google APIs. If you use those parts of our site, you are also bound by the Google Terms of Service. If you do not wish to be bound by these terms, or any of the terms contained within these Rules, please do not use our site.\n6. CAPS\nCAPS is The Motley Fool's service that allows you to make predictions about stocks, see others' predictions, aggregate community opinions, and track their accuracy. By putting together lots of information from a variety of sources, we hope to provide participants with a way to a) have fun and b) learn to make better investment decisions.\nYou should not assume that the opinions that people express in CAPS are the opinions of The Motley Fool or anything other than the opinions of the individuals expressing them.\nWhen you look at other people's predictions, you should remember that those people may have interests in the stocks that they're making predictions about. For example, some people may hope a company's stock will go up because they own many shares of it; others may hope that it will rise because they (or their sister) work for the company; others may hope that the stock will rise because that will increase their CAPS score and their international prestige. When you review people's predictions (or the stock tips you see on television or hear in the supermarket), you should not assume that the person making a prediction is unbiased or independent. One of the beauties of CAPS, though, is that you can see the performance of people's predictions over time and, we hope, distinguish sound analysis from self-serving nonsense.\nMotley Fool employees may participate in CAPS and they may have interests in the stocks about which they make predictions. Employees display their positions in their online TMF profiles at Fool.com. Any predictions made by Fool employees are their own. They are not speaking on behalf of our company and these predictions are not Motley Fool recommendations.\n7. Intellectual Property\nAll of the Content on our websites and any Service we provide is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws and is the property of The Motley Fool and/or providers of the content under license. By \"Content\" we mean any information, mode of expression, or other materials and services found on The Motley Fool. This includes message boards, blogs, CAPS picks, ratings, podcasts, chats, software, our writings, graphics, videos, and any and all other features. You can find out more information on copyright law and the Internet at www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html.\nYou may make one copy of the Content for your personal, non-commercial use, provided that any material copied remains intact and includes the following notice: \"Copyright 1995-2018 [or whatever the current year is] The Motley Fool. All rights reserved.\" Any other copying, distribution, storing, or transmission of any kind, or any commercial use of our Content, is prohibited without The Fool's prior written permission. That means you may not sell, auction, transfer or barter your subscription or any individual publication. You can make or end your own CAPS picks at any time, but those picks, their scoring history, your scoring history, and data aggregated by CAPS remain the property of The Motley Fool.\nYou also may not republish, post, transmit, or distribute the Content to online bulletin and message boards, blogs, chat rooms, intranets, or anywhere else without our consent. You further agree not to create abstracts from or scrape our Content, including CAPS ratings, for use on another website or service (including our own personal forums and blogs). In short, you may not post our Content anywhere else online. Aside from opening yourself up to liability, distributing our premium Services, stock picks, and performance data to other sites and forums is unfair to our members who pay good money to receive our Content. So please don't do it.\nPlease note that notwithstanding the foregoing, when you post content (such as a message-board post or CAPS pitch), you are not somehow surrendering your copyright in your expression, but you are granting us an unlimited license to use it. Specifically, by posting content, you agree that The Motley Fool has an irrevocable, perpetual, and worldwide license to use republish, distribute, reproduce, display, communicate to the public, adapt, perform, store, translate, sublicense, and promote anything you post on our websites.

We'll only republish your content in context, and we'll credit you as author (unless we're using small quotations). We won't republish your posts in advertising without your permission. And we promise not to mock you unless it would amuse us.\nWe also ask that you only upload or include on our Services materials you have the right to use. While we don\u2019t mind if Peter Parker posts photos he\u2019s taken on our platform, we do ask that he not repost images he\u2019s already sold or licensed to The Daily Bugle. If you have a good faith belief that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please notify our Copyright Agent.\nYou agree not to display any of The Motley Fool's trademarks or use them in any manner without our express written permission. You can find the list of our trademarks here.\nSome features of our site are patented under U.S. Patent No. 7,813,986 and U.S. Patent No. 7,882,006.\n8. Conduct\nThe Motley Fool champions active and open debate among our members. All we ask is that it's done in a lawful and civil manner -- be it posting on our boards, commenting on blogs or articles, replying to CAPS pitches, or using our system to contact a fellow member in any way.\nAccordingly, you agree to use The Motley Fool for lawful purposes only. You may not use or allow others to use your Fool membership to:\n- Post or transmit any content that is disruptive, uncivil, abusive, vulgar, profane, obscene, hateful, fraudulent, threatening, harassing, defamatory, or which discloses private or personal matters concerning any person;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any material that you don't have the right to transmit under law (such as copyrights, trade secrets, or securities) or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as nondisclosure agreements);\n\u2022 Post, transmit, or link to sexually explicit material;\n\u2022 Impersonate any person, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any advertising, promotional materials, or other forms of solicitation, including chain letters and pyramid schemes;\n\u2022 Violate any applicable law or regulation while accessing and using our sites, including, without limitation, the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the national or other securities exchanges (especially and including the rule against making false or misleading statements to manipulate the price of any security);\n\u2022 Offer, sell, or buy any security;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any file that contains viruses, corrupted files, \"Trojan Horses,\" or any other contaminating or destructive features that may damage someone's computer;\n\u2022 Forge headers or manipulate identifiers or other data in order to disguise the origin of any content transmitted through our sites or to manipulate your presence on our sites;\n\u2022 Use any automated means, including, without limitation, agents, robots, scripts, or spiders, to access, monitor, copy or harvest data from any part of our sites;\n\u2022 Take any action that imposes an unreasonably or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure or disrupts the functioning of our systems or Services; and\n\u2022 Take any action that damages or disrupts the functioning of our systems or Services.\nUnauthorized access of our sites is a breach of these Terms and Conditions and a violation of the law. You agree not to access our sites by any means other than through the interfaces we provide for use in our accessing our sites.\nThe Motley Fool may at any time, without prior notice and at our sole discretion, remove any post, terminate any membership, remove any individual CAPS picks, delete any CAPS players, remove any CAPS scorecards, or take any action for violating the above (and, if we may say so, sensible) provisions or otherwise taking an action disruptive to a Service. In the event TMF terminates your premium Service, you will receive a prorated refund at our discretion.\nYou are responsible for statements made and actions taken through the use of your password, so please maintain the confidentiality of your password. You agree to immediately notify Member Support of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your username and password.

No Personalized Advice\nWe want to help you make money. However, The Motley Fool is not in the business of rendering personalized investment advice. We can't know all the relevant facts about you and your individual needs, and we cannot claim or represent that any particular Services are suitable for you. Accordingly, you agree that any recommendation or action taken by a Service does not constitute a recommendation that a particular security, strategy, or action is suitable for you. If you want personal advice, then you should seek a registered investment advisor.\nThe Motley Fool may partner with third parties in order to make buying our Services' recommendations easier for you. We will not, and cannot, trade on your behalf at your brokerage. Only you can decide whether or not a stock is right for you and you agree to be liable for any trades you initiate at your brokerage using tools that we or our partners provide.\nAffiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no nonpublic knowledge of our affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates\u2019 personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published.\n10. You Bear Responsibility for Your Financial and Investment Decisions\nOne of the principal tenets here at the Fool is that the best person to handle your finances is you. By your use of our Services, you're agreeing that you bear responsibility for your own investment research and investment decisions. You also agree that The Motley Fool, its directors, its employees, and its agents will not be liable for any investment decision made or action taken by you and others based on news, information, opinion, or any other material published through our Services.\n11. Disclaimer of Warranties and Liabilities\nPlease read The Motley Fool's Disclaimer, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe Motley Fool provides a very broad range of information and commentary via its many Services. Consequently, as a result of the diverse opinions of our staff, a Fool Service may, from time to time, take actions or issue recommendations with regard to specific securities that are different from those taken or issued by another Service we provide.\nThe Motley Fool does not warrant the completeness or accuracy of the Content found in our Services or its usefulness for any particular purpose. And although we have the hardest-working, most talented techies in the business, The Motley Fool makes no promises that our content or any of the Services will be delivered to you on an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free basis. In fact, we're not making any promises or warranties except that we'll do our best to provide interesting and helpful information, education, and entertainment. Other than that, we reserve the right to be wrong, stupid, or even foolish (with a small \"f\").\nNow what does all this mean? It means that you agree that under no circumstances will The Motley Fool, its employees, or its agents be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or any other type of damages resulting from your use, purchase, or downloading of any material on our Websites, or arising from or related to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This includes, but is no way limited to, loss or injury caused in whole or in part by our negligence or by stuff beyond our control in creating or delivering any of our Services. This disclaimer of liability does not apply in New Jersey.\nThe Fool relies on various sources of information that we believe to be accurate and reliable. There are also literally thousands of contributors here -- most, we believe, with incredibly interesting and insightful information and opinions to share. But we can't and won't take responsibility for, or make any claims or representations about, the accuracy, completeness, or even the truth of every bit of data, information, and opinion provided through our Services. Remember: All information and content provided on or by The Motley Fool is to be used on an \"as is, with all faults, we're not perfect\" basis.\nObligatory Capitalized Disclaimers of Liability:\nEXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE WEBSITE AND PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONTAINED AND OFFERED ON THE WEBSITE ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d AND ON AN \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d BASIS. NEITHER THE MOTLEY FOOL NOR ANY OF OUR PARTNERS MAKES ANY WARRANTY THAT THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL THAT YOU PURCHASE OR OBTAIN FROM THE USE OF OUR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS OR THAT AND ANY ERRORS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED. NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR PARTNERS MAKES ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO OUR WEBSITES, ANY CONTENT, OR ANY OF OUR SERVICES, TOOLS, PRODUCTS, OR PROPERTIES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOU WILL ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THEIR CONTENT.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY AND THAT OF OUR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES DOES NOT APPLY IN NEW JERSEY.\nThat was tiresome, but important.\n12. Communication\nFederal or state law may require that we notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our websites or sending them to you via email (another reason to please keep your account settings current). If you do not provide us with accurate information, we cannot be held liable if we fail to notify you. You may request that we provide such notices to you in paper format by writing to General Counsel, The Motley Fool, LLC, 2000 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314.\n13. Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver\nIf a dispute arises in connection with your use of our Services or in relation to any of these Terms (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) our hope is that we can resolve the matter informally. Accordingly, in the event of a Dispute, we agree to first contact each other via email with a description of the Dispute and any proposed resolution. You will email [email protected] with your concern and The Motley Fool will contact you via the email address we have on file for you.\nIf a Dispute cannot be resolved informally, we each agree that except as provided below, the Dispute will be submitted to final and binding arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in a location convenient to you. Either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA\u2019s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. We will pay all of the filing costs, including arbitrator fees. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.\nEXCEPTIONS\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the following will not be subject to arbitration and may be adjudicated only in the state and federal courts of Virginia: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim related to or contesting the validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, or trade secrets; or (ii) an action by a party for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief. You may also file an individual action in a small claims court in lieu of arbitration.\nOPTING OUT\nYou will have thirty (30) days from the date you submit your personally identifiable information to opt out of this arbitration agreement. To opt out of arbitration, you must contact us at The Motley Fool, LLC, 2000 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314, Attention: Legal Department.

Your Agreement to These Terms\nYou acknowledge and agree that by agreeing to these Terms electronically you are expressly agreeing to the terms set forth herein. You acknowledge that your electronic submission constitutes your agreement and intent to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.\n15. Everything Else\nIf any provision in these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or nonsensical, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. This agreement is and always will be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia (except with respect to choice of law).You agree that the proper forum for any claim arising thereunder will be the U.S. Court for the Eastern District of Virginia or the appropriate Virginia court.\nOur Services are directed at a U.S. audience. We cannot warrant that the Services are appropriate for users outside the United States or that use of the Services is permitted under the laws of other jurisdictions. All personal data is maintained in the United States under the terms of our Privacy Policy, which is also incorporated by reference.\nExcept as otherwise expressly stated in these Terms and Conditions, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this agreement.\nThese Terms and Conditions, including those that are incorporated by reference, constitute the entire and only agreement between you and The Motley Fool and govern your use of our sites.\nLast Updated: November 17th, 2024\nhttps://www.fool.com/legal/stuff-we-own/"

You will be redirected momentarily\u2026\nFollowing a major tariff policy shift, a new AI Gold Rush is taking shape.\nIt\u2019s already being measured in trillions, and what we\u2019re witnessing could be a once-in-a-lifetime reshoring of America\u2019s tech infrastructure.\nBest of all: Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner is predicting there will be one stock that could be a clear winner.\nConsider this\u2026\nEarlier this year NVIDIA announced something unbelievably bold.\nEvery supercomputer would be built entirely in the USA - for the first time ever.\nThe total investment in America: $500 billion over four years.\nThat number should already have investors drooling with anticipation, but if you\u2019ve been paying attention, the story gets even better\u2026\nThat\u2019s because NVIDIA\u2019s announcement - while historic on its own - is just one of many dominoes we expect to fall in the near future.\n- Apple is furiously working to move production out of China, and recently announced $500 billion invested in the USA over the next four years.\n- And ChatGPT-creator OpenAI recently unveiled its \u2018Stargate\u2019 project that aims to invest $500 billion entirely in the United States in the next four years.\nAdd that up and it's already at $1.5 trillion.\nKeep in mind, NVIDIA was the first to act, announcing a bold $500 billion commitment to U.S. expansion almost immediately after the policy shift.\nSince then, we\u2019ve seen a growing wave of companies following in NVIDIA\u2019s gigantic footsteps\u2026 and all signs point to more on the way.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing is something that could be a once-in-a-lifetime reshoring of America\u2019s dominant technology companies.\nAll announced in what could be as short as a 90-day window. America\u2019s high-tech is now \u2018Made in the USA.\u2019\nHere\u2019s the best part: every media headline is focused on how bad tariffs are\u2026. And certainly, many companies will be losers.\nOnce again, we believe this is a once-in-a-lifetime shift happening rapidly before our eyes\u2026\nYet, almost no one is focusing on the fact that this multi-trillion dollar reshoring could mean potential MASSIVE gains for a small group of companies.\nThink of the companies that need to build trillions of dollars of factories, data centers, and other technology flooding back into America.\nLegendary investor and Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner just identified a small - less than 1/100th the size of NVIDIA - American company (headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut!) that does exactly this.\nIt specializes in the construction of massive technology projects and could soon become the \u2018story stock\u2019 of the potential Made in the USA boom.\nSo while some investors are content to sit and watch their net worth whittle away as tariff story after tariff story hits the news\u2026.\nWe believe we\u2019ve found something completely different.\nA stock that could become the next big winner of this possibly Made in the USA boom.\nBut \u2026. Tick, tick, tick\u2026 The clock is winding down. If you want to get invested before the next wave of technology companies announces their own Made in the USA plans\u2026\nYou need to consider acting now.

  "argos_summary": "ChargePoint reported Q2 2026 revenue of $99\u202fmillion, topping guidance and up 3% sequentially, while non\u2011GAAP gross margin rose to 33%, the highest since going public, aided by tariff mitigation. Cash on hand remained strong at $195\u202fmillion, with operating expenses up modestly due to R&D for new AC/DC product architecture. The company highlighted its expanding partnership with Eaton, new express DC and bidirectional home charging solutions, and a growing European footprint, while noting that the expiration of U.S. EV tax credits and 30C alternative fuel credits may delay future project timelines. Guidance for 2026 remains cautious, with revenue expected between $90\u2013$100\u202fmillion and a continued focus on reaching non\u2011GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven in the coming quarters.",
