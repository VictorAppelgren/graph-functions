  "description": "The crash happened on a Florida highway on Aug. 12.",
  "content": "The three victims of the Indian immigrant truck driver who made an illegal U-turn across a Florida highway earlier this month have been identified as Haitian immigrants, according to officials.\n\nThe driver Herby Dufresne, 30, and passengers Faniola Joseph, 27, and Rodrigue Dor, 53, all Haitian immigrants, were in their minivan when it plowed into the side of an 18-wheeler driven by Harjinder Singh, an immigrant from India, on Aug. 12, the Miami Herald reported.\n\nDufresne arrived in Miami in December 2023 from Port-au-Prince and was given a two-year permit to live and work in the US after obtaining a financial sponsor under a Biden-era program, the outlet reported, citing a friend of the victim.\n\nNo information was provided on Joseph and Dor\u2019s arrival or immigration status other than that they previously lived in Florida, the Miami Herald reported.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt the time of the fatal accident, all three men were on the way to Indiana, where Dor relocated after failing to secure work in Miami, a friend told the outlet.\n\nFootage from the driver\u2019s side of Singh\u2019s truck showed him making a wide U-turn on the Florida Turnpike \u2014 with the minivan plowing into its side and wedging itself partially underneath the tow bed. The 28-year-old barely reacts to the visibly devastating crash, video showed.\n\nSingh, an illegal migrant from India, came to the United States in 2018, failed English proficiency exams administered by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration after the April 12 crash.\n\nHe was able to accurately read only one of four signs he was presented during that test, Department of Transportation officials said.\n\nAfter being nearly deported in 2018, Singh was granted a work permit under the Biden administration in 2021.\n\nThe now-Florida inmate received his commercial driver\u2019s license in California in 2024 and received one in Washington in 2023, according to the DOT.\n\nCDL tests are only administered in English in California, while in Washington, they can be taken in English, Spanish, Russian, or Serbian-Croatian.",

      "text": "Judge awards family nearly $1B for botched delivery of baby at Utah hospital he blasted as \u2018most dangerous place on the planet\u2019\nA Utah judge awarded a family nearly $1 billion dollars \u2014 the largest in the state\u2019s history \u2014 after a hospital was so negligent in handling a baby girl\u2019s delivery that she will likely suffer a lifetime of disabilities, according to a report.\nAnyssa Zancanella, Danniel McMicheal, and their 5-year-old daughter Azaylee were awarded $951 million by Judge Patrick Corum earlier this month after he found Steward Health Care liable for the botched delivery of the newborn in West Valley City, Utah, on Oct. 14, 2019.\nThe nurses assigned to Zancanella at Jordan Valley Medical Center \u2014 then owned by Steward \u2014 were so green they\u2019d barely finished their training, and they gave the mom dangerous doses of a labor-inducing drug while the on-call doctor slept in a nearby room, the family\u2019s lawsuit filed in 2021 alleged.\nAzaylee wasn\u2019t delivered until more than a day later \u2014 and after a long-overdue C-section, the suit claimed.\nZancanella \u201cwould have been better off delivering this baby at the bathroom of a gas station, or in a hut somewhere in Africa, than in this hospital,\u201d Corum said in an early August ruling. \u201cLiterally, this was the most dangerous place on the planet for her to have given birth.\u201d\n\u201cThe person [Azaylee] was to be, the person she deserved to be, is trapped inside a brain-damaged child,\u201d Corum said. \u201cI cannot think of anything more profound, total or complete than that loss.\u201d\nThe astonishing damages award is the largest in Utah\u2019s history, the Salt Lake Tribune first reported, citing lawyers for the family.\nBut the family must now attempt to collect on their award from the embattled hospital chain, which is currently in bankruptcy as it owes billions to various creditors.\nZancanella\u2019s lawyers hope they will be able to collect at least the punitive damages against Steward \u2014 or half of the total award.\nZancanella and McMicheal had been on a short getaway in Salt Lake City away from their Wyoming home when the wife went into labor on Oct. 12, 2019, and was forced to deliver her girl at the local hospital, the suit said.\nBut the nurses, who\u2019d only finished their training the day Zancanella was admitted, pushed \u201cexcessive\u201d amounts of the labor-inducing drug Pitocin for hours \u2014 despite alarm bells like the baby\u2019s blood pressure rising and the fact that the drug wasn\u2019t working to dilate Zancanella, the suit alleged.\nWhen the nurses finally told the on-call doctor about the baby\u2019s alarming blood pressure and the mom\u2019s fever, the doctor simply went back to sleep in a room mere footsteps from where the labor was underway, the suit claimed.\nWhen Azaylee was delivered via C-section, she had a \u201cmisshapen head,\u201d a \u201cswollen\u201d face, and bruising and bulging on the front of her scalp, the suit claimed.\nThe baby had to be airlifted to Primary Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s intensive care unit in Salt Lake City for a slew of complications, including having been without sufficient oxygen during labor, the suit alleged.\nAzaylee now needs 24/7 care because of regular seizures.\nShe is mostly non-verbal and lacks the cognitive and executive functioning of others her age. Doctors think she\u2019ll never be able to carry out normal activities like driving a car, attending college, or working.\nAzaylee\u2019s seizures are so frequent that the family \u2014 including her younger sister \u2014 all sleep in a giant bed to be close in case one of the attacks happens while she\u2019s asleep. And they take oxygen with them everywhere they go to help with the seizures.\nThe parents say they plan to get Azaylee a service dog to help with seizure detection.\nThe young girl receives physical and occupational therapy and can only attend kindergarten for a few hours every day.\nAzaylee \u201chad her life stolen. We all did. We had her taken from us,\u201d Zancanella said during a three-day bench trial, according to Corum\u2019s ruling.\n\u201cShe is trapped. I know that my daughter is in there, but she can\u2019t come out and I think of that every day.\u201d\nSteward denied the allegations and any liability in May 2024 court papers but later that year its lawyers asked to withdraw from the case on the grounds they were no longer getting paid and were having trouble getting into contact with the company. The judge approved their withdrawal but the company never appointed new lawyers.\nThe hospital was renamed Holy Cross Hospital-West Valley after it was acquired by CommonSpirit Health two years ago.\nSteward, the nurses and the doctors involved didn\u2019t return requests for comment from the Tribune."

President Trump and I will restore safety to our roads,\u201d Duffy said.\nSingh was nearly deported in 2018 after he was detained crossing the border, but was released on $5,000 bond in January 2019 telling US Citizenship and Immigration Services that he feared returning to India, police sources previously told The Post.\nHe has been in immigration proceedings ever since.\nUnder the first Trump administration he was denied a work permit, but was granted one in 2021 under the Biden presidency \u2014 details which sparked a social media spat between California Gov. Gavin Newom\u2019s office and the Department of Homeland security.\nSingh received his Washington CDL in 2023, and his California license in 2024, the DOT said.\nHe was arrested in California Saturday by US Marshals on three counts of vehicular homicide."

I just missed it. I had like a dead look if you know what I mean. I\u2019m sure the guy was also acting in the moment of heat, in the moment of emotions.\u201d\nSzczerek, CEO of paving company Drogbruk, was allegedly caught on the live broadcast Thursday night apparently snatching the prized memento from young fan Brock\u2019s hands after Majchrzak, also Polish, appeared to be gifting it to the child while signing autographs courtside.\nThe businessman \u2013 who was seen placing the prized hat into his wife\u2019s bag as the devastated young fan protested \u2013 has since deactivated his social media accounts after the incident sparked widespread fury, Spanish outlet MARCA reported.\nSzczerek\u2019s countrymen swiftly blasted him on a Polish job search site as a \u201csack of garbage,\u201d \u201ccommon thief,\u201d \u201cprimitive scammer,\u201d and \u201cshameful jerk.\u201d\n\u201cOnly an ordinary idiot and a jerk could snatch a hat from a child\u2019s hands,\u201d wrote one Gowork.pl user. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy class,\u201d offered another critic.\n\u201cIf the company\u2019s president so unscrupulously stole a child\u2019s hat, if I were a customer, I would no longer use his services\u201d chime in another. \u201cI\u2019d be afraid he\u2019d steal from me too.\u201d\nThe millionaire has since attempted to make amends with the cheated fan and his family, according to Majchrzak.\n\u201cHe also wanted to make things right, so I gave him the credentials for Brock\u2019s mom on the same social media I was using to contact her,\u201d Majchrzak said.\n\u201cSo, maybe he can make things right himself.\u201d\nSzczerek \u2013 an amateur competitive tennis player in Poland \u2014 and was introduced to the sport by his racket-swinging wife Anna, according to Polish outlet Tenis Magazyn.\nFollow along for The Post\u2019s live coverage of the 2025 US Open\nAt their tony home in Kalisz, Poland, the Szcereks boast a private tennis court where they once hosted Polish legend Urszula Radwanska.\n\u201cIt was the most wonderful gift of my life. Our employees came up with the idea, and my husband helped them implement it,\u201d Anna Szcerek told the outlet, adding it was a her birthday gift.\nThe couple, who have two sons, also play competitive doubles tennis together \u2014 but Piotr Szczerek\u2019s prowess has propelled him to the second division of the Kalisz Tennis Association, the outlet reported.\nThe doting pair co-founded Drogbruck in 1999, and was described by the outlet as a leader in the industry.\nIn an interview, he noted that the paving industry was thriving in his country at the time, prompting him and his wife to establish a business in their hometown.\nThe company reportedly sponsors local sports programs and supports Polish tennis players, including Piotr Matuszewski.\nSzczerek could not be reached for comment, and emails sent to his company were not immediately returned.\nBut what began as an ugly incident ended on a brighter note for the slighted boy, when Majchrzak used the \u201cpower of the internet\u201d to track him down and gifted him a signed cap, along with other keepsakes.\nA video posted Saturday to Majchrzak\u2019s Instagram stories shows him reuniting with the overjoyed young fan, who he said was named Brock, and his family \u2013 showering him with gifts, snapping photos, and warmly chatting with them.\n\u201cToday after warm up I had a nice meeting,\u201d the tennis star wrote with a hands up emoji, followed by, \u201cDo you recognize?\u201d and a hat emoji.\nIn the clip, Brock beamed as he placed the hat on his head, proudly showing it off to what appeared to be his mother.\nMajchrzak then shared a photo of himself with the young boy, who was proudly wearing the prized possession.\n\u201cHello World, Together with Brock we wish you a great day!\u201d"
