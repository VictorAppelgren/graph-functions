  "content": "ST. LOUIS \u2014 Brendan Donovan had every intention of returning to the St. Louis Cardinals\u2019 lineup Monday. The team\u2019s lone All-Star had missed two games with nagging groin discomfort but was hopeful he\u2019d be available \u2014 even for one at-bat \u2014 in Monday\u2019s series opener against the Colorado Rockies.\n\nHe sure picked the right time.\n\nWith St. Louis trailing 2-1 in the bottom of the eighth, Cardinals manager Oli Marmol turned to Donovan to pinch hit for catcher Pedro Pag\u00e9s with two runners on and one out. The skipper was encouraged by Donovan\u2019s pregame work but did not make a final decision on his availability until just before first pitch. When Marmol saw his team in a prime scoring spot, he didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\nDonovan emerged from the dugout, worked a 1-2 count off Rockies reliever Juan Mejia, and then promptly drilled a two-run, go-ahead double to right field to give the Cardinals a 3-2 lead. Thanks to another stellar outing from Kyle Leahy \u2014 who posted 2 1/3 scoreless frames in relief of Miles Mikolas\u2019 quality start \u2014 that one-run lead held. St. Louis beat Colorado for its sixth win in its last 10 games and moved to just three games out of the final National League wild-card spot.\n\nNot too shabby for a team that traded its top three relievers and pledged its focus to the future less than two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cEven though we did sell at the deadline, you still don\u2019t lose belief,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cIf you lose belief, you have nothing. And I think that\u2019s one thing that this team has done a really good job of is responding. Very cool tonight to see that.\u201d\n\nAfter a dismal July that sank their chances of adding to the roster, the Cardinals have strung together wins despite a depleted bullpen and a limited bench. The team is without Nolan Arenado (shoulder strain) indefinitely and traded its closer, top setup man and a key left-handed reliever. It has also seen its roster jam to the point where its opening day starting catcher is seeing reps in left field. Maneuvering through the logistics of the roster has been complicated for Marmol, who must try to field his best nine each game while also finding sufficient playing time for a slew of players the front office is evaluating for next season and beyond.\n\nMarmol has had to change his managerial strategy to make this happen. His players have had to respond accordingly. Both have done so \u2014 and it\u2019s led to a surprising surge. Dating back to the deadline, the Cardinals have taken series victories over the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs. But Monday\u2019s win was arguably this month\u2019s most impressive yet, due to how the late innings were navigated.\n\nSt. Louis entered play knowing Donovan would only be available in a needed at-bat. Its bench became shorter when Lars Nootbaar departed in the top of the sixth with a left knee contusion, sustained after fouling a ball off his leg in the third. X-rays were negative for Nootbaar, who is considered day to day. Jordan Walker took over for Nootbaar in right field, leaving backup catcher Yohel Pozo and outfielder Garrett Hampson as the only two full-time replacements.\n\nThe bullpen wasn\u2019t much better. Both JoJo Romero and Riley O\u2019Brien were unavailable after their usage over the weekend, leaving Leahy as the highest-leverage reliever. St. Louis was aided immensely by Mikolas, who allowed two earned runs over 6 2/3 innings, to create an optimal lane for Leahy from the seventh inning.\n\nThat\u2019s where the coaching staff\u2019s navigation and the players\u2019 execution truly came into play.\n\nBefore the deadline, Marmol and pitching coach Dusty Blake had created consistent roles for their relievers. With Romero the only left-handed reliever on the roster, that can no longer be the case. Marmol also didn\u2019t want to use Donovan in the field Monday, and preferred to deploy him only for a pinch hit opportunity with the game on the line.\n\nThings changed quickly when the Cardinals started to rally. Leahy emerged from the seventh unscathed and followed up with a shutdown eighth inning, punctuated by back-to-back strikeouts to end the frame. Nolan Gorman worked a key one-out walk in the bottom half of the inning and advanced to second on Thomas Saggese\u2019s third hit of the night. This was when Marmol decided to empty his bench, knowing it would mean Donovan would need to play defense in the ninth.\n\nHampson pinch ran as the lead runner for Gorman, and Donovan took the at-bat for Pag\u00e9s, advancing to third on the throw home. When the Cardinals took a one-run lead, Marmol weighed the options in his bullpen, determined Leahy to be the best option (even though it would mean a third inning of work) and went for adding an insurance run over relying on defense, an uncharacteristic move. Marmol pinch hit Pozo for Victor Scott II, who roped a 105 mph liner right to third baseman Kyle Karros, who doubled off Donovan to end the inning.\n\nHampson took over for Scott in center field, Saggese moved to third base in lieu of Gorman, and Donovan took over second base for the ninth. Leahy pitched around a two-out single to secure his third win of the season. It was not how Marmol usually manages his one-run leads, but a different roster means different decisions.\n\n\u201cWe veered a little bit from what we\u2019ve done all year,\u201d Marmol said. \u201cWe take the lead there, we typically leave Scott in the game as our best defense. With no Romero and no O\u2019Brien, knowing Leahy is going to go back out in a one-run game, I\u2019m trying to add one more run, let Pozo take that at-bat and make it a two-run game.\n\n\u201cWe took our shot, and we\u2019re OK with Donovan playing defense if we can get the win. Glad it worked out that way.\u201d\n\nWhile asking a bullpen arm to log more than two innings can be a tall order, Marmol felt comfortable riding with Leahy, who has grown accustomed to longer relief outings.\n\n\u201cHe was efficient, he looked good and I trust him,\u201d Marmol said. \u201cEspecially in that moment, a one-run game, nothing\u2019s going to speed this kid up. We felt good with the other guys down with him being the guy to go back out and finish that game.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals feel good about a lot of things, and all things considered, they should. The expectations externally have been lowered, but internally, the daily grind remains the same. Much can happen within the final seven weeks of the regular season, and the Cardinals are in no way declaring themselves a playoff team. But they continue to play compelling baseball in what could have been a lost second half of the season.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of young guys in this locker room that have tremendous amounts of fight in them and tons of heart,\u201d Mikolas said. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up no matter what anyone else is going to throw our way. We have athletic guys making great plays, hitting, running the bases, having fun. And I think as long as we have fun, we\u2019re pretty dangerous.\u201d",

      "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 With two outs, two on and runners going on the pitch, Max Muncy\u2019s hard liner to right could have spelled trouble for the St. Louis Cardinals.\nClinging to a one-run lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the bottom of the ninth, the Cardinals turned to their vastly different bullpen to hold it. JoJo Romero, the lone left-handed reliever on the roster, drew an unfavorable hand: Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman were due to lead off the inning.\nAdvertisement\nIt marked just his second save opportunity of the year, but Romero didn\u2019t waver. After Ohtani hit a leadoff single, Romero retired Betts (thanks to a diving play by Lars Nootbaar), struck out Freeman and pitched around Will Smith, walking him to get to Muncy. Romero\u2019s 3-2 pitch left Muncy\u2019s bat at 99 mph, but Nootbaar took a few steps back, reached up and corralled the ball, capping off the play with a resounding fist bump.\nThere was plenty to like about Monday\u2019s 3-2 win. Sonny Gray shoved seven sparkling innings, allowing just one hit \u2014 a solo shot by Freeman in the fourth \u2014 with eight strikeouts over 90 pitches. A pair of solo homers by St. Louis (Masyn Winn in the second and Iv\u00e1n Herrera in the eighth) gave the Cardinals a fighting chance. When Los Angeles tied the game at two in the eighth, Yohel Pozo came through off the bench in the ninth, drilling a two-out, go-ahead single.\nPOZO IN THE 9TH! pic.twitter.com/2PCLv2jDQx\n\u2014 St. Louis Cardinals (@Cardinals) August 5, 2025\n\u201cI\u2019m always trying to do what the game is telling me to do,\u201d Pozo said. \u201cIn that situation, we just needed a hit. I saw the big hole between first and second, I was trying to hit the ball there. (Dodgers reliever Brock Stewart) threw me a cutter, gave me a chance to do it.\u201d\nMonday\u2019s victory over the reigning World Series champions was one of the Cardinals\u2019 best of the year, and is surely a welcome performance after a disappointing trade deadline. But when a season has taken a turn such as the Cardinals\u2019 has, wins and losses become secondary. The priority for the remainder of the year is the future \u2014 what Cardinals brass first intended at the end of the 2024 season. However, the organization\u2019s desire to attempt to compete simultaneously (and its inability to offload several veteran players over the offseason due to no-trade clauses) muddled the messaging.\nAdvertisement\nThere will be no mistaking what the rest of the season will look like. Manager Oli Marmol will spend each of the remaining 48 games trying to help answer what things will look like come 2026 and beyond.\nThis is not the same situation as the team\u2019s last selloff season, he insists. In 2023, the final two months consisted of the Cardinals simply trying to survive the remainder of the calendar. Many of the rostered players were not part of the team\u2019s future. At least this year, the roster reflects what the organization hopes will develop into a prominent core.\n\u201cThis lineup is what\u2019s next,\u201d Marmol said. \u201cSome of these guys in the \u2018pen, that\u2019s what\u2019s next. There is way more enthusiasm in a year like this compared to a 2023 standpoint because you\u2019re investing in what the future is going to look like. That wasn\u2019t the case last time.\u201d\nBut given the Cardinals\u2019 current roster construction, it\u2019s fair to question if the organization can accurately do that. Some players, like Brendan Donovan and Herrera, solidified themselves early on as everyday players. Alec Burleson, who entered play Monday with an .801 OPS and the second-most homers on the team (14), has emerged as another example. The players the front office identified as priorities before the season started \u2014 namely Jordan Walker and Nolan Gorman \u2014 have not taken advantage of their respective playing time opportunities. They will still need to see time on the field, but not at the expense of the players who have seized their runway.\n\u201c(People) are going to, every day, ask why one player is not (in the lineup), regardless of how I do it,\u201d Marmol said. \u201cBurleson has earned the right to be in there every day \u2014 and he\u2019s going to be. The other guys we\u2019ll have to find a rotation for.\u201d\nEasier said than done. The roster logjam is still an issue, even with Nolan Arenado on the 10-day injured list. Marmol would like for Gorman to take the bulk of the reps at third base in Arenado\u2019s absence, but \u201cthere has to be a real commitment to his objective and his mobility,\u201d he said. Gorman was not in Monday\u2019s starting lineup, but started at third base in each of the three previous games. The early returns were far from encouraging, with Gorman committing multiple costly misplays.\nAdvertisement\nBut there isn\u2019t anywhere else the Cardinals can play Gorman, as long as the future remains the focus. For Gorman to be a true impact player, he needs to have a position on the diamond. The organization\u2019s lack of positional flexibility is not unique to the active roster. It\u2019s an organization-wide issue that has trickled down into Triple A. St. Louis already has several offense-first, designated-hitter type of players, both at the major-league level and in the upper tier of their minor leagues. That\u2019s why the club first converted Burleson to a corner outfield spot, and why they are now trying the same with Herrera.\nThose decisions solved one problem only to create another. Walker\u2019s move to right field, combined with Nootbaar\u2019s need for a corner spot, makes four players for two roles. Nootbaar can play center, but not nearly to the defensive skillset of Victor Scott II, and the Cardinals are already subtracting plenty defensively with Gorman at third base and Herrera in left. If player development is the priority, Scott should remain the starting center fielder anyway, regardless of his .226 average and .629 OPS. The goal is to help Scott round into becoming the organization\u2019s next full-time center fielder, and that means riding out his struggles offensively.\nNOOOOOOOOOT SAVES THE GAME!#ForTheLou x @STIHLUSA pic.twitter.com/oyL6S1VwoO\n\u2014 St. Louis Cardinals (@Cardinals) August 5, 2025\nSo what are Marmol and his staff to do? The major-league coaches are stuck trying to find a solution to an unsolvable math problem. There are not enough spots in the starting lineup to guarantee everyday playing time to the players the front office wants to see. Sitting players like Burleson and Herrera, who have taken advantage of playing time and have turned in productive seasons, is out of the question \u2014 and doing so would send the wrong message to players looking to play their way into consideration next season.\nThe playing time rotation won\u2019t be perfect. Walker and Nootbaar should get four to five starts a week. Gorman has the potential to start every day, but only if his defense at third base improves. Herrera will be in the lineup every day, but he\u2019ll go between designated hitter and left field. Burleson can play either left or right field, and will DH on days Herrera doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s the only rotation that guarantees at least some sort of consistent playing schedule to every player identified as a priority.\nIt\u2019s a challenging ask, to say the least. Marmol understands the task and is hopeful the remaining eight weeks of the season will indeed lead to a jumpstart in planning for next year\u2019s team.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my job changes, because I\u2019ve had the same approach since the beginning of the season as to what we find important,\u201d Marmol said. \u201cWe won games along the way, but not at the expense of rotating guys, development, evaluating.\u201d\n\u201cWe gave guys opportunities and our staff is highly focused on growing these guys. That doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have different guys now and a younger group \u2026 but our objective overall, our goals as a staff, remain the same.\u201d\n(Photo of Burleson and Herrera: Harry How / Getty Images)"
