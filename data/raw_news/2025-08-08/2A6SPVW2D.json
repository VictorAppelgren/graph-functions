Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways\n\nThe world is coming to south Davis County this weekend.\n\nThe Bountiful Davis Art Center is hosting its 50th Summerfest arts celebration, a time for visitors to witness the dances, visual art creations and various crafts from folks from Mexico, Peru, China, India, the Pacific Island region and more.\n\nIt is also an opportunity for Utah\u2019s diverse population to create art.\n\n\u201cPeople forget that we\u2019re all creative. That\u2019s what makes us human,\u201d said Sarina Ehrgott, executive director of the Bountiful Davis Art Center. \u201cAnd there is enough culture here in the state of Utah that want to bring attention to that.\u201d\n\u2022 None When: Friday and Saturday, Aug. 8 and 9, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\u2022 None Cost: Entrance is free. Cost varies for food from Food League trucks and participation in some workshops.\n\nThe art center opened 51 years ago, and shortly thereafter, officials organized Summerfest as a way to learn, celebrate and share the art of different cultures. Folk groups have sung and danced. Hindi dance groups have wowed with their movements. Mexican visual artists have taught families how to create pi\u00f1atas.\n\nThis weekend, guests will see similar activities and performances, but in a different locale than in recent years. Bountiful City Park will host the 2025 Summerfest, the first time since before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn average \u2014 at any point during a Summerfest weekend \u2014 150 people could be seen watching performances, taking their children to the Art Yard, an area to create, or maybe eating food from different cultures due to the Food Truck League\u2019s participation in the event.\n\nThis year, Ehrgott anticipates 200 people will participate in a Summerfest program at any point in time, but in truth, the art center\u2019s focus is on getting more people connected to art and to different cultures, not on counting how many people are coming in and out of the event.\n\nThe event is free to allow everyone the opportunity to come and participate in the art celebration, Ehrgott said. Anyone can sit and watch a dance performance, and children are free to run around the Art Yard.\n\nAs Ehrgott, who is the only full-time employee at the center, says art is a human right, and as such it should be accessible to everyone.\n\nArt is also a perfect entryway into learning about different cultures, she said. Art can be what allows someone in Bountiful, who does not have a connection with anyone from a different culture, to ease their way into learning about a new heritage or background.\n\nIn other words, everyone \u2014 every culture \u2014 creates art, as Larry Fitzpatrick, a tech expert, wrote in BBN Times when highlighting tech culture and art.\n\nYou do not need to get on a plane to gain access to the human right of artistic expression, as Ehrgott said. This weekend, you can gain access to art right here in Bountiful.\n\n\u201cWe want people to know that you can be involved in art in many ways,\u201d Ehrgitt said. \u201cIt\u2019s about having a moment to yourself. It\u2019s about the process.\u201d\n\nTo see a schedule of Summerfest events and activities, visit www.bdac.org/summerfest.",
