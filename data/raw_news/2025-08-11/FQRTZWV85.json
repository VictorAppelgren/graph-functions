  "description": "Trump extends the deadline on China tariffs \u2014 but investors were unimpressed. They have been conditioned to expect such flip-flopping from Trump.",
  "content": "US President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference to discuss crime in Washington, DC, in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on August 11, 2025.\n\nThe heaviest of U.S. President Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs \u2014 a full 145% on imports of Chinese goods \u2014 was, once again, delayed for another 90 days.\n\nThe move should be a huge relief not just to investors, but perhaps most of the population on Earth. The U.S. and China are the two largest economies in the world, according to World Bank data, and a trade war in which imports of each other's goods double in price would probably stymie, if not cripple, the global economy.\n\nBut markets were mostly unmoved. Well, they did move \u2014 lower. The three big U.S. stock indexes retreated Monday as this outcome was more or less expected, since both sides had earlier telegraphed an extension of the tariff pause.\n\nInvestors could have also been conditioned to expect flip-flopping from Trump, such that threats, promises, criticisms and praises don't carry as much heft as they should anymore. On Monday, Trump said Intel's CEO Lip-Bu Tan's \"success and rise is an amazing story,\" after describing Tan as \"highly CONFLICTED\" the week before.\n\nThere's a Freudian idea in which an individual projects their thoughts and feelings to another person. Researchers are, well, conflicted, on the veracity of the phenomenon, but empirical observation suggests it's not uncommon.",

      "text": "A potential extension of a tariff pause between the United States and China will not be agreed to until President Donald Trump signs off on the plan, U.S. negotiators said Tuesday.\nTrump \"has final say on all the trade deals\" and the pending tariff truce, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC's Eamon Javers.\nThe remarks came after top trade officials for the two countries concluded talks in Stockholm, Sweden, their third round of high-level discussions since May.\n\"We're going to head back to Washington, D.C. We're going to talk to the president about whether that's something that he wants so do,\" U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told reporters following the talks.\nTrump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One around the same time, said he would get a briefing Wednesday on the status of the negotiations.\n\"I just had a phone call from Scott Bessent. They had a very good meeting with China, and it seems that they're going to brief me tomorrow,\" Trump said.\n\"We'll either approve it or not. But he felt very good about the meeting, better than he felt that he felt yesterday,\" he said.\nChinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang earlier said that the two sides agreed to continue to push for an extension of a 90-day pause on most of the U.S. \"reciprocal\" tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as most of Beijing's retaliatory measures.\nThat pause is currently set to expire Aug. 12.\nBessent told reporters after Tuesday's talks that if an extension is not reached by the deadline, then U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will shoot back up to their April levels.\n\"We call it boomeranging,\" Bessent said.\nHe said the trade teams will likely meet again in another 90 days.\nTrump on April 2 said he would impose a 34% blanket duty on Chinese goods as part of the sweeping global tariff rollout that he dubbed \"liberation day.\"\nA week later, he said he would hike the China tariffs to 125% \u2014 and that came on top of 20% fentanyl-related tariffs that Trump had previously imposed. China retaliated with its own steep tariffs on U.S. goods.\nBoth sides agreed to pause most of the tariffs in May, after their first trade meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.\nBessent gave a positive, but opaque, assessment of the latest talks. He said the two sides' positions are getting more \"refined\" and suggested that their discussions have led to an increase in mutual respect and understanding.\nBut he said that the U.S. is not pleased with China continuing to buy oil from Iran \u2013 even though Trump gave Beijing his blessing to do so last month.\nBessent also said that the negotiators did not discuss TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app whose fate in the U.S. has been in flux since the enactment of a law that would ban it unless it is sold.\n\"We are very careful to keep trade and national security separate,\" he said.\nTrade talks between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest trading nation's, are proceeding on a separate track from the rest of Trump's efforts to quickly reshape America's global trade relationships.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" earlier Tuesday that Trump's tariff rates for dozens of countries, which had been repeatedly paused, are set to restart Friday.\nBessent, asked by CNBC's Javers about that looming tariff deadline, suggested that it should not be a major concern because the affected countries can continue to negotiate with the U.S.\n\"I would think that it's not the end of the world if these snapback tariffs are on for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, as long as the countries are moving forward and trying to negotiate in good faith,\" he said."
