  "description": "In just over a week, the new iPhone 17 series will be unveiled. Here are the latest details of everything that\u2019s happening, how to watch the keynote, when to pre-order and more.",
  "content": "Updated Sept. 2 with more details and extra dates for your iPhone 17 release calendar.\n\nNow the calendar has rolled into September, at last it\u2019s possible to say it: the new iPhone is out this month. Here\u2019s everything you need to know, including details of the software that will be released at the same time as the hardware, or a little before.\n\nThe keynote is the next date to look forward to, and along with the date and time, you\u2019ll find details of how to watch it below. Then, how and when to pre-order, when to be ready to download the new iPhone software, and more.\n\nThe next special event is nearly here. It will, almost certainly, be a pre-recorded video introduced by CEO Tim Cook. And it will feature, indubitably, four new iPhones, at least two Apple Watches and perhaps new AirPods. The phones will be the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and a super-thin model possibly called iPhone 17 Air.\n\nIt will be screened in the 1,000-seater Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, to press and special guests.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t get your invitation (what an oversight!), don\u2019t worry, you can tune in to the simultaneous broadcast. Here\u2019s how.\n\nThe official YouTube livestream is here. Or go to the Apple TV app on your Apple TV, iPad, Mac or iPhone. Finally, go to apple.com/apple-events. Right now, this has a placeholder and you can add this to your calendar.\n\nThere will be plenty of press coverage on the same day, with press at the theater grabbing hands-on photos and video in the special area just outside the auditorium \u2014 it\u2019s an area that is tantalizingly hidden by huge metallic walls before the event, which slide back just before it ends.\n\nDate and time Tuesday, Sept. 9, 12 p.m. Pacific \u2014 to be confirmed\n\nThe last software release before the next iPhone OS is out will likely happen as soon as the keynote finishes, or at least at some point on the same day.\n\nDate and time Friday, Sept. 12, 5.am Pacific \u2014 to be confirmed\n\nThis will be announced at the keynote, but it\u2019s likely to be the same as last year, that is, early on the Friday after the unveiling.\n\nYou may be able to get in early by logging on to apple.com the night before and choosing the items you want, to place them in the shopping bag ready for Friday\u2019s pre-orders going live.\n\nThis is a simple way to get ahead of the line to ensure you can hone in on your chosen model, color and storage capacity. Apple doesn\u2019t always offer this, and there\u2019s not yet any indication of whether it will happen this time around. If it does, it\u2019ll be the evening of Thursday, Sept. 11.\n\nDate and time Monday, Sept. 15, 5.am Pacific \u2014 to be confirmed\n\nThis is the software that will work with the iPhone 17 series and all iPhones right back to iPhone 11, so if you want to try the new software on an older phone before deciding if you\u2019re going to buy a new one, this is the day.\n\nThe new software is in public beta right now, but will be available to all, likely on the Monday after the keynote. It seems to be in good shape now, so it could even come earlier.\n\nDate and time Friday, Sept. 19, 7.am local \u2014 to be confirmed\n\nWe\u2019ll know this information at the keynote, too, but it\u2019s always a Friday, and usually first thing, wherever you are.",

      "text": "Updated Sept. 1 with more details of what\u2019s reported about Apple Watch Ultra 3.\nA new Apple Watch Ultra is on its way, it seems, expected to launch on Tuesday, Sept. 9 alongside the iPhone 17 series. You can read a full run-down of what\u2019s coming when here. This is what\u2019s expected of the third iteration of Apple\u2019s chunkier, sportier smartwatch.\nApple Watch Ultra 3 At Last\nIn September 2024, alongside the Apple Watch Series 10, many expected Apple Watch Ultra 3 to be announced. Instead, the world was treated to Apple Watch Ultra 2 again, but in a new color. This led to the slightly confusing situation where Series 10 had a more powerful and more recent processor than the pricier Ultra 2. It\u2019s thought that some capabilities were about the same, so some Series 11 features also worked for the Ultra 2 (in both colors, of course).\nThis time, it seems, there\u2019ll be an all-new Ultra 3, with a tweaked design and display as well as a new chip.\nApple Watch Ultra 3 New Processor\nThe new chip will almost certainly be called S11. Reports suggest it may have similar performance to the S10 released last September in the Series 10 Apple Watch. If that sounds disappointing, remember that Apple has never released a chip that\u2019s not up to performing well. The new chip could be smaller, too, which leaves more space for other components \u2014 though there\u2019s no report that it will make for extra battery life. Still, since this is already two days, that might not be necessary.\nApple Watch Ultra 3 Display\nThe iOS 26 beta has code that hints the display will be better by about 12 pixels in each direction, which would make it the biggest Apple Watch display yet. This will most likely be achieved through thinner bezels rather than a changed case.\nIt will also likely adopt the superior screen tech that came to the Apple Watch Series 10. This meant that select watch faces, like Reflections, could update every second even in standby, meaning a sneaky glance down at your wrist during a dull meeting could tell you the time with to-the-second precision.\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 display was also brighter than the Ultra 2, so expect that benefit to apply for Ultra 3 as well.\nApple Watch Ultra 3 Blood Pressure Monitoring\nOther smartwatches have this, but Apple doesn\u2019t yet. It isn\u2019t a shoo-in this year, and if it does come, it will surely be in Series 11 as well. It\u2019s thought that instead of enabling users to take blood pressure readings, it will monitor in the background and alert if there\u2019s sign of high blood pressure \u2014 a bit like the heart rate monitoring does right now.\nApple Watch Ultra 3 Connectivity\nThis could be the first 5G Apple Watch, and it may have satellite connectivity, instead of limiting the cellular model to 4G, and it may have satellite connectivity. That\u2019s something Google just announced for the Pixel Watch 4, but this could go on sale before Google\u2019s timepiece. Satellite connectivity means that an emergency SOS feature could be enabled when you\u2019re out of cellular connectivity and possibly non-emergency messaging, too.\nThere will be more to learn when the keynote happens on Sept. 9, but these features are intriguing, at least."

      "text": "You may be thinking of a new iPhone 17 when it\u2019s launched next month \u2014 full details of the release schedule here \u2014 but you may also have heard that some prices are going up. The Labor Day sale at Amazon sees refurbished prices that are up to $726 less than you\u2019d have paid for a new handset this time last year (that\u2019s for the iPhone 15 Pro Max with 1TB of storage).\nThe deals highlighted in this post were independently selected by the Contributor and do not contain affiliate links.\nThe iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are both capable of running Apple Intelligence.\nYou can\u2019t buy the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max from Apple: the company has a policy that only the regular iPhone is carried over into the next year\u2019s range, not the Pro models. So, a refurbished model is what you\u2019ll need.\nRenewed Premium is the name for the top tier of refurbished models on Amazon and the quality is strictly managed.\nIn August 2024, the iPhone 15 Pro Max was the latest model and the 256GB storage model sold for $1,199. Right now, you can snap it up at Amazon for $779. It\u2019s unlocked, that is, it\u2019s not tied to any carrier.\nThat\u2019s $420 less than the original price new, and 5% off Amazon\u2019s average renewed premium price of $823.91.\nThat\u2019s the price for the blue titanium or natural titanium colors. Black titanium costs $789 and white titanium is $799.\nStep up to 512GB storage and the discount compared to the original new price ($1,399) is much steeper. You can buy the blue titanium finish, unlocked, for $829, which is $570 less than the new price and 7% less than Amazon\u2019s typical renewed premium price. All other colors are also available, but for $10 more: $839.\nFinally, the top storage level has the biggest discounts. The iPhone 15 Pro Max with 1TB of storage originally cost $1,599 new. It\u2019s now available, unlocked, in renewed premium condition for $872.42 in black titanium, which is $726.58 less, and 13% off Amazon\u2019s renewed premium list price of $999. You can also find it in the other three colors for a little more: $879."
