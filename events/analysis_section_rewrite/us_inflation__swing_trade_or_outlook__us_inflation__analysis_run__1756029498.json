      "feedback": "Your draft shows a solid, first-principles throughline and solid number anchoring, but it falls short of world-class rigor in structure, causal clarity, and tradable-outlook formatting. Actionable edits:\n\n- Lock the signal set into a clean, four-line, 3–6 month Swing-Trade framework: keep exactly four lines, two Up and two Down, each with the fields Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, and ensure probabilities are directly grounded in the cited material (drawn from the cited IDs) rather than “felt” from the narrative. Remove the long, unstructured macro narrative from inside the signal lines and relocate only the minimal catalysts and watchpoints into these four lines. Correct any typos in IDs (e.g., ILYC1M41F looks like a formatting error) and ensure every fact that could be contested has a matching ID.\n- Add a dedicated, explicit Trade/Outlook Plan as required: if a tradable asset can be tied to the thesis (e.g., IBM, MSFT, SHOP, or a liquid equity/commodity/FX proxy mentioned in the material), present a Swing Trade line: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %. If no single tradable asset fits, produce a concise Outlook line: Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %. Right now the draft lacks this standalone plan; supply at least a one-line Outlook or a tradable Swing Trade line anchored to specific, observable price levels and a trigger from the material (e.g., AI-capex prints, Azure growth, private-market deal cadence).\n- Strengthen first-principles grounding and the causal map: explicitly connect the four signals to a simple fundamental model (cloud/AI diffusion drives recurring-revenue cash flow; labor productivity and disciplined cost control sustain margins; macro risk premia reprice cash-generative franchises). For each line, show the causal link from the driver to a plausible, observable market manifestation (e.g., multiple expansion, earnings visibility, cash generation) and tie the catalyst to a concrete near-term trigger (e.g., cloud spend 2.4T by 2030; Pacaso expands to 10 destinations; HeartSciences Medicare/FDA milestones).\n- Tighten quantification and avoid generic platitudes: replace broad claims like “durable growth environment” with explicit numbers from sources (e.g., cloud spend: 2.4T by 2030; Azure growth 39% YoY; top destinations ~21% growth; 10 destinations; 8–12% cash-on-cash; 18.8% IRR; 1–1.5% productivity uplift). Present a compact sensitivity or range per line where feasible (e.g., probability bands or PnL impact ranges) and explicitly show the sources in-line next to the numbers.\n- Sharpen citation discipline and reconcile conflicts: ensure citations appear only for asserted facts/numbers and remove any overcitation; verify all critical sources are represented (0G3A676BP, 4LQD15CFU, UPV3X2MQ6, FOM34PUWA, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX, A7VLN74BK, TN66GHPAT, ILYC1M41F, etc.) and resolve conflicts (e.g., defunct 2014 AUVSI forecast vs 2025 UAS labor data) by flagging as caveats rather than mixing them into the core signal. Fix any typographical or formatting issues in IDs.\n- Remove or relocate near-term 0–3 week materials: keep them out of the 3–6 month signal sheet or move to an Annex; the SECTION FOCUS requires a clean 3–6 month Swing/Outlook view with testable catalysts and invalidations, not a broad, multi-horizon narrative.\n- Streamline the final deliverable: present four crisp Up/Down lines as required, a single concise 1-line Outlook or a tightly defined Swing Trade if you identify a liquid tradable asset, and keep the prose to the minimal, action-ready content. End-to-end alignment with horizon/style, first-principles rationale, quantification, and disciplined sourcing will elevate it to world-class level.",
