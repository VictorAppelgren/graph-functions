  "title": "OURA Reveals Cutting-Edge New Health Features For Oura Ring",
  "description": "The smart ring maker just announced serious new features with pregnancy insights and a menopause tool to offer support to women\u2019s health.",
  "content": "The Oura smart ring can tell you how well you\u2019ve slept, whether you\u2019re about to come down with a cold and how ready you are for the day ahead. On Aug. 12, the company announced two new initiatives addressing women\u2019s health.\n\nThe new features are designed to \u201csupport women through key life stages,\u201d the company said. There are two new areas of interest, pregnancy and perimenopause.\n\nFirst is a \u201cnext-generation\u201d Pregnancy insights, which analyzes common patterns of pregnancy and has new capabilities.\n\nIt now has continuous tracking of physiological changes during pregnancy, educational content and tools women can use each day to interpret phases of pregnancy.\n\nThese new features include gestational age tracking. With trimester rings and weekly insights. New members can enter a calibration state of seven to 15 days before they see Pregnancy Trends.\n\nThere\u2019s an all-new view called Trend to help visualize key biometrics such as temperature trends, heart rate variability and more.\n\nUsers can tag symptoms, as well as emotions they\u2019re feeling, for instance, in Keeping Track. This ties in to an expanded library of pregnancy-specific symptom tags. There\u2019s also educational content integrated into the app.\n\nOther updates include a pregnancy-aware Oura advisor, cycle insights and biometrics from resting heart rate to heart rate variability which are used to provide insights for pregnant women.\n\nThe second feature \u201cempowers members to track symptoms, understand their impact, and secure care with greater confidence through a combination of structured self-assessment, health data visualisation,\u201d Oura says.\n\nInsights follow a 12-question survey which leads to a personalized assessment and a PDF report that summarizes symptoms, cycle data and biometric trends. This can easily be shared with healthcare providers. And there\u2019s a suitable educational content hub to go with it.\n\nThe Pregnancy Insights roll out from Aug.12 on iOS and Android. Perimenopause Check-In is available from Aug. 13 on iOS and Android, for U.S. users only at first.\n\nThese new features are typical of Oura, which has consistently added new elements with insights built on software, rather than new hardware.",

      "text": "Updated Aug. 11 with further details, including a new price prediction and further details of screen sizes.\nOn Sept. 9, Apple will reveal its new iPhones, it\u2019s thought (full schedule here). The most expensive models will be the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max (and at least one of them will have a price rise, it\u2019s thought).\nOver the months, rumors have come and gone, gained credibility with corroboration from multiple sources, or been utterly discredited. Here\u2019s the latest intel on what\u2019s coming.\niPhone 17 Pro And 17 Pro Max Big Design Changes\nThe big change will come on the back of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, with the squarish camera panel replaced with one that stretches the full width of the phone. This may be accompanied by camera improvements though it\u2019s likely these could have been achieved with the old design.\nA smaller but noticeable knock-on effect for this looks like being a repositioning of the Apple logo on the phone\u2019s rear (full details here).\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is rumored to be thicker than ever, which may mean an increased battery size which may mean longer battery life (hurrah).\nThere are also reports that this year\u2019s Pro and Pro Max will change the material finish, switching from titanium to aluminum \u2014 titanium may be reserved for the iPhone 17 Air, which if its predicted 5.5mm thickness is correct, would need the extra strength titanium can bring.\niPhone 17 Pro And 17 Pro Max Display\nThe look is also changing in another way, with an anti-reflective display: read this for full details.\nAn upgrade to the display makes sense as, rumors suggest, this may be the year the regular iPhone switches from a 60Hz to 120Hz refresh rate, making for a smoother look.\nPotentially it also means the iPhone 17 could have ProMotion, though reports are divided on this, with others saying that this feature will continue to be the preserve of the Pro models, and possibly the new iPhone 17 Air. ProMotion, among other things, allows the always-on display on the iPhone 16 Pro, for instance.\nBut a new post on X from leaker Majin Bu shows the four different screen sizes we can expect across the range. The iPhone 17 Air will have a slightly larger display than the iPhone 17 Pro, sitting between the Pro and the Pro Max. If size is what counts for you, but the Pro Max is that bit too big, the iPhone 17 Air could be the one for you. More details here.\nThis means that every phone will have a different sized screen: for the iPhone 15 series, the 15 and 15 Pro had identical-sized displays, as did the 15 Plus and 15 Pro Max. Now, it seems, there will be four display sizes to choose from. Like last year, but this year with slightly different sizes.\niPhone 17 Pro And 17 Pro Max New Colors\nThere will be either four or five colors for the Pro and Pro Max. I believe four is most likely, like the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. These will be black, white, dark blue and the most controversial rumor: a bright orange. I suspect this will be a more muted color like copper, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe new colors may in part be inspired by the switch to aluminum \u2014 look how vibrant the iPhone 16 colors are right now.\niPhone 17 Pro And 17 Pro Max Cameras\nAll three rear cameras will be 48-megapixel resolution, it\u2019s predicted, for the first time. In other words, the telephoto will join the main and ultra wide cameras with sensors this detailed.\niPhone 17 Pro And 17 Pro Max Processor\nIt seems the A19 Pro is the chip that\u2019s coming \u2014 since the current models have the A18 Pro, this is hardly a surprise. It\u2019ll be faster, of course, and may lead to greater efficiencies for longer battery life. Alternatively, that extra efficiency could be spent on new features which use more power.\nThe same processor could appear in the iPhone 17 Air, though it\u2019s likely to be downgraded by the omission of one GPU, for instance. And iPhone 17 is likely to have A19, but not Pro.\niPhone 17 Pro Price\nIt looks like the prices will go up by $50 on each model, meaning the 17 Pro will start at $1,049, for instance, though it\u2019s not clear if the changing world of tariff exemptions will affect this.\nThe first hints of the price increase came from Edison Lee, an analyst at Jeffries, and claimed to affect the Pro and Pro Max. A further report claimed that the price increase would be accompanied, in the case of the iPhone 17 Pro, by an increase in storage in the base configuration, that is, up from 128GB to 256GB \u2014 which might at least soften the blow from the price increase.\nNow, Jeff Pu, analyst at GF Securities, has said there will \u201clikely\u201d be price increases, attributing the extra cost to tariffs on countries like China and India. However, it\u2019s thought that the iPhones coming from India may not be subject to tariffs. And Tim Cook recently said that the majority of iPhones imported to the U.S. currently come from India.\nDoes this mean price rises will be lower or could it be that the price increase is as low as $50 because of more favorable import conditions from India? Time will tell.\niPhone 17 Pro And 17 Pro Max Release Date\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max look set to go on sale on Friday, Sept. 19. The timing will be early morning, usually 7 a.m. in your time zone \u2014 so Australians and New Zealanders are usually among the very first to see the new phones.\nWhile there\u2019s still a possibility that one or other of the phones could be announced but not released until later \u2014 this happened to the iPhone 12 Pro Max which followed weeks after the iPhone 12 Pro. I don\u2019t think this will be the case this year."

      "text": "Updated Aug. 9 with more details of exactly what\u2019s coming and when plus further analysis and timing details.\nIn September, Apple will launch the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and an all-new model that\u2019s especially slim and is nicknamed iPhone 17 Air. Here\u2019s everything that will happen between now and the day you can buy one, down to the minute, including when pre-orders will open, how you may be able to jump to the head of that line, and when to expect reviews of the phones to appear.\nAnd remember, everything here applies to Apple Watch as well, as the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 (with a bigger-than-ever display) are also predicted to appear, possibly alongside Apple Watch SE 3rd generation and Apple AirPods Pro 3.\niPhone 17: Keynote Announcement\nThe keynote is when Apple will reveal its new handsets (plus new Apple Watch models, including an Apple Watch Ultra 3 which may have the biggest display yet). I believe it will be announced at around 8 a.m. Pacific on Tuesday, Aug. 26. You can read full details of the announcement and how it will happen here.\niPhone 17: Keynote at 10 a.m. Tuesday, Sept. 9\nOnce the keynote has been announced, around two weeks will pass until it takes place. Unless there\u2019s a major surprise, it will be in the 1,000-seater Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park, the company\u2019s Cupertino headquarters.\nIt will start at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, 6 p.m. U.K. time.\nAs for the date, that\u2019s looking increasingly likely to be the date I predicted in July: Tuesday, Sept. 9 \u2014 a recent leak based on data from internal documents from one or more German carriers points to the same date. That said, things can still change, so the Monday or Wednesday of that week are still possible.\nMuch less likely is an event in the week before: Labor Day would push the event to the Wednesday instead of the Tuesday events Apple likes best and it would clash with the Berlin tech show IFA, so many favored press would be in the wrong country.\nMore voices have been heard on the date of the keynote. Regular leaker Instant Digital has said on Weibo, \u201ciPhone 17 released on Sept.9,\u201d though according to your machine translation, this could include the words \u201cmay be released,\u201d which isn\u2019t quite as certain.\nDavid Snelling, highly respected Technology Editor of the U.K. newspaper the Daily Express, has said, \u201cApple never reveals anything until closer to the launch date but Express.co.uk has done some detective work and we think all will be unveiled on Tuesday, September 9,\u201d which is more positive.\nThere is a cautionary note, however: \u201cOf course, we could be completely wrong as Apple likes surprises, but that date seems the most likely,\u201d and while that\u2019s right, I\u2019m sure there are no surprises coming in terms of the date.\nThere are plenty more articles online which bet on Sept. 9, but please note that almost all of them are based on the same rumor based on alleged German carrier data mentioned above. In other words, though there has been plenty more coverage of this date, most leads back to the same source.\nWhat you\u2019re reading here is not based on that report.\nBy 12 noon Pacific the keynote will be over and we\u2019ll know all the new iPhones by name, and have access to all their secrets, including pricing.\nIf by any chance it\u2019s on another date in the same week, then all the other parts of the jigsaw remain in place, such as release date, reviews appearing and, our next topic: when pre-orders open.\niPhone 17: Pre-Orders Friday, Sept. 12\nThe date for pre-orders opening is routinely the Friday following the keynote, so even if the announcement falls one day earlier or later, pre-orders will be on Friday, Sept. 12. The time, if it\u2019s the same as last year, will be 5 a.m. Pacific, 8 a.m. Eastern, 1 p.m. U.K.\nSometimes Apple lets customers get ahead of the curve by choosing their preferred phone (model, color and storage level) the night before and put them in their shopping bag ready for pre-orders to open the following day.\nNote also that it\u2019s possible that not all phones will be released on the same day, even though they\u2019ll be announced together. This has happened in the past when there have been new categories, for instance.\nThis includes 2018 when the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max went on sale on one day, but the iPhone XR was held back \u2014 it came in five colors and introduced Liquid Retina Display, an LCD screen which appeared to have curved corners. Similarly, the first smaller-screened iPhone with Face ID, the iPhone 12 mini, landed around three weeks after the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro. The iPhone 12 Pro Max also arrived with the iPhone 12 mini. But all iPhone 12 models were announced on the same day.\niPhone 17: Reviews\nReviews from selected press will be under embargo until one day in the run-up to release. For the iPhone, this will likely be Tuesday, Sept. 16 or Wednesday, Sept. 17.\nThe timing can change but the embargo lift is often at 6 a.m. Pacific, 9 a.m. Eastern, 2 p.m. U.K.\niPhone 17: Release Date Friday, Sept.19\nThis is customarily the Friday in the week following the keynote, and will be in the morning. Usually, this is 7 a.m. local time."
