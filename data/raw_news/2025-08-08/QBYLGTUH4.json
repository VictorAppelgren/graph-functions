  "description": "Digital Realty Trust has lagged behind the broader market, yet analysts remain optimistic about the stock\u2019s longer-term prospects.",
  "content": "Austin, Texas-based Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR) brings companies and data together by delivering the full spectrum of data center, colocation, and interconnection solutions. With a market cap of $57.8 billion, Digital Realty engages in the ownership, acquisition, repositioning, and management of technology-related real estate.\n\nThe real estate giant has lagged behind the border market over the past year. Over the past 52 weeks, DLR stock has gained 16.4%, underperforming the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 21.9% surge. On a YTD basis, DLR is down 3.4% compared to the SPX\u2019s 7.8% returns during the same time frame.\n\u2022 Cathie Wood Is Buying Shares of This Little-Known Ethereum Treasury Company. Should You?\n\u2022 Robinhood Stock Seemingly Can\u2019t Be Stopped in 2025. Is It Too Late to Buy HOOD Here?\n\u2022 Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nZooming in further, DLR has also lagged behind the iShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF\u2019s (IDGT) 19.1% gains over the past 52 weeks and 4.5% returns on a YTD basis.\n\nDigital Realty Trust\u2019s stock prices dipped 1.2% in the trading session following the release of its mixed Q2 results on Jul. 24. The company reported a solid 10.1% year-over-year growth in total operating revenues to $1.5 billion, surpassing the Street\u2019s expectations by a notable 3.5%. Furthermore, its core funds from operations (CFFO) surged 19.5% year-over-year to $643.3 million, and its CFFO per share of $1.87 beat the consensus estimates by 7.5%. However, the company reported a notable drop in backlogs. At the end of the quarter, its backlogs stood at $826 million, down from $919 million reported in Q1 2025, making investors jittery.\n\nFor the full fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts expect DLR to deliver a CFFO per share of $7.20, up 7.3% year-over-year. The company has a solid CFFO surprise history. It has surpassed the Street\u2019s CFFO estimates in each of the past four quarters.\n\nThe stock has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating overall. Of the 28 analysts covering the DLR stock, opinions include 18 \u201cStrong Buys,\u201d two \u201cModerate Buys,\u201d seven \u201cHolds,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is slightly less optimistic than a month ago, when 19 analysts gave \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendations.\n\nOn Jul. 30, Truist Securities analyst Anthony Hau maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on DLR and raised the price target from $184 to $199.",
