      "text": "Unveiled Wednesday (April 30) at the company\u2019s Global Product Drop, the Visa Intelligent Commerce program opens the network\u2019s rails to developers building AI agents that search, recommend and now pay on behalf of consumers.\nThe stakes are considerable. Generative AI (GenAI) platforms are influencing what people buy. The missing link is a payment mechanism that is both invisible to consumers and accepted, quite literally, by merchants.\n\u201cThis is going to transform shopping and buying \u2014 we\u2019re letting AI developers and engineers use the Visa network to allow AI agents to find, and buy, on [the consumer\u2019s] behalf in a seamless and safe way,\u201d Mark Nelsen, Visa\u2019s global head of consumer products, told PYMNTS\u2019 Karen Webster on the eve of the announcement.\nAt the center of the effort is an AI-ready card, a credential developers can spin up through a bundle of Visa application programming interfaces (APIs). As Nelsen put it: \u201cThe APIs will have an AI-ready card. In a hypothetical search for the cheapest flight to Canc\u00fan, for example, a traveler uploads an existing Visa credential, while in the background Visa authenticates the cardholder with payment passkeys, tokenizes the 16-digit number and seats the token inside the AI agent.\u201d\nThat behind-the-scenes swap shields account data, eliminating the clunky step of keying in card numbers every time the agent hops to a new site.\nIt also takes card-on-file commerce to an entirely new, contextually powered ecosystem, allowing consumers to leave their physical and digital wallets at home.\nFive Building Blocks\nNelsen walked through an inventory of five modules that developers can cherry-pick or adopt wholesale. Modules, he said, are built on three decades of Visa\u2019s work in using AI to fight fraud. Visa says its AI engines blocked roughly $40 billion in fraud last year. Visa Intelligent Commerce imports the same models into agent-driven transactions.\n- Authentication: Confirms the AI agent is authorized to act for a specific consumer, extending identity verification to AI commerce.\n- Tokenization: Replaces card data with network tokens that work anywhere Visa is accepted while keeping sensitive details under wraps.\n- Payment Instructions: Lets the user preset dollar limits, merchant categories or real-time approval prompts \u2014 guardrails that load directly into VisaNet.\n- Personalization: With the shopper\u2019s consent, the module shares basic spend patterns so the agent can rank offers by preferred airline, hotel-price comfort zone or dining habits.\n- Signals: Streams transaction signals back to Visa in real time to trigger risk controls and aid dispute resolution.\nNelsen emphasized that, together, the tools aim to make AI-powered buying as routine and secure as tapping a phone at checkout.\nPersonalization Power\nBut here\u2019s where it can get interesting and where AI agents and AI cards can simplify the complexity of shopping.\nGenAI chatbots can already present a short list of hiking boots or boutique hotels. What they can\u2019t yet do is close the sale without punting the consumer to a checkout page. Or in the case of a complex search that asks for the most stylish hiking boots for the summer trip to Cinque Terre, and what restaurants are best to watch the sunset, there are multiple searches, steps and a big gap from information and intent to purchase. That gap, Nelsen argued, is where cart abandonment and lost revenue lurk.\n\u201cWe ask the consumer \u2026 whether they would like to share information around their spend behavior with the agent so that it knows their preferences, such as the airline you prefer and the typical amount of money that you spend on hotels. \u2018Where do you like to go for dinner?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s personalization.\u201d\nOnce a shopper sets, for instance, a $500 ceiling for a hotel or an airline ticket, the AI agent scours sites, picks seats or rooms and pays, constrained by the limits embedded in the token created by the AI card.\n\u201c[Visa] verifies your instruction,\u201d Nelsen said, \u201cand loads that instruction into VisaNet, and the agent will work on their behalf. \u2026 If everything matches, we\u2019ll send the transaction to the issuing bank to be approved.\u201d\nNelsen said that a consumer has all the security, control and protections in place that come with using their Visa card, even though it is the AI agent that is \u201cmaking\u201d the transaction.\nThe same tokenization that reassures consumers also signals to merchants that the purchase request is legitimate, not a bot fraudster. Users can require the AI agent to ping them for approval above a certain spend, or to pause before purchasing from unfamiliar sellers.\nSpeed to Market\nUnlike fledgling AI startups, Visa doesn\u2019t have to lay new rails. Its tokenization framework already covers more than 200 countries and territories, and the Intelligent Commerce APIs are live now for partners ranging from Anthropic and OpenAI to Microsoft, Samsung and Stripe. \u201cAny Visa credential can work,\u201d Nelsen said, because the underlying technology has been field-tested for years.\nThat global footprint means an AI agent could book a table at an impossible-to-get-into Manhattan restaurant \u2014 or a last-minute villa on Italy\u2019s Lake Como \u2014 without exposing card data or tripping fraud filters.\nMerchants, bruised by fraud losses and rising customer-acquisition costs, want conversions. Consumer want friction-free checkout. And regulators want proof that AI won\u2019t introduce new risk. Visa\u2019s bet is that sliding its fraud models and dispute-resolution tools under the hood will let all three constituencies adopt AI commerce faster.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only safe for the consumers,\u201d Nelsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s safe for the whole ecosystem, for the banks and the merchants as well. We\u2019re excited about what the program will enable.\u201d And, he added, \u201csearch used to be simple, and then it got complicated \u2014 now we can make it personalized and simple at the same time.\u201d\nVisa isn\u2019t predicting how quickly consumers will surrender purchase decisions to software agents, but it is positioning itself as the payments backbone when they do. By turning card numbers into tokens, layering on spend controls and piping in real-time fraud defenses, Intelligent Commerce tries to ensure the AI agent economy is born with same adult-grade security that exists in the digital and mobile ecosystems today.\nDevelopers can start coding today. Pilots are expected to surface in the coming months. If the model sticks, shopping bots could soon move from novelty to necessity, with Visa swiping the AI-powered card."

      "text": "The new offering, announced Tuesday (April 29), introduces Mastercard\u2019s Agentic Tokens, which the company said builds upon tokenization capabilities that power global commerce solutions like mobile contactless payments, along with programmable payments such as recurring expenses and subscriptions.\n\u201cThis helps unlock an agentic commerce future where consumers and businesses can transact with trust, security, and control,\u201d the company said in a news release. \u201cMastercard Agent Pay will enhance generative AI conversations for people and businesses alike by integrating trusted, seamless payments experiences into the tailored recommendations and insights already provided on conversational platforms.\u201d\nThat means, the company said, that someone planning a party could chat with an AI agent to curate outfits and accessories or plan a venue. The agent can then make purchases based on that customer\u2019s preferences and feedback, while also recommending the best way to pay.\nAccording to the release, Mastercard plans to collaborate with a number of tech companies on the program: Microsoft on new use cases to scale agentic commerce, IBM to accelerate B2B use cases and companies like Braintree and Checkout.com to enhance tokenization capabilities already in use.\n\u201cThe launch of Mastercard Agent Pay marks our initial steps in redefining commerce in the AI era, including new merchant interfaces to distinguish trusted agents from bad actors using agentic technology,\u201d said Jorn Lambert, Mastercard\u2019s chief product officer.\n\u201cRecognizing the seismic implications of this evolution, we are keen to collaborate with industry players to advance the standards for agentic payments, such as applying the Model Context Protocol to Secure Remote Commerce,\u201d he added. \u201cThis lays the foundation for scale and builds trust in agentic commerce.\u201d\nIn other agentic AI news, PYMNTS explored the technology\u2019s use in things like loan underwriting, fraud detection and cross-border payments in a recent interview with TerraPay Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Ram Sundaram.\nHe noted that while automated decision making and streamlined processes will continue to transform global money movement, there\u2019s still a need for have some human interaction.\n\u201cObviously, in the best-case scenario, everything goes smoothly, but when things are not going smoothly, that\u2019s when the customer queries come in,\u201d Sundaram said.\nIt\u2019s not always easy to immediately determine where a transaction is, as company analysts and representatives have to examine logs and query partner systems.\n\u201cA lot of that work is done manually,\u201d Sundaram said, adding that the agents \u201cknow the corridors and the markets that they are working in, but it still takes some time.\u201d"

      "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s almost a reimagining of the internet going on right now,\u201d Visa Senior Vice President and Global Head of Growth Rubail Birwadker told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. For the past 30 years, eCommerce has been about keeping bad bots out. The fraudsters, scrapers and hostile traffic. Now, the challenge is flipped. The bots showing up represent consumers and real intent to buy.\nVisa\u2019s answer is to give developers the connective tissue to work with these new agents instead of blocking them.\nOpening the MCP Server\nVisa announced Thursday (Sept. 4) it will open access to its production Model Context Protocol (MCP) server so developers can plug artificial intelligence (AI) agents directly into Visa Intelligent Commerce application programming interfaces (APIs). The company is also piloting an Acceptance Agent Toolkit that lets nontechnical teams generate invoices, create payment links and run analytics using plain prompts.\nThe goal is to compress the path from idea to functioning, payment-enabled agent while keeping every transaction tied to Visa\u2019s security framework.\n\u201cIf this works really well for just 5% or 10% of consumer experiences, that\u2019s not the bar,\u201d Birwadker said. \u201cIt needs to work for nearly all consumer experiences, the way Visa\u2019s card experience works everywhere.\u201d\nWhy Developers Matter\nBirwadker described the MCP server as a secure integration layer that standardizes how agents and large language models interact with Visa\u2019s services. Starting with Visa Intelligent Commerce and extending across more APIs, it reduces weeks of custom development to hours, he said.\nOn top of that sits the Acceptance Agent Toolkit, which lets business teams trigger prebuilt workflows like invoices or ad hoc revenue summaries with plain commands inside chat.\n\u201cThe goal is to extend the trust of the Visa brand into the future of agentic commerce,\u201d Birwadker said. \u201cAn MCP layer removes friction for developers and drives standardization at scale.\u201d\nVisa has been testing MCP internally and with partners since the spring launch of Visa Intelligent Commerce. Now, the company wants to \u201cextend the edges of our network to make it even easier for agents and other companies to build on.\u201d\nBirwadker expects access layers like MCP to become \u201ca relatively important tool\u201d because websites today or even developer docs \u201cwere not really designed with agents in mind.\u201d\nMCP lets developers \u201cbuild once, reuse everywhere,\u201d making agent behaviors portable across markets and use cases. He said that teams are already testing real checkout flows: how fast transactions complete, how multi-merchant purchases work, and how to keep legitimate agent traffic from being misclassified as bots.\n\u201cThis all works,\u201d Birwadker said. \u201cWe just need to work the kinks out,\u201d given the abstraction and automation unique to agent-led buying.\nMerchant On-Ramps\nFor merchants, the Acceptance Agent Toolkit provides on-ramps that do not require code. A simple command such as \u201cCreate an invoice for $100 for John Doe, due Friday\u201d returns a secure payment link. Asking \u201cSummarize today\u2019s revenue in New York State\u201d retrieves permitted transaction data.\nThe aim is to give Visa Acceptance customers fast, practical wins on repetitive tasks that make agentic commerce real and scalable.\nBirwadker sees three merchant camps forming as agentic AI\u2019s relatively short life has already shifted from curiosity to the reality that this new channel is how their customers want to discover products and pay for them.\nSome embrace it as a new channel for discovery and sales, eager to be found inside agent experiences. Established retailers are rethinking acquisition economics as agent channels capture more traffic and traditional strategies are no longer effective. A cautious group focuses on protecting margins and controlling fraud.\nDespite their differences, Birwadker said, \u201cthe consensus is that agentic commerce is not a trend \u2026 it\u2019s a new paradigm.\u201d\nEven right away. Several large retailers are already exploring pilots during the holiday peak. \u201cYes, a number of large retailers are,\u201d Birwadker confirmed. \u201cWe\u2019re working through it.\u201d\nBuilding Trust\nWebster noted that trust will become the gating factor of agentic success for merchants, issuers and consumers. And building it is dependent on one factor alone.\nBirwadker agreed, saying it starts with identity: anchoring agents to authenticated credentials through a consumer\u2019s bank. Layering in enriched data payloads before, during and after each transaction ensures disputes can be resolved fairly. If an agent buys a blue bag instead of a black one, standardized data must show what happened so liability can be assigned between issuers and merchants.\n\u201cIdentity followed by the right data payloads with the right authentication is the way to do this at scale,\u201d he said, pointing to Visa\u2019s broader work tokenizing credentials.\nA Standardized Future\nThe path forward will not be seamless. Developers and merchants must adapt infrastructure built for human browsing to a world where agents shop and transact. That is why Visa is putting MCP in developers\u2019 hands and a no-code toolkit in merchants\u2019 hands, to standardize the connective layer and accelerate real-world learning.\nFor Birwadker, the endgame is ubiquity. A technology that only works in a handful of scenarios will not move the needle. Agentic commerce must be as seamless and trusted as swiping a Visa card is today. The company intends to iterate quickly, he said, until the trust quotient, usability and standardization is built.\n\u201cThe easier it is for developers and merchants to build on MCP, the more likely it becomes the default,\u201d he said. \u201cOur bar isn\u2019t niche adoption.
