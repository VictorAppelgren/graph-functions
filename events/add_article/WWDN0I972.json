      "title": "Alphabet (GOOGL) Is A Top Long Term Quantum Computing Stock, Says Jim Cramer",
      "summary": "Jim Cramer on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street discussed AI’s massive power and water demands, suggesting quantum computing and nuclear energy as solutions, and highlighted Alphabet’s cloud growth and CoreWeave’s power constraints. He reviewed several stocks—Alphabet, Goldman Sachs, CoreWeave, and others—emphasizing their recent performance and hedge‑fund interest. The article also lists 30 stocks that could double in three years and 11 hidden AI stocks, noting trends such as AI infrastructure, LNG exports, and onshoring. Overall, it blends Cramer’s commentary with a hedge‑fund‑driven pick strategy focused on AI, energy, and infrastructure themes.",
