      "feedback": "Strong draft, but to reach world‑class level you need a sharper, fully surfaced 3–6 month catalyst map with explicit triggers, invalidations, timing, and a tighter, first‑principles link from policy to market transmission. Edit along these lines:\n\n- Ground the macro thesis in explicit, source‑backed causal chain and timing. Tie the base case to a concrete policy trigger window (e.g., committee actions and potential floor votes on the “big beautiful bill” within 6–8 weeks, with notable debt‑trajectory implications if it passes). Quantify debt/deficit signaling from the sources: the bill’s tax/benefit mix is described as a near‑$4.4 trillion ten‑year relief in EPJYXB7DX (CBO/CRFB framing) and a roughly debt‑expanding path per Range’s debt‑trajectory interpretation (UPV3X2MQ6). Reconcile the two numbers by explicitly stating the dispute and what would invalidate each view (e.g., passage with offsetting cuts vs. larger, unoffsetted deficits). Also note the political risk channel: DNC critique of Medicaid/work‑requirement changes (EPJYXB7DX). Put these into a 3–4 sentence causal chain: policy passage → fiscal signal (tax cuts vs. debt growth) → growth impulse (capex, hiring, consumer demand) → asset price/credit channel (equities, spreads, yields). (EPJYXB7DX; UPV3X2MQ6)\n\n- Build a clean, 3–6 month catalyst map with triggers, paths, and invalidations. Catalog catalysts as: (a) legislative progress on the big bill (timing, floor votes, caveats like Medicaid/work‑requirements), (b) debt‑service/yield signals (term premium moves or credit‑spread twists if the debt path worsens), (c) private‑market funding/flow signals (Pacaso, mogul, Range, HeartSciences, Gameflip votes of confidence or fundraising news), and (d) macro‑data confirmations (Q3 GDP, inflation, capex readings). For each catalyst, specify a window (e.g., weeks 1–4, 4–8, 8–12) and a concrete invalidation (e.g., bill fails to advance or is significantly watered down). Link private‑market signals to real‑economy channels (Pacaso’s cross‑border expansion, Range’s AI‑assisted planning, and HeartSciences’ Medicare/FDA milestones) to show the channel from policy to productivity to markets. (UPV3X2MQ6; FOM34PUWA; ILYC1M41F)\n\n- Sharpen the base case and the alt paths with precise numbers and clear rationale. Base case: policy momentum yields a modest fiscal impulse that boosts equities and risk appetite in 3–6 months, with a disciplined debt outlook; Alt 1: faster, smoother passage sustains risk appetite with higher near‑term rates controlled by productivity gains; Alt 2: weaker uptake or larger deficit/debt concerns tilt toward a rate/risk‑off regime. Tie each path to observable data points (bill progression, debt‑path commentary, and private‑market funding activity). Reconcile conflicts (e.g., 3.4T vs 4.4T tax/deficit estimates) by stating the source disagreement and the most plausible assumption under each scenario. (EPJYXB7DX; UPV3X2MQ6)\n\n- Strengthen the transmission channels with quantified links to fundamentals. Replace generic statements with explicit channels and numbers: tax cuts/tax‑reform impacts on corporate capex and consumer spending (CBO/CRFB framing in EPJYXB7DX); debt dynamics and yield implications (Range/TOA framing in UPV3X2MQ6); productivity/value capture through AI/automation and high‑tech sectors (Range’s AI wealth platform, Pacaso/mogul growth, HeartSciences’ AI‑ECG). Explicitly map how a policy impulse could lift earnings, margins, and valuations versus how higher debt could pressure long‑end yields and discount rates. (EPJYXB7DX; UPV3X2MQ6; ILYC1M41F; FOM34PUWA)\n\n- Tighten scope to the SECTION FOCUS horizon and constraints. End the write‑up with: base case, 1–2 explicit alts, clear risks, watch‑list signals, and confidence. Ensure each element is timestamped (e.g., 0–4 weeks, 4–8 weeks, 8–12 weeks), and annotate how each watch signal would validate or invalidate the scenario (e.g., bill advancement, debt‑trajectory shifts, private‑market funding flows). Maintain a single, coherent causal narrative rather than a collection of disjoint signals. (All sources cited above)\n\n- Ensure citation discipline and conflict reconciliation. After every assertion tied to a numeric claim or a key trigger, append the exact source ID(s) (EPJYXB7DX for the RNC/big beautiful bill and political framing; UPV3X2MQ6 for private‑market/AI productivity and debt signals; FOM34PUWA for UAS/job data as a productivity/tech‑capex proxy; ILYC1M41F for FIRE trend context). Where two sources conflict (e.g., 3.4T vs 4.4T debt impact), present both figures with a brief note on the attribution and the conditions under which each would hold, then indicate the preferred assumption under each scenario. (EPJYXB7DX; UPV3X2MQ6; FOM34PUWA; ILYC1M41F)\n\nIn short: restructure into a tight, explicitly timed, 3–6 month scenario map with named catalysts/triggers and invalidations; quantify transmission from policy to macro to markets using the exact numbers in the sources; fix conflicting estimates with transparent reconciliation; and present a base case plus 1–2 clearly delineated alts with watch signals and a defined confidence level.",
