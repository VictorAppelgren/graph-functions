  "title": "Is Your Network Ready for the Quantum Era? Key Security Considerations",
  "description": "Your network may be watertight according to today's thinking, equipped with firewalls, intrusion-detection systems, and data encryption. But will that be sufficient when quantum computers reach their prime? That is the biggest issue, and now is the appropriate moment to take serious consideration",
  "content": "We're standing at the edge of a major technological shift. Quantum computing, which until recently was the domain of science fiction or far academic fantasy, is edging its way onto the list of real-world disruptors. And while that is quite amazing from the scientific and innovation angle, it creates an enormous monkey wrench in something that far too often is taken for granted\u2014digital security.\n\nYour network may be watertight according to today's thinking, equipped with firewalls, intrusion-detection systems, and data encryption. But will that be sufficient when quantum computers reach their prime? That is the biggest issue, and now is the appropriate moment to take serious consideration of it.\n\nLet's take a step back and unpack why quantum computing matters to network security in the first place.\n\nToday, much of our online security relies on encryption that would take conventional computers thousands, if not millions, of years to crack. But quantum computers don't play by those rules. Thanks to their ability to process information in qubits\u2014units that can represent multiple states at once\u2014quantum machines can solve certain problems exponentially faster than traditional ones. That includes problems like breaking RSA and ECC encryption, which underpin everything from online banking to secure emails to your company's VPN tunnel.\n\nSo, when we refer to being we're actually referring to securing all those encrypted chat and digital signatures that will be vulnerable once the quantum computer attains a specific level of capability. That moment isn't tomorrow, but it's close enough that forward-thinking organizations can't afford to ignore it.\n\nHere's where things get a little uncomfortable. Even though powerful quantum computers aren't widespread yet, attackers can still start collecting encrypted data today with the intention of decrypting it later\u2014once quantum technology matures. This tactic, called is already being discussed in cybersecurity circles.\n\nThink about the implications. That means even your secure traffic from today could be sitting in some adversary's archive, waiting for quantum decryption to become a reality. That's why quantum security isn't just a future problem\u2014it's a now problem. The clock is ticking, even if the bomb hasn't gone off yet.\n\nFortunately, the security community isn't doing anything. Cryptographers and researchers are already busy building encryption systems that are capable of withstanding quantum attacks. This area of work, known as post-quantum cryptography (abbreviated as PQC), is gaining momentum rapidly.\n\nWhereas post-quantum cryptography is developed to execute on current classical systems (i.e., without the need to apply quantum principles to communicate securely), it is therefore smoother to implement. NIST has indeed been hosting an international competition to choose standardized algorithms that may someday supplant the existing vulnerable ones.\n\nSo yes, there are solutions on the horizon. But the thing is\u2014implementing an upgrade to support PQC is not going to be plug and play. It is going to require planning, testing, a new design, and most of all, time. And the sooner that process is initiated, the better equipped you will be to prevent a future security catastrophe.\n\nNow, some folks are looking toward quantum itself for answers\u2014specifically, quantum key distribution (QKD). This technique uses the principles of quantum mechanics to share encryption keys in a way that makes eavesdropping physically detectable.\n\nSounds good, doesn't it? It is. There is, however, a catch.\n\nQKD is special-purpose hardware, and it is still too costly and technically challenging to roll out on a large scale. It is an amazing product for super-secure applications such as governmental communication or money transfer between banks. But is it ready for the run-of-the-mill business network? Not yet. But it is something to watch, perhaps, if you handle very sensitive information.\n\nWhat You Can Start Doing Today\n\nBecoming quantum-ready isn't about tearing it all out and rebuilding; however, it is about being ahead of the curve. Begin with an inventory of your cryptographically relevant assets. Know which systems rely on RSA, ECC, or any other exploitable algorithms. Explore hybrid encryption methods that mix the best of the classics and quantum-resistant algorithms in the transition phase. Discuss with your vendors\u2014what are their quantum-readiness roadmaps?\n\nIf your internal team isn't equipped to handle this shift alone, consider bringing in trusted Network Security Services partners. These experts can help you identify risks, develop a phased migration strategy, and ensure your infrastructure is ready for both current threats and future quantum disruptions.\n\nThe rise of Quantum computing is not imminent in the same way that ransomware is. It won't knock on your firewall tomorrow and shut down your systems. It's quieter, it's slower, it's farther away\u2014yet it could be much more disruptive.\n\nIf your network is not ready, your data may be compromised in ways that you cannot yet imagine. But if you begin preparing today, you can lay the foundations of an effective security that is strong and able to withstand whatever comes its way in the future. So the question is not if the quantum age is approaching. It is already en route. The question is: will your network be ready when it arrives?",

      "text": "If you grew up in the digital age, you may have been one of the kids who played games online, chatted with friends on child-appropriate social networks, and posted embarrassing things online for laughs and reactions.\nNowadays, the internet is becoming increasingly more volatile, especially when kids are exposed to a variety of content and influences on social media or through other websites. Thankfully, there are ways you can utilize Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in ways that not only allow you to keep your kids safe online but prevent malicious activity from occurring as well.\nThe Basics of VPNs\nA VPN is a type of online service that allows you to hide your browsing activity. Though an article from Microsoft Azure outlines the ins and outs of how they operate, the short version is that a VPN creates a private connection between your computer and a remote server, owned by the VPN provider. This connection, or \"tunnel,\" encrypts your data so that no one else has access to it. It also masks your IP address so that no one else can trace you. This makes your online experience safer, more secure, and more anonymous.\nWhy Would You Use a VPN\nA VPN is often appropriate to use if you are concerned about the way your browsing activity might be tracked online. Through the use of state-of-the-art encryptions and IP masking, you can effectively maneuver through the internet in a safer, more secure, and more private manner.\nWhy Would My Kids Use a VPN\nStudies indicate that kids and teenagers might utilize VPNs to hide what they are looking at online. By using a VPN, a child might be able to bypass any parental controls you have implemented on your account.\nTypically, parental controls on devices are implemented by blocking certain IP addresses, which prevents your child from accessing blocked websites. VPNs, however, can scramble the home IP address, which means that your child may then be capable of bypassing parental controls and accessing blocked sites, such as social media or other websites.\nIt is important to note that children might not possess the ability to distinguish truly safe VPNs from their free counterparts, which might not offer the best protection from malicious activity such as malware and hackers. As a result, it's important to consider how, and even why, your child might be utilizing a VPN.\nHow to Tell if Your Child Is Using a VPN\nGabb.com suggests that the easiest way to determine if your child is using a VPN is to use the search tool on their device and type \"VPN\" on the device operating system. You can also search the top VPN apps on a mobile device's app store to see which ones might be most accessible.\nMost VPNs require a credit card to utilize their systems. However, some allow you to try them for free or are always free. Searching for the VPN software on a computer or phone is the most direct way to tell if there is a VPN present on the device.\nHow to Talk to Your Kids About VPNs\nIf your child is utilizing a VPN, it is important to understand why they are using one in the first place. It could be that they're hiding their internet tracking from companies like many adults do. Alternatively, they could be trying to hide their activity from you or other caregivers.\nIf your child is trying to hide something from you, it is most likely time to talk about the importance of online safety. While these conversations can often be difficult and can come with potential arguments, it is important to keep an open mind and to be direct and firm. Gabb.com states that you should focus the conversation on helping your child remain safe, not on punishing them.\nOne way to talk to your kids about online safety is to emphasize the importance of being wary about what websites they visit. Not all websites are built equally. In some cases, a website may not provide the security features that are necessary to keep your personal device safe. Malicious file types and viruses\u2014including malware, spyware, Trojan horses, and others\u2014can be injected into your device simply by clicking on a link or by downloading a file. In some cases, even just visiting a website can result in a script deploying, thereby exposing your device to a virus.\nAnother thing to discuss with your children is the importance of being mindful of what they view online. Even with a VPN deployed, your information may not be completely private, especially if the VPN service drops and your regular IP address is revealed. Remaining mindful of what you are viewing even as an adult is important and is a lesson that should be taught early on when a child is using the internet.\nFinally, if you are concerned about your child's access to applications on their phone, you can implement an \"allow list\" through iOS's Screen time app or Android device's Family Link app to manage your child's access to applications on their phone. Through these family-managing applications, only you, as the guardian, have control of what your child can download onto their phone.\nAre there Child-Safe VPNs?\nThankfully, modern VPN services are developing tools that allow parents to control what their child is viewing even while they are using a VPN. With these tools, you can determine what your child is viewing online, track what they are seeing, and prevent them from looking at websites or content that could endanger them or put their personal information at risk.\nVPNs are a great way to browse the web in a more private, safer manner. However, it is important for parents to note that not all VPNs are built equally, nor are all VPNs interested in keeping your child or their data safe. Always be cautious when utilizing a VPN application or website, especially if they claim to be free, and remain mindful of the terms the VPN offers if you or your child are using one. The most important thing when browsing the internet is to keep yourself and your information safe. Maintain your privacy online with a reliable and cheap VPN favored by users across the world.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission."

      "text": "Short URL: https://www.nist.gov/pqcrypto\nFor a plain-language introduction to post-quantum cryptography, go to: What Is Post-Quantum Cryptography?\nHQC was selected for standardization on March 11, 2025. NIST IR 8545, Status Report on the Fourth Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process is now available.\nFIPS 203, FIPS 204 and FIPS 205, which specify algorithms derived from CRYSTALS-Dilithium, CRYSTALS-KYBER and SPHINCS+, were published August 13, 2024.\nNIST initiated a process to solicit, evaluate, and standardize one or more quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms. Full details can be found in the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization page.\nIn recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers \u2013 machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.\nThe question of when a large-scale quantum computer will be built is a complicated one. While in the past it was less clear that large quantum computers are a physical possibility, many scientists now believe it to be merely a significant engineering challenge. Some engineers even predict that within the next twenty or so years sufficiently large quantum computers will be built to break essentially all public key schemes currently in use. Historically, it has taken almost two decades to deploy our modern public key cryptography infrastructure. Therefore, regardless of whether we can estimate the exact time of the arrival of the quantum computing era, we must begin now to prepare our information security systems to be able to resist quantum computing.\n| August 13, 2024 |\nThe Secretary of Commerce approved three Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for post-quantum cryptography: |\n| August 24, 2023\n|\nComments Requested on Three Draft FIPS for Post-Quantum Cryptography\n|\n| December 20, 2016\n|\nRequest for Nominations for Public-Key Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms |\n| August 2, 2016\n|\nRequest for Comments on Submission Requirements and Evaluation Criteria |\nSecurity and Privacy: post-quantum cryptography"

      "text": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)\nThe concept of quantum key distribution (QKD) was first proposed in the 1970s but it wasn\u2019t until the 1980s that it really came to light. The idea was incredibly simple yet it still took until the 1990s, when the connection was made to entanglement, that physicists started to get really interested. Since then the progress has been remarkable and it is now perhaps the most mature quantum technology, being commercially available for over 15 years now.\nToday\u2019s digital society is highly dependent on the security of data, both during communication as well as in storage, for example in e-banking, e-business, e-health, or e-government channels. With the progress of quantum computers that can potentially break this security, the risk for everyone is increasingly real.\nEspecially if one considers health, where records may need to be secured for a person\u2019s lifetime, QKD is the one technology that can actually address this issue of long-term security. Similarly the critical infrastructure that provides e.g. energy, needs to also address this risk and quantum technologies again hold the key.\nWhile commercially available for many years, progress continues on making these systems more compact, cheaper, and capable of operating over longer distances. These are all critical for the uptake of these technologies by governments and industry. The integration of these QKD systems into the existing network infrastructure is the current challenge and multidisciplinary teams of telecommunication equipment manufacturers, critical infrastructure providers, network operators, QKD equipment providers, digital security professionals and scientists, are working on this.\nQKD provides a way of distributing and sharing secret keys that are necessary for cryptographic protocols. The importance here is in ensuring that they remain private, i.e. between the communicating parties. To do this, we rely on the what was once seen as the problem of quantum systems; if you \u201clook\u201d at them, or disturb them in any way, you \u201cbreak\u201d the quantum characteristics.\nTypically, information is encoded on single photons, as shown in the figure. Alice can chose to encode these in a \u201cbit sequence\u201d using one of two states, like vertical (V) or horizontal (H) polarisation, and she also can chose to encode in two different states; here, two combinations of these states labeled +45\u00b0 and -45\u00b0. Bob then choses to measure in one of the two, what we call bases \u2013 either he measures H,V, or he measures +45\u00b0, -45\u00b0. If he measures in a base that is different from the one Alice used to prepare, then his answer will be random and discarded, but if they chose the same one, then they will have perfectly correlated results; Alice sends H and Bob detects H, and these are kept. This last step requires Alice and Bob to communicate about which base was used but reveals no information about the result, which now becomes the secret key. This is just one way to do but there are now many variations.\nAs you see, this just generates a secret key, this then needs to be incorporated into cryptographic protocols to ensure security in the various applications where they\u2019re used. The beauty that quantum physics brings to this solution is that if a spy or a hacker tries to intercept the key generation, they will introduce errors and reveal themselves. Importantly, this happens before any information is encoded or communicated!\nLaboratory demonstrations and some field tests of QKD in the 1990s paved the way for the first commercial systems in the early 2000s. Since then, we have seen the development of all the underlying technologies and new protocols for QKD and security applications that can exploit them. High rates (>Mbps) and long distances (>400km) have been demonstrated and both academic and commercial systems continue to get smaller and cheaper. This is expected to accelerate in the coming years and more integrated solutions are adapted for QKD. In 2019, we will also see the launch of a European testbed for QKD that will provide a showcase for these technologies and solutions, which will bring increased industrial interest to the field and accelerate the uptake of QKD-enabled solutions globally."
