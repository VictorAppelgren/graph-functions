  "title": "Apple TV+ Just Got a Price Hike. These Shows, Movies Make it Worth the Extra $3",
  "description": "Looking to get the most out of your Apple TV+ subscription? Here are the critical darlings and under-the-radar picks I think you should add to your watch list right now.",
  "content": "Severance brought Apple dozens of Emmy nominations and a very dedicated fan base. In return, we got... price hikes ? The company recently upped the cost of its Apple TV+ streaming service from $9.99 per month to $12.99. Is it worth the extra cash?\n\nSix years into Apple TV+ , it now has around 140 series, at least 22 of which have multiple seasons. There are 71 movies available or coming soon , and 45 pieces of kids-related content. The biggest-budget Apple TV+ shows tend to be sci-fi, such as For All Mankind or Foundation , but the full library covers multiple genres, including recent additions like The Studio with Seth Rogen and Your Friends and Neighbors with Jon Hamm. How many Apple originals have you watched? I dug into the streamer's catalog to pick out some of my favorite forgotten, niche, and sneakily good things to add to your watch list.\n\nFirst, let's dive into the Apple TV+ titles that have been around for a while, but are still worth watching. I found them all to be thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nThis rapidly paced espionage series set in the Iranian capital follows Mossad intelligence agent Tamar Rabinyan (Niv Sultan) and provides an interesting change of perspective for an American audience. Two seasons are available now and a third, with House star Hugh Laurie, is on the way.\n\nIn this movie, Rashida Jones stars as a young mom who suspects her husband of cheating on her. She reluctantly enlists the help of her father (Bill Murray), to solve the mystery, and chaos ensues.\n\nA \"will they or won't they\" romance movie starring Dakota Johnson as a single mom raising an  autistic daughter who connects with Andrew, a recent college grad trying to figure out what to do with his life.\n\nBefore she was Harmony Cobel, Patricia Arquette led this comedy-tinged drama as a down-and-out detective in Palm Desert, California. The series was canceled after one season, but it's a wild ride with no major cliffhangers, so it\u2019s worth checking out.\n\nIn this movie, two Black investors, played by Anthony Mackie and Samuel L. Jackson, try to defy racist property ownership laws in the 1950s by partnering with a white man to be the public face of the transactions.\n\nThese shows have a devoted fan base, but have not received the attention they deserve, in my opinion. All of them\u2014minus the Lessons in Chemistry mini-series\u2014have been renewed for more seasons. Don\u2019t sleep on these undercover hits before you get too far behind.\n\nDon\u2019t avoid this show because you might not be into cooking or chemistry. It's much more ambitious in scope than it may appear.\n\nThis semi-noir detective drama benefits from the mystery. All you need to know is that Colin Farrell plays a detective-for-hire looking for a missing girl. Its 30-minute episodes make it fly by, and there\u2019s a second season in the works .\n\nEven if you\u2019re not a fan of monster movies\u2014I\u2019m not\u2014 this show does a great job of focusing on the mystery, using real-life father and son actors to hammer home the show\u2019s ultimate climax.\n\nThe titular reluctant traveler, Eugene Levy of Schitt's Creek fame, is \"more of the great indoors type of guy.\" But he agrees to get out of his comfort zone and jet off to Tokyo, the Utah desert, South Africa, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Lisbon, and Finland. My whole family are fans of this one.\n\nDespite not being particularly interested in European fashion houses, I was completely captivated by this drama looking at the lives of Christian Dior and Coco Chanel.\n\nThis seven-episode show starring Idris Elba tells the thrilling hijacking story of a seven-hour flight from Dubai to London in real time. Even with its plot holes, the pacing and action make for a great ride.\n\nNot every show or movie can be a critics pick, but that doesn't mean they're not worth watching. The point of having enough content in a catalog is being able to speak to different audiences. I found myself mixed on some of these titles, but I don't regret spending the time. For example, Sunny didn\u2019t quite land the way I hoped it would, but it was interesting enough to finish and it made me reconsider some of our impending smart home robots. Go ahead and take a chance.\n\nDid you know that Apple TV+ has a seven-part mini-series from director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n starring Cate Blanchett and Kevin Kline? Cuar\u00f3n says he thinks of Disclaimer as one long movie, and it's hard to disagree with that as this psychological thriller unfolds and shifts the viewer\u2019s perspective throughout. I was thinking about it for weeks after.\n\nAnother Rashida Jones project, this one is based in Japan. It's a dark whodunnit brimming with retro vibes featuring robots and other funky gadgets.\n\nThis series pumps up the 2000s-era music while mixing an arson (and potential murder) investigation with some mental health awareness. Millennials should find a lot to like.\n\nThis drama series looks at Abraham Lincoln's murder from the perspective of his assassin, John Wilkes Booth. Once I warmed up to Hamish Linklater's take on Lincoln after an episode or two, I found it to be a compelling story.\n\nThe series follows a group of young American women who come to London searching for husbands in the 1870s. Despite the time period, the show has a modern tone and style (and soundtrack), ultimately making its sum bigger and better than its parts. Season two is on the way.\n\nThese are some of the most notable Apple TV+ shows, so there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve already heard of them. Now's the time to press play.\n\nFor subscribers who have already given most of the catalog a chance, here are a few notable shows and movies on the docket for the immediate future. If you've enjoyed the other premium programming, these will not disappoint.\n\nIn the even longer run, there are close to \u2014or seasons\u2014and movies that are in development, production, filming, or that have been ordered. It looks like there will be a barrage of things to watch for the foreseeable future. Did we miss any of your favorites? Let us know in the comments.",

      "text": "Ted Lasso season 4 is happening, but there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t yet know about it. According to one source, however, there\u2019s a big change in focus coming for the Apple TV+ series.\nNew season, new AFC Richmond team\nSigmund Judge, host of the Apple TV-focused Magic Rays of Light podcast, posted on X today about a big new Ted Lasso development:\nEXCLUSIVE: London filming for #TedLasso S4 is now set to begin in May/June with focus shifting at AFC Richmond to the formation of its women\u2019s team.\nOriginally Ted Lasso\u2019s next season was expected to start filming early in the year, but now it seems the shoot is happening around mid-year instead.\nThe bigger news from his post, however, concerns this major change in focus for the series.\nSeason 4 will apparently shift away from the original AFC Richmond men\u2019s team to instead highlight the formation of a women\u2019s team.\nI suspect we\u2019ll still see many appearances of the men\u2019s team throughout the season, but it seems that the narrative thrust of the show\u2019s return will center around a new women\u2019s team instead.\n9to5Mac\u2019s Take\nSigmund Judge has proven a reliable source for Apple TV reporting in the past, including at least one Ted Lasso-related rumor. So I have no doubt he knows what he\u2019s talking about here.\nThis sounds like a fun new direction for Ted Lasso to take, assuming we\u2019ll still get to keep in touch with many of the men\u2019s players and staff we already know and love. It will be interesting to see whether Jason Sudeikis\u2019 title character will still be the coach, however, or if his involvement will be scaled back.\nWhat do you think about this Ted Lasso season 4 rumor? Let us know in the comments.\nApple TV+ is available for $9.99 per month and features hit TV shows and movies like Ted Lasso, Severance, The Morning Show, Silo, and Shrinking.\nBest Ted Lasso and Apple TV buys\n- Ted Lasso book: Believe\n- Ted Lasso series Blu-Ray set\n- Funko Pop!
