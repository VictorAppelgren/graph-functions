Around that same time, Pelletier's mother received a text from him stating \"Help me.\"\nA trucker later found Pelletier's cellphone and backpack on a road near Bradenton.\n\"We just want him to come home,\" said Tierra Hadley, one of about two dozen people who came out to join the search party in Mims.\nSeveral Brevard County sheriff's agents also showed up to the search effort, which is being investigated by the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office.\n\u201cWe are working this investigation collaboratively with the Brevard County Sheriff's Office,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office.\nAnyone with information on Giovanni Pelletier's location is asked to contact the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office non-emergency number at 941-639-2101.\nTim Shortt contributed to this story.

The Charlotte County Sheriff\u2019s Office said on Friday, Aug. 1 around 1:30 a.m., he left with cousins to visit additional family in Brevard County. What happened next baffled his family.\n\"He texted \u2018help me\u2019. \"My son would not have put me in a place to be scared or worried, because he knows when it comes to my children there are no limits and nothing I wouldn\u2019t do it for him,\" said Bridgette Pelletier.\nThose in the car told Charlotte County Deputies that Pelletier began acting erratically, got out of the car and walked away near I-75 and State Road 70 in Manatee County. His backpack and phone were found on the side of the road.\n\"If something were to come up where maybe he was experiencing something, they would have been there and not think of somebody leaving somebody on the side of the road. It doesn\u2019t make sense. \"There are too many things that don\u2019t make sense. \"The narrative that\u2019s being told is not the true story, and it\u2019s disappointing because I believe that\u2019s why we don\u2019t have any more support from law enforcement thus far. \"There\u2019s been some amazing people in Charlotte County that have been so helpful, but without information we can\u2019t move forward, said his mom, Bridgette.\nThe non-profit search group, We Are the Essentials, and Giovanni\u2019s family continue to search parts of Sarasota County leading to Englewood. They\u2019re trying to narrow down the timeline.\n\"We are going to be focusing based upon the time that he left the family home, based on the text messages and face-time videos that were sent and attempted to receive from his mother,\" said Shelley Croft of We Are the Essentials.\nThey\u2019re asking anyone with footage of the white Chevy Malibu Giovanni was traveling in to come forward.\n\"If you believe that you see them, that video can make a world of difference in knowing where that car was at what time, in what area. \"You are maybe the missing piece to the puzzle,\" said Croft.\n\"Our family is not the same without Geo. We are not going to be able to stop looking for him, we won\u2019t be able to go home and go back to normal. \"We need him home,\" said Bridgette Pelletier.\nWhat you can do:\nIf you have any information, contact the Charlotte County Sheriff\u2019s Office at their non-emergency number (941) 639-2101.\nThe Source: Information was gathered through the Charlotte County Sheriff\u2019s Office; Giovanni Pelletier\u2019s family and We Are the Essentials."

Then, a foot was found.\nHuman remains connected to a man who mysteriously disappeared in 1997 were recovered near Fish Lake in Utah, local authorities revealed.\nAccording to an Aug. 5 news release from the Sevier County Sheriff's Office, a foot was discovered inside a hiking boot along the shore of the lake in May.\nThey learned that it belonged to a missing man identified as David White of Washington, who went missing in September 1997.\nBefore his disappearance, White was going to go fishing with his friends, but the plans didn't work out, so he decided to go by himself. His boat was found abandoned on the lake, with no trace of White.\n\"A shoe and hat were found floating in the water, giving a possible indication where White was believed to have fallen in,\" the sheriff's office stated. \"There were no witnesses at the time.\"\nAuthorities said he was staying at a hotel in the area at the time.

It spans about 280,000 acres across Liberty, Bryan, Evans, Long and Tattnall counties along the Canoochee River.\nWhat we know about Fort Stewart\nFort Stewart trains, deploys and mobilizes Army units and is home to the 3rd Infantry Division, according to the Department of Defense. The April 2020 census recorded about 8,821 people living within Fort Stewart, including students, active military members, military retirees and family members.\nIt employs thousands of civilians and servicemembers in the area and is considered a major community hub containing schools, medical centers, living quarters and recreational areas.\nThe fort is named after Brigadier General Daniel Stewart, a Revolutionary War figure, and its beginnings trace back to a 1940 purchase of land just outside Hinesville for an anti-aircraft artillery training center. The 3rd Infantry Division was activated at Fort Stewart in 1996.\nContributing: Davis Winkie, USA TODAY"

      "text": "Army sergeant in custody after 5 soldiers shot at Fort Stewart; motive remains unknown\nEditor's note: This page summarizes news on the shooting at Fort Stewart for Wednesday, Aug. 6. For the latest news on the Fort Stewart shooting, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Thursday, Aug. 7.\nATLANTA \u2013 A U.S. Army sergeant opened fire at the Fort Stewart military base in Georgia on Aug. 6, injuring five of his colleagues, before he was subdued by fellow soldiers and taken into custody, military officials said.\nThe shooting occurred shortly before 11 a.m. local time at the suspect's workplace \u2014 the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, according to officials. The incident prompted the base to be briefly placed under lockdown.\nOfficials did not provide further details on what led to the incident, but Army Brig. Gen. John Lubas said the suspect used a personal handgun, not a military firearm. Fellow soldiers responded swiftly, tackling him to the ground.\n\"These soldiers, without a doubt, prevented further casualties,\" Lubas, the commander of the 3rd Infantry Division and Fort Stewart, said at a news conference.\nThe suspect was identified as Sgt. Quornelius Radford, 28, an automated logistics noncommissioned officer. Soldiers in Radford's field typically manage maintenance or warehouse operations by placing orders and tracking work in Army computer systems.\nAll five people shot were \"in stable condition\" and \"expected to recover,\" according to Lubas. Two soldiers who had been shot were transported via ambulance to Memorial Health University Medical Center, a trauma center about an hour's drive away in Savannah. Helicopters were unavailable to assist due to local weather conditions, hospital spokesperson Bryna Gordon said.\nThree others were treated at the Winn Army Community Hospital, located on the base. One of them required surgery, according to Lubas.\nHow the shooting unfolded\nLubas said Radford opened fire shortly before 11 a.m. in an area of the south Georgia installation associated with the 3rd Infantry Division\u2019s 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, a tank unit that returned from a deployment in Europe in the summer of 2024.\nThe entirety of the fort was locked down shortly thereafter, and Radford was apprehended at 11:35 a.m., the base said in a social media post. Fort Stewart lifted the lockdown for much of the base shortly after midday and declared the post \"all clear\" just before 2 p.m.\nMultiple law enforcement agencies, including the Hinesville Police Department, joined the Army in responding to the incident. The FBI said it was responding to the scene at Fort Stewart and would provide resources or investigative support as requested.\nMotive for shooting remains unknown\nMilitary officials said they would not speculate about a motive. According to Lubas, Radford had been stationed at Fort Stewart since 2022 and was not previously deployed to combat.\n\"I don't have reason to believe that it had anything to do with a training event,\" the general said. \"Other than that, I can't state the motivations for this soldier.\"\nLubas added that it was not immediately known how the suspect was able to slip his handgun past base security.\nSuspected shooter arrested for DUI in May\nRadford was recently arrested for driving under the influence, Lubas said, but \"that was unknown to his chain of command until the (shooting) occurred.\"\nGeorgia state court records show that Radford was arrested in May for driving under the influence in Liberty County, where Fort Stewart is located.\nGeorgia State Patrol arrested Radford on May 18 for driving under the influence of alcohol, according to Liberty County court records. He was driving a 2021 Nissan Altima with Florida plates.\nRadford was also charged with running a red light, court records show. Liberty County court officials did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's requests for additional information.\n\u2014 Michael Loria\nTrump: 'Entire nation is praying for the victims and their families'\nBoth President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were briefed on the shooting and are monitoring the situation, according to a White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt and Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell.\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Trump called the suspect \"horrible\" and said the \"entire nation is praying for the victims and their families.\"\nHegseth said in a social media post that he is praying for the victims of the shooting, their families, and the Fort Stewart community.\n\"Today, a cowardly shooting at Fort Stewart left five brave Soldiers wounded,\" Hegseth said. \"Swift justice will be brought to the perpetrator and anyone else found to be involved.\"\nShooting sent loved ones on base scrambling for safety\nSadie Mohrbacher was at the theater watching the new Fantastic Four movie when she received a terrifying text message from her sister Wednesday morning: \"Active shooter on base. We are on lockdown.\"\nMohrbacher, 25, rushed out of the theater and called her sister, Paige Siple, who lives on the Fort Stewart military base in Georgia with her husband. Siple said that she was home alone and had locked the doors, closed all the curtains, and taken refuge in an upstairs closet with her dog, Ranger.\nSiple\u2019s husband, an active duty soldier who was working on the base, was safe and able to return home from work after the lockdown was lifted for a portion of Fort Stewart.\n\"It was horrifying,\" Mohrbacher told USA TODAY.\nMajor on-base shootings in recent decades\nWednesday's shooting is the second in recent years to occur in the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team's workspace. In December 2022, a fellow soldier shot and killed Sgt. Nathan Hillman at the unit's building complex.\nOther military bases have also experienced mass shootings in recent years.\nIn 2019, a foreign flight training officer from Saudi Arabia killed three Navy sailors and wounded eight more in a shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. Investigators determined the shooter, 2nd Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, who died in the attack, harbored jihadist beliefs.\nIn 2014, an Army specialist stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, killed three soldiers and shot 12 more before dying by suicide. A year earlier, Navy contractor Aaron Alexis killed 12 people at the Navy Yard complex in Washington, D.C.\nAnd in 2009, Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan killed 13 people, most of them soldiers, and wounded more than 30 others in a terrorist attack at a deployment medical processing center in Fort Hood, Texas. Hasan was wounded, apprehended, and sentenced to death for the murders.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Hasan\u2019s final appeal in March, confirming his death sentence.\nSchool lockdowns lifted after Fort Stewart shooting\nThree schools serving the children of military personnel at Fort Stewart were placed on lockdown Wednesday morning, according to a Department of Defense Education Activity alert. During the lockdown, no one could enter or leave the schools, though teaching continued, the alert said. Around 12:30 p.m. ET, the lockdown was lifted.\nIn Liberty County, where most of the base is located, two elementary schools and a middle school went into a soft lockdown \"out of an abundance of caution,\" the district said on social media. It was the students\u2019 first day back in school after summer break.\nIn Appling County, over 20 miles from Fort Stewart, all of the county's schools were placed under a level 1 lockdown before it was lifted around 1 p.m., the school system said on social media.\nWhat is Fort Stewart?\nThe U.S. Army\u2019s Fort Stewart is a sprawling military installation that includes training and housing facilities in southeast Georgia covering 438 square miles, an area larger than New York City.\nThe base is home to the Army\u2019s 3rd Infantry Division, and about 10,000 people live there, including active duty troops, family members, and civilian employees, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.\nThe base\u2019s history traces back to 1940 when it opened as an anti-aircraft training facility. Over the decades, it has steadily grown in size and population.\nToday, it serves thousands of active duty military, family members, students, retirees, contractors, and civilian employees.\nContributing: Reuters"

      "text": "Claire's files for bankruptcy - again. See which stores are closing.\nMall jewelry chain Claire's has filed for bankruptcy for the second time in seven years.\nThe majority of Claire's locations in the U.S. and the rest of North America will remain open as the company \"continues to explore all strategic alternatives,\" according to a news release issued Wednesday, Aug. 6, by parent company Claire's Holdings LLC and Claire's U.S., which operates Claire's and Icing stores in the U.S.\nClaire's, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, near Chicago, has continued to struggle since a March 2018 bankruptcy filing. The rise of ultra-popular fast fashion websites Shein and Temu had cut into sales for the jewelry store chain, which has 1,326 company-operated stores in the U.S. Other detrimental factors: rising interest rates, inflation and tariffs on goods from China.\nKnown for its ear piercings and teen fashion accessories, the chain joins other companies facing bankruptcies and store closings such as At Home, Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, Kohl's, JCPenney, Macy's and Party City.\nHere's what to know, including which stores are closing.\nWhy is Claire's filing for backtuptcy?\nAhead of the Aug. 6 bankruptcy filing, the company had sought to find a buyer for all or part of the business, and identified 18 stores it would close, according to filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.\n\"This decision is difficult, but a necessary one. Increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire's and its stakeholders,\" said Claire's CEO Chris Cramer in the news release. \"We remain in active discussions with potential strategic and financial partners and are committed to completing our review of strategic alternatives.\"\nEarlier this year, Claire's deferred payments on debt interest as a way to conserve cash, Bloomberg reported. U.S. tariff policy uncertainties has led to concerns about Claire's ability to pay a $475 million loan due in December 2026, according to Bloomberg.\nAnother sign of financial pressure and cash flow problems at Claire's: the company had increasingly fallen behind on its bills over the past year, according to Ragini Bhalla, spokesperson for business credit report provider Creditsafe.\n\"These patterns once again reveal that the retailer has been struggling to handle its financial obligations and delaying paying more of its outstanding bills,\" she said in July 30 report shared with USA TODAY.\nWhich Claire's and Icing stores are closing?\nA total of 18 Claire's and Icing stores will be closing, with clearance sales concluding no later than Sept. 7, according to the company's court filings. Additional stores could close, the company said in the filing.\nHere's the current list:\nClaire's Stores closing (13)\n- Eastdale Mall, Montgomery, Alabama\n- Newpark Mall, Newark, California\n- Ford City Mall, Chicago\n- Market Street, Lynnfield, Massachusetts\n- Bay City Town Center, Bay City, Michigan\n- Northtown Mall, Blaine, Minnesota\n- Livingston Mall, Livingston, New Jersey\n- Uniontown Mall, Uniontown, Pennsylvania\n- Shops at Highland Village, Highland Village, Texas\n- Pinnacle at Turkey Creek, Knoxville, Tennessee\n- Junction Commons, Park City, Utah\n- Provo Town Center, Provo, Utah\n- Woodinville Plaza, Woodinville, Washington\nIcing stores closing (5)\n- Galleria at Tyler, Riverside, California\n- Woodland Mall, Grand Rapids, Michigan\n- Greece Ridge, Rochester, New York\n- Mall of Abilene, Abilene, Texas\n- University Orem, Orem, Utah\nThis story was updated to fix an inaccuracy.\nContributing: Greta Cross and Kathryn Palmer, USA TODAY\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

My 18-year-old nephew, Giovanni Pelletier, has gone missing under deeply troubling and suspicious circumstances.\nHe was picked up by relatives to visit his father\u2019s side of the family and, according to those family members, he was later abandoned on the side of the road in Bradenton, Florida. His phone and backpack were found on the highway, and the last message he sent was a chilling text to his mom that simply said:\n\u201cMom help.\u201d\nThat was the last time anyone has heard from him.\nGiovanni is smart, kind, and full of life. He didn\u2019t deserve this. Our family is devastated, terrified, and doing everything in our power to bring him home \u2014 but we\u2019re receiving very little help from officials, and we are being forced to search on our own.\nMany people have been asking how they can donate to support the search \u2014 and because of that, we\u2019ve created this fund to help cover the growing costs. These include travel, food, housing, and resources needed to keep spreading the word and following leads. Giovanni\u2019s siblings have had to return home to another state to start school, which means my sister is now supporting two households while also trying to find her son.\nIf you can give \u2014 even just a few dollars \u2014 you\u2019ll be helping a mother who refuses to give up, a family desperate for answers, and a search that cannot stop until Giovanni is found.\nPlease donate.\nPlease share.\nPlease pray for Giovanni.\nWe won\u2019t stop searching until we bring him home.\nDonations\nOrganizer\nDesiree Pelletier\nOrganizer\nEnglewood, FL"

      "text": "Teen missing for nearly 1 week after going on vacation in Florida, texts mom 'help' before disappearing: Family\nGiovanni Pelletier, 18, was last heard from on Aug. 1, according to his family.\nA teenager from North Carolina has been missing for nearly a week after vacationing in Florida and trying to reconnect with relatives, the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office said.\nGiovanni Pelletier, an 18-year-old who is described as \"smart, kind and full of life,\" disappeared early last Friday \"under deeply troubling and suspicious circumstances,\" according to the family's GoFundMe page.\nPelletier was visiting Englewood, Florida, with his mother and her fiance and wanted to reconnect with relatives from his biological father's family, Desiree Pelletier, who is Giovanni's aunt and a sister of his mother, told ABC News. While he was unable to see his father, who is incarcerated, he made plans to see three of his cousins on that side of the family, his aunt said.\nWith only a few days left in his vacation, Pelletier's cousins picked him up at approximately 1:30 a.m. on Aug. 1 to take him on the three-hour drive to their house in Mims, Florida, his aunt said. His mother was planning on picking him up the next day, according to Desiree Pelletier.\nBut within 25 minutes of leaving, he sent his mom a text: \"Help me,\" his aunt said.\nThat was the last time his mother heard from him, according to his aunt. He also sent messages pleading for help to his grandfather and another aunt, Desiree Pelletier noted.\n\"Somewhere along the ride, something happened,\" his aunt said.\nThe next morning, the teen's mother saw the messages and missed phone calls from her son, could not get ahold of him and immediately contacted authorities, Desiree Pelletier said. She also reached out to the cousins who were with Pelletier, who said the group had been smoking marijuana, which is when the teen began to panic and pull out a knife, Pelletier's aunt noted.\nBut his aunt said that alleged behavior \"is not Gio\" and that it does \"not align\" with who he is.\nThe cousins also told police that Pelletier \"began to act erratically before exiting the vehicle,\" according to a statement from the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office. The cousins claimed they were driving on I-75 when Pelletier got out near SR-70, authorities said.\nHis family said he was \"abandoned on the side of the road in Bradenton, Florida,\" with his backpack and phone discovered in the area by a truck driver the same day he disappeared. Bradenton is about an hour away from Englewood by car.\nHis aunt said the family does not believe this is a run-away and that \"something is not told right.\"\n\"It doesn't make sense. Why would he say 'Help me' three different times to three people?\" his aunt said.\nSince then, the family has been continuing their search for Giovanni Pelletier, with officials saying they have received \"many, many tips that unfortunately turn out to be inaccurate.\"\n\"We love him and want him home and we just want him to be OK. As a family, we can't function normally. We're not doing well right now. We just want him home,\" his aunt told ABC News as she held back tears.\nAs of Thursday, the sheriff's office said in a statement to ABC News they \"do not have any updates on this investigation and continue to ask anyone with information to come forward.\"\nThe family is currently offering a reward of $10,000 for information leading to the teen's whereabouts, his aunt said."

      "text": "Legionnaires' disease cluster in NYC grows: 3 dead, 67 sickened\nThree people have died and more than 60 others are sickened in a growing Legionnaires' disease cluster in New York City, according to officials.\nThe cluster, which began July 25, has led to 67 Legionnaires' disease diagnoses in Central Harlem as of Aug. 5, according to the NYC Department of Health's latest update.\nThe source of the cluster is believed to be a cooling tower in the area, according to the agency.\nLegionnaires' disease is a severe pneumonia caused by a type of bacteria called Legionella, which grows in warm water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nWhere is the NYC Legionnaires' cluster?\nNYC Health said the Legionnaires' disease cluster is affecting the following Central Harlem zip codes:\n- 10027\n- 10030\n- 10035\n- 10037\n- 10039\nThe agency previously said the likely source of the bacteria causing the Legionnaires' cluster is a cooling tower in the area.\nAfter testing, 11 cooling towers in the area of the cluster had positive results for the Legionella bacteria. NYC Health said Aug. 4 that remediation of the 11 towers had been completed.\n\"Anyone in these zip codes with flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible,\" Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said in a release. \"Legionnaires\u2019 disease can be effectively treated if diagnosed early, but New Yorkers at higher risk, like adults aged 50 and older and those who smoke or have chronic lung conditions, should be especially mindful of their symptoms and seek care as soon as symptoms begin.\"\nThe health department also said the cluster does not involve any building\u2019s plumbing system, meaning it is safe to drink water, bathe, shower, cook and use air conditioners.\nWhat is Legionnaires' disease?\nLegionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by consuming water contaminated with Legionella bacteria, according to the CDC.\nSymptoms of the disease can take up to 14 days after exposure to show up and can include cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches and shortness of breath.\nLegionnaires' disease can be treated with antibiotics, and most healthy people who get infected usually get better. However, about one in 10 people who get Legionnaires' disease die from it, according to the CDC.\nThe best way to prevent Legionnaires' disease, which is a waterborne illness, is by cleaning pipes and devices that use water, according to the CDC.\nIs there a Legionnaires' disease outbreak?\nWhile the number of people with Legionnaires' disease in the Harlem area has grown, NYC Health has not yet categorized the diagnoses as an outbreak. The agency has referred to it as a cluster.\nAccording to the CDC, a cluster is defined as \"an aggregation of cases grouped in place and time that are suspected to be greater than the number expected, even though the expected number may not be known.\"\nAn outbreak is \"when there are more disease cases than what is typically expected for a target population in a given time and within a specific location,\" according to the CDC.\nUSA TODAY has reached out to NYC Health for more information about its characterization of the disease grouping.\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.
