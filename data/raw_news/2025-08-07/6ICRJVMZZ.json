  "title": "These Student Loan Borrowers Should Apply To Change Repayment Plans",
  "description": "Many student loan borrowers will likely need to consider switching plans or otherwise modifying their repayment approach in the coming months.",
  "content": "It is a tumultuous time for millions of student loan borrowers as repayment plans and loan forgiveness undergo some of the most significant changes in a generation. In light of these reforms, many borrowers will likely need to consider switching plans or otherwise modifying their repayment approach in the coming months.\n\nThe changes are happening on multiple fronts. Court challenges have thrown elements of several income-driven repayment program, including the SAVE plan and IDR student loan forgiveness, into disarray. Administrative problems and loan servicing issues have compounded application backlogs. Policy decisions by the Trump administration, such as the resumption of interest accrual for borrowers in the SAVE plan forbearance, have put pressure on borrowers to switch programs. And the \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d signed into law by President Trump last month will result in huge changes to the federal student loan system in the coming months and years.\n\nWhile some student loan borrowers will get to keep their repayment plan and may not have to take action, others may want to consider applying (or reapplying) to switch plans. Here\u2019s a breakdown.\n\nThe SAVE plan, a Biden-era income-driven repayment program that was created to reduce monthly payments and halt runaway balance growth associated with interest accrual, has been blocked for more than a year due to a lawsuit filed by a group of Republican-led states. As a result, around eight million borrowers were forced into an administrative forbearance, which hasn\u2019t counted toward student loan forgiveness. The SAVE plan hasn\u2019t been formally overturned yet, but a federal appeals court blocked the program last year. And in a subsequent ruling issued last spring, the court signaled a likelihood that the program will ultimately get overturned.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration restarted interest accrual for borrowers in the SAVE plan forbearance starting this month, arguing that doing so was required by a court order (although critics have disputed this, noting that no court explicitly ordered the Department of Education to resume interest). In addition, President Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d will ultimately repeal the SAVE plan by 2028, if the courts don\u2019t overturn it first.\n\nTaken together, this means that borrowers currently in the SAVE plan forbearance should start thinking about switching repayment plans. While it\u2019s possible that borrowers may not need to change plans until SAVE is phased out in July 2028, most observers expect that borrowers will have to make a change much sooner than that. And the resumption of interest accrual only adds pressure to borrowers to apply to switch repayment plans, as their loan balances are now increasing even though no payments are due.\n\n\u201cThe Department urges all borrowers in the SAVE Plan to quickly transition to a legally compliant repayment plan,\u201d said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon in a statement last month announcing that interest would start accruing again.\n\n\u201cAs of March 26, 2025, the online IDR application is once again available and servicers are processing applications for eligible borrowers to apply for the Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plans,\u201d says Department of Education guidance on its website.\n\nBut SAVE plan borrowers should be aware that they may have much higher payments under IBR, PAYE, and ICR compared to SAVE, especially if their income has increased since the last time they certified their earnings. And these alternative income-driven repayment plan options don\u2019t have the same interest savings benefits as SAVE.\n\nStudent Loan Borrowers Who Have Pending Applications For SAVE Or The Lowest Payment\n\nStudent loan borrowers who applied to SAVE, but were never able to enroll because the court injunction blocked the program before they were accepted into the plan, should also consider applying for a different income-driven plan. While SAVE remains blocked, the department cannot process applications for borrowers who selected SAVE. Instead, these borrowers should consider applying for ICR, IBR or PAYE (if they qualify). The Big, Beautiful Bill also creates a new income-driven option called the Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP. But RAP likely won\u2019t be available until sometime next year.\n\nThe same is true for borrowers who selected an option on their IDR application for their servicer to select the repayment plan with the lowest possible monthly payment. The Department of Education has determined that these applications cannot be processed in light of the SAVE plan injunction, and as a result, they will ultimately be rejected. Borrowers who selected the \u201clowest possible payment\" option on a pending IDR application should, therefore, reapply for one of the three available options \u2013 ICR, IBR, or PAYE.\n\nStudent Loan Borrowers Who Applied Before May\n\nIn addition, student loan borrowers who applied for any income-driven repayment plan prior to May of this year should consider reapplying. The Department of Education has indicated that there is a massive backlog of 1.5 million IDR applications, but many were submitted with tax returns and other income documents that borrowers had to manually upload with their applications because an online data sharing tool with the IRS was not functioning. In May, that IRS tool was restored. The tool allows for much faster automated processing of IDR requests because the Department of Education can simply import a borrower\u2019s income information from a borrower\u2019s federal tax return via the IRS.\n\nThe department is encouraging borrowers who submitted an IDR application prior to the restoration of the IRS data retrieval tool to reapply online at StudentAid.gov. Doing so may expedite processing, and should automatically cancel any previously-submitted application.\n\n\u201cApplying for an IDR Plan is quick and easy if borrowers provide consent for the Department to obtain their federal tax information directly from the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d said the department in a statement in July. \u201cThis allows the Department to process borrowers\u2019 IDR applications faster and eliminates the need for borrowers to manually upload their income information.\u201d\n\nStudent Loan Borrowers On The PAYE Or ICR Plans\n\nStudent loan borrowers who are currently enrolled in the PAYE and ICR plans can continue in these plans for the time being. But under the Big, Beautiful Bill, these repayment programs will be phased out by July 1, 2028, and possibly sooner than that. Once that happens, borrowers enrolled in PAYE and ICR will need to switch either to the Income Based Repayment plan (which is preserved under the legislation), or the new RAP plan, which may have lower monthly payments but also requires more years in repayment before a borrower can reach student loan forgiveness eligibility.\n\nFor now, borrowers in PAYE and ICR don\u2019t need to take any action. And in fact, it may be a good idea for many enrollees to stay in these plans for now, particularly if a borrower\u2019s income has increased since their last income recertification. But these individuals should start considering their alternative repayment options now. And many should prepare for potentially higher payments under IBR or RAP.\n\nSome student loan borrowers who have Parent PLUS loans may also want to consider changing repayment plans. Under the Big, Beautiful Bill, Parent PLUS borrowers will be cut off from student loan forgiveness and income-driven repayment unless they consolidate their loans by July 1, 2026, and enroll in an income-driven repayment plan by July 1, 2028. Currently, the only income-driven repayment plan for most consolidated Parent PLUS loans is the ICR plan. Once that plan has been phased out, borrowers enrolled in ICR or one of the other income-driven options will be able to switch to the IBR plan. All other Parent PLUS borrowers would have no option to repay their student loans based on their income going forward.",

      "text": "This month, interest began accruing again for more than seven million student loan borrowers stuck in the SAVE plan forbearance. A new repayment plan expected to be launched in the coming months may offer some borrowers a way to pause interest accrual again. But it could come at a cost.\nInterest had been paused for SAVE plan borrowers for nearly a year. Last summer, a federal appeals court blocked the Biden-era repayment program in response to a legal challenge brought by a group of Republican-led states, thrusting millions of borrowers into a forced forbearance that suspended payments and set interest rates to zero. The Trump administration argued last month that restating interest during the forbearance was required under a new court order issued last February.\n\u201cThe Department lacks the authority to put borrowers into a zero percent interest rate status,\u201d said the Department of Education in a statement last month announcing the resumption of interest. \u201cThe Biden Administration also invented a zero percent \u2018litigation forbearance,\u2019 forcing taxpayers to foot the bill and leaving borrowers without clear direction on how to legally repay their loans.\u201d\nCritics argued that nothing in recent court decisions related to the SAVE plan litigation compelled the Department of Education to restart interest accrual, and prior court rulings had affirmed the interest-free forbearance while the litigation continued. One analysis concluded that borrowers would be hit with more than $3,000 in annual additional costs due to interest accrual resuming.\nThere is no way presently for student loan borrowers in the SAVE plan to halt the accrual of interest. The good news, though, is that a new repayment plan will be released in the coming months that may allow some borrowers to effectively halt excess interest accrual and, thus, retain at least some of the interest-savings benefits associated with SAVE. However, that new plan is not immediately available, and accessing those benefits may come at a significant price. Here\u2019s what borrowers should know.\nStudent Loan Interest Under SAVE Plan Resumes\nLast Friday, interest began accruing again for millions of SAVE plan student loan borrowers. Interest rates had been effectively set to 0% since August 2024 after the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction which blocked the program. This decision, which paused but did not strike down the SAVE plan, forced millions of borrowers into an administrative forbearance that has suspended all payments and interest for the last 12 months.\nBut, following the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt decision in July to resume interest for SAVE plan borrowers, interest started accruing again as of August 1, 2025.\n\u201cYour loan(s) in the SAVE forbearance will begin accruing interest on Aug. 1, 2025,\u201d reads a mass email sent to the nearly eight million borrowers who have been in the SAVE forbearance. \u201cYou won't have to make payments until the courts reach a final decision and the SAVE forbearance ends, but your balance will grow when interest starts accruing on Aug. 1, 2025.\u201d\nAs a result, borrowers\u2019 student loan balances have started increasing. Borrowers can make voluntary payments to reduce or pay off that interest as it accrues, but they are not required to do so at this time. Notably, student loans enrolled in SAVE remain in an administrative forbearance status even as interest accrues. That means that while voluntary payments are allowed, they still won\u2019t count toward student loan forgiveness for income-driven repayment or Public Service Loan Forgiveness.\nBorrowers\u2019 only other option would be to switch to a different repayment plan.\n\u201cEligible borrowers can apply for or recertify under the Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Repayment Plans,\u201d says department guidance that was updated in July following the announcement about interest resuming.\nBut while switching to the ICR, IBR, and PAYE plans would allow borrowers to start making qualifying payments toward student loan forgiveness under IDR plans and PSLF again, that won\u2019t stop interest from accruing. These older income-driven repayment plans have limited interest benefits. The IBR plan will cover interest accrual for subsidized federal student loans during the first three years of enrollment, while PAYE limits the amount of interest that can be capitalized (meaning added back on to the loan principal). But aside from that, these repayment plans have no meaningful interest benefits. And if a borrower\u2019s monthly payment is less than the amount of monthly interest accrual, their overall loan balance will increase over time, even as they make their required payments. This is a process called negative amortization, and can lead to huge balance growth.\nNew RAP Option Would Suspend Excess Student Loan Interest\nThe good news for student loan borrowers is there will soon be a new repayment plan option that could restore some significant interest benefits. The Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP, is a new income-driven repayment plan that was enacted under President Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill.\u201d RAP will have monthly payments tied to income much like the existing income-driven plans, and RAP also will be a qualifying repayment plan for the PSLF program.\nOne of the most significant benefits of RAP compared to existing income-driven repayment plans is an interest and principal subsidy. The plan would waive any excess interest that accrues above a borrower\u2019s minimum required RAP payment, and would also allow up to $50 of each monthly payment to be applied directly to principal. Previously, federal law mandated that 100% of a federal student loan payment must go entirely to interest before any portion of that payment would be applied to principal. This is not as generous as the interest freeze under the SAVE plan forbearance, but it is more beneficial than the interest-only subsidy that had been offered under the SAVE plan itself.\nTaken together, while RAP would not halt all interest accrual, the principal and interest subsidy would prevent runaway balance growth and mitigate interest accrual for borrowers with a high debt-to-income ratio. This will allow borrowers to gradually reduce their student loan balance, even if they have very low payments.\nRAP Has Downsides That Could Be Costly For Student Loan Borrowers\nBut RAP has some significant downsides, which student loan borrowers should be aware of:\n- The RAP interest and principal subsidy would only apply to borrowers whose calculated monthly payment is less than the amount of monthly interest accrual. Borrowers whose monthly student loan payments exceed the amount of interest accrual would receive no subsidy.\n- RAP will likely have higher monthly payments for borrowers than what they had paid under the SAVE plan. Those who have experienced an increase in their income since they last provided the Department of Education with their income data may see an even larger jump in payments.\n- RAP has a 30-year repayment term before a borrower can qualify for student loan forgiveness. This is far longer than the 20- or 25-year terms offered to borrowers under ICR, IBR, PAYE, and SAVE.\n- RAP has a less generous treatment of family size for purposes of calculating a borrower\u2019s monthly payment. RAP only offers a $50 deduction in monthly payment per dependent child. The other income-driven plans have broader definitions of family size that include a borrower\u2019s spouse, the borrower\u2019s children who receive at least half of their financial support even if they are not claimed as dependents, and other individuals living in the household who receive at least half of their support from the borrower.\n- RAP\u2019s repayment formula is not indexed to inflation, in contrast to ICR, IBR, PAYE, and SAVE. That means that more borrowers will be pushed into a higher repayment plan bracket under RAP as wages rise over time.\nThus, some SAVE plan borrowers can eventually switch to RAP to retain some of the interest benefits associated with SAVE and the related administrative forbearance. But those benefits are not necessarily as generous (particularly compared to the SAVE plan forbearance), and they could come at a steep price when factoring in the potential downsides of RAP.\nWhen Student Loan Borrowers Can Access RAP\nEven if SAVE plan student loan borrowers want to quickly jump to RAP to mitigate the resumption of interest this month, they can\u2019t, as RAP is not available yet. The Department of Education has not expressly indicated when RAP will launch, and did not include any details on the rollout of the plan in a recent \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter that outlined the department\u2019s initial steps to implement the \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill.\u201d However, RAP is expected to launch no later than July 1, 2026, which is when new borrowers will be cut off from existing income-driven plans including ICR, IBR, PAYE, and SAVE."

      "text": "The Trump administration is set to start charging interest on student loans that are currently in the SAVE plan forbearance, contradicting months of assurances made to borrowers. Interest accrual will begin in August, and is expected to impact eight million student loan borrowers.\nThe abrupt policy shift, first reported today by Politico, comes as the federal student loan system faces unprecedented upheaval. The Department of Education faces massive operational challenges following layoffs and buyouts that reduced its workforce by nearly 50%, contributing to growing backlogs of applications for borrowers applying for income-driven repayment plans or requesting student loan forgiveness. Last week, President Trump signed legislation passed by Republican lawmakers in Congress that will repeal several popular affordable repayment plans and raise the monthly payments for millions of borrowers. And this summer, the department is expected to begin garnishing the wages for more than five million borrowers who are in default on their student loans.\nAdvocacy groups slammed the Trump administration, arguing that charging SAVE plan borrowers interest will burden them with additional costs.\n\u201cInstead of fixing the broken student loan system, Secretary McMahon is choosing to drown millions of people in unnecessary interest charges and blaming unrelated court cases for her own mismanagement,\u201d said Student Borrower Protection Center executive director Mike Pierce in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cEvery day, we hear from borrowers waiting on hold with their servicer for hours, begging the government to let them out of this forbearance, and help them get back on track\u2014instead, McMahon is choosing to jack up the cost of their student debt without giving them a way out. These are teachers, nurses, and retail workers who trusted the government\u2019s word, only to get sucker-punched by bills that will now cost them hundreds more every month. McMahon is turning a lifeline into a trap and fueling one of the biggest wealth grabs from working families in modern history. It\u2019s a betrayal.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what student loan borrowers need to know.\nSAVE Plan Forbearance Had Paused Student Loan Payments And Interest\nMore than eight million borrowers had enrolled in the SAVE plan by last year, or were automatically converted to SAVE from its predecessor plan, REPAYE. The SAVE plan is one of several student loan repayment plan options that allow borrowers make payments based on their income, with any remaining balance eligible for loan forgiveness after years in repayment (typically 20 or 25 years).\nHowever, a group of Republican-led states then filed a legal challenge against the Biden administration to block the program, arguing it was too generous and exceeded what Congress had authorized when it first passed a law allowing for the creation of income-driven repayment plans more than three decades earlier. Last summer, a federal appeals court issued an injunction blocking the SAVE plan. This forced millions of borrowers into an involuntary forbearance while the litigation continued. During the forbearance, borrowers have not been required to make payments, and interest has been set to 0%. But the time spent in the forbearance has not counted toward student loan forgiveness \u2013 both on the 20- or 25-year IDR repayment terms, and also for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.\n\u201cED has placed borrowers currently enrolled in the SAVE Plan (previously known as the Revised Pay As You Earn, or REPAYE, Plan) into a general forbearance because their servicers are not currently able to bill them at the amount required by a recent court order,\u201d says Department of Education guidance. \u201cInterest will not accrue under this forbearance, which will last until the legal situation changes or servicers are able to send bills to borrowers at the appropriate monthly amount. Furthermore, time spent in this general forbearance will not count for PSLF or IDR forgiveness.\u201d\nThe forbearance has continued for the last year. And despite misleading correspondence recently sent to borrowers by some student loan servicers contracted with the department, officials have confirmed that no interest should be accruing on loans that are in the SAVE plan forbearance.\nStudent Loan Interest Expected To Resume In August\nBut according to Politico, the Department of Education plans to resume charging student loan interest for borrowers who are in the SAVE plan forbearance. According to the reporting, the department is suggesting that charging interest is required under an updated, expanded injunction issued by the federal appeals court earlier this year.\n\u201cToday, the U.S. Department of Education announced it will take an additional step to bring fiscal responsibility to the federal student loan portfolio by restarting interest accrual for borrowers with loans in the illegal Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan on August 1, 2025,\u201d said the department in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe Department will take this action to comply with a federal court injunction that has blocked implementation of the SAVE Plan, including the Department\u2019s action to put SAVE borrowers in a zero percent interest rate status.\u201d\nBut nothing in the court\u2019s injunction expressly requires the department to resume charging interest on covered federal student loans.\n\u201cDespite representations by the U.S. Department of Education (the Department) to the contrary, no federal or state court\u2014including 8th Circuit Court of Appeals\u2014has issued an order instructing the Department to resume charging these borrowers interest or calling into question the Secretary\u2019s authority to waive interest accrual for borrowers whose payments have been suspended,\u201d said the Student Borrower Protection Center in a memorandum released on Wednesday.\nFurthermore, the abrupt resumption of interest appears to contradict guidance and prior assurances the department has provided to student loan borrowers over the course of the last 12 months \u2013 particularly that interest won\u2019t accrue \u201cuntil the legal situation changes or servicers are able to send bills to borrowers at the appropriate monthly amount.\u201d The legal situation has not changed, and student loan servicers are not able to bill borrowers under the SAVE plan given that the repayment formula is enjoined.\nThe SBPC warned that resuming interest charges will cause substantial harm to student loan borrowers, and will cause balance to balloon.\n\u201cThe Student Borrower Protection Center estimates that a typical borrower affected by this Trump Administration policy change will incur more than $3,500 in unnecessary interest charges per year or roughly $300 per month,\u201d said the group.\nWhat Student Loan Borrowers Can Do\nStudent loan borrowers who are in the SAVE plan forbearance can apply to change to a different income-driven repayment plan. The Department of Education has resumed processing applications for the ICR, IBR, and PAYE plans.\n\u201cThe Trump Administration will support borrowers in selecting a new, legal repayment plan that best fits their needs and helps them get on a sustainable financial path while protecting American taxpayers,\u201d said the department. \u201cTomorrow, the Department will begin direct outreach to the nearly 7.7 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan, with instructions on how to move to a legal repayment plan so borrowers can begin making qualifying payments.\u201d\nHowever, the department and its contracted loan servicers are contending with major application backlogs, exacerbated by the Trump administration\u2019s decision to shut down the entire IDR application system for several months earlier this year in response to the February court order in the SAVE plan litigation. As of last month, the department still had a backlog of 1.5 million applications, with many student loan borrowers having applied months earlier with no progress on their requests.\nThe department also appears to be suffering from deepening operational problems that are impacting IDR plans as well as the related Public Service Loan Forgiveness, or PSLF, program. The Trump administration removed an IDR tracking feature earlier this year that allowed borrowers to monitor their student loan forgiveness progress under IDR plans, and appears to have halted IDR payment count updates as well as student loan forgiveness under the IBR plan, which is not required under any current court order. The administration also appears to have stopped updating PSLF payment counts for many borrowers, as well.\nThe passage last week of President Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d adds additional complications to the student loan system. That legislation formally repeals the SAVE, PAYE, and ICR plans, which will force borrowers enrolled in those plans to eventually switch to either IBR (which could result in higher monthly payments), or the new Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP, which could keep borrowers in debt for up to 30 years. Technically, borrowers appear to still be able to select PAYE and ICR on their IDR applications, but these borrowers will likely have to change their repayment plans again, possibly as soon as next year, as a result of the new legal changes impacting student loans."

      "text": "One of the Department of Education\u2019s major student loan servicers has issued an updated notification clarifying that certain borrowers who have already applied for income-driven repayment should now consider submitting a new application to hasten processing. The revised guidance followed a more ambiguous announcement the servicer made earlier this month.\nThe statement by MOHELA comes as the IDR application system is under enormous strain. IDR plans, which are a type of federal student loan repayment option that provides borrowers with monthly payments based on their income and a path to eventual student loan forgiveness, have been inaccessible for millions of borrowers for months. At least eight million borrowers were thrown into an involuntary forbearance last summer due to a legal challenge over the future of the SAVE plan, the newest of four IDR programs. Many of these borrowers (some of which are pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a separate student loan forgiveness program) have applied to change to a different income-driven plan like ICR, IBR, or PAYE, but have been unable to enroll due to a massive backlog of applications. The backlog is in part due to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to temporarily shut down the IDR application system earlier this year following a new court order in the SAVE plan litigation.\nMany borrowers, particularly those stuck in the SAVE plan forbearance or recent graduates trying to enroll in IDR for the first time, submitted applications to change IDR plans months ago, but are still waiting on a response. MOHELA\u2019s latest announcement suggests that reapplying could speed things up. But doing so may come with risks. Here are the details.\nUpdated Student Loan Servicer Statement Suggests Reapplying For IDR\nMOHELA first posted a statement earlier this month suggesting that federal student loan borrowers who have applied for IDR should consider submitting a new application, particularly if they applied prior to April 27, 2025. This is roughly the date when the Department of Education began resuming IDR processing after revising the application form to comply with the latest court order in the SAVE plan litigation.\nBut MOHELA\u2019s initial announcement was difficult to decipher. The notice said that for borrowers who submitted an IDR application prior to April 27, \u201c Your application didn\u2019t include income info.\" MOHELA encouraged impacted borrowers to reapply. But many borrowers did include income information with their IDR application, and it was not at all clear whether these borrowers would need to reapply. The revised statement now displayed on MOHELA\u2019s website offers some clarity.\n\u201cIf you submitted an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) application prior to April 27th, 2025, and your application has not been processed yet, you can now reapply at StudentAid.gov to use your IRS verified income and select an eligible plan which may expedite processing,\u201d says the student loan servicer. \u201cYour previous application will be automatically canceled.\u201d\nThis suggests that borrowers don\u2019t necessarily need to reapply to IDR. But if you submitted an application prior to April 27th and are still waiting, MOHELA suggests that reapplying now could speed things up, particularly if you use the IRS data retrieval tool that links your income information from your tax return to the Department of Education\u2019s online IDR application system. This data retrieval tool has been down for much of the last year, but if is back up and running again, it could indeed expedite processing, as that is the tool\u2019s primary purpose. Borrowers who manually provide their income documentation by uploading it into the online application, or appending it to their paper IDR application, typically experience longer processing times.\nRisks For Student Loan Borrowers Reapplying For IDR\nStill, there are some potential risks student loan borrowers should be aware of if they are considering reapplying for their IDR plan. There are no guarantees that reapplying will actually expedite processing, notwithstanding MOHELA\u2019s statement (and note that MOHELA says it \u201cmay\u201d expedite processing, not \u201cwill\u201d). Anecdotal reports indicate that single borrowers are experiencing faster IDR processing than married borrowers, regardless of when they have submitted their application. And sometimes, submitting multiple IDR applications can cause unexpected problems such as delayed processing or multiple rounds of forbearances, which typically don\u2019t count toward student loan forgiveness.\nIt is also noteworthy that the announcement suggesting that borrowers reapply for IDR is only present on MOHELA\u2019s website. None of the Department of Education\u2019s other major contracted student loan servicers \u2013 such as Nelnet, Aidvantage, and EdFinancial \u2013 have similar announcements posted on their own websites. And the department\u2019s main website that provides guidance to student loan borrowers impacted by the ongoing IDR legal challenges provides no similar suggestion, either. Notably, the department\u2019s website was last updated on April 28, 2025 \u2013 the day after the cutoff suggested in MOHELA\u2019s announcement. So this information certainly could have been included with that update, in theory.\nCritics of MOHELA may also point out that the loan servicer has been accused of making misleading statements to borrowers in the past. Most recently, the servicer sent out letters to millions of borrowers in the SAVE plan forbearance suggesting that their loans were subject to interest accrual, even though the Department of Education has confirmed that no interest should be accruing during the SAVE plan forbearance period.\nThese Student Loan Borrowers Should Consider Reapplying\nTaking MOHELA\u2019s updated statement at face value, any federal student loan borrower with MOHELA-serviced student loans who applied for an IDR plan prior to April 27, 2025, and who manually provided income documentation by uploading it into the online application or attaching it to a paper application (or provided no income documentation at all), may want to consider reapplying. If you do reapply, be sure to use the online application system and opt into the IRS data retrieval tool when prompted, which MOHELA suggests is the key to expediting processing.\nMOHELA also notes in its announcement that, \u201cApplications for the SAVE plan and \u2018lowest monthly payment\u2019 requests are still on hold and loans will stay in an administrative forbearance.\u201d This is due to the ongoing legal challenge involving the SAVE plan. Borrowers who previously applied for IDR and specifically selected the SAVE plan or the option for the \u201clowest monthly payment\u201d (which are no longer even options on the newly-revised IDR application) should consider reapplying, regardless of who their student loan servicer is or whether they included documentation of their income with their original application.\nFinally, MOHELA says that, \u201cIf you have at least 1 loan on SAVE and 1 loan on another IDR plan, your application will remain on hold and your loans will stay in an administrative forbearance.\u201d This statement is fairly ambiguous, and it is not clear if the loan servicer is suggesting that these borrowers also should reapply for IDR. But if you meet this description, you\u2019re pursuing student loan forgiveness (particularly through PSLF), and want to get back into repayment, it may make sense to reapply if the only other alternative is remaining stuck in a forbearance."

      "text": "Today, the U.S. Department of Education announced it will take an additional step to bring fiscal responsibility to the federal student loan portfolio by restarting interest accrual for borrowers with loans in the illegal Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan on August 1, 2025. The Department will take this action to comply with a federal court injunction that has blocked implementation of the SAVE Plan, including the Department\u2019s action to put SAVE borrowers in a zero percent interest rate status. The Department had the authority under the SAVE plan to prevent borrowers from going into negative amortization, which is the authority the Department relied on to put borrowers in zero percent interest rate status. Outside of that regulatory provision in SAVE (which is enjoined), the Department lacks the authority to put borrowers into a zero percent interest rate status.\nMillions of borrowers enrolled in the Biden Administration\u2019s SAVE Plan based on the false promise of loan cancellation and zero monthly payments, despite multiple federal courts striking down such policies. The Biden Administration also invented a zero percent \u201clitigation forbearance,\u201d forcing taxpayers to foot the bill and leaving borrowers without clear direction on how to legally repay their loans.\nThe Trump Administration will support borrowers in selecting a new, legal repayment plan that best fits their needs and helps them get on a sustainable financial path while protecting American taxpayers. Tomorrow, the Department will begin direct outreach to the nearly 7.7 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan, with instructions on how to move to a legal repayment plan so borrowers can begin making qualifying payments.\n\u201cFor years, the Biden Administration used so-called \u2018loan forgiveness\u2019 promises to win votes, but federal courts repeatedly ruled that those actions were unlawful. Congress designed these programs to ensure that borrowers repay their loans, yet the Biden Administration tried to illegally force taxpayers to foot the bill instead,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. \u201cSince day one of the Trump Administration, we\u2019ve focused on strengthening the student loan portfolio and simplifying repayment to better serve borrowers. As part of this effort, the Department urges all borrowers in the SAVE Plan to quickly transition to a legally compliant repayment plan \u2013 such as the Income-Based Repayment Plan. Borrowers in SAVE cannot access important loan benefits and cannot make progress toward loan discharge programs authorized by Congress.\u201d\nJust weeks after the Supreme Court ruled the Department cannot unilaterally waive federal student loans in Biden v. Nebraska, the Biden Administration announced the SAVE Plan in a renewed effort to implement illegal student loan bailouts on the backs of hardworking American taxpayers. In June 2024, a federal court blocked parts of the SAVE Plan. As a result, borrowers enrolled had their federal student loans placed in forbearance with a zero percent interest rate. In February 2025, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the SAVE Plan is unlawful. A federal district court entered an injunction in April 2025 to implement the Eighth Circuit decision. To comply with this injunction, the Department is instructing its federal student loan servicers to begin charging interest on impacted loans starting on August 1, 2025. Interest will not be assessed retroactively.\nDetailed information for borrowers about court actions related to Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans is available at StudentAid.gov/courtactions.\nNext Steps\nBorrowers in the SAVE Plan will see their loan balances grow when interest starts accruing on August 1. When the SAVE Plan forbearance ends, borrowers will be responsible for making monthly payments that include any accrued interest as well as their principal amounts.\nTo compare available repayment plans, the Department encourages borrowers with loans in the SAVE Plan to use the Loan Simulator to estimate monthly payments under available repayment plans, determine repayment eligibility, and learn which option best meets their repayment goals. Borrowers who previously submitted an IDR application and selected the Income-Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn (PAYE), or Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plan do not need to submit a new application. SAVE Plan borrowers working toward legal loan discharges, such as through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, must switch out of the SAVE Plan to an alternative IDR repayment plan to start making qualifying payments.\nOn July 4th, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, which includes a new income-based Repayment Assistance Plan that will be available to borrowers by July 1, 2026. Since the One Bill Beautiful Bill Act envisions restricting enrollment in PAYE and ICR Plans in the future, and because those two repayment plans are currently impacted by legal challenges as well, the Department urges SAVE borrowers to consider enrolling in the Income-Based Repayment Plan authorized under the Higher Education Act until the Department can launch the Repayment Assistance Plan.\nIncome-Driven Repayment (IDR) Application\nApplying for an IDR Plan is quick and easy if borrowers provide consent for the Department to obtain their federal tax information directly from the Internal Revenue Service. This allows the Department to process borrowers\u2019 IDR applications faster and eliminates the need for borrowers to manually upload their income information. When borrowers allow the Department to access their federal tax information, annual recertification of borrowers\u2019 IDR plans is automatic.\nThe Department continues to make progress on the backlog of submitted IDR applications because of a processing pause put in place by the Biden Administration. Borrowers switching from the SAVE Plan to another IDR plan can expect quick and timely processing.\nCollections\nThe Department resumed collections on May 5 after a five-year hiatus and has emailed more than 23 million borrowers reminding them of their legal obligation to repay their loans as well as the benefits of making regular progress toward repayment.\nAs of late June, the Department received nearly $282 million in collections on defaulted federal student loans through voluntary payments and the Treasury Offset program administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury. The Department has not thus far withheld monthly federal benefits, such as Social Security payments, since restarting collections.\nThe Department expects administrative wage garnishment to begin later this summer."

      "text": "The House of Representatives on Thursday approved President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d that would make unprecedented changes to federal student loan programs. Republican lawmakers approved the bill on a narrow party-line vote, with all Democrats opposing the measure. The bill now heads to President Trump, who is expected to sign it on Friday afternoon.\nNever before has Congress passed legislation that would take away benefits and relief from current student loan borrowers and college-bound families on such a massive scale. Borrowers currently in repayment on their student loans or pursuing student loan forgiveness, as well as prospective students hoping to attend college or enroll in a graduate program, will now have fewer options to pay for school or manage their existing student debt.\nThe bill would also impose new restrictions and paperwork requirements for Medicaid and nutritional benefits, which are expected to result in millions of Americans losing access to healthcare and food stamps. GOP lawmakers argued the cuts were necessary to address alleged waste and fraud, and to help offset the costs associated with massive tax cuts. Democrats countered that the bill would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest people, raise the cost of living for everyone else, and endanger the nation\u2019s fiscal health by ballooning the deficit.\n\u201cRepublicans broke their promise to voters to lower costs, instead radically reshaping the way American families pay for the basics while sidelining the federal enforcement officials who hold big corporations accountable for treating families fairly,\u201d said Mike Pierce, Executive Director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, in a statement earlier this week. \u201cThis bill will drive patients deeper into medical debt, borrowers deeper into student debt, and working families deeper into debt to pay for higher energy costs, higher grocery bills, and more expensive cars and trucks.\u201d\nRepublicans, however, praised the legislation. \u201cThe One Big, Beautiful Bill is one big, beautiful win for the American people,\u201d said Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Tim Walberg (R-MI) in remarks on the House floor early Thursday. \u201cAmericans struggled under crushing inflation driven by the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s outrageous spending. Even worse, the Biden-Harris administration spent billions on reckless student loan repayment pauses, forcing Americans who never set foot on a college campus to cover the costs of elite Ivy League degrees.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what student loan borrowers need to know about the \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill,\u201d and what comes next.\nMajor Changes To Student Loan Repayment And Forgiveness\nWhen the Senate narrowly passed its own version of the bill earlier this week, there were some doubts as to whether the House would approve it, given some very significant differences between the Senate bill and the legislation approved by the House in May. But the Senate version of the bill ultimately won the day.\nThe legislation will phase out most current income-driven repayment plans by July 2026. The SAVE plan, as well as ICR and PAYE, would no longer be an option for any borrower, including those who are now in repayment under those plans. Those who are enrolled in SAVE, ICR, or PAYE would, at some point between July 2026 and 2028, have to either enroll in IBR or a new income-driven plan created by the bill called the Repayment Assistance Plan. Switching to IBR could result in significantly higher monthly payments for many borrowers, particularly those who had been repaying their student loans under PAYE or SAVE. While RAP could be more affordable for some compared to IBR, the tradeoff would be an additional five to 10 years in repayment before the borrower could qualify for student loan forgiveness. Borrowers who lose access to their current repayment plan and fail to make a selection would be forced into a Standard plan, which could be unaffordable for many.\nParent PLUS borrowers who have already consolidated their loans and are currently enrolled in any income-driven repayment plan would be able to maintain access to the IBR plan. But all other Parent PLUS borrowers would have a fairly limited window to act. They would have one year to consolidate their loans, or they could wind up being completely cut off from income-driven repayment and any possibility of eventual student loan forgiveness.\nThe GOP bill would also suspend new regulations enacted under the Biden-Harris administration that expanded access to student loan discharge programs associated with school misconduct. And it would slash most of the funding allocated to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog agency created to oversee and regulate the financial services sector, including the student loan servicing industry.\nMore Limited Student Loan Options Starting Next Year\nFor prospective students and college-bound families, the \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d would fundamentally change the landscape for higher education financing. For college students, Stafford loans would remain capped. Parent PLUS loans would still be available, but with severely reduced limits (a $65,000 lifetime cap). And any parent who already has a Parent PLUS loan, and then takes out a new Parent PLUS loan in 2026 or later, could become completely ineligible for any income-driven repayment program or student loan forgiveness, including through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\nFor graduate and professional students, financing options would also become more narrow. The bill eliminates the Graduate PLUS program, a federal student loan option that helps fund attendance at graduate and professional schools. Increased Stafford loan borrowing limits would partially offset the elimination of this option, but with lifetime caps of $100,000 for graduate students and $200,000 for professional students, it may simply not be enough to cover the full cost of expensive advanced degrees. Critics have argued that some prospective students may turn to riskier private student loans, or decide against going to medical or law school altogether, which would make existing shortages in high-need areas (like rural hospitals) even worse.\nAnd new borrowers who take out any federal student loans starting in July 2026 \u2013 regardless of whether they are graduate or undergraduate students \u2013 would have only two repayment plan options: a Standard plan on a 10 to 25 year term depending on the loan amount, or the RAP plan, which requires 30 years in repayment before the borrower could qualify for student loan forgiveness.\nStudent Loan Forgiveness Under PSLF Is Intact But Still In Danger\nIf there\u2019s any good news for borrowers, it\u2019s that Congress left the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, or PSLF, untouched. PSLF offers student loan forgiveness to nonprofit and government workers in as little as 10 years. An earlier provision of the \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d would have locked new doctors and dentists out of PSLF, but this provision was dropped by the Senate before passage, and the House approved this modified version of the bill.\nBut the Trump administration is separately working on a major PSLF overhaul through a rulemaking process that allows the Department of Education to change existing regulations governing federal student loans. The department completed a three-day negotiated rulemaking session this week as it works to implement President Trump\u2019s executive order issued in March that would restrict student loan forgiveness under PSLF for organizations that engage in activities with a \u201csubstantial illegal purpose.\u201d Critics have argued that the proposed rules are illegal without approval from Congress, and would allow the Trump administration to weaponize the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program against nonprofit organizations and state and local governments whose policies and missions don\u2019t align with the administration\u2019s."

      "text": "Millions of Americans will soon be cut off from critical federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, following passage of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d earlier in July. Under the bill, Parent PLUS borrowers will be blocked from several debt relief options, unless they take specific steps by certain deadlines to preserve access.\nThe changes are part of a broader package of reforms that will be implemented under the legislation over the course of the next several years. The bill repeals several popular income-driven repayment plan programs, creates a new repayment plan, imposes new caps and borrowing limits without directly lowering the cost of education, and limits the ability of the Department of Education to establish new relief options. Some of the changes are immediate, while others will be phased in over time.\nBut some of the most significant student loan reforms will hit the roughly four million Americans who have Parent PLUS loans the hardest. Here\u2019s what these borrowers should know.\nParent PLUS Loans Had Been Eligible For Student Loan Forgiveness\nParent PLUS loans are a type of federal student loan issued to the parent of an undergraduate borrower. While the student is the person who benefits from the loan by having their education paid for, the parent is the borrower. And it is the parent, not the student, who is legally responsible for the repayment of the loan.\nThese types of student loans have historically been able to access critical federal student loan forgiveness and relief programs, albeit on a more limited basis than other types of student debt. Individual Parent PLUS loans are ineligible for income-driven repayment plans, but can become eligible for Income-Contingent Repayment if the borrower consolidates their Parent PLUS loans into a federal Direct consolidation loan. ICR historically has allowed for student loan forgiveness after 25 years in repayment, and also is a qualifying repayment plan for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, or PSLF.\nICR is an expensive plan, and Parent PLUS borrowers typically cannot access more affordable income-driven options like IBR or Pay As You Earn. But for lower income borrowers, or people who have had a reduction in their income due to job loss or retirement, ICR can provide a lifeline by keeping monthly payments affordable and providing a pathway to eventual student loan forgiveness.\nBig, Beautiful Bill Imposes New Student Loan Forgiveness Restrictions For Parent PLUS Borrowers\nBut President Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d fundamentally changes the landscape for Parent PLUS borrowers. The bill will repeal several existing income-driven repayment options, including ICR. It preserves the IBR plan, which allows for student loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years in repayment. The bill also creates a new income-driven option called the Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP, that allows for student loan forgiveness after 30 years in repayment. Both plans qualify for PSLF. But Parent PLUS borrowers would be ineligible for RAP, even if they consolidate their loans.\nThe only way for Parent PLUS borrowers to maintain access to income-driven repayment under the changes imposed by the legislation would be to consolidate their loans (if they haven\u2019t already done so) by July 1, 2026, and enroll in the IBR plan \u2013 which the bill opens up to consolidated Parent PLUS loans \u2013 by July 1, 2028. Borrowers enrolled in the ICR plan would be converted to IBR or given the opportunity to switch once ICR is phased out.\n\u201cThe Big Bill significantly changes Parent PLUS borrowers\u2019 repayment options,\u201d said the National Consumer Law Center in a blog post published earlier in July following the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cOnly Parent PLUS borrowers that consolidate their loans before July 1, 2026 and are enrolled in any IDR plan between now and July 1, 2028 will be eligible for an income-driven repayment plan after the SAVE, ICR, and PAYE plans are eliminated on or before July 1, 2028. Those borrowers will be eligible for the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. They will not be eligible for RAP.\"\nAll other Parent PLUS borrowers would become permanently ineligible for IBR and, therefore, any income-driven repayment option. That also means they would effectively be cut off from student loan forgiveness. That is because, given that Parent PLUS borrowers are ineligible for RAP, IBR will be the only surviving income-driven plan available that provides a pathway to eventual student loan forgiveness. And borrowers typically must also enroll in an income-driven plan to pursue PSLF, as well. Without access to IBR, Parent PLUS borrowers cannot access these routes to student loan forgiveness.\n\u201cBorrowers pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) should note that while payments in a 10-year standard plan qualify for forgiveness, payments in standard plans with repayment periods longer than 10 years do not qualify,\u201d said NCLC in the blog post. \u201cExisting Parent PLUS borrowers who do not jump through these hoops in time will be locked out of income-driven repayment options, which could make it very difficult to manage their loans if they cannot afford fixed payments.\u201d\nTaking Out New Loans Next Year Could Also Limit Student Loan Forgiveness\nExisting Parent PLUS borrowers should also be aware that taking out any new student loans or Parent PLUS loans on or after July 1, 2026, or consolidating existing loans after that date, would also effectively cut them off from student loan forgiveness. By taking out a new loan or consolidating after the cutoff, the individual would be considered a new borrower and would lose access to IBR and, therefore, student loan forgiveness. The only repayment options for new borrowers starting on July 1, 2026 would be RAP (which Parent PLUS borrowers cannot access, even if they consolidate their loans) or a Standard plan.\n\u201cBorrowers that take on new Parent PLUS loans or consolidate their existing Parent PLUS loans after July 1, 2026 will only be eligible for the new standard repayment plan,\u201d said NCLC. \u201cParent PLUS borrowers should consider consolidating now, before July 1, 2026, and enrolling in the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plan so that they can preserve their ability to make reduced payments in an IDR plan in the future.\u201d\nBorrowers who take out new student loans in the future may also lose access to important deferment options, as well.\n\u201cIf borrowers consolidate or take on Parent PLUS loans after July 1, 2027 those loans will not be eligible for the economic hardship or unemployment deferments and will only be eligible for up to 9 months of many forbearances in a 2 year period,\u201d said the NCLC. \u201cThis could mean increased hardship and defaults for low-income Parent PLUS borrowers in the future.\u201d\nThus, Parent PLUS borrowers who want to preserve access to affordable repayment options and eventual student loan forgiveness under income-driven repayment plans and PSLF should consider consolidating their loans via the federal Direct loan program before July 1, 2026. And they should also consider enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan before July 1, 2028, and avoiding any further borrowing so that they don\u2019t get cut off from these programs."

      "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2025/07/16/new-update-on-student-loan-repayment-backlog-and-pslf-buyback-raises-alarms/",
      "text": "Secretary of Education Linda McMahon submitted a new court filing on Wednesday providing updates on the status of a massive backlog associated with pending income-driven repayment plan requests and student loan forgiveness applications for the PSLF Buyback program. The latest filing suggests that the Department of Education continues to make painfully slow progress in working through the application backlogs. And in light of new developments associated with recent legislative and policy changes, the backlogs may actually soon get worse.\nThe update provided by the Trump administration is part of an ongoing lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers over stalled applications for income-driven repayment plans and PSLF Buyback. The Trump administration had halted IDR application processing earlier this spring, arguing that a pause was required to update its systems to comply with a new court order associated with a separate ongoing legal challenge over the SAVE plan. The AFT argued in its lawsuit that the IDR shutdown was unlawful, and was also preventing borrowers from pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a separate program that can provide student loan forgiveness to teachers, nurses, firefighters, and other public servants after 10 years of qualifying payments.\nAfter the AFT filed its suit, the Department of Education resumed processing IDR requests. But the temporary shutdown exacerbated an existing backlog of applications. In the meantime, many borrowers pursuing PSLF who were stuck in the SAVE plan forbearance and were nearing the threshold for student loan forgiveness applied for PSLF Buyback because they were unable to quickly change their repayment plan. PSLF Buyback is a relatively new program that allows borrowers to make a lump sum payment so that prior periods of non-qualifying deferments or forbearance can count toward student loan forgiveness. But the surge in PSLF Buyback requests also caused a massive backlog, which was likely worsened by mass staff layoffs the Trump administraiton implemented at the Department of Education.\nIn April, the AFT and the department reached a temporary agreement whereby Trump administration officials would provide monthly updates on the application backlog associated with IDR requests and PSLF Buyback. In the meantime, the litigation would be temporarily paused to assess this progress. Secretary McMahon filed the department\u2019s third such update on Wednesday. But the newest update shows that the department is still struggling to process applications for repayment plans and student loan forgiveness, just as the department is pushing millions of additional borrowers to switch plans in the face of new policy and legislative developments. Here\u2019s the latest.\nTrump Administration Struggles To Process Surge Of Student Loan Repayment Requests\nThe Department of Education latest status report on IDR application processing shows that administration officials and student loan servicers have made only a little dent in the backlog.\nWhile the IDR application backlog has been reduced from nearly two million requests through April 30, the total current backlog is largely unchanged from the previous month. At the end of May, the department had processed 285,694 IDR applications, with 1,582,641 applications remaining in the queue. As of Wednesday\u2019s update \u2013 which reflects processing figures through June 30 \u2013 the department has only processed an additional 186,731 applications, suggesting a significantly slower rate of processing in June as compared to May. And, concerningly, the total number of IDR applications in the backlog stood at 1,511,504 \u2013 largely unchanged from the prior filing. If processing continues at the current rate (a net backlog reduction of roughly 70,000 applications), it would take nearly two years for the department to clear the backlog.\nThe Department maintains that it is making progress in working through the IDR application backlog, and blames the Biden administration for the large number of student loan repayment plan requests that remain in the queue.\n\u201cThe Department continues to make progress on the backlog of submitted IDR applications because of a processing pause put in place by the Biden Administration,\u201d said the department in a statement last week. \u201cBorrowers switching from the SAVE Plan to another IDR plan can expect quick and timely processing.\u201d\nBacklog Of Student Loan Forgiveness Requests For PSLF Buyback Grows Again\nThe latest filing also presented equally concerning updates about the PSLF Buyback backlog, which continues to move in the wrong direction.\nIn the department\u2019s initial filing in May, the backlog of student loan forgiveness requests under PSLF Buyback stood at more than 49,000. The backlog then grew to more than 58,000 the following month, despite the department having processed several thousand PSLF Buyback requests. Wednesday\u2019s filing indicates that the department has now processed another 2,224 PSLF Buyback applications, reflecting additional progress. But The PSLF Buyback application backlog has grown yet again from more than 58,000 at the end of May to 65,448 as of June 30. This means the backlog has grown by roughly a third over the course of the last three months, despite steady processing by the department.\nApplication Backlogs For Student Loan Forgiveness And Repayment May Soon Worsen\nThis bad news for student loan borrowers may only get worse due to new policy and legal developments. Last week, the Trump administration abruptly announced that starting on August 1, the Department of Education will begin charging interest on federal student loans that are subject to the SAVE plan forbearance. Borrowers enrolled in SAVE have had no payments and no interest accrual since last year due to the ongoing legal challenge over the future of the program. The administration argued that the resumption of interest charges is necessary to comply with a new court order in that lawsuit. But student loan borrower advocacy groups noted that nothing in that latest order requires the department to start charging interest again on covered student loans.\nAs a result of the administration\u2019s decision to resume charging interest on student loans subject to the SAVE plan, the department is now actively encouraging more than 7.7 million borrowers to apply to switch to a different income-driven repayment plan. The department also noted that the future of the PAYE and ICR plans is also in doubt, particularly after President Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d authorized the eventual repeal of PAYE and ICR, as well as the SAVE plan. The department suggested that these borrowers also consider applying to change their repayment plan. The Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR, would be the only alternative option. This could potentially add millions of additional applications to the existing backlog in the coming weeks and months.\n\u201cThe Department urges all borrowers in the SAVE Plan to quickly transition to a legally compliant repayment plan \u2013 such as the Income-Based Repayment Plan,\u201d said Secretary McMahon in a statement last week announcing the resumption of interest accrual. \"Borrowers in SAVE cannot access important loan benefits and cannot make progress toward loan discharge programs authorized by Congress.\u201d\nWhat Student Loan Borrowers Can Do\nSome student loan servicers have urged borrowers who applied for an IDR plan in April of this year or earlier to resubmit their application online using the newly restored IRS data retrieval tool, which can expedite application processing by automatically verifying a borrower\u2019s income. The Department of Education appears to encourage using this feature, as well.\n\u201cApplying for an IDR Plan is quick and easy if borrowers provide consent for the Department to obtain their federal tax information directly from the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d said the department. \u201cThis allows the Department to process borrowers\u2019 IDR applications faster and eliminates the need for borrowers to manually upload their income information.\u201d The department noted that student loan borrowers who provide this consent would also be eligible for automatic annual income recertification for existing IDR plans."

  "argos_summary": "Student loan borrowers are facing significant changes as the Trump administration resumes interest accrual for those in the SAVE plan forbearance, impacting around eight million borrowers. The recent 'Big, Beautiful Bill' will phase out several income-driven repayment plans, including SAVE, PAYE, and ICR, by 2028, forcing borrowers to switch to potentially more expensive options like IBR or the new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). Borrowers are encouraged to reapply for income-driven repayment plans due to processing backlogs and the need to secure their eligibility for loan forgiveness programs.",
