  "content": "Katie Miller, the wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, has confirmed she\u2019s left Elon Musk to launch her own podcast.\n\nThe former top aide in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)\u2014who dramatically followed Musk out the door to work with him when he left his government role in May\u2014is now rebranding as a podcaster, hoping to offer a female alternative to the MAGA male-dominated podcast world.\n\n\u201cFor years, I\u2019ve seen that there isn\u2019t a place for conservative women to gather online,\u201d Miller said in a video launching her podcast.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a place for a mom like me, mom of three young kids, four, three, and almost two, and a wife and trying to do a career, eat healthy, work out\u2026 so I wanted to create that space where we have real, honest conversations with people across the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, the video announcing the launch of Miller\u2019s podcast has gained 30 views on YouTube.\n\nMiller attracted headlines and speculation after she left her husband in the White House to join Musk full-time at his companies. Her departure is thought to have caused friction among White House officials and raised questions about her loyalties, especially as it was revealed she was on Musk\u2019s payroll the entire time she was working as a special government employee.\n\nThe relationship took an interesting turn in July after Musk unfollowed Miller on X, the social media platform the world\u2019s richest man owns, as Musk began distancing himself from the MAGA world following his fallout with President Donald Trump, including Miller.\n\nIn her launch video, Miller said she decided do her own podcast after \u201cconcluding my time working full time for Elon Musk.\u201d\n\nAmong the guests set to appear on her show are Vice President JD Vance and heavyweight boxing legend Mike Tyson. Speaking to Axios, Miller added there\u2019s one special guest she\u2019s particularly pining to appear.",

      "text": "Stephen Miller and his wife are putting forward a united front amid the couple\u2019s Elon Musk drama.\nA photo posted to Katie Miller\u2019s X\u2014the social media site Musk owns\u2014features the Millers and their three children enjoying a day at the beach. It shows Miller frolicking in the water and sun while her husband, who is tagged in the photo, can be made out in the distant background.\n\u201cThree kids later and I\u2019m in the best shape of my life. If you needed a reason to have kids here it is: they make you better, stronger and life richer,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBeing a mom is the best job in the world. Cheers to a weekend in the summer sun.\u201d\nThe beach day pic follows drama that erupted when Miller left the White House to work for Musk after the former chief of the Department of Government Efficiency left his post in late May.\nAfter Katie departed with Musk, the official account of the Democratic Party trolled White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on X with an image of an empty chair facing what appeared to be an empty bed, tagging @StephenM.\nThe situation drew even more attention after Musk\u2019s mud-slinging break-up with President Donald Trump in June. Stephen Miller was among the president\u2019s allies who rebuked Musk.\nHowever, there is reason to think that the relationship between Musk and Katie Miller might not be as strong as it once was. On Friday, Musk unfollowed her on X, raising questions about whether she is still working for him.\nEarlier this month, the couple posted a Fourth of July photo of themselves together, pushing back on rumors that Musk had caused a rift between the two.\nStephen Miller, the outspoken architect of Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan, first met his future wife while working in the White House in 2018. She was working in the Department of Homeland Security and eventually became a staffer for Vice President Mike Pence. They married in 2019.\nMusk became close with the Millers during his stint in the White House, with The Wall Street Journal reporting that he was with Katie \u201calmost all the time.\u201d He even spent time with the couple outside of work.\nThe relationship between Stephen Miller and Musk deteriorated as Musk ramped up his criticism of Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful\u201d bill, with Musk eventually unfollowing him on X."

      "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s right-hand man is the latest headed out the door in a DOGE exodus that includes the billionaire himself and Stephen Miller\u2019s wife.\nSteve Davis\u2019 exit follows Musk\u2019s announcement on Wednesday that his time is up at DOGE, where he launched a sweeping and chaotic four-month campaign to slash government waste.\nJust hours earlier, CNN reported Katie Miller, who is married to President Donald Trump\u2019s deputy chief of staff, was also out, with sources saying she will now work \u201cfull time\u201dfor Musk and has been helping to arrange media appearances separate to his government work.\nA top leader at DOGE, Davis managed daily operations such as hirings and firings and actioning Musk\u2019s directives on cost-cutting targets at various agencies, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news. A person familiar with the matter confirmed to The Daily Beast that Davis would leave his post.\nSeveral other top DOGE officials will also reportedly depart, including James Burnham and Brad Smith.\nNews of Davis\u2019 departure surprised some department staffers, who said he had been engaged in his work as recently as Wednesday, WSJ reported.\nThe exodus has fueled rumors of friction between Musk and Trumpworld, especially after the Tesla founder bashed Trump\u2019s signature spending bill. Stephen Miller was among the Trump officials who publicly hit back this week.\nDavis, an engineer, is a decades-long Musk loyalist who has worked for the businessman at his various companies, including SpaceX and the social media platform X. Davis has led the Musk-owned Boring Company since 2018. The New York Times reported earlier this year that Musk, during a transition meeting ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration, described Davis as \u201clike chemo,\u201d telling attendees, \u201ca little chemo can save your life; a lot of chemo could kill you.\u201d\nIn his Wednesday announcement, Musk said his scheduled time as a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d was reaching its end, and thanked Trump for \u201cthe opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.\u201d\nThe \u201cspecial government employee\u201d designation allows nongovernment workers to serve in federal roles for up to 130 days. For Musk, his window closes on Friday.\nThe world\u2019s richest man had shared his intention last month to step back from government to focus on his businesses, which faced brand damage and tumbling sales while Musk courted controversy and headlines by Trump\u2019s side.\nMusk told Ars Technica on Tuesday he \u201cprobably did spend a bit too much time on politics.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I\u2019ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks,\u201d he said.\nMusk set an initial savings goal for DOGE of $2 trillion in cuts, but conceded in January it was unrealistic. The department estimates it has found $175 billion in savings, but analysts have questioned if the numbers add up."

      "text": "Elon Musk has unfollowed Stephen Miller\u2019s wife, Katie, on X just weeks after dramatically stealing her away from the White House where she worked with her husband.\nMusk\u2019s poaching of Katie Miller, who left her position as a spokeswoman for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in late May to work for the Tesla CEO full-time, fueled speculation about where her true loyalties lie.\nWell, pull up a chair, there\u2019s a new twist.\nWithout any public comment on the fate of the highly publicized appointment, Musk\u2019s decision to unfollow Miller now raises the question of whether she is still working for him.\nKatie tried to put rumors about a potential rift with her husband to bed on July 4, posting a picture of herself with her husband on X in an apparent show of strength.\nMusk unfollowed Katie on X a week later, having previously cut ties with Stephen Miller on the platform after he threatened to primary any Republican who voted for the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d and accused President Donald Trump of appearing in the files of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\nMiller was among those to call out Musk during the explosive break up between Trump and the billionaire.\nIn May, the official X account of the Democratic Party trolled Miller with an image of an empty chair in a corner facing what appeared to be an empty bed, tagging @StephenM.\nWhether the unfollowing of Katie is a personal or professional snub remains to be seen, but her removal comes following a wider purge of MAGA loyalists by Musk, who also unfollowed Utah Senator Mike Lee and White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt yesterday. The Daily Beast has reached out to Musk for comment.\nOn Wednesday, Musk also unfollowed House Speaker Mike Johnson, the White House\u2019s Rapid Response account, Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace, and Energy Secretary Chris White, as his ongoing feud with the president continues to escalate.\nCaught in the middle of the Trump/Musk/Miller breakup are the employees of DOGE, who are reportedly being forced to state their loyalty to the president as the administration seeks to purge itself of the remaining Musk loyalists while Trump plots revenge on his erstwhile ally.\nWith neither Musk nor Miller at the helm, DOGE has reportedly fallen into disarray, according to Politico\u2019s West Wing Playbook. At least eight members of the original DOGE team have left the government along with Musk, with dozens more eyeing an exit.\nThe agency, once guarded by armed security, no longer has a sentry stationed at the entrance to its headquarters, and the \u201cAuthorized Access Only\u201d signs around the office buildings it uses have reportedly been removed."

      "text": "White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller continued to pump up the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d amid criticism from Elon Musk and others on the right.\nMiller, who spent considerable time Tuesday defending \u201cthe most essential piece of legislation... in generations,\u201d didn\u2019t mention Musk by name in his new batch of posts. But the tech billionaire leaving DOGE and bringing Miller\u2019s wife, Katie, out the door with him has added another level of intrigue to the spat.\nMiller began by disputing how the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the GOP\u2019s bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.\n\u201cOne of the bigger points of confusion on the BBB is spending vs. tax cuts,\u201d Miller wrote Wednesday morning.\n\u201cThe lefty CBO says extending the 2017 tax cuts (preventing their expiration) increases the deficit. Some critics have seen this figure and claimed or implied the bill increases *spending.* Even according to CBO, the bill cuts spending over $1.6 trillion,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cSo when a libertarian (eg Rand [Paul]) attacks the \u2018deficit\u2019 impact of the bill, they are attacking the tax cut. Of course, honestly accounted, extending current tax rates has zero deficit impact which is why the bill, because of its spending cuts, reduces the deficit.\u201d\nIn the same post calling the proposed legislation a \u201cdream bill,\u201d Miller touted that it \u201chas not a single Democrat provision or vote.\u201d\nDespite Miller\u2019s view of the situation, fiscal conservatives are wary. After Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul voiced his displeasure over the cost, Trump attacked him. Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson also spoke up, pledging to stop the bill even if the White House were to launch a pressure campaign against him. Johnson named two others in the Senate with a similar stance: Rick Scott of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah.\nYet Miller maintained that their concerns were off-base.\n\u201cThe only spending change in the bill is a giant spending cut,\u201d he wrote in response to Office of Management and Budget head Russ Vought accusing the CBO of using a \u201cbig gimmick\u201d in its calculations.\n\u201cThe entire \u2018deficit\u2019 change per the lefty CBO was not expiring the Trump Tax Cut from 2017,\u201d he added. \u201cFurther, because it\u2019s a [party-line] reconciliation bill, no monies are appropriated in the bill to fund government.\u201d\nMiller also responded directly to Paul in a post later Wednesday after the Kentucky Republican said he was in favor of voting on the debt ceiling and the tax cuts separately.\nPaul\u2019s \u201csole objection is that he wants to force Republicans and President Trump to make a deal with Schumer to raise the debt ceiling that he can then vote against,\u201d Miller argued.\n\u201cOf course, a deal with Schumer to raise the debt ceiling means a tax HIKE and a spending HIKE.\u201d\n\u201cSo, his sole demand, is to take a course of action that equals more spending and more taxing and still of course extends the borrowing limit.\u201d\nFiscal conservatives in the Senate aren\u2019t the only obstacles to the bill, though. Republicans who have objected to the proposal\u2019s cuts to Medicaid include Josh Hawley of Missouri, Maine\u2019s Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry Moran of Kansas, and Jim Justice of West Virginia.\nThe CBO estimates that the Republican bill would cause 10.3 million people to lose Medicaid coverage, the majority being residents of states Trump won in 2024."

      "text": "Alex Cooper, host of the Call Her Daddy podcast, is being called out by angry fans over her interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.\nCooper faced a backlash on social media, with regular listeners of the podcast, known for its frank discussions about sexuality and advice for women, accusing her of peddling propaganda for the Democratic Party nominee.\nHarris is also getting flak for dodging mainstream media interviews\u2014and hardball questions\u2014and instead plumping for cozy chats with softball questions from \u201csafe\u201d interviewers.\nSome fans left remarks on the show\u2019s Instagram account congratulating Cooper for the coup in getting the Democratic Party White House hopeful onto the podcast rated second in popularity only to Joe Rogan\u2019s show in the United States.\nBut others said they would never listen again\u2026 and asked when Cooper would be interviewing Donald Trump.\nThe interview avoided the podcast\u2019s usual raunchy content, sticking largely to go-to Harris campaign talking points and steering clear of potential lightning rod topics such as illegal immigration and the Biden administration response to Hurricane Helene.\n\u201cOne of my most favorite podcasts and now I\u2019ll never listen again. Unbelievable,\u201d wrote one (former) fan.\n\u201cDONE, this was my fav podcast. I\u2019m 100% disgusted,\u201d posted another.\n\u201cProbably just lost a lot of followers,\u201d was another user\u2019s view.\n\u201cI\u2019m so disappointed, this feels like propaganda and trying to make her look \u2018gen z.\u201d\nMany complained that the hurricane disaster wasn\u2019t addressed.\n\u201cCall her daddy was more important than the millions who could use aid with rebuilding their homes ?!\u201d read one comment.\n\u201cDid you discuss the plan for getting all the bodies that got swept into the trees and along the riverbanks in NC during the taping of this podcast?\u201d was the next post.\n\u201cLoved CHD from the beginning, but really disappointed you chose to do this one. Why alienate so many of your fans? Especially during a natural disaster when she should have been on the ground helping people,\u201d remarked another.\nOne even went so far as to write: \u201cDamn call her daddy about to be canceled.\u201d\nThe comments were not all negative, however. Many praised Cooper for her \u201ciconic\u201d interview.\n\u201cFor those angry about this, missed the whole point. It\u2019s about women and as an interviewer, you interview all walks of life and people. She nailed it and is not telling anyone how to vote. Great work @alexandracooper,\u201d said a fan.\n\u201cOmg daddy this was just everything,\u201d gushed another. \u201cYou kept your composure and was amazing of course but omg the VP of the States.\u201d\nNot everyone cared about the politics, however. \u201cI need that hoodie,\u201d one user wrote, referring to Cooper\u2019s lavender \u201cUnwell Network\u201d sweater."
