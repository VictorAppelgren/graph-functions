  "title": "The Home Renovation Realtors Say Could Diminish Property Value",
  "description": "Before you undertake any major renovations, there's one thing you should never do, as it may diminish your property's value according to the professionals.",
  "content": "With so much uncertainty in today's housing market, it's understandable if you're confused about what kind of renovations will improve your bottom line. The internet is rife with advice about the front door paint colors that can boost resale value, which countertop materials people love (and hate), and those major red flags that drive potential buyers away. If your home is older or just feels outdated, you may be considering more than just minor cosmetic upgrades before listing it for sale. But think twice before doing any major conversion that results in losing a bedroom, because it's one home renovation realtors say could diminish your property value.\n\nLimited inventory, skyrocketing prices, and interest rate anxieties, make this a challenging time to sell your home. Along with getting your listing price just right, you'll likely be thinking about what features are most likely to attract buyers. According to Zillow, 77% of buyers describe homes having the desired number of bedrooms as extremely important. In fact, only budget and air conditioning rank higher!\n\nAs multi-generational living becomes more common, and homeowners are moving half as often as they used to, many buyers carefully consider the number of bedrooms to make sure they will accommodate children, in-laws, guests, and remote work spaces now and in the future. According to Texas real estate agent Jordan Suber, \"Converting a bedroom into another type of space (such as a home office, gym, or storage room) can decrease your home's value, especially if it reduces the number of bedrooms below what's typical for similar homes in the area.\" Instead of a full conversion, consider staging a spare bedroom to demonstrate it's multi-purpose potential instead.\n\nRead more: Home Upgrades That Are A Waste Of Money, According To HGTV's Mike Holmes\n\nReducing Your Bedroom Count Is Likely To Lower Your Home's Listing And Appraisal Value\n\nReducing the bedroom count can drastically reduce your home's appeal with potential buyers. Eliminating a bedroom to create a closet or larger suite is a common mistake, especially if you're anxious to sell your historic home. \"Homeowners, in a misguided attempt to make an old house more current combine two bedrooms into a larger one or create a master suite at the expense of another bedroom.\" Atlanta-based broker Greg Kurzner cautioned. \"But if you turn a 4-bedroom home into a 3-bedroom home \u2013 when comparable homes have 4 bedrooms, the house might be worth less after the improvement,\" he stated. It's a sentiment repeated ad nauseam by realtors across the country.\n\nThey're not the only ones sounding the alarm. Appraisers like Ryan Lundquist also warn that \"apples-to-apples\" valuations of your home will be based on the true number of bedrooms. If you convert a bedroom to a den, gym, or playroom, buyers may see the bigger picture but Lundquist says \"it's a quick way to lose marketability (and maybe value.)\"\n\nFHA, VA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and even conventional loans all typically require appraisals that follow strict guidelines when it comes to accurate bedroom counts. If you remove or alter a bedroom, the appraisal could lead to a lower valuations or loan complications. Converting a bedroom into another type of space can also create significant zoning, code compliance, permitting, and insurance challenges that can rear their ugly head before you make it to the closing table. Consider a conversion carefully to avoid fines, or worse, costly refits that make a potential buyer quickly run the other way.\n\nEnjoyed this article?

      "text": "The Front Door Paint Colors That Can Boost Resale Value, According To Our Paint Expert\nEveryone wants to ensure that they can get the most bang for their buck when putting their home on the market. While you don't want to sink a lot of capital into remodels right before you move out, something as simple as a coat of paint can help make your property seem more attractive to a bigger pool of buyers. For example, according to a 2023 poll by Alside, a manufacturer of vinyl siding, consumers are currently most attracted to off-white exteriors (clocking in at 20%) and white exteriors (following closely at 14%). While not everyone can repaint their brick or vinyl, they can at least repaint their door. But what color will help fetch the highest bidder? In an exclusive interview with House Digest, we asked Sue Wadden, the director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams, which color can garner the most positive attention. However, the answer is a bit layered.\nAs it turns out, the best colors to choose are those that either match the style of your home or are currently trending. You want it to boost curb appeal and make your house memorable for buyers who are visiting multiple listings per week. \"A front door is the perfect place to experiment and add a fun pop of color to set a home apart from others on the block,\" Wadden reveals. The worst colors to choose are those that are high maintenance or can appear dirty quickly.\nChoose colors that are bold or trending\nFirst, the best color for resale is the one that will help make your home stand out in buyers' memories. \"When you think about driving around different neighborhoods, a bold, eye-catching color draws the most attention and is also that unique feature of the home that can display the homeowner's personality from the outside,\" Wadden tells House Digest exclusively. But when it comes to choosing the best color with the highest resale value, the answer isn't so cut and dry. \"It is truly up to personal preference and the design style a homeowner is trying to achieve,\" Wadden says. However, if you need help narrowing down what that preference is, she shares what is currently trending.\n\"Red has been popular for years and always stands out when paired with a white or brick exterior,\" she says. \"Deeps and darks are really trending, especially with a dark or natural exterior because they lend elegance and sophistication to the exterior look.\" If you want to tap into the zeitgeist, she recommends considering Sherwin-Williams' Color of the Year, Upward SW 6239, for a front-door contender. It echoes the current Coastal Grandmother decor trend, making it feel fresh and current. She also recommends bright, natural tones like Basque Green SW 6426 and Kale Green SW 6460 for the trend.\nAvoid white, yellow, and multicolored designs\nGiving your front door a quick coat of paint can really make it market-ready. Wadden tells House Digest exclusively, \"A door might be on the older side, and the style might be a bit outdated. However, a fresh coat of paint with a bold pop of color paired with some new hardware instantly gives it new life and a new look for the home exterior.\" But that doesn't mean any color paint will work. There are two that you want to avoid since they're high maintenance: yellow and white. \"Yellows can be difficult to maintain on a front door and sometimes induce feelings of anxiety. White is generally a go-to but can become very dirty in such a high-traffic part of the home,\" she explains.\nWhile you want your exterior to be memorable and show off your personality, you don't want to go too far with it. Make sure to choose only one color and leave the rainbow motifs for your new house; multicolored doors are a little too eccentric to appeal to many buyers. \"While a solid color door can suit many styles and design aesthetics, multicolored doors tend to be very personal and may not be attractive to every future homeowner,\" Wadden notes, adding, \"Solid colors will serve a seller best for that mass appeal.\" Follow these tips and you might just fetch higher bids than your realtor thought you would."

      "text": "Imagine a house that used to be three bedrooms until the owner converted one room into a den. Is there a big hit to value now? Will the appraiser only give credit for two bedrooms? Let\u2019s consider some thoughts below. Anything to add?\n1) Big deal for value: First off, there can be a huge difference in value between a property that has three full bedrooms and one that only has two bedrooms with no other space that could possibly be used as a bedroom (such as a den). A three-bedroom unit simply has more utility and marketability, so when appraising a classic two-bedroom property I definitely want to take an \u201capples to apples\u201d approach in my comp selection by finding other two-bedroom homes since those ones are most similar in appeal.\n2) Buyers see the bigger picture: Sometimes we see homes that technically only have two bedrooms because a buyer selected a builder\u2019s \u201cden option\u201d or maybe a seller removed a closet in the third bedroom. We\u2019d be right to classify these homes as 2-bedroom properties, but at the same time my sense is if there\u2019s an extra den or office that can be easily converted to a bedroom, buyers see the bigger picture of the house without getting too stuck on one less closet. Thus we can probably compare a house like this with other three-bedroom homes more than classic two-bedroom homes. Though we have to consider any impact to value for the lack of a closet.\nEXAMPLE 1: A seller closed up a bedroom closet to use the space as an office and is now concerned an appraiser is not going to give him credit for the extra \u201cbedroom.\u201d Since there isn\u2019t a closet, an appraiser will likely label the home as two bedrooms, BUT the appraiser will also recognize the house can very easily have an extra bedroom with the addition of a closet. Since the house is so much closer to being a three-bedroom home, it would be very limiting to only use classic 2-bedroom comps (see #3 below too). In other words, buyers see the big picture of a house and they probably aren\u2019t going to expect a massive price reduction over one simple closet being removed.\nEXAMPLE 2: I was asked how to value a 2-bedroom house that was close to 3000 sq ft and there were no other \u201ccomps\u201d that size with only two bedrooms. But the thing is this house had extra space that could easily be converted to a third and fourth bedroom with the addition of closets. In situations like this it\u2019s so easy to get locked into a rigid comp search and only look at two-bedroom homes. I\u2019m a big fan of \u201capples to apples\u201d where possible, but sometimes we have to step back and look at properties like buyers do. In this case there were multiple offers on the home because buyers were seeing the bigger picture of value rather than getting wrapped up in two closets missing. It\u2019s possible this home could still sell at a discount, but let\u2019s not start comparing it with significantly smaller two-bedroom \u201ccomps\u201d either because that\u2019s not what buyers are doing.\n3) Logic and adjustments: Whenever we see a difference in bedroom count it\u2019s easy to give a canned value adjustment. So without any research we hear, \u201cThe value difference between a 2-bedroom and 3-bedroom home is $20,000.\u201d Okay, maybe that number works sometimes, but let\u2019s step back and think like logical buyers. If looking at a home that has a den option that is otherwise similar to a traditional bedroom, it might cost around $2,000 to add a closet. In a situation like this does it really make logical sense to give a $20,000 negative adjustment? In other words, would buyers truly penalize a property at $20,000 because there is technically no closet? I would venture to say most buyers are probably not going to expect a huge price discount for such a minor cost-to-cure.\n4) The market might not care: Sometimes the market doesn\u2019t show much of a price impact for only having two bedrooms. We see this in 55+ communities, but we might also see it with architecturally interesting properties where prospective buyers might not need extra bedrooms. This is a good reminder to step back from being trigger-happy about giving the same value adjustment since the market doesn\u2019t always make an adjustment.\n5) Pro tip on downsizing: I recommend not turning a 3-bedroom to a 2-bedroom house. I see this happen when an owner wants a larger master bedroom, but it\u2019s a quick way to lose marketability (and maybe value).\nI hope this was helpful or interesting.\nThink Like an Appraiser Class (I\u2019m teaching): By the way, I\u2019m doing my favorite class on Dec 7 from 9am-12pm called How to Think Like an Appraiser. We\u2019ll talk through comp selection, making adjustments, tips for talking about value, and what to do in various scenarios. Details here.\nQuestions: What is #6? Do you have any stories or examples to share about the value difference (or lack thereof) between bedrooms? Anything else to add?\nIf you liked this post, subscribe by email (or RSS). Thanks for being here.\nJoe Lynch says\nBedroom count is a significant factor for acreage properties with septic systems. System size is dictated by bedroom count so the den that works as an additional bedroom in town doesn\u2019t work in this case.\nAlso, bedroom count is a buyer filter. Many families need at least 3 bedrooms, limiting the market for true two bedroom homes.\nGood post. I usually handle dens as functionally equivalent to additional bedrooms. Adding a closet is a rounding error.\nRyan Lundquist says\nFantastic point about acreage properties. I\u2019m glad you mentioned that. So true. I agree about a market filter too. This is why many agents will list a property as \u201c2-3\u201d or maybe \u201c3\u201d with as asterisk or explanation. I\u2019ve had this bedroom conversation about 4-5 times over the past month, so I knew a blog post was fitting. I look forward to seeing how the conversation unfolds. Thanks for your take Joe. I always appreciate it.\ndarryl says\nbeing the seller in contract can I cancel and collect deposit if the appraisal was done wrong my house is a 3 bedroom all 3 bedrooms have closets and windows. but the appraiser appraised my home as a 2 bedroom with a den.\nRyan Lundquist says\nHi Darryl. Thanks for reaching out. That\u2019s more of a legal or real estate broker question, so I\u2019d defer to them. Sorry. I wish I could be more help. This is where the fine print in the contract matters, so I think your agent / broker is going to be your best resource.\nGary Kristensen says\nAll great thoughts. As I was reading it, I\u2019m thinking about the 55 and over community and two bedrooms being common, then you said it. It just goes to show, appraisers have to look at properties through the eyes of the typical buyer in that market. How do appraisers know how the typical buyer would see something? Appraisers need to get out there and interview parties to similar transactions to see what they were thinking.\nRyan Lundquist says\nYes. Well said. \u201cAppraisers have to look at properties through the eyes of the typical buyer in that market.\u201d Thank you Gary. Even in my two examples above it would be easy to make a big deal about a lack of closets, but if buyers are not making a big deal about it, there is no sense in giving too much power or big adjustments for having technically two bedrooms.\nTom Horn says\nGreat questions, Ryan. I think as appraisers we can sometimes not put ourselves in the place of the buyer but in reality that is exactly what we should be doing because we as appraisers must measure buyer perceptions and actions. I think the \u201cextracted\u201d adjustments we sometimes come up with needs to be compared to the \u201ccost to cure\u201d like you pointed out. The $2,000 cost of adding a closet is much more logical to consider as opposed to the $20,000 bedroom adjustment.\nRyan Lundquist says\nThank you Tom. Very well stated. I agree with your thoughts. Thank you.\nJacob Brewster says\nRyan, excellent post as usual. I can tell you, having appraised in California for 15 years and now in Utah for the past 2 years, this gets much more complicated when you add in basements. It\u2019s not uncommon to have 1 bedroom in the \u201croom count\u201d (above grade), and then the finished basement to include another 2-4 bedrooms (I\u2019ve seen 3000+ Sq Ft GLA have only 1 bedroom). Basements are tricky because different buyers want different things. Some want additional bedrooms, some would rather use the space as a movie theater or rec room. My biggest takeaway from this was that it is important to interpret what the market expectations are. You can have a 2 bedroom home with a den/office that the market sees as an optional 3rd bedroom, and there is virtually no value difference when compared to a 3 bedroom home.\nRyan Lundquist says\nJacob, thanks for the kind words. I can only imagine the change from moving your practice. We just don\u2019t have too many basements in California, so we aren\u2019t used to all the issues like some other markets. Do you find appraisers in your area tend to include the basement as GLA or do they break it out separately? I know Fannie Mae\u2019s stance (https://sacramentoappraisalblog.com/2014/05/27/can-a-basement-be-consdered-square-footage/) and I am also aware that it\u2019s important to deter from their rule at times too. This is definitely another cog in the system to consider, and I\u2019m glad you brought it up. You nailed it with, \u201cit is important to interpret what the market expectations are.\u201d\nWes Blackwell says\nI would also advise that sellers not downsize the house from a 3 bedroom to a 2 bedroom.\nFirst, I think it hurts the property on the MLS and other sites. If I\u2019m a buyer only searching for 3+ bedrooms, I\u2019m not even going to see this property in the search results. So you\u2019ll lower the demand from the start.\nSecond, while some buyers have the \u201cvision\u201d\u2026 many others don\u2019t. Millennials are the next generation of home buyers, and most seem to be completely lost on the concept of a \u201cstarter home\u201d that needs a little work to make it shine. They mostly want something turn-key that doesn\u2019t need any hammers or screwdrivers to make perfect.\nIn general, I think homeowners should only stick to modifications that will improve the home\u2019s value or have a neutral impact, and shouldn\u2019t do anything that may possibly risk hurting the home\u2019s value should they decide to sell later on in the future.\nRyan Lundquist says\nGood stuff Wes. I really appreciate your take. I think your perspective is right on. The housing stock has definitely improved in my mind in terms of expectations over the past decade. So many properties were flipped in recent years that solid surface counters, for instance, are common now. Buyers really do expect more out of a home. Though you certainly have to pay more too, and not all buyers are in tune with that.\nI actually sat on a panel on affordability a few months back. It was interesting to hear people\u2019s comments and questions. People definitely wanted modern upgraded energy-efficient homes in close proximity to Midtown that were affordable. Unfortunately those types of homes around $200,000 don\u2019t exist in Sacramento in that location (or probably anywhere in Sacramento). One of the panelists did an excellent job talking about the concept of a starter home. The first home you buy isn\u2019t where you will live forever, so you have to just get in rather than check off everything on your ideal list. Sage advice.\nKellie says\nHi! I appreciate your insight into the 2-3 bedroom dilemma. I was wondering where in the spectrum you fall in considering \u201cwalk-thru\u201d bedrooms in old turn of the century farm houses as a third bedroom. They were traditionally used as 3rd bedrooms, and back in the day closets were rare in any of the rooms. However, in modern times it seems more like a loft or family room space. How do you see these properties being viewed in current market trends?\nRyan Lundquist says\nHi Kellie. Thanks so much for the comment. It\u2019s hard to give an opinion on something without really seeing it, but I\u2019ll pitch in some thoughts. I do have a blog post I wrote about a situation where I appraised a property where one had to walk through the second bedroom to get to the third \u201cbedroom.\u201d This might not be the exact same thing as what you are describing, but it does sound close. https://sacramentoappraisalblog.com/2016/03/07/why-did-the-appraiser-say-it-was-only-two-bedrooms-it-should-be-three/\nIn a case like this with walking through a bedroom to get to another I would say one of these rooms is NOT a bedroom. Yet if an appraiser colleague called it a bedroom with functional obsolescence, I wouldn\u2019t argue that. I don\u2019t know that we could say the market would always respond one certain way with a situation like this because in some situations the market might pay the same as a traditional 3-bedroom house. Though we have to recognize this is much different than a den that lacks a closet because this type of layout won\u2019t work functionally with some buyers. Thus my inclination is to say the value impact would more likely be felt in the market much more readily than the scenario I described in this post. I would think a home like this would more readily compare with a 2-bedroom more than a 3-bedroom, though it\u2019s not really a traditional 2-bedroom only though because of the extra space. If I remember correctly about the house I appraised the value was reconciled toward the lower end of the 3-bedroom market (which was also the higher end of the 2-bedroom market). Ah, value can be tricky\u2026. Thoughts?\nJack G says\nI find it interesting that the closet issue is such a strong influence when defining a bedroom. I am usually more concerned with doors. In most cases (at least in my market area). \u201cdens\u201d tend to have large entry openings with no doors. The space may serve a family well as a bedroom if it were able to be private. I am also told that in many parts of the world, closets are often mobile like furniture and can be placed in a room to facilitate storage of clothes and such. In any case, good information and opinions from everyone!\nRyan Lundquist says\nThanks Jack. I appreciate your take. Your comment underscores the importance of being in tune with the local market and what that market expects and/or mandates.\nKR says\nMaybe this article doesn\u2019t apply very well to us in the Midwest where most homes have basements. I\u2019ve rarely made a room count adjustment for two large bedrooms compared to three small bedrooms if GLA is similar. Especially when they have finished basements. Some of the most expensive homes in our area have only one bedroom above grade, and one or more in the daylight basement. I adjust for GLA but I\u2019ve not seen a real correlation between value and above grade bedroom count in single family homes.\nRyan Lundquist says\nThanks KR. Yeah, I wasn\u2019t really thinking of basements when writing this post. We certainly don\u2019t have basements in California like you either. I love your comment though. Every market is different and we have to continue to treat real estate that way. There are thousands of sub-markets throughout the United States and value does not work the same way in each of those markets. I\u2019m curious, do you tend to lump the area in the basement with the above-grade space? Do agents tend to list GLA as including both above and below-grade? It sounds like your market treats them about the same. Thanks again.\nrobert blakeman says\ni have a room that is on the second floor and is open to the floor below. Does this satisfy being a bedroom\u2026no privacy?\nRyan Lundquist says\nHi Robert. Thanks for the comment. It\u2019s hard to say without really seeing the room. If you wish you can email me some photos that might give me a better perspective to pitch in my two cents. All things considered, if there is no privacy, this sounds more like a loft area than a bedroom. One of the hallmarks of a bedroom is privacy (unless we are looking at a studio where the sleeping area and everything else is integrated).\nMbpstar says\nIf my egress window goes to an interior courtyard (courtyard is outside) would that qualify as a bedroom?\nRyan Lundquist says\nHi Mbpstar. Hmm, that is a really interesting situation. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever encountered something like that before while in the field as an appraiser. I know some Mid-Century Modern homes have bedrooms that open up to an interior courtyard, but if my memory serves me correctly the bedrooms like this I\u2019ve seen also have an additional window to the exterior of the property. I would welcome peers to pitch in on this issue, but here\u2019s my take. I\u2019m hesitant to consider this a bedroom. However, if this is a unique design and buyers very clearly label a space like this as a bedroom, it\u2019s hard to argue against that. But this sounds like a situation that is not safe, so I\u2019d be more prone to call it a Den or something else unless there was compelling market support to say otherwise. Am I correct in thinking that most bedrooms in the house don\u2019t have this set-up? In other words, does just one room have this layout? If that\u2019s the case, it may be the tell that this other area was clearly built as something else. Thoughts?\nMichael McCrea says\nYes the old owner added a bathroom and a bed/closet to the room. Building the bathroom blocked in the courtyard so its at the center of the house. The new bathroom does have a sliding window in the shower but I don\u2019t think it meets egress requirements. I was thinking maybe adding a fire ladder to the courtyard may work.. Ill have to talk to the city I guess but long process and costly either way.\nRyan Lundquist says\nInteresting. It seems there\u2019s always a story why a room or property is the way it is. I wonder what the city considered this room after the addition was done (assuming the previous owner used permits of course). If you hear anything definitive, I\u2019d be curious to hear more.\nJustin Dakoi Gonzalo Pozos says\nBackground: I have one of those \u201coptional bedrooms, but chose the den\u201d situations from my builder [12-year-old home].\nI since converted it to a bedroom by constructing 12 in. deep floor to ceiling bookshelves facing out to the foyer, with a hardboard wall panel backing. In the room, there are two windows, large closet, HVAC vent, centered lighting, and dedicated light switch, etc.\nI did not see any information in the local, state (TX), FHA regulations about walls and bedrooms.\nQuestion: Can I list this as a bedroom during the sale? or does the wall have to be traditional framing and drywall?\nA potential large-scale homebuying company said that it did not count due to the nature of the wall\u2026\nRyan Lundquist says\nHi Justin. Thanks so much. It\u2019s hard to visualize exactly what your situation is, so it\u2019s not so easy to give feedback or advice. It sounds like this room is still open to the rest of the house without a door though? If that\u2019s the case, it still seems like a Den because a bedroom is usually enclosed. This might not be a huge cost-to-cure, but if it\u2019s open to the rest of the house, I can see an appraiser not calling it a bedroom because it feels like a Den. However, an appraiser can still recognize it could become a full-fledged bedroom without too much effort.\nThere is no formal definition of a bedroom from FHA or Fannie Mae that I\u2019ve ever seen. There are some general requirements to consider though when it comes to building and such. Here is a post where I discuss some of the necessary items. https://sacramentoappraisalblog.com/2014/09/09/the-4-requirements-for-a-room-to-be-considered-a-bedroom/\nPlease feel free to pitch in thoughts back.\nMarlon says\nHi, I have a small house of around 512 sq ft that I\u2019m trying to refinance soon. The house has one bedroom and a 7.7\u00d77.3 Den with door and big window. On the county records it appear as Den or bonus room as well as on the purchase appraisal.\nDo you think that by putting a movable IKEA closet, the refinance appraiser will recognize the room as a bedroom even though is not 70 sq ft totally? If not, what to do in order to have that Den to be considered a 2nd bedroom.\nThanks\nRyan Lundquist says\nHi Marlon. Thanks for reaching out. A closet from IKEA isn\u2019t going to cut it for an appraiser in my opinion. Realistically I don\u2019t know that there is anything you can do here. It sounds like Tax Records, MLS sales history, and basic logic (it\u2019s less than 70 sq ft) all point toward this home being a one-bedroom unit. It is what it is. But the good news is this one-bedroom unit has an extra space, and that can sometimes be helpful when an appraiser chooses comps. After all, a one-bedroom with more functional utility is potentially more marketable and/or valuable than a one-bedroom without an extra space (that someone might use as a sleeping area even though it\u2019s technically not one). Regarding your refinance, here is an information sheet you might consider using to help highlight the features of your property when the appraiser comes over. Best wishes. Thanks for asking. https://sacramentoappraisalblog.com/2014/11/18/a-cheat-sheet-of-information-to-provide-to-the-appraiser-during-a-refinance/\nMarlon says\nThank you very much for your information. I did check the form and it\u2019s very helpful, I sure will use it to bring the appraiser the most information possible.\nOne last thing, I was curious about when you say that the IKEA Closet is not going to cut it for the Appraiser\u2026you mean because of the fact of the sq footage or because there\u2019s evidence that appraisers devalue the idea of a armoire rather than a permanent build closet. I just ask because the extra room/Den I was talking about is smaller because the closet of the one bredroom was built flush to the bedroom wall but it pops out inside the Den reducing the Den space. So, I was thinking the idea of removing that closet to add 2 extra feet to the den and I will have more room to fit a family member or visitor. Still the den will not meet the 70 sq ft as to be legal bedroom but I\u2019ll get more space inside anyways. Then, on the only existing bedroom I will put an armoire(IKEA closet) to still have all the bedroom features. Doing that I\u2019ll reduce some space in the bedroom but I\u2019ll still have around 76 sq feet(plus the 2 feet where the new armoire will go in).\nMy question here now is, do you consider that any appraiser will see as abad thing what I might do. Do you think it will take out value to the house by removing the existing permanent closet and putting an armoire. It will take more space of the bedroom but still on the acceptable room footage and at the time the Den will have more space available.\nI really appreciate your advice. Don\u2019t wanna find myself hurting the house value.\nRyan Lundquist says\nHi Marlon. My comment on IKEA actually has nothing to do with value. What I\u2019m trying to communicate is that the addition of personal property (an IKEA closet) in the Den doesn\u2019t all of the sudden make the room a bedroom. That\u2019s all I\u2019m talking about, so obviously one piece of personal property doesn\u2019t make the home worth more now (or less). As far as removing an existing permanent closet it\u2019s hard to say with certainty here. As a general rule of thumb I\u2019m not a fan of removing closets because the market tends to expect them. I would very rarely ever recommend someone to do something like that, though maybe in the right situation it could make sense.\nWould it affect value? This is a pretty minor issue and a simple cost-to-cure, so I\u2019m not overly concerned in that regard. Yet if your market expects closets, it would be a mistake to remove them. I personally would not do that, but it\u2019s your house. If your primary concern is value and marketability I would email a few local Realtors and/or appraisers and ask them if they think that\u2019s a good idea. My guess is they\u2019re going to say, \u201cNO, don\u2019t do it.\u201d But I could be wrong. Also, put yourself in buyers\u2019 shoes. Would it be acceptable to walk through a house and not see a closet? Think in terms of 100 buyers walking through the house. Would most of them be cool with that? That\u2019s thinking like the market and if you want a market-based answer, try to see if you can answer that question by collecting some opinions of your local real estate community (and maybe even others you talk to).\nJan says\nExcellent articles. We bought a 1960s home with 2 large bedrooms and another room used as an office/library/guest bedroom. This room has 2 doors: one door enters the master bedroom, one door enters the living room. One wall is all windows including sliding glass doors to the patio/pool backyard, and one wall is mahogany-colored built-in bookshelves and cupboards. We currently have a desk setup in the free corner between the 2 doors. There actually is a closet between one door and the sliding glass where we have installed a Murphy bed for guests. This \u201ccloset\u201d also has old fixtures as if a laundry area or sink was there in past. On the other side of the \u201ccloset\u201d wall is the wet bar. Could such a room be classified as a bedroom or den/guest room for listings? Thanks for great info shared.\nRyan Lundquist says\nHi Jan. Thanks for the comment. It is so hard to visualize exactly the set-up. I wish I could offer a definitive opinion, but it\u2019s not so easy to fully picture things. From what you are describing I wonder if this one some sort of conversion at some point."

The Answer is Yes.\n7 home improvements that can actually decrease your home\u2019s value, according to real estate experts\nWhen it comes to resale value, not all home improvements are created equal. In fact, some can even decrease your home value.\nBY TERRI WILLIAMS JULY 01, 2021\nYour home\u2019s resale value is (or at least should be) an important factor to consider when renovating and making home improvements. Surprisingly, the two least expensive home improvement projects have a huge payoff. There are also other reno projects that can provide a great return on investment when you put your home on the market.\nHowever, some \u201cimprovements\u201d can actually lower the value of your home and make it less appealing to buyers. These are the home improvement projects that you should avoid.\n1. TURNING A BEDROOM INTO A CLOSET\nWho doesn\u2019t love a large, walk-in closet? But if buyers have to choose, they\u2019ll place more value on bedrooms than on a larger space to store clothes and shoes. Tyler Forte, CEO at Felix Homes in Nashville, tells us that one of his clients turned a guest bedroom into a walk-in closet for the master suite.\n\u201cGenerally speaking, a walk-in-closet is a great feature \u2013 but not at the expense of an additional bedroom,\u201d he warns. \u201cOn average, each additional bedroom can add $10,000 to the value of a home.\u201d On the other hand, if you replace a bedroom with a walk-in closet, Forte says you\u2019re decreasing the home\u2019s value by $7,500 \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t even include the cost of materials and labor spent on the project.\nKris Lindahl, CEO and founder of Kris Lindahl Real Estate, which serves Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin markets, agrees. \u201cConverting a bedroom into a larger master closet will likely not increase value because you lost a bedroom,\u201d he says.\n2. COMBINING BEDROOMS\nCombining two small bedrooms to create a larger bedroom sounds like a good idea, right? Older homes may be quaint and have a lot of architectural details, but they almost always have small bedrooms (and bathrooms). \u201cHomeowners, in a misguided attempt to make an old house more \u2018current\u2019 combine two bedrooms into a larger one or create a master suite at the expense of another bedroom,\u201d says Greg Kurzner, president/broker at Resideum in Alpharetta, GA.\n\u201cBut if you turn a 4-bedroom home into a 3-bedroom home \u2013 when comparable homes have 4 bedrooms, the house might be worth less after the improvement.\u201d He admits that square footage is important but says that the number of bedrooms and bathrooms will also matter to homebuyers.\nKurzner\u2019s view is shared by Bill Golden, realtor/associate broker at RE/MAX Around Atlanta, GA, who advises against changing the home\u2019s layout in any way that eliminates a bedroom. \u201cIn an area of homes with 5 bedrooms, that may not matter much, but if your home is in a neighborhood where most homes have 3 bedrooms and 2 baths, and your renovation changes it to only 2 bedrooms and 2 baths, you may lose some value when you go to sell,\u201d he warns.\n3. PERMANENT CUSTOMIZATION\nSince you\u2019re the person living in the home \u2013 and paying the mortgage \u2013 it\u2019s natural to want the home to suit your likes and preferences. And that\u2019s fine, as long these changes are easy to neutralize when you decide to sell the home. Lisa K. Lippman, licensed associate real estate broker at Brown Harris Stevens in New York, NY, advises caution when integrating custom colors in a permanent way. \u201cBright colored stone or tile, an all-black bathroom, or bright blue cabinets in the kitchen will appeal to very specific taste and are not easily or inexpensively undone,\u201d she warns.\nKurzner agrees and also advises against materials and eclectic style that you love \u2013 but no one else does. \u201cEven certain decor can have a negative impact on your home\u2019s appeal, but at least that can be removed when you move out,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, when a buyer feels like they will need to \u2018undo\u2019 your improvement and \u2018redo\u2019 it over, the improvement has backfired and has likely cost you.\u201d\n4. BOLD PAINT COLORS\nPaint is a relatively easy home improvement project, but that doesn\u2019t mean buyers want to spend time and money repainting your home. \u201cPainting your home, either the interior or exterior, in non-neutral colors can decrease the value of your home,\u201d says Chris Fajkos, realtor at Tahoe Mountain Realty in Truckee-Tahoe, CA. You may prefer reds, purples, deep blues, and the like, but don\u2019t assume that buyers will. \u201cCurrent interior design trends continue to suggest that buyers want and expect neutral colors, and if you go against the grain, you may end up putting off buyers who would\u2019ve paid top dollar for your home.\u201d\nHere\u2019s something homeowners tend to forget. \u201cYour home is only worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it, so if prospective buyers see a costly paint job ahead of them, they might either offer under the asking price or pass on the home altogether,\u201d Fajkos warns.\n5. NOT MAINTAINING THE HOME\u2019S ARCHITECTURAL STYLE\nA home improvement project can also decrease the house\u2019s value if you use incongruous or cheap materials, according to Golden \u201cIf you have a Tudor style home with diamond-paned windows, and you replace them with plain vinyl windows that don\u2019t match the home\u2019s style, you will decrease your home\u2019s value,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, you have new windows, but if you\u2019ve ruined the architectural style of the home, you have not improved its value, and more than likely you have decreased its value.\u201d\n6. LOWERING CEILINGS\nBuyers love high ceilings, which open up spaces and make rooms appear to be larger than they really are. Lower ceilings can probably save on energy bills, but they can also induce feelings of claustrophobia. Keep that in mind if you\u2019re thinking about altering the height of your ceilings. \u201cLowering ceilings has long been a simple solution for lighting, wiring, or to create a delineation between an entrance gallery and living space,\u201d says Lippman. \u201cHowever, lowering a ceiling should be done sparingly, as it can also lower the property\u2019s value.\u201d\n7. ADDING A POOL\nSome buyers love swimming pools. However, experts are divided on how a pool affects your home\u2019s value. Sometimes, it may depend on which area of the country you\u2019re in. For example, Golden says he sold a home (in Atlanta) this spring that had a pool, and was inundated with offers. \u201cNow, in the era of COVID, when people have gotten used to staying home more, pools are at a premium around here,\u201d he explains.\nBut in colder climates, you might get a different response. \u201cAt least in Minnesota, installing a pool can be a downside to many potential buyers, and thereby have the effect of decreasing a home\u2019s value given the limited amount of time you can use a pool in Minnesota and the costs associated with maintenance and repair,\u201d Lindahl says.\nAnd even in warm climates, not every buyer will appreciate a swimming pool. \u201cThat\u2019s one of those home improvement projects that isn\u2019t going to return a reasonable percentage of the cost of the improvement,\u201d says Kurzner. \u201cNo matter how nice the pool, many people don\u2019t want them or the maintenance and costs associated, so that can negatively affect value.\u201d\nIf you are thinking about an upgrade/improvement on your home please check with me. I\u2019ll be happy to let you know how it will effect your home\u2019s value.

      "text": "The Home Renovation Realtors Say Could Diminish Property Value\nWith so much uncertainty in today's housing market, it's understandable if you're confused about what kind of renovations will improve your bottom line. The internet is rife with advice about the front door paint colors that can boost resale value, which countertop materials people love (and hate), and those major red flags that drive potential buyers away. If your home is older or just feels outdated, you may be considering more than just minor cosmetic upgrades before listing it for sale. But think twice before doing any major conversion that results in losing a bedroom, because it's one home renovation realtors say could diminish your property value.\nLimited inventory, skyrocketing prices, and interest rate anxieties, make this a challenging time to sell your home. Along with getting your listing price just right, you'll likely be thinking about what features are most likely to attract buyers. According to Zillow, 77% of buyers describe homes having the desired number of bedrooms as extremely important. In fact, only budget and air conditioning rank higher!\nAs multi-generational living becomes more common, and homeowners are moving half as often as they used to, many buyers carefully consider the number of bedrooms to make sure they will accommodate children, in-laws, guests, and remote work spaces now and in the future. According to Texas real estate agent Jordan Suber, \"Converting a bedroom into another type of space (such as a home office, gym, or storage room) can decrease your home's value, especially if it reduces the number of bedrooms below what's typical for similar homes in the area.\" Instead of a full conversion, consider staging a spare bedroom to demonstrate it's multi-purpose potential instead.\nReducing your bedroom count is likely to lower your home's listing and appraisal value\nReducing the bedroom count can drastically reduce your home's appeal with potential buyers. Eliminating a bedroom to create a closet or larger suite is a common mistake, especially if you're anxious to sell your historic home. \"Homeowners, in a misguided attempt to make an old house more current combine two bedrooms into a larger one or create a master suite at the expense of another bedroom.\" Atlanta-based broker Greg Kurzner cautioned. \"But if you turn a 4-bedroom home into a 3-bedroom home \u2013 when comparable homes have 4 bedrooms, the house might be worth less after the improvement,\" he stated. It's a sentiment repeated ad nauseam by realtors across the country.\nThey're not the only ones sounding the alarm. Appraisers like Ryan Lundquist also warn that \"apples-to-apples\" valuations of your home will be based on the true number of bedrooms. If you convert a bedroom to a den, gym, or playroom, buyers may see the bigger picture but Lundquist says \"it's a quick way to lose marketability (and maybe value.)\"\nFHA, VA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and even conventional loans all typically require appraisals that follow strict guidelines when it comes to accurate bedroom counts. If you remove or alter a bedroom, the appraisal could lead to a lower valuations or loan complications. Converting a bedroom into another type of space can also create significant zoning, code compliance, permitting, and insurance challenges that can rear their ugly head before you make it to the closing table. Consider a conversion carefully to avoid fines, or worse, costly refits that make a potential buyer quickly run the other way."

      "text": "One Major Red Flag That's Driving Potential Buyers Away From Your Home\nWhen selling virtually anything, you need a good price and solid marketing. But the most important thing you need is a quality product. The same can be said for homes. A 2023 Self survey revealed that most buyers are put off from buying a home that needs major renovation. This is because it shows that the property will require a lot of work until it is comfortable and liveable, so naturally, they might want to look elsewhere. To sell a home successfully, you need to have all your ducks in a row to keep potential buyers interested and willing to go through the process to get it.\nA property that appears to need major renovations can be one that has too many issues, needs a lot of updating, or both. This means that it's not always enough for everything to be functioning properly \u2014 homes these days also have to meet a certain standard of modernity and freshness. So as you address issues with the building and construction, also consider features that are out of style and need to make room for the new.\nMajor renovations and fixes\nWhen potential buyers can point out multiple things that they need to fix or change, they get discouraged because there are already so many costs associated with buying a home. To avoid this, fix structural issues and invest in the right upgrades. The same Self survey revealed that almost half of buyers and renters would stop the home buying process if they found out it had excessive moisture or mold. With this in mind, take issues of ventilation and water damage seriously by bringing in professionals if necessary.\nSome simple upgrades that will help you sell your house faster include new faucets, updated bedroom closets, and new lights \u2014 people don't want to think about having to fix leaks or change out old fixtures and furniture. Another point from the survey is the room buyers are most concerned with: the kitchen. Pay extra attention to this space when renovating and staging. If you want to splurge, kitchen upgrades like top-notch appliances, double sinks, and statement hardware are definitely worth the price."

      "text": "Everything You Need To Know About Preparing To Sell Your House\nHaving been considered a seller's market by Investopedia since the late 2010s, the real estate market is currently primed for sellers looking to capitalize on the limited inventory of available properties mixed with high offer prices from buyers. Because of this, you've likely thought about selling your home every now and again, but if you've decided that it's the right time to put your house on market, there are a few things you should know and do before diving in head first, especially if you're a first-time seller.\nAnd although some of the things may be more apparent than others, like cleaning your home and having repairs done, even the most obvious components of preparing your house for the market may be more complex than you think. Overall, you should be ready for just about anything as the real estate market has been known to be unpredictable (via Forbes).\nCleaning can be key\nWhile keeping your home clean may seem like an obvious part of putting it up for sale, your home's cleanliness may be more complicated than just daily upkeep and getting rid of junk. Zillow, in particular, has reported that your home's cleanliness can signal a number of things to prospective buyers, including lacking upkeep when it comes to bigger maintenance issues. To counteract this, plan on deep cleaning each room, including your closets and storage spaces, tending to your property's curb appeal, and removing any sign of or odor caused by your pets (via The Balance).\nHave an inspection done\nOne of the best ways to prepare your home for the market is by opting to have a home inspector come to take a look at it. While visiting your home, the inspector will determine a number of things, including whether or not the home is structurally sound and has outdated plumbing and electrical systems (via Zillow). Overall, pre-inspections can help you figure out what parts of your home will need the most care and upkeep, according to OpenDoor, as well as what parts of your home could be a dealbreaker for potential buyers.\nHandle repairs and touch ups\nFollowing your pre-inspection, you should plan on repairing and touching up anything that isn't working properly, is outdated, and has been damaged while you've been living in the home. The necessity of the repairs may vary and can include painting over scuff marks, installing new light fixtures and appliances, and replacing faulty pipes or wiring, according to Realtor. Overall, repairing the broken and outdated parts of your home can be an important part of the selling process as you may see your home's value increase with each project you do (via First State Community Bank).\nHave your home appraised\nWhile home appraisals are often associated with buyers, prospective sellers should consider having one done before listing their house, as there are a number of benefits to home appraisals. In particular, having an appraisal done can help you figure out the right price for your property, which in turn can help sell your house faster, according to Nationwide. And even if you aren't ready to part with your home, appraisals can still be helpful as they may determine if you've reached the threshold required to remove the added expense of mortgage insurance (via Mathis Title Company).\nUtilize home staging\nWhether it's done by professionals or not, home staging can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. If you choose to do it yourself, a good place to start is by taking down your family photos and decluttering each room, according to HGTV. Remember that your goal with staging is to make your home look as presentable and homey as possible so buyers can easily imagine themselves living there. This can be done by making your bed, setting your tables, adding in plants, and painting your walls a neutral color (via Investopedia).\nFigure out the pricing\nLikely one of the complicated parts of preparing your home for the market is figuring out the right asking price. And although having a real estate appraiser assess your residence can be a big help, it is just one of the many ways you can go about determining the price (via Forbes). According to Homelight, the five biggest factors that can influence your home's price point are the house's location, the prices of recently sold homes, the condition of the house, any improvements, updates, or additions, and determining the conditions of the market in your area.\nMarket your home\nOnce you've found the right price and handled your repairs and staging, you can begin the process of marketing your home. If you decide to do it yourself, you'll want to make sure you have the information needed to properly list the home, as well as an experienced photographer to take photos of your property. From there, you'll want to list it under for sale by owner on sites like Zillow and share it on social media. If you use an agent, the marketing process becomes more simplified as the agent will handle advertising the information (via Investopedia)."
