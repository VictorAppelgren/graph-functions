      "summary": "Shopify’s stock surged 22% after its Q2 2025 earnings, and it remains up over 80% year‑to‑year, driven by a 27% rise in gross merchandise volume to $163 billion and a 29% revenue increase to $5 billion. The company’s no‑code, fast‑loading platform and ecosystem—payments, marketing, AI tools, and now fulfillment—have given it a competitive edge, though its earlier attempt to build a fulfillment network was sold to Flexport and hurt the stock. After shedding that costly venture, profitability returned and operating income grew 51%, but unrealized losses still weigh on net income. The article also explains how revenue is recognized and why metrics like price‑to‑sales and revenue growth matter for investors, and it outlines the concept of competitive advantage and its importance for long‑term success.",
