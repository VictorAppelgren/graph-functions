      "text": "Heat wave bakes Southern Europe, sparking warnings to stay hydrated and indoors\n- Share via\nROME \u2014 Italian health officials intensified heat warnings Monday as Southern Europe began a brutally hot week with temperatures expected to top 104 degrees on a continent overburdened with summer tourists.\nCountries with borders on the Mediterranean Sea weren\u2019t alone in suffering. Authorities in North Macedonia extended a heat alert for the next 10 days with predicted temperatures topping 109 degrees while Kosovo also issued heat warnings.\n\u201cNever in my life have I experienced heat like this before in Pristina,\u201d Artan Kelani, a 22-year-old student, said in Kosovo\u2019s capital, where it reached 94 degrees Monday and was expected to get hotter starting Wednesday.\nThe Italian Health Ministry urged regions to beef up house-call services so that older people don\u2019t have to go out if they need medical care and to set up dedicated heat stations at hospitals to treat emergency cases. Rome braced for temperatures as high as 107 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday.\nThe Italian capital\u2019s civil protection office, volunteers and officials from the local water company plan to be at 28 locations, including the ancient Colosseum and open-air produce markets, to guide residents and tourists to fountains and to distribute bottled water.\nThe city government said that having volunteers fan out through the city would help hasten the arrival of medical help for people who seem to be suffering ill effects from the heat.\nThe culprit for the hot weather is a high-pressure anticyclone dubbed Cerberus, the multi-headed dog that guards the gates to Hades, the underworld in Greek mythology. Europe\u2019s third heat wave in a month is expected to affect much of the Mediterranean and last until Wednesday.\n\u201cThe bubble of hot air that has inflated over Southern Europe has turned Italy and surrounding countries into a giant pizza oven,\u201d Hannah Cloke, a climate scientist and physical geographer at the University of Reading in England, said in a statement. \u201cThe hot air which pushed in from Africa is now staying put, with settled high pressure conditions meaning that heat in warm sea, land and air continues to build.\u201d\nScientists say crushing temperatures that blanketed Europe last summer may have led to more than 61,000 extreme-heat-related deaths.\nThe mercury in Rome hit 102 degrees just before 3 p.m. Monday. Power outages were hitting parts of the city as electric grids suffered under heavier demand from air conditioners.\nWhile the Italian capital\u2019s hot spell was tough on tourists trekking through the cobblestone streets, tourist industry workers sweated through it.\nPrince Mack, who is from Liberia, kept hydrated as he hawked tickets to open-top tour buses near central Rome\u2019s Piazza Venezia. \u201cI drank about six of these [water bottles] since this morning, and I\u2019m still going to drink more,\u201d he said at midday.\nThe Ministry of Health issued 10 recommendations to protect older adults, vulnerable people and and pets from the heat. The guidance included staying indoors and avoiding strenuous exercise during the hottest hours of the day and drinking at least nearly a half-gallon of water daily.\nLocal celebrities went on state-run RAI television to read the recommendations aloud and get the message out.\nBesides Rome, several other cities, in particular on the southern islands of Sicily and Sardinia, were expected to top 104 on Tuesday.\nAnimals were stressed, too. Italian farm lobby Coldiretti noted that cows are producing around 10% less milk as a result of the heat.\nSpain\u2019s Aemet weather agency said the heat wave this week \u201cwill affect a large part of the countries bordering the Mediterranean.\u201d Temperatures in some southern areas of Spain were forecast to exceed 107 degrees before dropping at some point Wednesday.\nAemet spokesperson Rub\u00e9n del Campo said that as Cerberus pushes a hot mass of air from Africa toward Europe, the heat and very dry air would cause the risk of wildfires to skyrocket.\nA wildfire that started Saturday on the Canary island of La Palma continued to burn out of control Monday, although authorities say weaker winds and cooler temperatures in the area are helping firefighters combat it. The blaze has burned some 11,300 acres of mostly woodland hills and some 20 houses and buildings.\nMore than 4,000 residents were evacuated from their homes Saturday but were allowed to return as of late Sunday.\nHeat waves and drought swept across much of Europe last summer, with the temperature in Britain rising above 104 degrees for the first time on record.\nThe agency says it expects temperatures to drop sometime Wednesday.\nGreece got a brief respite from the heat Monday, with opening hours returning to normal at the ancient Acropolis and other sites. But two wildfires threatened homes in areas outside Athens, where winds of up to 45 mph made the flames difficult to contain.\nMost of southern Greece, including greater Athens, was at an elevated level of alert for fire risk, while more extreme temperatures are expected starting Thursday."

      "text": "Wildfires threaten major city in Turkey as much of southern Europe burns\n- Share via\nISTANBUL \u2014 Wildfires that have engulfed Turkey for weeks threatened the country\u2019s fourth-largest city Sunday, forcing more than 3,500 people to flee their homes and leaving two people dead.\nGreece, Bulgaria and Montenegro are also battling blazes fed by unusually high temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds.\nOvernight fires in the forested mountains surrounding Bursa in northwestern Turkey spread rapidly, tinting the night sky over the city\u2019s eastern suburbs with a red glow. Dozens of severe wildfires have hit the country daily since late June, with the government declaring the two western provinces of Izmir and Bilecik as disaster areas Friday.\nForestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli told reporters late Sunday that 3,515 people had been safely evacuated from villages to the northeast of Bursa as more than 1,900 firefighters battled the flames. The highway linking Bursa to the capital, Ankara, was closed as surrounding forests burned.\nA firefighter died from a heart attack while on the job, said Bursa\u2019s mayor, Mustafa Bozbey, adding that the blaze had scorched more than 7,400 acres around the city. Another person was killed and two seriously injured when a water tanker fell into a ravine outside Bursa, local media reported.\nOrhan Saribal, an opposition parliamentarian for the province, described the scene as \u201can apocalypse.\u201d\nBy morning, lessening winds brought some respite to firefighters, who continued efforts to battle the flames. But TV images revealed an ashen landscape where farms and pine forests had earlier stood.\nYumakli said fire crews across the country confronted 84 separate fires Saturday. The country\u2019s northwest was under the greatest threat, including Karabuk, where wildfires have burned since Tuesday and 1,839 people have been evacuated from 19 villages.\nAside from Bursa and Karabuk, a major fire was raging in Kahramanmaras, in southern Turkey, the minister said, warning that rising winds could suddenly reignite fires in areas not properly watered down after the flames are extinguished.\nBeleaguered firefighters and rescue workers saved thousands of livestock and pets that had been left behind in the rush to evacuate. Local media also showed images of workers assisting wildlife caught among the fires.\nUnseasonably high temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds have been fueling the wildfires.\nThe General Directorate of Meteorology said Turkey recorded its highest temperature ever of 50.5 degrees Celsius \u2014 122.9 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 in the southeastern Sirnak province on Friday. The highest temperatures for July were seen in 132 other locations, the directorate said.\nFifteen people have died in recent weeks, including 10 rescue volunteers and forestry workers killed Wednesday in a fire in Eskisehir in western Turkey.\nJustice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said late Saturday that prosecutors had investigated fires in 33 provinces since June 26, and that legal action had been taken against 97 suspects.\nIn Greece, firefighters battled active wildfires in the country\u2019s southwest and on the island of Kythera on Sunday, after a blaze that scorched the northern Athens suburb of Kryoneri on Saturday. High temperatures, reaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit or more, persist across much of the country, though winds have eased slightly.\nIn Kryoneri, 27 residents were evacuated overnight with police assistance after some initially ignored warnings. Authorities urged the public to comply with evacuation orders, warning that resistance puts both civilians and rescuers in danger.\nThe fire service reported three people hospitalized with breathing issues and one firefighter treated for burns at a military hospital.\nOn the island of Evia, where another fire is now under control, media reports indicate large numbers of animals perished in barns.\nOn Bulgaria\u2019s southern borders with Greece and Turkey, as well as the western Serbian frontier, firefighters battled wildfires as the government declared the worst-hit provinces disaster zones. A code-red warning, the highest level, was issued for residents across nearly half the country.\nNational Fire Service chief Alexander Djartov told reporters that 236 wildfires were burning, many fanned by strong winds. The government had asked European Union partners for help, he added, and aircraft were expected from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, Hungary and Sweden later Sunday.\nIn the southwestern Strumyani region, overnight blazes forced firefighters to retreat. They were reinforced Sunday by soldiers. Dozens of people fled their homes in the western Tran region as flames threatened villages near the Serbian border.\nWilks writes for the Associated Press. AP writers Veselin Toshkov in Sofia, Bulgaria, and Demetris Nellas in Athens contributed to this report."

Tall columns of flames rose behind apartment blocks on the outskirts of the city, while dozens of vehicles were scorched as flames swept through a nearby impound lot.\n\u201cToday is another very difficult day with the level of fire risk remaining very high across many parts of the country,\u201d Fire Service spokesman Vassilis Vathrakoyiannis said. At least 15 firefighters were hospitalized or treated for burns, smoke inhalation or exhaustion, he added.\nAs water-dropping planes and helicopters swooped overhead, residents joined the effort, beating back flames with cut branches or dousing them with buckets of water.\nAfter heat waves, resources stretched thin\nFirefighting resources were stretched thin in many affected countries as they battled multiple outbreaks after weeks of heat waves and temperature spikes across the Mediterranean region. On the Greek island of Chios, exhausted firefighters slept on the roadside after a nightlong shift.\nAircraft rotated between blazes on the western Greek mainland, the Patras area and the island of Zakynthos. Athens also sent assistance to neighboring Albania, joining an international effort to combat dozens of wildfires. An 80-year-old man died in one blaze south of the capital, Tirana, officials said Wednesday.\nResidents were evacuated from four villages in central Albania near a former army ammunition depot. In the southern Korca district, near the Greek border, explosions were reported from buried World War II-era artillery shells. Authorities said dozens of homes were gutted in a central region of the country.\nDeaths in Spain and Turkey\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez expressed condolences after the death of a firefighting volunteer in the hard-hit Castile and Le\u00f3n region north of the capital, Madrid, where thousands have been displaced by evacuations.\n\u201cThe wildfire situation remains serious, and taking extra precautions is essential,\u201d S\u00e1nchez wrote in an online post. \u201cThank you, once again, to all those working tirelessly to fight the flames.\u201d\nEvacuation centers were filled to capacity in parts of central Spain, with some spending the night outdoors on folding beds. The most severe fires pushed northward into more rural areas, where some residents hosed the walls of their homes to try and protect them from flames.\nServices along a high-speed rail link between Madrid and the northwestern region of Galicia were suspended after fires neared some sections of the tracks, state rail company Renfe said.\nIn Turkey, a forestry worker was killed Wednesday while responding to a wildfire in a southern region, officials said. The Forestry Ministry said the worker died in an accident involving a fire truck that left four others injured.\nTurkey has been battling severe wildfires since late June. A total of 18 people have been killed, including 10 rescue volunteers and forestry workers who died in July.\nIn France, which is recovering from massive recent fires in the southern regions, temperatures of up to 108 degrees were expected for the third consecutive day. Officials issued weather alerts giving local authorities discretion to cancel public events and cordon off areas with high fire risks.\nLightning storms and farming practices cited as possible causes\nAuthorities across European countries have cited multiple causes for the massive fires, including careless farming practices, improperly maintained power cables and summer lightning storms.\nLaw enforcement officials in North Macedonia also cited indications of arson, motivated by rogue developers. Firefighters struggled to contain a blaze at a nature reserve outside the capital, Skopje, on Wednesday.\nThe European Union has rushed aid to fire-stricken countries, including nonmember states, with ground crews and water-dropping aircraft. Much of the recent effort was concentrated on Montenegro, where major wildfires continued to burn in rugged areas near the capital, Podgorica.\n\u201cNatural disasters know no borders,\u201d said Ljuban Tmusic, head of Montenegro\u2019s civil protection agency. \u201cIn Montenegro, the resources we have ... are clearly not enough.\u201d\nGatopoulos and Semini write for the Associated Press.
