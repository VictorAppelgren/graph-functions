  "title": "Five moments that have defined Ruben Amorim's nightmare Man Utd reign so far",
  "description": "Ruben Amorim has been in charge of Manchester United for just nine months, but it's been a period of time that has been littered with lows and very few highs.",
  "content": "Manchester United's woes continue to mount as manager Ruben Amorim faces increasing scrutiny. The latest setback occurred on Wednesday at Blundell Park, where the Red Devils were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby Town in a penalty shootout, marking their earliest departure from the tournament in over ten years. Amorim, 40, has only been in charge at Old Trafford for nine months, but it's proven to be the most testing time in his career and indeed for many of his players. His tenure has been marked by a series of disappointments, with few high points since he took over from Erik ten Hag. The cup exit at the hands of a League Two side is just the latest blow in Amorim's troubled reign, as we reflect on his most difficult moments at the helm of Manchester United.\n\nDespite maintaining a calm exterior during media engagements, Amorim is known to have a fiery temper. This was evident following United's 3-1 home defeat to Brighton last season, reports the Mirror. This loss marked their sixth home defeat of the Premier League campaign and Amorim's fourth, despite having been in the job for just over two months. Reports suggest that tensions reached boiling point in the dressing room, with Amorim reportedly smashing a TV screen in a fit of anger directed at his team. The television, which he typically employs to demonstrate tactics before kick-off and during the interval, became the unfortunate casualty of Amorim's outburst at his squad, who reportedly remained in their seats throughout his angry tirade.\n\nThe January defeat to Brighton certainly left its mark on Amorim, who didn't limit himself to destroying a television when expressing his exasperation with what represented another woeful display from his team. After overseeing 11 league matches at that stage, United had managed to secure merely 11 points - and their appalling run prompted Amorim to astoundingly describe his squad as the \"worst team in Manchester United history.\" For the latest breaking stories and headlines, sign up to our Daily Express MUFC newsletter, or join our WhatsApp community here. During his post-match press briefing, the Portuguese manager declared: \"In [the past] 10 games in the Premier League, we won two. Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me. We are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines.\" Nevertheless, he retracted his remarks just days afterwards, attributing his striking statements to his inexperience as a manager. \"I'm a young guy and sometimes I make a mistake,\" Amorim admitted during his press conference before a Europa League clash against Rangers. \"That's why I don't talk about it after the game.\"\n\nUpon taking the reins at Manchester United in November, Amorim inherited a team languishing in 13th place, with the club's hierarchy hoping that parting ways with Ten Hag just four months into the campaign would spark a turnaround. Despite high hopes, Amorim, 40, struggled to halt the Red Devils' slide, managing only seven wins out of 27 league matches, culminating in a dismal 15th place finish and a meagre 42 points tally. Not since the 1989-90 season had United found themselves so low in the league standings, and the points total was their worst in the top flight since the relegation days of 1973-74. Despite a nightmarish first season at Old Trafford, Amorim did guide the squad to the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur. The showdown in Bilbao offered a chance for redemption, but it was Spurs who triumphed with a narrow 1-0 victory. The sting of domestic failure combined with European heartbreak led Amorim to concede he'd step down if there was any doubt about his capacity to restore United to its former glory. \"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation,\" Amorim declared post-final. \"But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things. In this moment, I am not here to defend myself. It's not my style. I have nothing to show to the fans. In this moment [I need] a little bit of faith.\"\n\nThe Red Devils suffered one of the most shocking upsets in recent years as they were dumped out on penalties by League Two outfit Grimsby, who could have sealed victory in regular time had they not thrown away their 2-0 advantage. Amorim didn't hold back in criticising his players following the loss whilst suggesting his position at Old Trafford could be under threat. He disclosed that discussions will take place after their Premier League encounter against Burnley on Saturday - their final fixture before the international break. He told ITV Sport: \"I think the players spoke really loudly about what they want today. Something has to change and you're not going to change 22 players again.\" Speaking about potential discussions with United's hierarchy, Amorim said: \"Let's focus on the next game and then we have time to think about things. We have a lot of debts with our fans so let's focus on the game.\" Amorim then reinforced his stance, adding: \"We have a job to do, a job to prepare and then we'll stop and think things through.\"",

      "text": "Ruben Amorim's offer to leave Man Utd, TV screen smash and Grimsby humiliation\nRuben Amorim hasn't even been at Manchester United for a year but the Portuguese boss has become used to regular disappointing moments during his Old Trafford tenure\nThe hits just keep coming at Manchester United as pressure continues to build on boss Ruben Amorim. The latest knockout blow came on Wednesday at Blundell Park, where his side succumbed on penalties in the second round of the Carabao Cup to Grimsby Town, marking their earliest exit from the competition in over a decade.\nThe 40-year-old has only been at the helm of the Red Devils for nine months, but it's been the most challenging period of his career and for many of his players. The lows have been constant while the highs have practically been non-existent following his appointment to replace Erik ten Hag.\nThe elimination from the cup at the hands of League Two opposition is the latest damaging moment in Amorim's tenure, as Mirror Football looks back at the most challenging times of his brief career at Old Trafford.\nSmashing a TV screen\nWhile Amorim presents a cool and collected character when it comes to his media obligations, he's been known to have a fiery side. That aspect of his character came out in spades after United's 3-1 home defeat to Brighton last season.\nIt was their sixth home defeat of the Premier League campaign and Amorim's fourth despite having been in the job for just over two months. Tensions certainly boiled over in the dressing room as it was reported Amorim smashed a TV screen while angrily venting at his squad.\nThe TV, which he usually uses to explain tactics before kick-off and at half-time, was the unfortunate victim in Amorim losing his temper at his team, who were said to have remained seated during his furious rant.\nWorst team in history admission\nThe January loss to the Seagulls certainly had an impact on Amorim, who didn't stop at the damaging of a TV in showing his frustration with what was yet another poor showing from his side.\nHaving taken charge of 11 league games at that point, United had picked up just 11 points - and their dismal form caused Amorim to shockingly brand his side as the \"worst team in Manchester United history.\" In his post-match media conference, the Portuguese boss said: \"In [the past] 10 games in the Premier League, we won two.\n\"Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me. We are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines.\"\nHe did, however, walk back his comments just days later as he attributed his bold comments to his relative youth as a manager. \"I\u2019m a young guy and sometimes I make a mistake,\" Amorim said at his press conference ahead of the Europa League tie against. \"That\u2019s why I don\u2019t talk about it after the game.\"\n15th-placed league finish\nUpon Amorim's appointment in November, he took over a side in 13th with hopes that the decision to sack Ten Hag four months into the season could reignite what had been a struggling season.\nHowever, the 40-year-old could do little to stop United's poor form that continued to slip further under his stewardship. Amorim won just seven of his 27 league games in charge last season, leaving United to finish 15th with just 42 points.\nNot only was it their lowest league position since the 1989\u201390 season, but it was the fewest points they've collected in a top-flight season since they were last relegated back in 1973\u201374.\nOffer to leave Man Utd\nIn what was a horror debut season at Old Trafford, Amorim did lead the club to the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur. While a victory in Bilbao could have somewhat salvaged a historically bad season, it was the north London side that came out on top in a 1-0 win.\nThe disappointment of their domestic campaign coupled with a European final defeat saw Amorim admit he'd walk away from the dugout if faith is lost in his ability to return United's status as one of football's biggest powers.\n\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation,\" said Amorim after the final. \"But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.\n\"In this moment, I am not here to defend myself. It's not my style. I have nothing to show to the fans. In this moment [I need] a little bit of faith.\"\nGrimsby embarrassment\nThe Red Devils endured one of the most memorable cupsets in history as they were knocked out on penalties by League Two side Grimsby, who could've won the game in normal time had they not surrended their 2-0 lead.\nAmorim didn't shy away from calling out his players after the defeat while hinting his future at Old Trafford could be left in peril. He revealed that talks will be made after their Premier League clash against Burnley on Saturday - their last game before the international break.\nHe told ITV Sport: \"I think the players spoke really loudly about what they want today. Something has to change and you\u2019re not going to change 22 players again.\" Talking about potential talks with United's hierarchy, Amorim said: \"Let\u2019s focus on the next game and then we have time to think about things.\n\"We have a lot of debts with our fans so let\u2019s focus on the game.\" Amorim then doubled down, adding: \"We have a job to do, a job to prepare and then we\u2019ll stop and think things through.\"\nJoin our new MAN UTD WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Manchester United content from Mirror Football.
