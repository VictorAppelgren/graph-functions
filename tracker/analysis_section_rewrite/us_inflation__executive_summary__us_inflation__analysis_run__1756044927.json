      "feedback": "The draft is expansive but unfocused for a professional 4–6 sentence brief; it should be condensed into a tight house view anchored to a single base case, with two clear alternatives, plus a compact catalysts/watch/invalidations set and explicit regime mechanics; move all assertions to source IDs and prune ancillary micro-narratives that dilute the core signal. Actionable edits: 1) rewrite as 4–6 executive bullets (Base case: Regime 1–4 mechanics, tariff/inflation-to-discount-rate channel, Ford as a cash-flow/flexion proxy with the W2622L6WW metrics; Bull alt: policy AI/nontraditional-inflow catalysts with explicit drivers and sources like UPV3X2MQ6, ILY C1M41F; Bear alt: debt/deficit drag with triggers from RHXDOHQQX, J99EM2TPZ, FOM34PUWA); 2) define regime-entry/exit criteria with numeric thresholds (e.g., tariff stance/persistence, inflation path, EV profitability tipping points) and show how these map to equity multiples; 3) replace narrative placeholders with exact numbers from sources (Ford forward P/E ~10.3, ~5% yield; UNH FCF yield >9% and ~3% dividend; LULU ~13.5x forward; UNH/LULU stake/position details); 4) attach every factual claim to a source ID and reconcile conflicts by choosing a single coherent base-case narrative anchored in EPJYXB7DX, FOM34PUWA, UPV3X2MQ6, ILY C1M41F, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX, S15934PBQ; 5) trim or relocate the 0–3 week horizon content into a brief appendix or separate note, and surface only the 4–6 week catalysts in the main brief (tariff/auto pass-through, AI productivity milestones, regulatory/adoption milestones); 6) add a concise watch list of 4–6 measurable signals (tariff-extension status, CPI autos, AI-productivity readouts, 10-year yield path, 13F/earnings trajectories) with IDs; 7) tighten prose to remove repetition and ensure every sentence advances the house view or a named catalyst, then summarize the overall stance (policy momentum + AI/nontraditional inflows support higher multiples for moats like UNH/LULU vs Ford with limited upside until durable EV economics); 8) spell out invalidations clearly (policy reversal, sharper inflation surprise, sustained EV fragility, debt/debt-service shock) and tie each to a source; 9) fix any attribution gaps (avoid non-source-derived governance signals or misattributions) and 10) deliver in a single concise paragraph that preserves strict executive style and source discipline (IDs after each claim).",
