      "summary": "Hexagon Agility, a Hexagon Composites subsidiary, secured $4.2 million in new orders for CNG/RNG fuel systems for Cummins X15N natural‑gas engines in North American heavy‑haul fleets. The orders span over 10 Class 8 fleets across logistics, food & beverage, oil & gas, and construction, reflecting a growing diesel‑to‑natural‑gas transition. The X15N engine expands the addressable market by adding 200,000 trucks to the 300,000 heavy‑haul trucks sold annually in North America. The move offers diesel‑like performance, up to 1,200‑mile range, and fuel‑cost savings, supported by a network of more than 1,600 CNG/RNG stations.",
