  "title": "Chappell Roan\u2019s Recent Smash Returns To Its All-Time Peak As Her Latest Debuts",
  "description": "Chappell Roan\u2019s \u201cThe Subway\u201d debuts at No. 1 on the U.K. Singles and Streaming charts, while \"The Giver\" returns to its peak and \"Good Luck, Babe!\" surges into the top 10.",
  "content": "Chappell Roan\u2019s new single \u201cThe Subway\u201d has become another breakout smash for the multi-genre singer-songwriter. The tune opens in impressive positions on a number of charts in the United Kingdom and even manages to become another leader for the Grammy winner.\n\nAs \u201cThe Subway\u201d gets off to a strong start, the excitement generated by the new release helps several of Roan\u2019s most famous tracks become bestsellers again.\n\nEarlier in 2025, Roan delivered \u201cThe Giver,\u201d her first single since winning the Grammy for Best New Artist. That track \u2014 which helped her venture into country for the first time \u2014 rises from No. 5 to No. 2 on the Official Physical Singles chart.\n\nThat position marks the all-time high for \u201cThe Giver\u201d on the U.K.\u2019s list of the bestselling tracks available on any physical format. The cut has reached the runner-up spot before, and \u201cThe Subway\u201d helps it find its way there again.\n\nRoan fills a pair of spaces inside the highest tier on the Official Physical Singles chart this week. As \u201cThe Giver\u201d improves from No. 5 to No. 2, \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d \u2014 which helped Roan establish a global fanbase \u2014 ascends from No. 12 to No. 10. The pop superstar almost claims a trio of top 10 hits on the Official Physical Singles roster, but \u201cPink Pony Club\u201d just misses out on helping her accomplish that feat, as it dips from No. 10 to No. 11.\n\n\u201cThe Subway\u201d has clearly played a role in where \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d and \u201cThe Giver\u201d appear on the Official Physical Singles chart, even though Roan\u2019s latest release has not yet become available on any physical format, so it\u2019s not even eligible for the list it seems to be impacting in a roundabout way.\n\n\u201cThe Subway\u201d leads both the Official Singles and Official Singles Streaming charts. Roan doubles her total number of champions on the main ranking of the most consumed songs in the U.K. and scores her first leader on the streaming-only tally. The track also launches at No. 3 on both the Official Singles Sales and Official Singles Downloads rosters.",
