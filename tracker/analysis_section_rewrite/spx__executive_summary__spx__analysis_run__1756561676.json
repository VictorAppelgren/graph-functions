      "feedback": "The draft is overly verbose, mixes multiple assets (dxy, ether, spx, tsla) and strays from the single‑asset focus required for the brief. Tighten the narrative to a 4–6‑sentence executive summary that **only** addresses the dollar index, with a clear causal chain, quantified catalysts, and watch‑list items. Remove all references to ether, spx, tsla, and other assets; if you must mention them, frame them as *secondary* drivers of risk‑on sentiment with a concise causal link to dxy (e.g., “institutional crypto demand → risk‑on → dxy”). Ensure every claim is backed by an inline source ID (e.g., (Z7O1DCHS7), (7XH2DKEKV)). Quantify the base‑case move (≈‑200 bp to 95.8) and the upside/downside ranges from catalysts (Fed cut probability, PCE, NFP, term‑premium steepening). Explicitly state the catalyst windows (Fed meeting 2025‑09‑01, PCE 2025‑08‑30, NFP 2025‑08‑31) and the potential impact on dxy (±70 bp, ±50 bp). Conclude with a concise watch list: Fed minutes 2025‑09‑01, PCE 2025‑08‑30, NFP 2025‑08‑31, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread. This will satisfy the 4–6 sentence constraint, maintain a single‑asset focus, and provide actionable, evidence‑based guidance.",
