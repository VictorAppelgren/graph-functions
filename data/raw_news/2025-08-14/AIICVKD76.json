  "description": "Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 release date is fast approaching. Here\u2019s when to expect the new iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, and iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max.",
  "content": "It\u2019s been almost a year since Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone 16 lineup debuted. That means the iPhone 17 release date is fast approaching. Here\u2019s when to expect Apple\u2019s new iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max to launch.\n\nApple products all have their own release cadence. Some go years between updates, while others launch new hardware annually.\n\nOut of all Apple product launches, the iPhone is the most consistent.\n\nEvery year, new iPhones debut around the same time\u2014give or take a week. First they\u2019re unveiled in a big media event, then they ship about a week and a half later.\n\nThis has been true for years. Here are the last several iPhone announcement dates:\n\nBased on this pattern, we can expect Apple to announce the new iPhone 17 lineup the week of September 8.\n\nIt could be that Monday the 8th, or perhaps Tuesday the 9th. Apple tends to favor Tuesdays for iPhone launches, but last year opted for Monday\u2014presumably to avoid the U.S. Presidential Debate on Tuesday.\n\nWhen to expect iPhone 17 to officially release\n\nUnlike the slight variation in new iPhones\u2019 announcement day, their official launch day is even more precise and consistent.\n\nApple always ships its new iPhones on a Friday. Not the same week the announcement is made, but the Friday that follows that.\n\nThus, the iPhone 17 release date is expected to be Friday, September 19 this year.\n\nLooking at Apple\u2019s history with recent iPhone launches confirms this pattern.\n\nRegardless of the exact day of the week the iPhone 17 announcement falls on, pre-orders should begin that Friday, with the official release date the following Friday.\n\nFor an overview of new features expected in Apple\u2019s upcoming models:\n\nTo summarize, Apple follows a very predictable and consistent pattern with flagship iPhone launches.\n\nBased on that pattern, we should expect the following:\n\nWhich new iPhone 17 model do you plan to buy? Let us know in the comments.\n\u2022 AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)",

      "text": "Next month, the iPhone lineup is getting a brand new model: the iPhone 17 Air. Per various reports, Apple plans to drop its Plus option in favor of an ultra-thin new form factor that could tempt a lot of Pro users. Here are seven features coming to the iPhone 17 Air.\nUltra-thin form factor\nFollowing the trend started by Apple\u2019s M4 iPad Pro, the iPhone 17 Air\u2019s defining feature will be its thinness.\nPer Ming-Chi Kuo and various other reports, iPhone 17 Air will be just 5.55mm thin. Presumably, this measurement does not include the camera bar.\nThis is a massive reduction from current iPhones. The 16 Pro models are 8.25mm thick, while the base 16 and 16 Plus are 7.8mm.\nApple\u2019s thinnest model ever was the iPhone 6, and even that was 6.9mm.\nNew 6.6-inch display\nBeing ultra-thin won\u2019t be the 17 Air\u2019s only hardware advantage over the Pro line. Apple will also give its new model a unique display that could offer the perfect compromise between existing sizes.\nApple\u2019s iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will feature 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays, respectively. These are the same sizes as the 16 Pro line.\niPhone 17 Air, however, will slot in exactly halfway between the two models with a 6.6-inch display. Thanks to its ultra-thin form factor, the 17 Air\u2019s display may still feel small enough for current Pro users while offering just enough space to satisfy Pro Max fans too.\nAlways On and high refresh rate features\nEver since 2022, a big difference between Apple\u2019s entry models and Pro line has involved two display features:\n- Pro models boast an Always On display\n- they also support the 120Hz ProMotion high refresh rate\nThese are the kind of features that, once you get used to them, are hard to go without.\nFortunately, for the first time, Always On and a version of ProMotion are expected to hit the base iPhone 17 and 17 Air.\nI say \u2018a version of\u2019 because rumors have swirled about a possible 90Hz refresh rate display being in the works at Apple. No credible rumor has indicated this will hit the 17 Air, so it\u2019s likely it will get the full 120Hz ProMotion feature.\nA19 Pro chip\nApple giving a new chip to its latest iPhone is always a given. But iPhone 17 Air chip rumors are especially intriguing.\nFor a while, consensus was that the base iPhone 17 and 17 Air would get an A19 chip, while the 17 Pro and Pro Max alone get A19 Pro.\nRecently though, a leaker suggested Apple is putting the A19 Pro in the iPhone 17 Air too\u2014but with one GPU core disabled.\nHow much difference will there ultimately be between these various A19 chips? Probably not a lot for everyday tasks.\nNew design with single rear 48MP camera and four colors\nAs seen in the dummy models above, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to differ from its siblings substantially in the design and camera departments.\nWhile the 17 Pro line again offers three rear cameras, and the base model two, the 17 Air will feature only one: the main 48MP \u2018Fusion\u2019 camera.\nRumors have been minimal around this camera\u2019s features, which could indicate it will be very similar to the existing main camera on the iPhone 16 line.\nAs for the rest of the design, expect four color options:\n- Black\n- Silver\n- Light Gold\n- Light Blue\n24MP front camera\nCurrently, the iPhone\u2019s selfie camera is only 12MP\u2014and gets clearly inferior results to the rear cameras.\nFortunately, Apple is bringing a welcome 24MP upgrade to the front camera on the iPhone 17 Air and all other iPhone 17 models.\nThe new front camera is still unlikely to match the quality of the rear camera, but it should at least close the gap substantially.\nApple\u2019s in-house C1 modem\nFinally, there\u2019s a connectivity change coming to the iPhone 17 Air that could help boost battery life a bit.\nApple\u2019s in-house C1 modem debuted earlier this year in the iPhone 16e, bringing several benefits including a battery improvement.\nOut of the full iPhone 17 lineup, only the iPhone 17 Air will get the new C1 modem.\niPhone 17 Air features: wrap-up\nThe iPhone 17 Air will no doubt be the most exciting fourth model in Apple\u2019s lineup to date. Where the iPhone mini and Plus had their niche groups of loyal fans, the 17 Air seems likely to set the future tone for iPhone design. It\u2019s going to be a fun iPhone 17 launch season.\nWhich iPhone 17 Air features are you most excited about? Do you plan to buy the new model? Let us know in the comments.\nBest iPhone accessories\n- AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)\n- MagSafe Car Mount for iPhone\n- HomeKit smart plug 4-pack\n- 10-year AirTag battery case 2-pack\n- 100W USB-C fast charging power adapter\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "It\u2019s going to be a big fall for Apple, with 15+ new products expected\u2014including the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air. But what about Apple\u2019s flagship Pro models? Here are seven new features coming to the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max.\nA19 Pro chip\nApple will once again upgrade its new iPhones with a new and improved A-series chip. This year that will be the A19 Pro chip.\nApple\u2019s very best silicon will be reserved exclusively for the 17 Pro and Pro Max, though the new 17 Air model is rumored to come with a modified variant. The standard A19 chip will be included in the base iPhone 17.\n24MP front-facing camera and 48MP telephoto\nThe iPhone\u2019s cameras get better every year, but often Apple\u2019s big improvements focus solely on rear cameras.\nWith the full iPhone 17 line, though, Apple plans to upgrade the front camera from a 12MP sensor to a brand new 24MP sensor, which should bring big improvements.\nAs for the rear cameras, the telephoto lens will get bumped to 48MP\u2014making all three rear cameras 48MP.\n12GB RAM, the most ever in an iPhone\nThe advent of AI has made RAM in Apple\u2019s devices increasingly important. iPhone 15 owners know this better than anyone, since RAM limitations made the device incompatible with Apple Intelligence.\nApple plans to give its 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max models 12GB of RAM\u2014the most ever in an iPhone.\nThis is a nice 50% improvement from the 16 Pro\u2019s 8GB of RAM and should ensure faster performance with Apple Intelligence and other demanding tasks.\nAnti-reflective, more scratch-resistant display\nEven though the iPhone 17 Air and base model are likely to gain certain display features that were formerly Pro-exclusive, Apple has some new upgrades coming to its Pro line to make up for that.\niPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to feature a new anti-reflective, more scratch-resistant display.\nThink something along the lines of nano-texture\u2019s benefits, but without the drawbacks of being so delicate that it needs a special polishing cloth.\nLargest battery ever in iPhone 17 Pro Max\nLots of Pro Max users love the bulk and size of the huge iPhone.\nThis year, iPhone 17 Pro Max is getting thicker than ever to pack an even larger battery.\nRumors indicate the iPhone 17 Pro battery will stay about the same as last year\u2019s. But if you want the most possible battery life in an iPhone, the Pro Max is becoming a better option than ever.\nNew design with aluminum, camera bar, and bolder colors\nLike Apple did with its 16 Pro models, the company is ready to double down on its Pro line being especially optimized for camera use. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will reportedly replace the traditional camera bump with a camera \u2018bar\u2019 instead.\nBoth models are also getting a redesigned frame, with aluminum replacing titanium. Apple just recently introduced titanium to the iPhone\u2019s Pro models in 2023, so the shift to aluminum is especially curious.\nOne apparent benefit of adopting aluminum will be bolder Pro colors this year, with Orange and Dark Blue rumored to join the standard Black and Silver options.\nImproved cooling with vapor chamber\nFinally, the full iPhone 17 lineup is expected to get improved cooling systems, with the iPhone 17 Pro Max exclusively boasting a vapor chamber plus graphite sheet.\nNo doubt this move is a reflection of Apple Intelligence\u2019s importance to the iPhone\u2019s future. AI not only requires more powerful chips and extra RAM, but better cooling to maintain max performance too.\niPhone 17 Pro features: wrap-up\nThis list of iPhone 17 Pro features reiterates my belief that this year\u2019s purchase decision will be harder than ever. The ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air sounds very exciting. But depending on your priorities, there\u2019s no doubt that iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will continue offering the best overall package.\nWhich iPhone 17 Pro features are you most excited about? Let us know in the comments.\nBest iPhone accessories\n- AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)\n- Anker 100W charging brick for fast charging\n- 10-year AirTag battery case\n- MagSafe Car Mount for iPhone\n- HomeKit smart plug 4-pack\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 lineup is launching very soon, bringing four models including the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, and strong upgrades to the Pro line. Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming with the new iPhone 17 lineup based on the latest rumors.\niPhone 17\nLast year, the iPhone 16 was one of the most compelling base models yet. iPhone 17 may not have as packed a list of new features as what\u2019s coming to other models, but it appears ready to continue that trend nonetheless.\n- 6.3-inch screen: Slightly larger display, similar to iPhone 16 Pro size.\n- A19 chip: New chip with incremental improvements over last year.\n- 24MP front-facing TrueDepth camera: The first selfie camera upgrade in years.\n- ProMotion and always-on display: Formerly Pro-exclusive dynamic refresh rate features.\n- Refreshed color lineup: Purple, Green, Blue, Black, and White.\n- $799 price expected: The same as last year\u2019s iPhone 16.\niPhone 17 Air\nA brand new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will replace the Plus model in Apple\u2019s lineup. It will prioritize form over function, with a futuristic design that\u2019s thinner than ever, but sacrificing battery life and cameras in the process.\n- Ultra-thin form factor: Just 5.55mm thick, easily the thinnest iPhone ever.\n- 6.6-inch display: New screen size slots right in the middle of Pro and Pro Max.\n- A19 Pro chip w/ reduced GPU count: Apple\u2019s more powerful chip, but binned with only five GPU cores.\n- 24MP front-facing TrueDepth camera: The first selfie camera upgrade in years.\n- One rear camera: Only the Main camera, no Ultra Wide or Telephoto.\n- 12GB RAM: 50% increase over prior models\u2019 8GB.\n- ProMotion and always-on display: Formerly Pro-exclusive dynamic refresh rate features.\n- C1 modem: Apple\u2019s first in-house 5G modem.\n- Colors inspired by other Air products: Light Blue, Light Gold, Black, and Silver.\n- $949 price expected: $50 price increase over last year\u2019s Plus model.\niPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max\nApple\u2019s Pro models will continue being the best possible all-around iPhones this year. iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will come in the same 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch sizes as last year, but a lot of other features are changing.\n- New design: Full-width camera bar expands typical bump, and aluminum replaces titanium.\n- A19 Pro chip: The most powerful new iPhone chip with no compromises.\n- 24MP front-facing TrueDepth camera: The first selfie camera upgrade in years.\n- 48MP upgraded Telephoto camera: Up from 12MP, making all three rear cameras now 48MP.\n- Larger battery on Pro Max only: The king in battery life will extend its lead.\n- 12GB RAM: 50% increase over prior models\u2019 8GB.\n- Anti-reflective, more scratch resistant display: New upgrades to account for loss of ProMotion exclusivity.\n- More colorful colors: Orange and Dark Blue will join Silver and Black.\n- $1,049 and $1,249 prices expected: $50 price increases over last year.\nApple\u2019s iPhone 17 lineup: summary\nThe iPhone 17 lineup, thanks largely to the addition of the 17 Air, might make it harder than usual to choose the best model for you. Those considering the base iPhone 17 will get the benefit of ProMotion for the first time ever. iPhone 17 Air will feel the most futuristic, but also come with some compromises. And while iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max sound as strong as ever, they don\u2019t have the same \u201cbrand new\u201d appeal that the Air might.\nWhich iPhone 17 model do you plan to buy?
