  "description": "From lattes in the lobby to after-hours pints, how JPMorgan's new skyscraper is built to fuel 14,000 bankers and other employees.",
  "content": "\u2022 The new skyscraper on New York City's Park Avenue is rolling out all the stops for food and drink.\n\u2022 From the coffee outposts to the vegan hotspot, here's a look at what workers can expect.\n\nHow many coffee bars does it take to fuel 14,000 Wall Streeters? According to JPMorgan's internal communications for its new tower, the answer could be in the dozens.\n\nThere won't be just two in the lobby or two more upstairs in its massive food hall \u2014 work caf\u00e9s will be located on every floor, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider that outline what employees can expect as they gear up for the move. The building, located at 270 Park Avenue in Manhattan, is slated to open for most workers early next year, but some will move in sooner, the documents said.\n\nThe bank's communications to its staffers reveal a carefully designed culinary ecosystem \u2014 one that signals how serious it is about making in-office life palatable, even pleasurable, as it calls workers back to the office five days a week. The bank's CEO, Jamie Dimon, has made clear that he thinks working from home is inefficient and ineffective.\n\n\"It is an apprenticeship system. You can't learn working from your basement,\" he said earlier this year.\n\nA spokesperson declined to comment on the new details, which were shared with employees through an internal portal.\n\nIn addition to overflowing options for coffee breaks, JPMorgan is dangling Michelin-starred vegan meals and 24-hour coffee \u2014 perfect for bleary-eyed bankers in need of a 2 a.m. pick-me-up.\n\nOn the menu at the Exchange, a social hub spread across floors 13th to 16th floors, are fast-salad spot Sweetgreen; Umami; and Little Dirt Candy, which appears to be connected to a Lower Manhattan vegan spot run by a Michelin-starred chef. Overall, there will be some 15 choices in the Exchange, the bank documents said, plus refreshments on all of the bank's 60 floors.\n\nPark Avenue Express, what appears to be a proprietary JPMorgan concept, is billed as the spot \"for those looking for a quick bite to eat at any time of day or night,\" the documents say, noting that it's open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n\"There are plenty of options to keep you fueled throughout your day and tons of opportunities to recharge with your favorite snacks and coffee drinks in our cafes and coffee bars,\" one of the documents said. The 14th floor of the tower will also house a Monday to Friday Starbucks location and The Corner, \"a vibrant New York coffee house\" featuring \"a diverse selection of artisanal brews and locally sourced treats.\"",

      "text": "- JPMorgan Chase is about to open its new headquarters at 270 Park Avenue in Manhattan.\n- The 60-story skyscraper, designed by Foster + Partners, is chock-full of perks and amenities.\n- The building includes a gym, an Irish pub, AI tech, a food hall, and more \u2014 see the photos.\nAmerica's biggest bank is gearing up to open its new and long-awaited headquarters at 270 Park Avenue in Manhattan \u2014 complete with a new state-of-the-art gym, an Irish pub, a social \"exchange\" above the trading floors, and more.\nThe exact move-in date is unclear, but the tower has been lighting up the New York City skyline in recent weeks \u2014 and JPMorgan employees told Business Insider the bank has been posting updates, including details about the new gym, on its intranet.\n\"Our cutting-edge Fitness Center offers access to cardio, strength and recovery equipment, locker rooms, daily group exercise classes, a nutrition consultation and sessions with a Well-being Performance Coach,\" the bank said on its intranet, according to screenshots obtained by Business Insider.\n\"It may take up to five business days from your move into 270 Park to be able to join the Fitness Center,\" the bank told employees adding that \"a monthly membership fee is required\" to join the gym.\nThe Jamie Dimon-led bank behemoth first unveiled details of the building's amenities in 2022. The 60-story skyscraper will stand at 1,388 feet tall and was designed by Foster + Partners, which has headed other iconic projects like The Gherkin in London and the Hearst Tower in New York.\nWith the transition imminent, Business Insider put together a slideshow of the skyscraper's most interesting perks and amenities, from its in-building employee gym to AI tech systems and a massive food hall. We spoke to people who have seen some of the communications, looked over JPMorgan press releases, interviews and reports from other publications, and renderings from the architects designing the tower.\nA huge food court and in-office pub\nJPMorgan's head of global real estate, David Arena, told Fortune that the project would include a food court with 19 restaurants.\nHe described it in the February interview as a \"modern version of an Eataly,\" referring to a popular Italian food hall. The bank has said it will feature \"diverse food operators and healthy menus.\"\nThere's also an Irish pub in the building, according to Fortune, as well as the option for food to be delivered on-demand straight to employees' desks.\n'State-of-the-art' membership gym\nScreenshots of an internal JPMorgan portal obtained by Business Insider said 270 Park's \"state-of-the-art\" fitness center will be operated by Exos, a corporate well-being company that also offers sports training for professional athletes.\nThe bank's internal communications said the gym will only be available to employees assigned to work at 270 Park for now. When the building fully opens in 2026, any employee with a Midtown Manhattan work address will be able to use it.\nThe company has said employees who use the gym will have to pay a membership fee, which has drawn some gripes from people posting on Reddit who said they were JPMorgan employees. The bank declined to comment on the gym cost.\nIn-office wellness center\nRecent communications to employees also mentioned a Health & Wellness Center that will provide medical care and services to benefits-eligible employees based in the US.\nLicensed providers will be there to offer sick visits, acute care, general medical advice, lab work, allergy shot management, and international travel preparation.\nMost services at the Health & Wellness Center are free, the portal says, including Wellness Screenings and certain lab tests performed on-site.\nThe public JPM website also mentions 270 Park will have \"modern mother's rooms and prayer and meditation spaces.\"\nElements of nature \u2014 from lighting to air and materials\nThe 270 Park Ave tower will use \"biophilic design\" techniques to connect the outdoors to the indoors, according to JPM's website, through the use of plants and \"healthier furniture and building materials.\"\nThe windows of the building will bring in 30% more daylight than a typical office building, the site says, and use \"circadian lighting\" to \"support a healthier indoor environment.\"\nThe tower will have advanced heating and air-conditioning systems that both clean outdoor air as it comes in and filter recirculated air, the firm says.\nThe tower will be New York City's largest all-electric skyscraper, according to the site, powered by renewable energy and producing \"net zero operational emissions.\"\nSmart tech and AI\nThe tower will feature technology that uses \"sensors, AI, and machine learning systems to predict, respond to, and adapt to energy needs,\" according to the bank's website.\nThe building's technology will be touchless for both employees and visitors, the firm says.\nJPMorgan's Arena told Fortune earlier this year: \"They'll know when you register for a conference room how you like the temperature, et cetera. They'll know when you show up at Starbucks in the morning or whatever other coffee shops we have, how you like your latte.\"\nCity views & fine art\nAt the top of the 60-story building will be a conference center with \"unobstructed city views\" to host events, the bank's website says.\nFortune said the new building will also have its own signature scent.\nJPMorgan's company art collection will be featured in the building, Fortune reported, including gifts from David Rockefeller and \"generative artwork that comes to life and moves when guests walk past.\"\nMore space \u2014 both indoors and out\nJPM says the new building will house up to 14,000 employees (compared to the other facility, which was designed for about 3,500).\nArchitects Foster + Partners described \"the social heart of the tower\" as a three-story area above the trading floors called the \"Exchange.\"\nThe bank says there will be 2.5 times more outdoor space on the ground level of Park and Madison Avenues, including wider sidewalks and a large public plaza."

      "text": "- Starbucks South Korea is telling customers to leave their large office supplies at home.\n- The chain urged patrons not to bring desktops, printers, and desk partitions into its stores.\n- The country is known for its strong caf\u00e9 culture, and a trend of people working from coffee outlets.\nStarbucks South Korea has a problem \u2014 some of its customers are treating the outlets like private office spaces.\nThe coffee chain has posted notices in its South Korean stores urging patrons not to bring bulky office equipment into the shops, per local news reports.\nThe notice said items like desktops, printers, extension cords, and desk partitions would not be allowed in its outlets, as reported by Korea's JoongAng Daily and the Korea Herald.\nThe notice also told customers to take their belongings with them when leaving their seats for long periods, and to let other customers share tables meant for multiple people.\nIn response to a request for comment from Business Insider, a Starbucks representative said Starbucks Korea had updated its policy for its customers to \"have a pleasant and accessible store experience.\"\n\"While laptops and smaller personal devices are welcome, customers are asked to refrain from bringing desktop computers, printers, or other bulky items that may limit seating and impact the shared space,\" the representative said.\nShe added that Starbucks Korea's new policy doesn't involve time limits for customers dining in stores.\nPictures on social media show customers in South Korea putting up foldable partitions around their work areas in Starbucks stores, making the area inaccessible to other customers.\nStarbucks' new policy comes as a work-from-caf\u00e9 trend, known in South Korea as \"cagongjok,\" has swept the country.\n\"Cagongjok\" translates to people who work or study in caf\u00e9s for prolonged periods. In Seoul, the trend is fueled by the large number of caf\u00e9s on every street corner.\nSouth Korea is Starbucks' third-largest market after the US and China, with more than 2,000 outlets. At the end of 2024, its store count surpassed Japan's.\nThe Seattle-based coffee chain released its third-quarter 2025 earnings on July 29. It reported its sixth straight quarter of sales declines, with global same-store sales down 2% compared to a year ago.\nThe company's stock has been down about 18% in the last six months but is flat compared to the start of the year.\nIn his \"Back to Starbucks\" turnaround plan for the US, CEO Brian Niccol implemented several measures to encourage customers to hang out in stores and use them as third spaces.\nPart of that plan involved bringing back ceramic mugs for hot drinks, introducing self-serve condiment bars. He also initiated design changes like adding more power outlets to make the caf\u00e9s more comfortable and convenient."

      "text": "- JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon defended some of his comments on DEI and WFH.\n- He said he wasn't against working from home overall but opposed it in certain circumstances.\n- He described some DEI efforts as wasteful but said the bank was committed to diverse communities.\nMany people have piled into the work-from-home debate that's been amplified by Jamie Dimon's testy comments. Now Dimon has something he wants to say back to them.\nDuring a CNBC interview on Monday from JPMorgan's global leveraged finance conference in Miami, Dimon acknowledged some faults.\n\"I should never curse, ever. That \u2014 OK,\" he said. \"And I shouldn't get angry or stuff like that.\"\nHe then defended his stance on pulling employees back to the office five days a week, a mandate set to go into effect for most workers on March 3.\n\"I completely respect people that don't want to go to the office all five days a week. That's your right. It's my right. It's a citizen's right,\" Dimon said. \"But they should respect that the company is going to decide what's good for the clients, the company, etc., not an individual.\"\nHe added: \"They can get a job \u2014 and I'm not being mean \u2014 they can get a job elsewhere. I understand that it may make total sense for them to do that.\"\nDimon was defending some fiery comments he made during an internal town hall in February, the audio of which was published by Barron's. In it, Dimon complained that there was \"not a goddamn person\" he could get a hold of on Fridays and griped about employees not paying attention on \"fucking Zoom.\"\nDimon said in the interview with CNBC that \"we do have 10% of jobs that are full time at home,\" highlighting virtual call centers in Baltimore and Detroit.\n\"I'm not against work from home,\" Dimon said. \"I'm against where it doesn't work.\"\nJPMorgan employees have spoken out about some of the drawbacks of being back in the office full time, and a petition against the in-office mandate collected more than 1,700 signatures. Dimon said in the town hall that he didn't care about how much support the petition garnered, and he reiterated that during the Monday interview.\n\"That's fine. They have the right to feel that way,\" he said. \"But we're not going to change. We're going back to the office, and I'm sure when we do there'll be some seats not available. But for the most part, most of our people understand why we need to do it.\"\nDuring the town hall, Dimon also sounded off on JPMorgan's DEI-related programs, reportedly saying, \"I saw how we were spending money on some of this stupid shit, and it really pissed me off,\" and threatening to cancel them because \"I don't like wasted money in bureaucracy.\"\nHe said on Monday that what he found specifically wasteful were \"trainings that don't work, or too many of them,\" and hiring outside consultants for meetings and events. He also argued that a lot of small programs grew over time and should be consolidated.\nHe said the bank was \"still going to reach out to the Black, Hispanic, LGBT, veteran, disabled communities,\" adding, \"We're not changing that.\""

      "text": "- Second-quarter dealmaking returns were higher than expected, but Wall Street is still nervous.\n- A cloud of uncertainty that started this year hasn't retreated, slowing bank hiring.\n- Some banks have continued with layoffs, including Goldman Sachs and Barclays.\nDealmaking is back. Hiring? Not quite.\nBig banks wowed investors last month when they reported better-than-expected revenues from dealmaking in the second quarter, introducing a wave of cautious optimism across Wall Street. IPOs, including the one from Figma, gave equity capital markets teams reason to celebrate. A new KPMG report on mergers and acquisitions found that second-quarter deal values were up 22% quarter over quarter, amounting to $123 billion in value overall.\nAt private credit giant Apollo, business has been booming: \"The team is working as hard as I've ever seen,\" CEO Marc Rowan said recently, citing a surge in in\u2011office presence. \"It is among the busiest Julys we have ever seen in our business.\"\nYet beneath that bravado lies a more nuanced picture: Sure, dealmaking hasn't bottomed out the way some feared in the spring, but some job cuts are still unfolding behind the scenes, Business Insider has learned. Year-end bonus forecasts appear tepid in sectors like M&A advice and private equity investing. Hiring has yet to ramp up en masse, and executives continue to emphasize the need for \"efficiency,\" pointing to disruptions from artificial intelligence and geopolitical uncertainty.\nEric Li, head of global banking research at analytics firm Crisil Coalition Greenwich, expressed surprise at the level of layoffs he's witnessed this summer in his role advising investment banks.\n\"Investment banking numbers actually beat estimates by a long margin, and people are still doing layoffs in July and August,\" Li said, adding: \"It's not really rational if you ask me.\"\n\"Uncertainty is probably people's biggest concern,\" he added, saying that jitters sparked by President Trump's tariffs and other geopolitical turmoil haven't abated. \"Which means that we'll continue to see corporates holding cash, preparing for the rainy day.\"\nFrom uncertainty to AI\nAt Goldman Sachs, second-quarter investment banking fees jumped 26% with M&A advisory revenue surging more than 70%. Yet the bank saw headcount decline by roughly 2% to 45,900 in the most recent quarter. A New York State WARN notice filed in March says it plans to part ways with an additional 338 NYC-based staffers later this month.\nThe bank said the August job cuts are tied to an annual culling of underperformers it conducted earlier this year \u2014 not economic activity.\n\"This is the same annual talent review that was announced months ago. Many of these positions can and will be filled with new people in New York and our other offices,\" a spokesperson for the bank told Business Insider.\nBarclays cut several staffers from its Los Angeles-based financial sponsors team in what appears to be a larger reorganization of that team, according to a person familiar with the matter. Some roles are expected to be moved to San Francisco, where the team's new MD is based, this person said.\nJPMorgan's chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum, earlier this year said his firm has instructed managers to \"resist\" hiring and to double down on \"their focus on efficiency.\"\nOne senior dealmaker pointed to the rise of private credit as a factor behind summer cuts at banks.\n\"What traditionally used to be done at some of the larger banks has now moved into some of the larger alternative asset managers and insurance companies,\" the banker said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss industry practices. \"Some of those changes are because of the advent of private credit.\"\nBanks are showing some signs of selective onboarding \u2014 but those efforts remain measured.\nSophia Samadian, an investment banking recruiter at Selby Jennings, said her clients are \"still being selective\" about who they hire but pouncing on the \"strategic\" hires more quickly than before \u2014 a signal that momentum may be picking up.\n\"Once they identify the right talent,\" she said, \"they're moving faster than we've seen.\"\nIndeed, some smaller or boutique firms have been scooping up bankers in anticipation of a busier second half of the year. Jefferies poached several senior tech investment bankers from Guggenheim Partners to bolster its presence in the Bay Area, which Reuters first reported in May. Evercore poached a top JPMorgan industrials banker in July to serve as a senior managing director.\nEven if M&A surges back to 2021 levels, AI could still dampen hiring, said Chris Connors, a principal at Johnson Associates, who predicted that headcount at banks will \"trend lower\" over the long term.\n\"I don't think you're going to see gangbusters hiring,\" Connors concluded. From here on out, \"I think it's going to be strategic hiring.\""

      "text": "- There's unrest on the healthcare team at Goldman Sachs, where 11 junior bankers recently quit.\n- Six bankers left on the same day last week, Insider exclusively reported.\n- Bankers complained about long hours, intense demands, and disappointing bonuses.\nAt least 11 junior bankers at Goldman Sachs have quit in recent weeks, with six of them \u2014 all first-year analysts \u2014 handing in their resignations on the same day last week, according to a person close to the bank.\nThe analysts and associates were members of the ultra-elite Wall Street bank's healthcare investment-banking team, and represented about one sixth of the team's junior workforce in New York.\n\"It'll definitely be stressful to the group\" to handle this chunk of bankers exiting at roughly the same time, said one current US employee at Goldman. Now, senior bankers on the team may be apt to take their feet \"off the gas pedal\" in seeking out new business opportunities, said a former associate who departed earlier this month.\nThat associate said a major factor for their departure was the payout of paltry bonuses by Wall Street standards. This person said that other associates had received year-end bonuses, which are paid to junior bankers in August, ranging between $25,000 to $75,000 \u2014 and that set off alarm bells. For comparison, the year prior, some top-performing associates earned $200,000 bonuses as a \"thank you\" for their efforts, the person said.\nThe current US employee, who has since spoken firsthand with some of the ex-analysts who left last week, said they were tired of feeling \"unappreciated\" by their bosses and routinely working until 5 a.m.\nThe person close to the bank disputed the notion that these 11 departures were an anomaly, saying that their timing reflects the spate of departures that can sometimes happen at Wall Street banks after juniors receive their bonuses in late summer. \"There's always natural turnover around bonus season, and this small number of departures is par for the course,\" the person told Insider.\nGoldman's healthcare team has advised on five announced M&A transactions over the past three months, including Amazon's blockbuster $4 billion takeover of primary-care provider One Medical. The bank's healthcare advisory practice is the second biggest fee earner on Wall Street following rival JPMorgan Chase, according to data from Dealogic.\nFor all the details on what's going on and what it could mean for the powerhouse healthcare banking team at Goldman, read Insider's full report here.\nDo you work at Goldman Sachs?

      "text": "- JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn't think work-from-home policies are very effective.\n- He's said that remote workers are inattentive in meetings and that it's impossible to foster culture.\n- Here are some of Dimon's thoughts on working from home.\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has said many things about working from home.\nThe banking executive has repeatedly shared why he thinks workers aren't as effective when they're not in the office and how that can negatively affect company culture.\nTaken together, Dimon's comments reflect a very specific image of the work-from-home employee: They largely work in corporate jobs, are inattentive, and are at times hard to reach.\n\"I think our employees will be happier over time,\" Dimon said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Thursday, referring to JPMorgan's return-to-office mandate. \"And the younger people will learn the right way; it's an apprenticeship system. And you can't learn working from your basement.\"\nHe has added the caveat that WFH can be effective in certain areas, such as virtual call centers. Still, it does reflect how skeptical he is of a coveted work perk \u2014 for some, a requirement \u2014 that many employees seek in their jobs.\nJPMorgan issued a five-day return-to-office mandate for most of its employees in January, and Dimon said in the Bloomberg TV interview that 10% of JPMorgan worked remotely.\nIn his annual shareholder letter last year, Dimon said JPM had seen significant growth in the past half-decade while also allowing some \"bad habits to develop.\"\n\"Working from home exacerbated the situation by hindering innovation, slowing decision-making, inhibiting information sharing, reducing efficiency, and creating more politics and bureaucracy,\" he wrote.\nA spokesperson for JPMorgan didn't respond to a request for comment.\nHere's what else Dimon has said about working from home.\nWFH stifles innovation\nDimon has said that remote work doesn't allow for a free flow of ideas that in-person work can and that it ultimately slows down innovation at a company.\n\"Remote work eliminates much spontaneous learning and creativity because you don't run into people at the coffee machine, talk with clients in unplanned scenarios or travel to meet with customers and employees for feedback on your products and services,\" he wrote in an annual shareholder letter in 2021, explaining what he called the \"serious weaknesses\" of working in the \"virtual world.\"\nRemote work is bad for young professionals\nThe banking CEO has said remote work is especially bad for up-and-coming professionals.\nIn an interview at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in late February, Dimon said that WFH didn't work in his business and that \"younger people are being left behind\" because of it. The effects are not immediate but \"cumulative,\" he said.\n\"It's not the first month you're working. It's by the second year, you have less people; you're put in less assignments; you know less what's going on; you have less conversations at the water cooler or in the cafeteria \u2014 so it's leaving them behind,\" Dimon said. \"I won't do that.\"\nIn the 2021 shareholder letter, the CEO said professionals learn through mentors or apprenticeships, which \"is almost impossible to replicate in the Zoom world.\"\nRemote workers are inattentive during meetings\nOne of Dimon's apparent frustrations with working from home is how inattentive his employees seem to be during virtual meetings.\n\"A lot of you were on the fucking Zoom and you were doing the following,\" Dimon said in a leaked audio recording that was obtained by Business Insider. \"Looking at your mail, sending texts to each other about what an asshole the other person is, not paying attention, not reading your stuff.\"\nHe echoed the sentiment again during the event at Stanford.\n\"As I was talking, there were 12 people in the room and four people on the screen, and all four people on the screen were on their phone,\" he said of a Zoom meeting he was in. \"And you think you're focusing and learning?\"\nOnly office workers whine about RTO\nDimon said during his Stanford chat that the majority of American workers had never worked remotely, pointing to doctors, firefighters, and deliverers, among others.\n\"It's only these people in the middle who complain a lot about it,\" he said, referencing white-collar workers.\nWhat about a hybrid schedule?\n\"And don't give me this shit that work-from-home-Fridays works,\" the CEO said in the leaked audio recording. \"I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there's not a goddamn person you can get a hold of.\""

      "text": "- Employees at JPMorgan's largest US office are back five days a week as of last week.\n- The Polaris site in Columbus, Ohio, is a major tech hub with more than 12,000 workers.\n- Employees spoke to BI about jockeying for desks and parking in their first week back.\nJPMorgan Chase's largest US office was put to the test last week as its roughly 12,000 workers returned Monday through Friday for the first time since the work-from-home movement swept the nation five years ago, at the start of the pandemic.\nWhether the bank passed that test depends on whom you ask.\nOn Monday, April 21, an executive at the firm's sprawling Columbus, Ohio, campus, projected optimism about employees' first full week back in the office while acknowledging some pain points.\n\"Ample seats were available across the site,\" a memo from Becky Griffin, the location leader at the Columbus campus, said. \"We did notice that some areas were busier than others,\" she added, \"and we're continuing to monitor capacity to make sure everyone can easily find a seat.\"\nGriffin said lines for the cafeteria at the campus, known as Polaris, were \"longer than usual,\" but that they \"moved efficiently, with a smooth checkout process.\"\nShe also addressed concerns about parking. \"To make the parking process more efficient, we have already adjusted the shuttle service and provided updated instructions to our on-site parking attendees,\" she wrote in the memo, which workers received as they were wrapping up their first full day in the office together.\nEmployees who spoke to BI complained that some of these issues persisted as the week went on, leaving some workers jockeying for desks, hunting for alternative parking, and skipping lunch to avoid long lines. In a second memo sent on Friday, Griffin said the company would be \"making ongoing adjustments\" and offered a link to an email for employees to provide feedback. She added that the bank had established a \"Polaris Commuting Resources\" page on its internal system to keep employees updated on changes.\nJPMorgan workers at Polaris who spoke to BI, however, said they couldn't see easy solutions to some of the problems discussed in the memo because the campus \u2014 which houses some 12,000-plus employees \u2014 has limited parking and a total seating capacity of 11,930, according to internal documents about the property reviewed by BI.\n\"There's really not a lot of space left on the property,\" said one software engineer at Polaris. \"They'd have to make some serious changes for the site to be able to hold all the cars that come there every day.\"\nThe engineer was one of three employees who spoke to BI about working at the Columbus facility, which is home to many of the bank's tech workers and key to several of its cloud-focused initiatives. These employees asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to discuss company matters.\n\"There's not really infrastructure in place to handle the number of people that are working there now,\" the software engineer continued, adding: \"It's definitely put everybody in kind of a tough spot.\"\nGriffin did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement to BI, Michael Fusco, a JPMorgan spokesperson, pointed to measures the bank has taken over the past week to smooth out the transition.\n\"We have been working hard to ensure our sites have the capacity and amenities employees need to return full-time,\" Fusco said. \"Last week, we had more than 2,000 open seats available daily in Polaris, ensuring ample seating to accommodate all employees. We also increased the number of parking attendants and shuttles to improve the parking process.\"\nLife at Polaris in a post-RTO world\nIn January, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called his workers back to the office five days a week starting in March. The return was delayed for some office locations to give them time to get ready. The firm's Polaris campus only switched to the five-day-a-week RTO model last week.\nJPMorgan isn't alone in demanding workers to return to pre-pandemic norms. Employees at Goldman Sachs and Citadel were called back to the office five days a week in 2021. Tech giants like Amazon and TikTok have also ordered workers back to their desks Monday through Friday.\nSome Polaris employees have pushed back, however, including by exploring unionizing, as BI has previously reported. Dimon defended his decision in an internal town hall at the Columbus campus in February, saying the mandate was issued with the bank and its clients in mind, not individual preferences.\nJPMorgan has addressed the insufficient parking at Polaris by reserving additional spaces at a local church about a mile away. Once parked, workers can wait for a shuttle that will take them to and from the campus, about a 10-minute ride. Employees, however, described 30-minute waits to board the buses in some cases.\nA back-office manager told BI that on-campus parking has also become strained. The employee said the site's central buildings are encircled by a road dotted with two-story parking garages, and the road has been logjammed.\n\"From the moment you hit that ring, you're sitting in traffic to get around the campus,\" said the manager, who added they had recently spent an hour and 15 minutes looking for a parking spot.\nIt's led some employees to search for workarounds \u2014 like finding parking at Polaris Fashion Place, a nearby mall, and ordering Uber transportation to the office, the second of the two engineers said.\nThis strategy hasn't proved a major time saver, however, this engineer added, citing the backlog of vehicles clogging the campus road in the morning. The manager described large orange construction signs punctuating the road and third-party traffic attendants directing the flow of vehicles.\nHe questioned whether these measures were helpful, saying that, in his experience, traffic attendants \"just wave you past closed lots. They don't tell you where to go.\"\n'They can cheat the system'\nOnce inside, the employees said there's some jockeying for desks, mainly for people who don't have assigned seating and don't reserve a spot ahead of time through the company's booking portal.\n\"I actually have a close friend who had to move desks probably five times over the span of an hour,\" said the first software engineer.\nIt's not just individuals who are being Tetris'd around the office in an effort to have teams sit together. The back-office manager said their team's designated seating was moved earlier in April, and that they'll need to be relocated again in the coming days.\n\"Everyone is still fed up, and everyone is still scratching their heads as to why we're doing this,\" the manager said.\nBoth software engineers said some intrepid workers had discovered they could swipe into the office and then leave a few hours later if they wanted to go home early.\n\"They can cheat the system like that,\" said the first engineer. \"Some people will just badge in, work for an hour or two, and leave.\"\nEmployees also questioned whether being back in the office is really fostering teamwork if it means some colleagues can't sit together.\n\"One of our guys\" \u2014 an executive director on a particular team \u2014 \"is sitting in a completely different wing, because we have no room left,\" the second engineer said. \"Tell me how collaboration is a driving force when your teams are now scattered throughout the building instead of sitting in one area.\"\nHave a tip?
