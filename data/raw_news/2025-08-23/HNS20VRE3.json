  "description": "Immigration officials intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty",
  "content": "Abrego Garcia\u2019s case became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.\n\n\u201cThe government immediately responded to Mr. Abrego\u2019s release with outrage,\u201d the filing reads. \u201cDespite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego\u2019s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE\u2019s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning.\u201d\n\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges, which stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security agent testified that he didn't begin investigating the traffic stop until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.\n\nAlthough Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. Those fears were somewhat allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland, which requires immigration officials to allow Abrego Garcia time to mount a defense, including 72 hours' notice before initiating deportation proceedings.\n\nFederal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador where he faces a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of violence, according to court filings.",

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers ask judge to delay release from jail over deportation fears\nKilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers ask judge to delay release from jail over deportation fears\nLawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a federal judge in Tennessee to delay releasing him from jail in order to prevent the Trump administration from trying to swiftly deport the Maryland construction worker.\nU.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr. in Nashville is expected to rule soon on whether to free Abrego Garcia while he awaits trial on human smuggling charges. If the Salvadoran national is released, U.S. officials have said he would be immediately detained by immigration authorities and targeted for deportation.\nAbrego Garcia became a prominent face in the debate over President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported to his native El Salvador in March. That expulsion violated a U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order in 2019 that shields Abrego Garcia from deportation to El Salvador because he likely faces threats of gang violence there.\nThe administration claimed that Abrego Garcia was in the MS-13 gang, although he wasn\u2019t charged and has repeatedly denied the allegation. Facing mounting pressure and a U.S. Supreme Court order, the Trump administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. last month to face the smuggling charges, which his attorneys have called \u201cpreposterous.\u201d\nThe smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding, during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with nine passengers. Police in Tennessee suspected human smuggling, but he was allowed to drive on.\nU.S. officials have said they\u2019ll try to deport Abrego Garcia to a country that isn\u2019t El Salvador, such as Mexico or South Sudan, before his trial starts in January because they allege he\u2019s a danger to the community.\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Nashville ruled a month ago that Abrego Garcia is eligible for release after she determined he\u2019s not a flight risk or a danger. Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys asked her to keep him in jail over deportation concerns.\nHolmes\u2019 ruling is being reviewed by Crenshaw after federal prosecutors filed a motion to revoke her release order.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys initially argued for his release but changed their strategy because of the government\u2019s plans to deport him if he is set free. With Crenshaw\u2019s decision imminent, Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys filed a motion Sunday night for a 30-day stay of any release order. The request would allow Abrego Garcia to \u201cevaluate his options and determine whether additional relief is necessary.\u201d\nEarlier this month, U.S. officials detailed their plans to try to expel Abrego Garcia in a federal court in Maryland. That\u2019s where Abrego Garcia\u2019s American wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, is suing the Trump administration over his wrongful deportation in March and is trying to prevent another expulsion.\nU.S. officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally around 2011 and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, although not to his native El Salvador.\nFollowing the immigration judge\u2019s decision in 2019, Abrego Garcia was released under federal supervision, received a federal work permit and checked in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement each year, his attorneys have said. But U.S. officials recently stated in court documents that they revoked Abrego Garcia\u2019s supervised release.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys in Maryland have asked U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to order the federal government to send Abrego Garcia to that state to await his trial, a bid that seeks to prevent deportation.\nHis lawyers also asked Xinis to issue at least a 72-hour hold that would prevent immediate deportation if he\u2019s released from jail in Tennessee. Xinis has not ruled on either request."

      "text": "Outrage grows over Maryland man\u2019s mistaken deportation to El Salvador prison\nOutrage grows over Maryland man\u2019s mistaken deportation to El Salvador prison\nIn the 22 days since Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to a notoriously violent prison in El Salvador, his young son has sought comfort in the scent of his missing father\u2019s clothes.\n\u201cHe shows me how much he missed Kilmar,\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said in court documents. \u201cHe has been finding Kilmar\u2019s work shirts and smelling them, to smell Kilmar\u2019s familiar scent.\u201d\nAbrego Garcia, 29, who worked as a sheet metal apprentice and was pursuing his journeyman license, was pulled over in an Ikea parking lot and arrested on March 12, with his 5-year-old son in the car.\nAn immigration judge in 2019 had granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where Abrego Garcia was likely to face persecution by local gangs. He had a legal work permit issued by the Department of Homeland Security, his lawyer said.\nYet he was sent back to his native El Salvador, which President Donald Trump \u2019s administration acknowledged on Monday was an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d\nDespite this, White House officials have argued against bringing him back, alleging without showing proof that he has ties to the MS-13 gang. The administration further says it lacks the power to seek his return from El Salvador\u2019s government, noting that a U.S. court could at best order the White House to \u201centreat \u2014 or even cajole \u2014 a close ally.\u201d\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s mistaken deportation has outraged many while raising concerns about the expulsion of noncitizens who were granted permission to be in the United States.\n\u2018Just ask them nicely\u2019\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s family and attorneys have denied any gang ties and argue that the U.S. has little evidence to support its claim. In court documents filed Wednesday, his lawyers argued that the U.S. government\u2019s mistake must be corrected and that he be returned.\nOtherwise, immigration court orders are \u201cmeaningless, because the government can deport whomever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want,\u201d attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg wrote.\nSandoval-Moshenberg noted the U.S. has been paying El Salvador\u2019s government to incarcerate Abrego Garcia and other deportees. He argued that efforts to return him would likely be successful: \u201cFirst, just ask them nicely to please give him back to us.\u201d\n\u201cTheir argument that there\u2019s nothing they could possibly do to get this guy back is significantly weakened by the fact that, on Wednesday of last week, they put Kristi Noem inside that prison,\u201d Sandoval-Moshenberg told The Associated Press in an interview, referring to the DHS secretary.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t so much as ask and say, \u2018By the way, you got this one guy. We messed up. Can we have him back, please?\u2019\u2019' he said, adding that the U.S. previously \u201cmoved mountains\u201d to return people mistakenly deported.\nOhio State law professor C\u00e9sar Cuauht\u00e9moc Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said it\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d to ask the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia, but the courts have little recourse if the White House refuses.\nThat\u2019s because Abrego Garcia is not a U.S. citizen and is outside the country, the professor said. The Supreme Court has long held that Congress, working with the executive branch, gets to decide who\u2019s allowed to enter and under what terms.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of a single instance in which a federal court has ordered a presidential administration to allow a particular person who is not a U.S. citizen into the United States,\u201d Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s erroneous deportation is \u201ctruly worrisome,\u201d the professor said, because \u201cwho\u2019s to say they won\u2019t deport somebody else who has legal permission to live in the United States?\u201d\nGangs and the family pupuseria\nAbrego Garcia said he fled El Salvador because a gang, Barrio 18, routinely extorted his parents\u2019 business for \u201crent\u201d money and threatened to kill him and his brother if the family didn\u2019t comply, according to court documents in his 2019 immigration case.\nThe family sold pupusas, El Salvador\u2019s signature dish, which are flat tortilla pouches that hold steaming blends of cheese, beans or savory pork. Abrego Garcia\u2019s mother ran the business, Pupuseria Cecilia, out of their home. His father was a former police officer.\nThe family eventually sent Abrego Garcia\u2019s brother Cesar to the U.S. Abrego Garcia was also sent to the U.S. after the gang repeatedly tried to recruit him, immigration court documents stated.\nAbrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador around 2011, according to his lawyers, and made his way to Maryland to join his older brother, a U.S. citizen.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s emigration from El Salvador was the subject of an October 2019 immigration hearing after he was arrested while looking for work and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement following allegations about his gang membership.\nICE had argued against his release because local police in Maryland had \u201cverified\u201d his gang membership, court records said. Abrego Garcia subsequently filed for asylum, while his lawyer submitted \u201cvoluminous\u201d evidence that he faced the threat of violence in El Salvador.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys also pushed back against the MS-13 claim, which was based on a confidential informant\u2019s allegations, court documents said. The informant alleged that Abrego Garcia belonged to an MS-13 chapter in New York, where he had never lived.\nAn immigration judge denied Abrego Garcia\u2019s asylum request in October 2019 but granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador. He was released and ICE did not appeal.\nAbrego Garcia later married Vasquez Sura, who is a U.S. citizen, and the couple are parents to their son and her two children from a previous relationship."

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleads not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee federal court\nKilmar Abrego Garcia pleads not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee federal court\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has become a flashpoint in President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, pleaded not guilty Friday to human smuggling charges in a federal court in Tennessee.\nThe hearing was the first chance the Maryland construction worker has had in a U.S. courtroom to answer the Trump administration\u2019s allegations since he was mistakenly deported in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys have characterized the smuggling case as a desperate attempt to justify the mistaken deportation. The investigation was launched weeks after the U.S. government deported Abrego Garcia and following a Supreme Court order and mounting pressure to return him.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers told a judge Friday that some government witnesses cooperated to get favors regarding their immigration status or criminal charges they were facing. A federal agent acknowledged during his testimony that one witness was living in the U.S. illegally with a criminal record and is now getting preferred status.\n\u201cHe sounds like the exact type of person this government should be trying to deport,\u201d Federal Public Defender Dumaka Shabazz said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to give all these other people deals to stay in the country just to get this one other person.\u201d\nMost of Friday\u2019s hearing focused on whether Abrego Garcia should be released as he awaits trial. U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes said she will write her decision \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d\nThe smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with nine passengers. While officers suspected possible smuggling, Abrego Garcia was allowed to go on his way with only a warning.\nBody camera footage shows a calm exchange between officers and Abrego Garcia. The officers then discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling before letting him go. One of the officers says, \u201cHe\u2019s hauling these people for money.\u201d Another says Abrego Garcia had $1,400 in an envelope.\nThe federal indictment accuses Abrego Garcia of smuggling throughout the U.S. hundreds of people living in the country illegally, including children and members of the violent MS-13 gang.\nIn briefings before Friday\u2019s hearing, U.S. attorneys described Abrego Garcia as a danger to the community and a flight risk. They also accused him of trafficking drugs and firearms and of abusing the women he transported, among other claims, although he is not charged with such crimes.\nRob McGuire, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, told the judge Friday that \u201cmigrant transportation is inherently dangerous.\u201d\nThe prosecutor also presented two orders of protection that Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife sought in 2020 and 2021 against him for domestic violence. Jennifer Vasquez Sura said this spring that the couple had worked things out \u201cprivately as a family, including by going to counseling.\u201d\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys rejected the prosecution\u2019s assertions that he was a danger, while arguing the charges aren\u2019t serious enough for detention.\n\u201cIf Mr. Abrego Garcia is so dangerous, this violent MS-13 guy, why did they wait almost three years to indict him on this?\u201d Shabazz asked the judge. \u201cWhy wait until literally after the Supreme Court told them they denied him due process and they had to bring him back before they investigate him?\u201d\nSpecial agent testifies\nFriday\u2019s proceeding included testimony from a Department of Homeland Security agent who quoted three unnamed witnesses who spoke to a grand jury about Abrego Garcia\u2019s alleged actions.\nSpecial agent Peter Joseph said that the witnesses saw Abrego Garcia trafficking people, guns or drugs and that Abrego Garcia earned upwards of $100,000 a year. One man said Abrego Garcia was sexually inappropriate towards underage girls, Joseph testified, while a woman said Abrego Garcia had solicited nude photos of her when she was 15 and she believed he was in the MS-13 gang.\nDuring cross-examination, Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys raised questions about possible conflicts of interest. One man had been convicted of a felony and was previously deported. He also was serving a 30-month sentence when investigators contacted him, Joseph acknowledged. That witness is now living in a halfway house and on his way to getting work authorization.\nThe second man is a very close relative of the first witness and \u201csaid he would help in return for his release from jail,\u201d said Richard Tennent, an assistant federal public defender. A third witness had previously been compensated for her work with law enforcement.\nTennent said one of the witnesses told investigators that Abrego Garcia would drive roundtrip between Maryland and Houston \u2014 nearly 24 hours each way \u2014 two or three times per week. The witness said Abrego Garcia usually had two of his children and his wife with him.\nTennent pointed out that Abrego Garcia has three children, two of whom are autistic.\n\u2018Kilmar wants you to have faith\u2019\nAbrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador who had been living in the United States for more than a decade before he was deported. The expulsion violated a 2019 U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order that shielded him from deportation to his native country because he likely faced gang persecution there.\nBefore Friday\u2019s hearing began in Nashville, Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife told a crowd outside a church that Thursday marked three months since the Trump administration \u201cabducted and disappeared my husband and separated him from our family.\u201d\nHer voice choked with emotion, Vasquez Sura said she saw her husband for the first time Thursday. She said, \u201cKilmar wants you to have faith.\u201d\nThe decision to charge Abrego Garcia criminally prompted the resignation of Ben Schrader, who was chief of the criminal division at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. He declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press last week. However, a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter confirmed the connection.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the Trump administration said that the human smuggling operation transported immigrants across the country, not that it brought immigrants into the country illegally.\n___\nFinley reported from Norfolk, Va."

He was pulled over for speeding in a vehicle with eight passengers and said they\u2019d been working in Missouri.\nOfficers then discussed among themselves their suspicions of human trafficking because nine people were traveling without luggage. One of the officers said: \u201cHe\u2019s hauling these people for money.\u201d Another said he had $1,400 in an envelope.\nAbrego Garcia was never charged with a crime, while the officers allowed him to drive on with only a warning about an expired driver\u2019s license, according to a report about the stop released last month by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The report said he was traveling from Texas to Maryland, via Missouri, to bring in people to perform construction work.\nThe Trump administration has been publicizing Abrego Garcia\u2019s interactions with police over the years, despite a lack of corresponding criminal charges, while it faces a federal court order and calls from some in Congress to return him to the U.S.\nAn attorney for Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said in a statement Friday that he saw no evidence of a crime in the released footage.\n\u201cBut the point is not the traffic stop \u2014 it\u2019s that Mr. Abrego Garcia deserves his day in court. Bring him back to the United States,\u201d Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\nWhen details of the Tennessee traffic stop were first publicized, Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife said he sometimes transported groups of fellow construction workers between job sites.\n\u201cUnfortunately, Kilmar is currently imprisoned without contact with the outside world, which means he cannot respond to the claims,\u201d Jennifer Vasquez Sura said in mid-April.\nAbergo Garcia fled his native El Salvador to the U.S. when he was 16 and lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years, court documents state. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported him in March to a Salvadoran prison over a 2019 accusation that he was in the MS-13 gang.\nPolice in Maryland had identified Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 gang member based on his tattoos, Chicago Bulls hoodie and the word of a criminal informant. But he was never charged. His lawyers say the informant claimed Abrego Garcia was in an MS-13 chapter in New York, where he\u2019s never lived.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s expulsion to El Salvador also violated a U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order in 2019 that shielded him from deportation to his native country. The judge had determined that Abrego Garcia would likely face persecution there by local gangs that had terrorized him and his family.\nAfter Abrego Garcia\u2019s family filed a lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia on April 4. The Supreme Court ruled April 10 that the administration must work to bring him back.\nXinis then lambasted a government lawyer who couldn\u2019t explain what, if anything, the Trump administration has done. She ordered officials to provide sworn testimony and other information to document their efforts.\nThe Trump administration appealed. But a federal appeals court backed Xinis\u2019 order for information in a blistering ruling. The case is ongoing.\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump acknowledged to ABC News on Tuesday that he could call El Salvador\u2019s president and have Abrego Garcia sent back. But Trump doubled down on his claims that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang.\nAttorney Sandoval-Moshenberg said Friday that Abrego Garcia should be able to answer the allegations himself before the U.S. immigration judge who heard his case in 2019.\n\u201cI have represented Kilmar Abrego Garcia for more than a month, and this bodycam video is the first time I\u2019ve heard his voice,\u201d Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \u201cHe has been denied the most basic protections of due process \u2014 no phone call to his lawyer, no call to his wife or child, and no opportunity to be heard.\u201d\n___\nFinley reported from Norfolk, Virginia."

Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife later saw him in photos and video from the prison, identifying her husband through his distinctive tattoos and two scars on his head.\nAt a news conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the Trump administration acknowledging it mistakenly deported a Maryland man with protected legal status to a notorious El Salvador prison\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials admitted in a court filing on Monday to an \u201cadministrative error\u201d in deporting him. The government\u2019s acknowledgment sparked immediate uproar from immigration advocates while prompting Vice President JD Vance and other administration officials to repeat the allegation that he\u2019s a gang member.\nMS-13 allegation stems from a 2019 arrest\nAbrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador around 2011, \u201cfleeing gang violence,\u201d according to his lawyers, and made his way to Maryland to join his older brother, a U.S. citizen.\n\u201cBeginning around 2006, gang members had stalked, hit, and threatened to kidnap and kill him in order to coerce his parents to succumb to their increasing demands for extortion,\u201d the complaint states of his life in his native country.\nAbrego Garcia later married a U.S. citizen and worked in construction to support her, their son and her two children from a previous relationship.\nThe allegations about his affiliation with MS-13 stem from a 2019 arrest outside a Maryland Home Depot store, where he and other young men were looking for work, according to the complaint.\nCounty police asked if he was a gang member and demanded information about other gang members. After explaining that he wasn\u2019t a gang member and had no information, he was turned over to ICE.\nICE argued against Abrego Garcia\u2019s release at a subsequent immigration court hearing because local police had \u201cverified\u201d his gang membership, the complaint said. The evidence they cited included his wearing of a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie and a confidential informant\u2019s claim that Abrego Garcia belonged to MS-13\u2019s \u201cWesterns clique\u201d in Long Island, New York, despite having never lived there.\nAbrego Garcia filed for asylum, while his lawyer submitted a \u201cvoluminous evidentiary filing establishing his eligibility for protection and contesting the unfounded allegation of gang membership,\u201d the complaint stated. In response, ICE cited the information previously provided by local police.\nAn immigration judge denied Abrego Garcia\u2019s asylum request in October 2019 but granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador. He was released after ICE did not appeal.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers say \u201che has neither been convicted nor charged with any crime\u201d and has fully complied with the conditions of his protected status, checking in with ICE yearly.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said U.S. government lawyers had multiple opportunities to try legally to deport him, including appealing the judge\u2019s 2019 decision or deporting him elsewhere.\n\u201cThere are lots of things they could have done,\u201d Sandoval-Moshenberg told The Associated Press. \u201cBut each one of those is in a court and gives him the opportunity to defend himself. And they didn\u2019t do any of them. They just put him on an airplane.\u201d\nICE calls deportation \u2018an oversight\u2019\nIn its court filing on Monday, the Trump administration said ICE \u201cwas aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador,\u201d but still deported Abrego Garcia \u201cbecause of an administrative error.\u201d\nAn ICE official called his deportation to El Salvador \u201can oversight\u201d in a statement submitted to the court on Monday.\nRobert Cerna, ICE\u2019s acting field office director of enforcement and removal operations, wrote that it was \u201ccarried out in good faith based on the existence of a final order of removal and Abrego-Garcia\u2019s purported membership in MS-13.\u201d\nThe administration argued against his return to the U.S., citing alleged gang ties and claiming that he is a danger to the community.\nThey also argued that the court lacks jurisdiction in the matter because Abrego Garcia is no longer in U.S. custody.\nThe administration wrote that Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys \u201cdo not argue that the United States can exercise its will over a foreign sovereign. The most they ask for is a court order that the United States entreat \u2014 or even cajole \u2014 a close ally.\u201d\nIn response to criticism, Vance posted a screenshot of court documents related to Abrego Garcia\u2019s 2019 bond proceeding on the social platform X and wrote that \u201cit\u2019s gross to get fired up about gang members getting deported while ignoring citizens they victimize.\u201d\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s removal comes as Trump follows up on campaign promises of mass deportations. Last month, he invoked the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act, granting himself powers to summarily deport to a notorious El Salvador prison hundreds of Venezuelans who were deemed by U.S. authorities to be associated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\nAbrego Garcia was deported at the same time on March 15 but under the U.S.\u2019s general immigration laws, not the wartime powers act, the White House said.\n___\nFinley reported from Norfolk, Virginia.

(AP) \u2014 The Trump administration hasn\u2019t decided where it would deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he is freed from a Tennessee jail, but a U.S. immigration official said Thursday that Mexico and South Sudan could be willing to accept the El Salvador native.\nThomas Giles, an assistant director for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, testified in a Maryland federal court that ICE would detain Abrego Garcia as soon as he\u2019s released to await trial on human smuggling charges.\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis is considering Abrego Garcia\u2019s request to order the U.S. government to send him to Maryland instead, a bid aimed at preventing the Trump administration from trying to deport him again.\nAbrego Garcia became a flashpoint over Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies when the Salvadoran national was wrongfully deported to his native country in March. Facing mounting pressure and a U.S. Supreme Court order, the administration returned him last month to face the smuggling charges.\nThe charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with nine passengers without any luggage, prompting police to suspect human smuggling. However, he was allowed to drive on.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers have called the charges \u201cpreposterous\u201d and argue that deporting him will deprive him from defending himself at trial. Justice Department attorneys have countered that he\u2019s a danger.\nA federal judge in Tennessee could release Abrego Garcia as soon as next Wednesday. A four-hour court hearing in Maryland on Thursday focused on what ICE would do.\nSascha Rand, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, pressed Giles for information about any due process that Abrego Garcia might receive in the U.S. immigration court system. He also asked the ICE official how Abrego Garcia would be treated in a country such as Mexico or South Sudan.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to send people to a country where they\u2019re going to get persecuted or tortured,\u201d Giles said.\nRand asked Giles if Abrego Garcia was persecuted or tortured at the notorious Salvadoran megaprison the Trump administration sent him to in March.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Giles said.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers recently alleged in court documents that he was beaten and subjected to psychological torture at the facility. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele denied the allegations.\nRand also asked Giles if Abrego Garcia would be removed without any notice or procedures, to which Giles said \u201cno.\u201d The ICE official said Abrego Garcia could express a fear of going to the country he\u2019s being sent to, which could trigger a review process.\nGiles said he assumed someone would immediately have to express that fear.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about minutes or seconds here?\u201d Rand asked.\nThe person can still get an interview if the fear is expressed before the plane takes off, Giles said. If a \u201ccredible fear\u201d is determined, that person will be referred to an immigration judge for a final determination.\nXinis, the judge, briefly brought up the possibility of a 48-hour pause on any attempts to deport Abrego Garcia. However, no agreement was made.\nSimon Sandoval-Moshenberg, another attorney for Abrego Garcia, told reporters outside the Maryland courtroom that the government wouldn\u2019t agree to a 48-hour pause. The hearing will resume Friday morning.\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges in Tennessee. A federal judge in Nashville was preparing to release him, determining he was not a flight risk or a danger. But the judge has agreed to keep him behind bars over his legal team\u2019s deportation concerns.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers have asked that judge to delay his release until a July 16 court hearing in Nashville to consider a request by prosecutors to revoke Abrego Garcia\u2019s release order while he awaits trial.\nWhen the administration deported Abrego Garcia in March, it violated a U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order in 2019 that shielded Abrego Garcia from being sent to his native country. The immigration judge had determined that Abrego Garcia likely faced persecution by local gangs that had terrorized him and his family.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s wife is suing the administration over his deportation in March and is trying to prevent him from being expelled again. Her lawsuit is being handled by Xinis, the judge in Maryland. Abrego Garcia lived and worked in the state for more than a decade, working construction and raising a family, before he was deported.\nThe administration claimed that it deported Abrego Garcia because was in the MS-13 gang, although Abrego Garcia wasn\u2019t charged and has repeatedly denied the allegation."

That supervision had allowed Abrego Garcia to live and work in Maryland for years, while he periodically checked in with ICE.\n\u201cDefendants have done little to assure the Court that absent intervention, Abrego Garcia\u2019s due process rights will be protected,\u201d Xinis wrote in her order.\nAbrego Garcia became a prominent face in the debate over President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies following his wrongful explusion to El Salvador in March. Trump\u2019s administration violated a U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order in 2019 that shields Abrego Garcia from deportation to El Salvador because he likely faces threats of gang violence there.\nThe smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding, during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with nine passengers. Police in Tennessee suspected human smuggling, but he was allowed to drive on.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s criminal attorneys in the Tennessee case want him released from jail to await trial, but only if he won\u2019t be taken into ICE custody and deported. A federal judge in that criminal case on Wednesday affirmed that Abrego Garcia is eligible for release. U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw ruled that appropriate release conditions will mitigate any risk of flight or any danger to the community.\nCrenshaw then sent the case back to U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes, who originally held that Abrego Garcia is eligible for release last month. Holmes has held off on ordering his release at the request of Abrego Garcia\u2019s own lawyers. On Wednesday, she signed yet another order putting off his release from jail, this time for 30 days.\nU.S. officials have said they\u2019ll try to deport Abrego Garcia to a country that isn\u2019t El Salvador, such as Mexico or South Sudan, before his trial starts in January because they allege he\u2019s a danger to the community.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s American wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, is suing the Trump administration in Xinis\u2019 Maryland court over his wrongful deportation in March and is trying to prevent another expulsion.\nU.S. officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally around 2011 and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, although not to his native El Salvador. Following the 2019 decision, Abrego Garcia was released under federal supervision, received a federal work permit and checked in with ICE each year, his attorneys have said.\nThe Trump administration recently stated in court documents that they revoked Abrego Garcia\u2019s supervised release when they deported him in March, claiming that he was in the MS-13 gang.\n____\nAssociated Press writer Travis Loller contributed from Nashville, Tenn."

He said he and 20 others were forced to kneel all night long and guards hit anyone who fell.\nAbrego Garcia was living in Maryland when he was mistakenly deported and became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. The new details of Abrego Garcia\u2019s incarceration in El Salvador were added to a lawsuit against the Trump administration that Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife filed in Maryland federal court after he was deported.\nThe Trump administration has asked a federal judge in Maryland to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that it is now moot because the government returned him to the United States as ordered by the court.\nA U.S. immigration judge in 2019 had barred Abrego Garcia from being deported back to his native El Salvador because he likely faced persecution there by local gangs who had terrorized him and his family. The Trump administration deported him there despite the judge\u2019s 2019 order and later described it as an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d Trump and other officials have since doubled down on claims Abrego Garcia was in the MS-13 gang.\nOn March 15, Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador and sent to the country\u2019s mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.\nIn the new court documents, Abrego Garcia said detainees at CECOT \u201cwere confined to metal bunks with no mattresses in an overcrowded cell with no windows, bright lights that remained on 24 hours a day, and minimal access to sanitation.\u201d\nHe said prison officials told him repeatedly that they would transfer him to cells with people who were gang members who would \u201ctear\u201d him apart.
