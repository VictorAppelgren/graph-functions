  "description": "Hollywood star Denzel Washington called out Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones amid the franchise's Super Bowl drought and Micah Parsons contract talks.",
  "content": "New York native Denzel Washington, one of Hollywood's biggest stars, said he's been an avid supporter of the Dallas Cowboys for decades.\n\nBut the two-time Academy Award winner expressed his frustration with the current state of his beloved NFL franchise. Washington made a guest appearance on ESPN's \"First Take\" program on Tuesday in support of his upcoming film \"Highest 2 Lowest.\"\n\nWhile much of his conversation with host Stephen A. Smith centered on the film, Washington took a moment to call out longtime Cowboys owner Jerry Jones as the franchise's Super Bowl drought approaches the three-decade mark.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nCowboys star pass rusher Micah Parsons continues to hold out and seek a trade as talks with Jones and the team's front office on a long-term contract extension appeared to stall.\n\nWashington suggested Jones handling of the Parsons situation was ultimately a disservice to the team's fans.\n\n\"I don\u2019t like what (Jones) is doing\u2026 I respect the owner, but I don\u2019t like what it\u2019s doing to the fans,\" Washington said. \"He\u2019s not thinking about us, the fans. He\u2019s thinking about his pockets. It\u2019s like\u2026 there\u2019s box office and there\u2019s the Oscars. And you ain\u2019t been to (the Oscars) in a minute. At the end of the day, I\u2019m still gonna wear my hat with the star on it.\"\n\nWashington then tried to pivot back to discussing the film, but not before offering Jones more advice.\n\nWashington also said he's been a Cowboys fan \"since the 1960s.\" The 70-year-old actor has also long supported the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nParsons missed four games last season but still finished the year with 12 sacks. He has recorded double-digit sacks in each of his four seasons in the NFL.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLast week, Jones admitted that he was not completely confident Parsons would be in a Cowboys uniform for the team's season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\"No, absolutely not,\" Jones said last Tuesday. \"A big part of that is his decision. How would I know that?\"\n\nThe Cowboys have won three Super Bowl titles since Jones became the franchise's controlling owner. However, the team has not reached the championship game since the 1995 season.\n\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",

      "text": "The Dallas Cowboys are an American football franchise located in the Dallas-Forth Worth metroplex that plays in the National Football League and competes within the National Football Conference East division. The Cowboys have been a staple of American football for generations. Originally joining the NFL in 1960, the team still holds a large national following across the country. Although they are based in the Dallas area, the franchise has played all of its home games in Arlington, Texas, at AT&T Stadium since the field opened in 2009.\nThe current head coach of the team is Mike McCarthy, preceded by Jason Garett, who led the team for nearly a decade. The general manager, owner, and president of the team since 1989 is businessman Jerry Jones. The Cowboys are widely considered one of the most popular teams in the league. Furthermore, the franchise holds the record for most consecutive sell-outs.\nThey hold 190 regular season and post-season games sold out games. The Cowboys have won the Super Bowl five times with eleven overall appearances, slightly behind the record holder New England Patriots. Currently, the franchise has won eight NFC championships, the most in the NFL. They qualified for the playoffs thirty-four times and held 20 straight winning seasons from 1966 to 1985. The large fanbase of the Cowboys has helped contribute to their financial stability and success as a team through the decades.\nFor instance, multiple outlets value the team to be worth billions of dollars and the most profitable franchise in the NFL. In 2018, they earned the title of becoming the first franchise to be worth $5 billion and, in prior years, earned more than half a billion in revenue annually. Prior to moving to the AT&T Stadium in 2009, the Cowboys played at the Texas Stadium and, before that, the Cotton Bowl arena."
