  "description": "The latest report shows that switching to Windows 11 for one diehard group of users, gamers, is inching up (but there\u2019s a way to go).",
  "content": "Microsoft stops support for Windows 10 on Oct. 14, 2025 (though you can extend this for a year). Keen gamers make up one group of Windows 10 diehards, but the latest report from Steam shows they are very slowly switching over.\n\nMany users, including gamers, are using machines which aren\u2019t capable of running Windows 11, so will have to extend unless they buy new equipment. And if it ain\u2019t broke, you can see why they don\u2019t want to change.\n\nAs spotted by Windows Latest, the latest Steam Hardware & Software Survey, a monthly survey by the essential gaming distribution platform, shows how many of its users are on Windows (spoiler: very nearly all of them), and which versions.\n\nFirst, the bad news for Microsoft: some users are still using Windows 7. Not many, though, just 0.09%, which is unchanged from the previous survey.\n\nNext up is Windows 10, which still, just months before support ends, still manages 35.2% of the total. Microsoft will be happy that that figure has declined, as it wants everyone on Windows 11, but less happy that the drop is just 0.5% compared to the previous total.\n\nStill, Windows 11, the figure Microsoft is keenest to see grow is creeping up and is now at 59.9%, almost exactly three fifths, then.\n\nWindows overall makes up 95.23%, a tiny fraction of 1% less than the last survey.\n\nThe other players, since you ask, are Mac users, which the survey quaintly refers to as OSX, who make up just 1.88% of the users. But it\u2019s growing! A whole 0.12% up!\n\nThe rest of the users are on Linux, which is more than the Mac, at 2.89%\n\nMicrosoft continues to push the change to Windows 11, and for those who can do it on their current computer, there are many benefits \u2014 even if it may not be free, after all.",

      "text": "Microsoft continues to encourage users to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11, before Windows 10 goes end-of-life on Oct.14. However, though the upgrade is free, it looks like many people will need a Microsoft subscription to make the move.\nThe latest, rather slick, video from Microsoft promoting Windows 11 has small print which shows that the update will cost money in many cases. As spotted by Windows Latest, the video, which begins with an upbeat exhortation to \u201cMove your world in a snap,\u201d quietly adds that some apps will have to be reinstalled from the app provider once you\u2019ve migrated your data.\nWell, that\u2019s only a mild annoyance, although if you\u2019ve been on Windows 10 for a lot of years, you may find there\u2019s quite a few of those apps.\nEven so, I think that still qualifies as a \u201cseamless transfer,\u201d as Microsoft describes it.\nHowever, as the screen shows a cursor clicking on the words \u201cBack up\u201d the bottom of the display reads, \u201cRequires Microsoft account; data transfers more than 5GB require Microsoft subscription or trial.\u201d\n\u201cIt highlights the system backup feature that can save and migrate your system settings, apps, preferences, and personal files to another PC. All you need to do is enroll the device in the backup and then ensure everything is backed including personal files and folders,\u201d Windows Latest says.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but a 5GB limit would be impossible for me. So, many people, perhaps almost everyone, will need to sign up, even if only briefly, for OneDrive.\n\u201cThe problem is that not everyone relies on or trusts OneDrive with their data,\u201d Windows Latest adds. It piles up the cost of moving to Windows 11, which now requires purchasing a new PC if your current one cannot comply with all the hardware requirements.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s possible to use an external drive to copy the data, it\u2019s not as slick or seamless as Microsoft\u2019s suggested method. And if you don\u2019t have a subscription, you could sign up for a trial and get rid of it straight after the transition. Just don\u2019t forget to cancel. And that doesn\u2019t solve the trust issue if that\u2019s holding you back."

      "text": "With Windows 10 support ending in just two months, more users are shifting to Windows 11.\nAccording to Steam\u2019s July 2025 survey, 59.9% of gamers now use Windows 11, while Windows 10 sits at 35.19%.\nThe shift is expected to speed up, especially since Nvidia plans to stop driver support for Windows 10 next year, which will push gamers to upgrade if they want the latest performance boosts.\nWindows still dominates overall, with 95.53% of Steam users on the platform. Linux and macOS trail behind with 2.89% and 1.88%, respectively.\nOn the hardware side, the RTX 3060 remains the most used GPU, and most players still use six-core CPUs, 16GB RAM, and 1080p displays.\nMicrosoft just added gpt-oss-120B and gpt-oss-20B to Azure AI Foundry and smaller model runs natively on Windows 11.\nWhat stands out is that the gpt-oss-20B model is now GPU-optimized for local use on Windows PCs, marking the first time an OpenAI model like this can run natively on Windows.\nIf your system has a discrete GPU with at least 16GB of VRAM, you're good to go. You can start building with it today using Foundry Local or the AI Toolkit in VS Code.\nThis means faster iteration, more control, and no need to rely on cloud access for testing or deployment. More device support is also expected soon.\nIn addition, Microsoft is testing new features for Copilot on Windows 11, including 'Actions' where AI can open a browser and do things for you.\nIf you\u2019ve got a Radeon graphics card, AMD just released a new driver update you might want to grab.\n25.8.1 WHQL brings support for several upcoming games and also adds compatibility with the new RX 9060 non-XT GPU.\nYou\u2019ll notice better performance in titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Battlefield 6 beta, F1 25, and more. The update also includes AMD\u2019s latest FSR 4 enhancements.\nOn top of that, AMD has fixed bugs like video stuttering in Chrome, crashes in Monster Hunter Wilds and Battlefield 2042, and texture issues with Oculus Rift S.\nIf you play Warzone on Verdansk, stuttering should feel less annoying now. This update makes your Radeon card more ready for what's coming next.\nBattlefield 6 now requires Secure Boot on Windows 11.\nBattlefield 6 is almost here, and while fans are excited after the trailer, PC players have a small roadblock.\nIf you're on Windows and plan to join the beta starting August 7, EA now requires you to enable Secure Boot on your PC. This feature makes sure only trusted software runs during startup. It is needed for EA\u2019s anti-cheat system called Javelin.\nIt helps keep cheaters out, but turning it on might involve changes in your BIOS settings. EA has shared a guide, but the steps can be tricky.\nThis is not the first time they have done this. Battlefield 2042 had the same rule. So check your settings before the beta begins.\nWhat's new in the most recent update for Windows 11? All these features in the video are coming to everyone on August 12 when Patch Tuesday rolls out.\nIf you use Microsoft 365 Copilot, there\u2019s a new feature inside Word called \u201cDraft with Copilot.\u201d It helps you write faster by generating content based on your prompts.\nWindows is updating the Settings app too. Everyone will see the search bar at the top now, but on AI PCs, it\u2019s powered by a smart assistant.\nThere\u2019s a new recovery feature called Quick Machine Recovery. If your system runs into a big issue, Windows can now automatically try to repair itself by downloading a fix.\nAll these features ship later this month. We've a video on YouTube.\nIt\u2019s a major milestone for Windows on ARM as Adobe has finally released native versions of several popular creative apps.\nPremiere Pro, After Effects, Audition, and Media Encoder are now available in beta for ARM-powered Windows devices.\nThis move brings significant performance and battery life improvements, especially for users running Snapdragon X Series chips. Previously, these apps only ran in emulated mode, which limited efficiency and responsiveness.\nHowever, since the apps are still in beta, they come with limitations.\nAdobe notes that some missing features, like support for certain codecs and plugins, will not be implemented even after the stable release.\nMicrosoft has released a new Windows 11 Canary build (27913) for Insiders, focused on small but meaningful fixes.\nOne of the most noticeable changes is the Settings app\u2019s search box, now centered at the top for a more unified experience.\nThis update also fixes a strange bug where some users heard the old Windows Vista boot sound instead of the Windows 11 one.\nBackground glitches causing wallpapers to go black have been addressed too.\nOther fixes include: Settings crashing under Power & Battery, Broken apostrophes showing as weird characters, Audio cutting out after casting to a TV, and BSODs caused due to VPN connections.\nWindows 11 is finally fixing a long-standing annoyance for multi-monitor users.\nUntil now, only your main screen let you open the notification center and calendar by clicking the taskbar clock.\nOn secondary displays, the clock was there, but it didn\u2019t do anything. That\u2019s changing.\nMicrosoft is now rolling out an update that makes the taskbar on all monitors more functional. You can now click the clock on any screen to open the calendar flyout or the notification center. This means no more moving your cursor across monitors just to check alerts or events.\nThis small but meaningful upgrade is now available for Windows Insiders in the Dev and Beta Channels.\nMicrosoft is quietly rolling out a new Copilot mode called Smart, and it could be one of the biggest upgrades yet.\nWe found that existing modes like Quick Response, Think Deeper, and Deep Research let you pick how fast or detailed the AI replies are.\nSmart mode does that thinking for you. It adapts automatically, offering quick answers when that\u2019s enough, and going deeper when the task demands more reasoning.\nBehind the scenes, Smart is linked to GPT-5, the next-gen model from OpenAI. GPT-5 is designed to unify the o-series and GPT-series into one powerful system that chooses the right thinking depth automatically.\nMicrosoft Excel now supports automatic updates for PivotTables. This long-requested feature means you no longer have to manually refresh your table when new data is added.\nWith Auto Refresh turned on, your PivotTable updates itself in real time whenever the source data changes.\nAuto Refresh is enabled by default for new PivotTables. You can turn it on or off for older tables by selecting the PivotTable, then going to the PivotTable Analyze tab and clicking the Auto Refresh option.\nThis works only for data within the same workbook. External data sources are not supported.\nIf Auto Refresh fails, Excel will show a small alert in the bottom-left corner."

      "text": "Updated Aug. 8 with more details of exactly what\u2019s coming and when.\nIn September, Apple will launch the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and an all-new model that\u2019s especially slim and is nicknamed iPhone 17 Air. Here\u2019s everything that will happen between now and the day you can buy one, down to the minute, including when pre-orders will open, how you may be able to jump to the head of that line, and when to expect reviews of the phones to appear.\nAnd remember, everything here applies to Apple Watch as well, as the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 (with a bigger-than-ever display) are also predicted to appear, possibly alongside Apple Watch SE 3rd generation and Apple AirPods Pro 3.\niPhone 17: Keynote Announcement\nThe keynote is when Apple will reveal its new handsets (plus new Apple Watch models, including an Apple Watch Ultra 3 which may have the biggest display yet). I believe it will be announced at around 8 a.m. Pacific on Tuesday, Aug. 26. You can read full details of the announcement and how it will happen here.\niPhone 17: Keynote at 10 a.m. Tuesday, Sept. 9\nOnce the keynote has been announced, around two weeks will pass until it takes place. Unless there\u2019s a major surprise, it will be in the 1,000-seater Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park, the company\u2019s Cupertino headquarters.\nIt will start at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, 6 p.m. U.K. time.\nAs for the date, that\u2019s looking increasingly likely to be the date I predicted in July: Tuesday, Sept. 9 \u2014 a recent leak points to the same date. That said, things can still change, so the Monday or Wednesday of that week are still possible.\nMuch less likely is an event in the week before: Labor Day would push the event to the Wednesday instead of the Tuesday events Apple likes best and it would clash with the Berlin tech show IFA, so many favored press would be in the wrong country.\nBy 12 noon Pacific, we\u2019ll know all the new iPhones by name, and have access to all their secrets, including pricing.\niPhone 17: Pre-Orders Friday, Sept. 12\nThe date for pre-orders opening is routinely the Friday following the keynote. The time, if it\u2019s the same as last year, will be 5 a.m. Pacific, 8 a.m. Eastern, 1 p.m. U.K.\nSometimes Apple lets customers get ahead of the curve by choosing their preferred phone (model, color and storage level) the night before and put them in their shopping bag ready for pre-orders to open the following day.\nNote also that it\u2019s possible that not all phones will be released on the same day, even though they\u2019ll be announced together. This has happened in the past when there have been new categories, for instance.\niPhone 17: Reviews\nReviews from selected press will be under embargo until one day in the run-up to release. For the iPhone, this will likely be Tuesday, Sept. 16 or Wednesday, Sept. 17.\nThe timing can change but the embargo lift is often at 6 a.m. Pacific, 9 a.m. Eastern, 2 p.m. U.K.iPhone 17: Release Date Friday, Sept.19\nThis is customarily the Friday in the week following the keynote, and will be in the morning. Usually, this is 7 a.m. local time."
