  "title": "I Can Finally Text With iMessage on My Android Device: Here's the Trick",
  "description": "Message with blue bubbles from your Android device.",
  "content": "Switching from iPhone to Android usually means losing access to Apple\u2019s exclusive features. Despite this, I've found a way to enjoy iMessage (one of the best parts of the Apple ecosystem) without giving up my Android phone.\n\nOpenBubbles Is the Answer You've Been Looking For\n\nSending texts via RCS on an iPhone isn't perfect, so the blue bubble vs. green bubble gap still exists. Some people continue to use iMessage exclusively, so group chats can feel awkward if everyone has to switch to green bubbles just because of you.\n\nOpenBubbles offers a way around this. It uses the hardware code of an Apple device you already own to send and receive iMessages on your Android phone. Once you set it up with a Mac or an old iPhone, that device acts as a relay, and your messages appear directly in the OpenBubbles app on your Android phone.\n\nThis setup does not rely on any third-party cloud service. Everything runs through your own device, which makes it easier to trust from a privacy standpoint. If you don't have an Apple device to spare, OpenBubbles also offers dedicated hardware that can act as a relay. However, there is currently a waitlist for this, and using it means giving up some of the privacy benefits while also paying a monthly fee.\n\nIt also supports FaceTime, and the experience is far better than using FaceTime on an Android device via a web browser. With this method, you can also initiate calls, unlike the official browser option.\n\nFirst, install the OpenBubbles app on your Android phone via the Play Store. Once that\u2019s done, head over to OpenBubbles\u2019 self-hosting page and download the QR code generator app for your Mac. Open the app like you would any other app on your Mac, and it will display a QR code on the screen.\n\nOn your Android phone, launch the OpenBubbles app, then tap Next to get through the onboarding menus. Select the Self-hosted option, then choose Scan Code to scan the QR code displayed on your Mac.\n\nIf you can't scan the code for some reason, select Copy Activation Code on your Mac and manually enter that code in the OpenBubbles app. You might wish to use a messaging app or shared clipboard so you can copy and paste the code, as it's quite long.\n\nNext, you'll be prompted to enter your Apple Account's credentials. Your password is sent directly to Apple\u2019s servers, so OpenBubbles never has access to it.\n\nOnce the setup is complete, you can start sending iMessages right away. Tap the send message icon in the bottom-right corner, choose a contact, and type your message.\n\nThis is only the beginning, though. OpenBubbles can do much more than send and receive iMessages, and setting it up unlocks several other useful features.\n\nGet FaceTime, iMessage Games, and More Working Flawlessly\n\nOpenBubbles is not only about sending and receiving iMessages. It also brings over several other Apple-exclusive features that work just as well on Android. One of the biggest ones is FaceTime; you can place FaceTime calls directly from within the app by opening a conversation and tapping the video icon in the top-right corner.\n\nIncoming FaceTime calls also show up like a regular call on your phone, so you can answer without having to fumble through extra menus or links.\n\nSharing media works exactly as it does on an iPhone. You can send full-resolution photos and videos by tapping the plus (+) icon in the chat and choosing the attachment option you need. The layout will feel familiar if you have used iMessage before, with only a few small UI differences compared to iOS.\n\nOpenBubbles also includes iMessage games via an add-on app called OpenPiegon. After downloading the app, which integrates directly with OpenBubbles, you can play most iMessage games just like you would on an iPhone. Not every single game is supported, but the majority work without issues.\n\nOnce OpenPiegon is installed, you don\u2019t need to open it separately. Head into an iMessage chat, tap the plus (+) icon, select OpenPiegon, and pick the game you want to play.\n\nYou can also track your Apple devices through a built-in map feature. Tap the three dots in the top-right corner and select Map to see their locations. Keep in mind that this only shows where your devices are; you won\u2019t be able to ping them or mark them as lost.\n\nYou can also view shared albums from the same menu, but you can\u2019t upload photos to them. In my experience, this feature has been a bit buggy, so you shouldn't depend on it too much.\n\nSwitching from an iPhone to Android comes with its fair share of compromises, but OpenBubbles has been one of the standout apps that made the mobile OS transition much smoother for me.\n\nI went into it expecting a makeshift workaround that I\u2019d only use occasionally, but it turned out to be one of the most useful apps I\u2019ve ever tried on my Samsung phone.",

      "text": "Switching from iOS to Android can feel overwhelming, especially if you\u2019ve spent years in Apple\u2019s walled garden. But with the right set of apps, the move doesn\u2019t just get easier\u2014it starts to feel like the better choice.\n5 LocalSend\nAmong all the features in Apple\u2019s ecosystem, AirDrop was easily my favorite, and I'd imagine it also tops the list for many others. So, of course, I really missed it after switching to Android.\nI did try sharing files via Quick Share, but it was a mess. It barely worked for me, and half the time it refused to even establish a connection. I eventually found myself reaching for a USB-C cable just to move a 100MB file.\nThankfully, that\u2019s when I discovered LocalSend\u2014an open-source AirDrop alternative that instantly became one of my most-used apps. It works across Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and even Linux, so I don\u2019t feel locked into any one ecosystem anymore.\nYou don\u2019t need to be on the same brand of device or signed in to any account; just connect to the same Wi-Fi network, and you\u2019re good to go. You can send photos, files, text, clipboard data, and even entire folders. It\u2019s fully local too, meaning nothing gets uploaded to the cloud, and there are no ads or trackers.\nWhat's amazing is that it\u2019s also faster than AirDrop in many cases, especially with bigger files. It just works, and that alone puts it miles ahead of Quick Share (which somehow still struggles with basic stability).\nDownload: LocalSend (Free)\n4 OpenBubbles\nEven with iPhones finally getting RCS support, the blue bubble vs. green bubble divide is still very real. I still run into people who only use iMessage, and although I use a Mac as my main computer, I never fully got away from needing iMessage on my phone.\nOpenBubbles fixes that. It lets me use iMessage directly on my Samsung phone by turning one of my Apple devices into a relay. You just set it up once using a Mac or an old iPhone you already own, and after that, everything runs through the OpenBubbles app on your Android phone.\nIt doesn\u2019t rely on any third-party cloud server; it\u2019s all hosted on your own device. That made it a lot easier to trust from a privacy standpoint.\nEven FaceTime works, and it's implemented much better than using FaceTime on an Android device via a web browser. If you don\u2019t have an Apple device to use as the relay, you can use OpenBubble's hardware as the server, though this is currently in limited beta with a waitlist.\nFor now, if you already own a Mac or have an old iPhone lying around, this is one of the easiest and most reliable ways to bring iMessage to Android. While the initial setup can be a bit tedious, it's definitely worth it.\nDownload: OpenBubbles (Free)\n3 iCloud\nSwitching ecosystems isn\u2019t something you can realistically do overnight\u2014especially when it involves spending thousands of dollars at once. Even after moving to Android, there are still a few Apple services I continue to rely on.\nI use my AirPods regularly with my Android phone, and I still need access to services like Apple Notes and Find My, which I haven\u2019t gotten around to fully migrating yet.\nThat\u2019s where the iCloud web app has come in handy, as it gives me access to pretty much everything I still have tied to my Apple ID. You can access your iCloud Drive, all the photos previously synced from your Apple devices, and much more\u2014all directly through the web.\nTo make this even easier, I\u2019ve added the iCloud website as a shortcut to my Android home screen. It opens in its own window and feels a lot like using a native app.\nIt\u2019s not perfect, and obviously lacks the polish of Apple\u2019s first-party apps, but it works well enough for now. Eventually, I do plan to export everything and fully disconnect from the Apple ecosystem, but until then, this is a pretty solid middle ground.\nVisit: iCloud (Free, subscription available)\n2 Automate\nOne of the tools I missed most after leaving iOS was the Shortcuts app. It wasn\u2019t super-advanced, but it was convenient for automating small tasks without much effort. Android doesn\u2019t really come with anything similar out of the box, and Google Assistant Routines are too basic to be useful most of the time.\nThat\u2019s where Automate comes in. Not only is it the closest I've found to Shortcuts, but it's a much more powerful alternative. Like Shortcuts, it uses a flow-based interface where you connect blocks to build out what you want the phone to do. But Automate goes way beyond what Apple offers.\nOne of the best aspects is the community around it. There\u2019s a massive library of user-created flows you can download and try out. You\u2019ll probably end up finding workflows you never thought you needed.\nIf you want even more control and don't mind a slightly steeper learning curve, Tasker is worth checking out too. While it's not free, it\u2019s the gold standard for Android automation.\nDownload: Automate (Free, in-app purchase available)\n1 Bitwarden\nSwitching ecosystems meant I needed a new password manager\u2014it's one of those tools I rely on heavily, and going without one wasn\u2019t an option. Since the Apple Passwords app was out of the picture on Android, I started looking into alternatives. After comparing a few, Bitwarden stood out as the one that checked all the right boxes, so I decided to go with it.\nI wasn\u2019t entirely sure if Apple would make it easy to export my saved passwords, but thankfully, the process turned out to be pretty straightforward. You can export all your passwords as a CSV file, and Bitwarden supports importing that directly, filling everything in automatically without much hassle.\nThe Apple Passwords app only supports exporting passwords on iOS 26 and later.\nEven though my needs were fairly basic, I liked knowing that Bitwarden also offers paid tiers for extras like encrypted file storage, advanced 2FA options, and other security-focused features. It\u2019s nice to have the option to upgrade if I ever need more.\nDownload: Bitwarden (Free, subscription available)\nWhile my switch from iOS to Android hasn\u2019t been flawless, I\u2019m genuinely enjoying my Samsung phone a lot more than I expected. It\u2019s refreshing to finally break free from the limitations I constantly ran into on my iPhone.\nThere are still a few bits I miss, but overall, the added flexibility has made the switch worth it."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\n- Android users can't initiate FaceTime calls but can join them via invitation links shared by Apple users.\n- The FaceTime invitation link can only be created on an Apple device.\n- To join a FaceTime call on Android, tap the link sent by the Apple user, join the call, and wait for your join request to be approved.\nAlthough FaceTime is exclusive to Apple devices, you can still participate in FaceTime calls as an Android user if an Apple user invites you. Below, we'll teach you how to get a FaceTime link and join the call from an Android device.\nYou Can't Start a FaceTime Call on Android\nCan you get FaceTime on Android? The simple answer is you can only join a call that an Apple user initiated through invitation links. There's no FaceTime app for Android, so you can't start a FaceTime call yourself.\nInstead of an app, FaceTime works via the web browser on your Android device. And since it runs on a web browser, you can also use FaceTime on a Windows PC.\nHowever, some FaceTime features are not accessible to Android users. For example, you can't activate Memoji or use hand gestures to trigger FaceTime reactions.\nStill, these restrictions are not too bothersome. The available features are enough to help you connect with your Apple contacts and have a good conversation. Calls are end-to-end encrypted, while video and audio quality is as you would expect from FaceTime.\nCreate a FaceTime Link on iPhone for Android Devices\nTo start, you'll need to request an Apple device user to generate and share a FaceTime invitation link with you. As mentioned earlier, you cannot generate a FaceTime link on an Android device.\nYour friend or family member will need to check the iOS version and ensure that their iPhone or iPad runs on iOS/iPadOS 15 or later. On a Mac, at least macOS Monterey is required to create FaceTime links.\nIn the example below, we demonstrate how to generate a FaceTime link on an iPhone:\n- First, make sure you've set up FaceTime in your iPhone's Settings app.\n- Next, open the FaceTime app and tap Create Link.\n- From the Share sheet, choose WhatsApp or any other social platform to send the link to your Android contact. You can tap Add Name to name the link if you want to, but it isn't necessary.\n- You've now created an invitation link. It will appear in the Upcoming section of FaceTime. Tap the link, tap Join, and wait for your Android friend to send a join request.\nIf you accidentally exited the Share sheet earlier and failed to share the FaceTime link at Step 3, don't worry. Just hit the Info (i) button next to the FaceTime link and tap Share Link to send it to your Android contact.\nNote that our steps above create an instant FaceTime link. However, you can opt to schedule a FaceTime call for later if you prefer.\nHow to Join a FaceTime Call on Android\nAs an Android user, once you receive the FaceTime link from your Apple contact, follow these steps:\n- Tap the link to load the FaceTime page on your device's web browser.\n- Enter your name in the Name field and tap Continue.\n- Select Allow if your browser prompts to grant FaceTime access to your camera and microphone.\n- Once your camera opens, tap the green Join button.\nThe Apple user who created the FaceTime link will receive a join request on their device. On their end, they need to tap the green checkmark to approve your request.\nThe request only appears on their screen for a second or two. If they missed that, they need to tap the Info (i) icon, tap the green checkmark, and then tap Done to return to the FaceTime call.\nWith that, you have successfully joined the call. You will see a toolbar with several control options, including a Full Screen button, Mute switch, Camera toggle to show/hide video, and more.\nWhen your call is over, tap anywhere on your screen for the toolbar to reappear. You can't end the FaceTime call as an Android user, so simply select the red Leave button to exit the call.\nOverall, it's a pretty frictionless process that requires no special software, app, or browser plugin. So, if you have been wondering how to video chat with friends who own Apple devices, now you know how to.\nWith a FaceTime invite link and a modern browser, you can easily access FaceTime and connect with your friends and family who use Apple devices."

      "text": "After using an iPhone as my daily driver for years, I decided to switch to a Samsung phone for my next upgrade. And while I\u2019ve been enjoying the experience for the most part, there are still a few bits that fall short.\n4 App Quality Is Much Better on iOS\nThe first difference I noticed after switching to a Samsung phone is that so many mainstream apps feel a little worse on Android. What surprised me most is that this even includes Google\u2019s own apps. You\u2019d think Android would be the most stable platform to use, say, YouTube, but I\u2019ve run into random bugs like picture-in-picture breaking or playback controls freezing up. These are issues I never saw on my iPhone.\nSocial media apps are an even bigger letdown. At almost every launch, Samsung makes it a point to highlight partnerships with social media companies to improve camera performance inside apps like Instagram and Snapchat. But the results are still shockingly bad. The in-app camera on Instagram still looks considerably worse than the native one, and compared to my old iPhone, it\u2019s not even close. It\u2019s still a noisy, low-quality mess, so I find myself using the stock camera app more than I should have to.\nEven when it comes to gaming, iOS holds an edge. A lot of the more demanding titles, like Genshin Impact, run at higher graphics settings and better resolution by default on iPhones. They even do so while maintaining better frame rates.\n3 iPhones Actually Get Software Updates on Time\nThis isn\u2019t something I\u2019d say about every Android brand, but Samsung is easily one of the worst when it comes to delivering timely software updates. There are several exciting features in OneUI 7 that I love, but the rollout was a mess.\nFor context, Android 15 officially launched for Google Pixel phones in October 2024. I didn\u2019t get the Android 15-based OneUI 7 update on my Galaxy S24 Ultra until June 2025. That\u2019s eight months later. By the time the update landed on my phone, Google had already started testing the Android 16 beta.\nI\u2019m not expecting Samsung to deliver instant updates to every single A-series phone or older budget devices, but this is the Galaxy S24 Ultra we\u2019re talking about: a flagship phone that's a little over a year old. Despite that, the update was still delayed by months. After all the hype about Samsung promising seven years of updates, fumbling this badly in the first cycle feels off.\nI knew exactly what I was missing out on during those months, and being left behind like that made me appreciate how straightforward the update situation was on my iPhone. When Apple pushes out a new iOS version, every supported device gets it on the same day.\n2 The Apple Ecosystem Is Better\nSamsung has done a decent job building out its ecosystem; it has its own version of AirDrop, seamless device syncing, and integration across laptops, tablets, and wearables. On paper, it checks all the boxes. But in practice, it still feels clunky and inconsistent.\nFor example, you can use Quick Share to share files wirelessly; when it works, it\u2019s faster than AirDrop in my experience. But that \u201cwhen\u201d is doing a lot of heavy lifting. More often than not, it refuses to work. I\u2019ve had so many moments where I gave up and grabbed a cable instead\u2014because somehow in 2025, that\u2019s still the fastest and most reliable way to move files.\nEven the Galaxy Buds, which should connect instantly to my phone, sometimes don\u2019t. I\u2019ve had to manually dig into the Bluetooth settings more than once just to get them paired. That's something I never had to think about with my AirPods on an iPhone.\nWhen it comes to tablets, Samsung\u2019s ecosystem hits another wall. Android tablets have definitely improved, but tablet apps are still wildly hit or miss. Some apps scale properly, while others look like stretched-out phone screens. The only area where they used to have an edge over the iPad was multitasking, but iPadOS 26 has tons of amazing features that solve this problem.\nI\u2019m not saying Samsung doesn\u2019t have an ecosystem. It's present, and on paper, it\u2019s nearly feature-for-feature with Apple. But in my experience, not a single part of it has worked flawlessly. I\u2019ve run into some issue with every component, and it makes the whole experience feel like an afterthought.\n1 iOS Simply Feels More Cohesive\nOne of the biggest aspects I\u2019ve come to appreciate after using an iPhone for so long is how everything feels like it belongs together. iOS is built as a single system with one clear design, so everything flows smoothly. On Samsung phones, it feels more like two different mixed ideas. You have Google\u2019s version of Android, then Samsung adds its own layer on top, and the result doesn\u2019t always feel cohesive.\nFor example, some apps use Samsung's Gallery app for importing photos, and others use Google Photos. There\u2019s no easy way to set a default. You end up switching between the two without knowing why, and it gets annoying after a while.\nThere\u2019s also the app store situation. You get both the Play Store and the Galaxy Store preinstalled. Most people stick with the Play Store, but Samsung keeps pushing its version with exclusive apps and updates. It feels unnecessary and adds more clutter.\nOn top of that, there are so many duplicate apps. You get Samsung Internet and Chrome, Samsung Messages and Google Messages, and then Samsung Calendar and Google Calendar. It\u2019s confusing at first, and you won\u2019t know which ones to use. On iOS, there\u2019s only one version of each app, and you never have to think about this problem.\nThis is not to say I regret switching. There are plenty of points I really like, especially the hardware, but Samsung still has some work to do on the software side. Even so, I think it's a strong option for anyone considering leaving the iPhone."

      "text": "Quick Links\nRich Communication Services (RCS) is meant to bridge the gap between traditional SMS and modern chat apps. But a few key reasons are holding me back from embracing it on my iPhone.\nIt's Redundant on iOS\nOne of RCS's selling points is that it bridges the gap between iPhone and Android users by enabling richer communication features directly in the default messaging app. Unlike iMessage, which only works between Apple devices, RCS can enhance the experience of texting Android users with perks like better media sharing, typing indicators, and read receipts\u2014all without needing a third-party app. On paper, that sounds promising.\nBut here\u2019s the reality: apps like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram already solve this problem far better than RCS does. These apps are free, widely available, and offer far more than RCS ever could. Whether it\u2019s end-to-end encryption, group video calls, or cross-platform support that doesn\u2019t depend on carrier implementation, these apps make texting and sharing media with non-iOS users seamless.\nTake WhatsApp, for instance. It\u2019s as simple as downloading the app and syncing your contacts\u2014no worrying about whether your carrier supports a specific standard or if the other person\u2019s device is RCS-compatible. When the solution already exists and works perfectly, RCS feels like it\u2019s trying to reinvent the wheel.\nIts Encryption Is Conditional\nAnother glaring shortcoming of RCS is its lack of universal end-to-end encryption. While Google has made strides to introduce encryption for RCS chats, it\u2019s not consistently available across all carriers or regions. In contrast, platforms like WhatsApp and Signal offer end-to-end encryption as a standard feature, ensuring that only you and the person you're communicating with can read the messages.\nWhen privacy is a priority, RCS falls short. Even with encryption enabled in some cases, it\u2019s dependent on both users having compatible devices, supported carriers, and updated software. If any link in that chain is missing, your conversations revert to plain SMS-level security, which is essentially no security at all.\nCompare this to Signal\u2019s uncompromising security model, where encryption is always guaranteed. Every message, call, or media file is encrypted\u2014no exceptions. Even iMessage, despite its limitations across platforms, ensures encryption within the Apple ecosystem.\nIf I\u2019m going to trust a messaging system, security needs to be non-negotiable. RCS simply doesn\u2019t deliver the same level of assurance as the alternatives already available.\nOver-Reliance on Carriers\nAnother drawback of RCS is its heavy dependence on carriers for implementation and support. Unlike instant messaging apps that operate independently of mobile networks, RCS requires carriers to adopt the protocol, configure their systems, and maintain compatibility. This reliance introduces unnecessary complexity and inconsistency.\nThe rollout of RCS has been anything but smooth. Some carriers fully support it, while others don\u2019t. Even when RCS is available, features like encryption or high-quality media sharing might vary depending on your carrier\u2019s implementation. This patchwork approach creates a fragmented experience, the exact opposite of what modern communication tools should aim for.\nIf RCS had been built with the same universal accessibility and independence as other instant messaging apps, it might have been worth using. But as it stands, its carrier reliance undermines its potential and adds another layer of inconsistency to an already fragmented system.\nIt Feels Like an Unneeded SMS Comeback\nRCS may be marketed as the next evolution of SMS, but it feels like a step backward disguised as progress. Sure, it adds modern features like high-quality image sharing and typing indicators, but these are things we\u2019ve had for years with instant messaging apps. Why try to revive SMS when it\u2019s already been overtaken by better solutions?\nSMS is an outdated technology. It served its purpose in the early days of mobile communication, but messaging has evolved far beyond plain text and basic media attachments. RCS, for all its improvements, still operates within the framework of carriers and phone numbers, which feels restrictive today.\nCompare this to apps like Telegram or Messenger, where your account isn\u2019t tied to a single device or carrier. You can seamlessly switch devices, sync your messages, and enjoy features like stickers, polls, and advanced group management. RCS can\u2019t compete with that level of flexibility. It\u2019s stuck trying to enhance a system that\u2019s already been left behind.\nInstead of breathing new life into SMS, RCS feels like an attempt to keep carrier-based messaging relevant in an era where apps have already won the battle. It\u2019s hard to get excited about \"modern SMS\" when we\u2019ve lived with far better alternatives for years.\nWhat Would Change My Mind\nRCS has potential, but it needs to overcome several shortcomings before I consider adopting it. First and foremost, security is a dealbreaker. Universal end-to-end encryption\u2014guaranteed for every message, regardless of carrier, device, or region\u2014is essential. Without it, RCS can\u2019t compete with the privacy standards set by apps like Signal or even iMessage.\nAnother major improvement would be seamless cross-platform integration. Right now, RCS feels fragmented, with its functionality varying depending on whether the recipient has RCS enabled or if their carrier supports it. For RCS to win me over, it should work effortlessly, like WhatsApp or iMessage. I shouldn\u2019t have to wonder whether my messages will go through as intended.\nRCS also needs to shed its dependence on carriers. This reliance creates unnecessary delays and inconsistencies, making the service feel outdated in a world where messaging apps operate independently of phone plans. A centralized, carrier-agnostic system would make RCS far more appealing and reliable.\nBeyond these foundational fixes, RCS needs to go beyond playing catch-up. Right now, it mimics the features of existing apps without offering anything innovative. To stand out, it must introduce capabilities that go above and beyond. If it wants to replace SMS, it should leap ahead of the competition, not merely try to match them.\nFinally, the experience on iOS would need to be seamless. If Apple were to fully embrace RCS and integrate it smoothly into the Messages app, it might be worth reconsidering. It shouldn\u2019t feel like a clunky add-on or a downgrade from iMessage. For RCS to succeed, it needs to feel as natural and user-friendly as Apple\u2019s ecosystem demands.\nUntil RCS can address these gaps, it\u2019s hard to see it as a viable alternative to the robust messaging options already available. The concept is promising, but it still has a long way to go to meet modern expectations."

      "text": "Phone Number Registration\nINFO\nPhone Number Registration may not be as reliable as Mac registration, and different carriers may not play nicely. OpenBubbles operates BEST with Mac hardware codes.\nThe following guide contains links to third-party websites that are not affiliated with OpenBubbles and their contents can change at any time. Use at your own risk.\nLearn how to get your phone number working on iMessage. The app will default to sending to whatever handle is chosen in settings or setup. You can also choose to skip logging in with Apple Account. This may lead to less issues in some cases.\nPre-Setup | Do this first\nMake sure iMessage andFacetime is disabled on your iPhone. You also need to disable Advanced Data Protection and Contact Key Verification.\nSim / eSim Swaping Methods\nSim swapping is a method which involves using an iPhone to register a number, and then using OpenBubbles normally with Mac hardware data. You can follow the same guides used for BlueBubbles. However, this method can be even more unreliable than OB. All These BlueBubbles | Sim Swapping Guide\nRelay Apps\nKeep the device on at all times and connected to Wi-Fi in order to keep your number registered. While not required, leaving the display on may improve reliability.\nMethod 1 - Validation Relay\nThere are multiple ways to install Validation Relay, dependening on iOS version and device hardware. This guide can be followed regardless of jailbreak status:\nGuide 1 - TrollStore\n- Install TrollStore on your device (iOS 14 - iOS 17.0) - TrollStore Guide\n- If you have TestFlight installed, delete it.\n- Sideload JJTech's - Validation Relay App TIPA file in TrollStore.\n- For best results, sign out of any Apple ID on the device.\n- Input the code from the relay app in OpenBubbles (if you are changing from existing hardware, go to Settings -> Change Hardware).\n- Enable Keep Awake and Dim Display\n- Optional Steps - If you are jailbroken you can install the following tweaks (may not be compatible with your iOS version):\n- AdvancedBrightnessSlider to lower the risk of screen burn in\n- ChargeLimiter to limit charge of the battery\n- Immortalizer to keep the relay app in the active while the screen is off.\nMethod 2\nIf you are on older iOS versions (10 - 14) and jailbroken follow these steps:\n- Download Copperboy100's - RelayServer. -arm is for iOS 10 - 14 (rootful), -arm64 is for iOS 15 - 16.5 (rootless)\n- Install RelayServer\n- Retrieve the relay code in /var/mobile/config.json. You can find this using an app like Filza.\n- For best results, sign out of any Apple ID on the device.\n- Input the code from the relay app in OpenBubbles (if you are changing from existing hardware, go to Settings -> Change Hardware).\nDO NOT USE\nIt is known to be extremely unreliable and usually only works once.\nCredits : pypush, jjtech, Alfie, BlueBubbles Team, danip, cjocollin and Copperboy100"
