  "content": "Andy Carroll put on a united display with his bikini-clad girlfriend Lou Teasdale as they enjoyed a romantic holiday in Ibiza, following their short-lived split.\n\nThe couple split earlier this month after a series of rows, with initial reports claiming the footballer, 36, dumped the make-up artist, 41, after growing fed up with her high maintenance behaviour.\n\nHowever, Daily Mail exclusively revealed it was in fact Lou who called off the relationship, and just four days later, Andy revealed they've decided to give their relationship another go.\n\nIn a series of snaps posted on Instagram on Wednesday, the couple looked stronger than ever as they held hands in a mirror selfie while lunching at Maison Neo.\n\nLou captioned the post: 'Love you x', which cemented their relationship status after they briefly split.\n\nAndy also posted a snap of Lou showing off her snooker skills while dressed in a stylish red bikini.\n\nThe couple revealed they jetted to Ibiza for a romantic holiday, before heading to The MAINE for a night out\n\nLast week, Andy said he's vowed to cut down on alcohol in a bid to save his relationship with Lou, as he confirmed the pair are trying 'to work through their difficulties'.\n\nHe told The Sun on Sunday: 'I love Lou and I love her family. We row like any couple.'\n\nReferring to his divorce from wife Billi Mucklow, who he shares three children with, Andy added: 'Things have been difficult for me and I'm going through a divorce.\n\n'Some of our rows have been about alcohol, as Lou has been teetotal for 14 years and I have a beer or wine at dinner and a drink after the game, but it's not a problem in my life. We're better off together and we're trying to work through our difficulties.'\n\nThe pair, who were together for just over a year, unfollowed each other on social media and Andy wiped all trace of Lou from his Instagram.\n\nThey now follow each other on Instagram and have added their loved-up snaps back to their pages.\n\nA source previously told the Daily Mail: 'It was Lou who ended her relationship with Andy, she walked away a few days ago, it was very much her choice to end their romance.\n\n'She isn't interested in pointing the finger or blaming him and hoped to deal with their split in private, before he blocked her on Instagram and deleted their photos together.\n\n'Lou is very upset by how everything has played out and the arguments between them were especially difficult for her to go through.\n\n'However, Andy wants Lou back and flew to Ibiza via private jet on Tuesday just to find her, even though he has no idea where she's staying.\n\n'He will think it's a romantic gesture but for Lou, she's unimpressed and just wants to be away with her family, she's not interested in any of his attempts at a reconciliation now.\n\n'All she has done all year is love and support Andy, her feelings haven't gone away, but Lou has to protect herself now and ending the relationship is the only way to move forward.'\n\nThe father-of-five returned to the UK with Dagenham & Redbridge last month after a two-year spell in France.\n\nThe couple's last public outing was at an Oasis gig at the end of July, where they packed on the PDA, proving they were still together.\n\nThe date night came after the ex footballer was interrogated about the arguments with his make-up artist lover in a restaurant and at their hotel on the Greek party island, The Sun on Sunday reported.\n\nSpeaking about the first incident, a worker at the Nikolus Tavern told the newspaper: 'He seemed very drunk and furious with his partner.\n\n'He was using very bad words. It was improper behaviour. The woman looked very upset.'\n\nAccording to the restaurant worker, police arrived and took the ex-Liverpool, Newcastle United and England striker aside for a chat, before he was later allowed back to girlfriend Lou.\n\n'Police spoke to him. He was allowed to return, and the couple left after paying for their meal. Andy was very calm when the police arrived \u2014 he stood up and spoke to them outside the restaurant', the restaurant worker added.\n\nJust hours later, cops were called again by hotel staff following reports of damage in their room.\n\nDaily Mail understands that the former England forward - once Britain's most expensive Premier League footballer when bought by Liverpool from Newcastle for \u00a335million - was taken to the police station for questioning, but he was not arrested and no further action was taken.\n\nThe incident was confirmed by a hotel employee, who claimed Andy broke the door. That night, Lou left the hotel and spent the night at Soho Roc House.\n\nA joint statement from the couple given to The Sun said: 'Whilst having a private dinner in a restaurant on a quiet holiday in Mykonos, we had a heated discussion of the sort that most couples have had on occasion. It quickly became apparent to the police that there was no reason for them to be there.\n\n'We went outside the restaurant with them together as they insisted they wanted to 'look after' us.\n\nAs far as we are concerned, the situation has been blown out of all proportion by an interested member of the public. No one was arrested and no one was charged with anything.\n\n'We are very happy, in love and looking forward to our future together and we are disappointed that a private disagreement has become a public matter.'\n\nThe pair began dating last year after he separated from his TOWIE star wife Billi Mucklow last September.\n\nAndy and Billi called it quits divorce after two years of turbulent marriage, the footballer confirmed last year.",
