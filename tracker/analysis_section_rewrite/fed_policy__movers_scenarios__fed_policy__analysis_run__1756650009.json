      "feedback": "The draft lacks explicit canonical‑handle mapping (e.g., dxy, ust10y, mortgage_rates) and causal links; add “dxy” and “ust10y” tags to each line and cite the source IDs that quantify the impact (e.g., XTQIQRP5K for CPI, 7XH2DKEKV for Fed minutes). Replace vague “CPI surprise” with the concrete trigger “CPI > 3.0 % on 2025‑08‑15 (XTQIQRP5K)” and quantify the expected DXY move (+30–50 bp) and mortgage‑rate compression (–10–15 bp) using the 10‑year yield and term‑premium relationship from LF0UUL917. For the “Fed cut” scenario, specify the exact policy‑rate change (–25 bp on 2025‑09‑16 (3YAQ8JUPL)), the resulting 10‑year yield drop (to 4.15–4.20 % per 97MD1FHW8), and the consequent mortgage‑rate decline (to 6.5–6.7 %). Include an invalidation clause: if CPI < 2.5 % on 2025‑08‑15, the Fed may delay the cut, keeping the term premium high and mortgage rates above 7 %. For the “Fed reversal” line, replace the generic “Fed policy reversal” with the concrete event “Fed raises policy rate by 25 bp on 2025‑09‑16 (3YAQ8JUPL)”, and quantify the 10‑year yield rise (>15 bp) and mortgage‑rate jump (+10–15 bp). Ensure each probability is grounded in the cited source (e.g., 70 % base case from XTQIQRP5K, 60 % for CPI miss from Z7O1DCHS7). Finally, remove the duplicate “2‑yr/10‑yr spread <30 bp” line; its effect is already captured in the Fed‑reversal scenario, and consolidate the two “Up” and two “Down” items into a single coherent set that covers the DXY, ust10y, and mortgage‑rate nexus over the 2025‑08‑15 to 2025‑09‑30 window.",
