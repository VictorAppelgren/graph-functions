  "content": "BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA / ACCESS Newswire / August 11, 2025 / Cablevisi\u00f3n Holding S.A., (\"Cablevision Holding\", \"CVH\" or \"the Company\")(BCBA:CVH)(OTC:CVHSY), controlling shareholder of Telecom Argentina S.A. (NYSE:TEO)(BCBA:TECO2), announced today its First Half and Second Quarter 2025 Results. Figures have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") and are stated in constant Argentine Pesos (\"Ps.\" or \"P$\") as of June 30, 2025, unless otherwise indicated. The Company's Management has applied IAS 29 (inflation adjustment) in the preparation of these financial statements, following the provisions of Resolution 777/18, issued by the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Valores (\"CNV\").\n\u2022 This quarter includes results of Telef\u00f3nica M\u00f3vil Argentina ('TMA'), which was acquired by Telecom Argentina on February 24, 2025, hence, the results for the 1H25 aren't comparable to the results of 1H24 as they include results of TMA from March 1st 2025.\n\u2022 Total Revenues reached Ps. 3,357,004 million, an increase of 44.4% in real terms as of 1H25, compared to the same period of 2024, mostly driven by the incorporation of revenue from TMA and by higher ARPUs in real terms in all of the services, in part the effect of price increases carried implemented in 2024 and the decrease in inflation rate; partially offset by a decrease in fixed telephony copper accesses.\n\u2022 Total Costs (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization) reached Ps. 2,356,557 million, an increase of 44.1% in constant currency, mainly driven by higher costs on all items, driven by the incorporation of TMA. Excluding this effect, total costs reached Ps. 1,625,722 million, a decrease of 0.6% compared to 1H24.\n\u2022 EBITDA reached Ps. 1,000,447 million as of 1H25, an increase of 45.2% in real terms compared to 1H24, mainly driven by the incorporation of TMA's EBITDA, and by higher revenues (excluding TMA), resulting in a higher EBITDA Margin of 29.8% in 1H25, compared to 29.6% in 1H24.\n\u2022 Consolidated Net Loss amounted to Ps. 80,188 million. Consolidated net loss attributable to the Controlling Company amounted to Ps. 37,380 million. (1) EBITDA is defined as Total Revenues minus operating cost and expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization). We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful measure of our performance. It is commonly used to analyze and compare media companies based on operating performance, leverage and liquidity. Nonetheless, EBITDA is not a measure of net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indication of our financial performance, an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of liquidity. Other companies may compute EBITDA in a different manner; therefore, EBITDA as reported by other companies may not be comparable to EBITDA as we report it.\n\n(2 ) EBITDA Margin is defined as EBITDA over Total Revenues.
