      "summary": "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is suing the Trump administration for an injunction to prevent her removal, arguing the action would harm Fed credibility and the U.S. economy. A temporary restraining order hearing is set for tomorrow, with the judge weighing the alleged clerical error and the need for cause. Markets remain largely unchanged, but the case could influence the upcoming Fed policy meeting on September 17 and set a precedent for executive interference with the Fed.",
