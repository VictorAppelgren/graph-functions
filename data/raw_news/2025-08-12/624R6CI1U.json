  "description": "The Seattle Mariners have extended their winning streak to eight games with a 1-0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. On Tuesday night, George Kirby led the team, allowing just three hits in seven...",
  "content": "Kirby led Seattle to its eighth straight win Tuesday night, 1-0 over the Baltimore Orioles, and about 90 minutes after he spoke in the clubhouse, the Mariners caught Houston in the AL West. The Astros lost 14-1 to Boston, dropping into a first-place tie with Seattle.\n\nSeattle is starting a road trip that also includes matchups with the Mets and Phillies. The Mariners have three more games against Houston in mid-September, and those will decide who wins the season series.\n\nKirby allowed three hits in seven innings on an 87-degree night that wasn't oppressive, but seemed to give closer Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz trouble when he began to feel lightheaded while pitching the ninth. The heat also altered Kirby's wardrobe.\n\n\u201cFirst time I haven't worn sleeves in probably two years, which was nice,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cI was just finding a way to cool down in the tunnel \u2014 some ice or whatever it is. It'll get you, so you just got to make sure you hydrate.\u201d\n\nSince allowing 11 runs in 8 2/3 innings in his first two starts of the season, Kirby has shaved his ERA all the way down to 3.71. It's the first time all year that he has finished a game with it under 4.00.\n\nIn the ninth, Mu\u00f1oz needed a lengthy break on the mound after walking Gunnar Henderson. After taking a drink out of a cup, he allowed a single to Adley Rutschman and a long foul fly to Ryan Mountcastle that was almost a home run.\n\n\u201cI thought he battled through it very well and made some good pitches there to Mountcastle, who put up a pretty good at-bat,\" manager Dan Wilson said. \"That was a big save right there in a big situation.\u201d",
