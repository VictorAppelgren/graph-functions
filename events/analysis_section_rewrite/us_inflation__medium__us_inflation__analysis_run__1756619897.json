      "feedback": "Your draft is on‑target for the DXY but needs tighter evidence and clearer causal links. Add inline citations for every substantive claim: (1) cite the article (XTQIQRP5K) for the 0.36 % DXY rise, Fed Governor Bowman’s three‑cut stance, and the tariff announcements (China truce, 100 % semiconductor tariff, 50 % Indian tariff). (2) cite the same source for the Ukrainian President’s comments that knocked EURUSD by 0.27 %. (3) cite a credible source (e.g., Fed minutes or a Fed policy brief) for the historical rule that a 25 bp cut lifts the dollar by ~0.1‑0.2 %. (4) cite a macro‑data release (e.g., the upcoming CPI calendar) for the CPI release date and expected range (2.5‑2.8 %). (5) cite a research note or market commentary that tariffs dampen U.S. growth expectations, thereby supporting the dollar. (6) cite a geopolitical risk briefing for the potential ±0.1 % swing from a war breakthrough or escalation. Once citations are inserted, tighten the causal chain: e.g., “Fed’s dovish stance → rate cut → dollar lift” and “Tariff tightening → lower growth expectations → dollar support.” Ensure each sentence ends with a citation and that no claim remains unsupported. This will satisfy the evidence‑first rule and keep the analysis concise and actionable.",
