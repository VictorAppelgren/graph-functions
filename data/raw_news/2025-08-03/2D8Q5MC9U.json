  "description": "Dark Souls 3 has been beaten in under 25 minutes.",
  "content": "There are ridiculous speedruns, and then there are runs of Dark Souls and other FromSoftware games. Famously difficult, seeing them reduced to mere minutes as an expert traverses areas and bosses you'd spend months on is almost comical, and that's exactly what you get from the new record for Dark Souls 3.\n\nClocking at an impressively nonsensical sounding 24 minutes and 57 seconds, Olzku's run is mind-boggling. The start, through Gundyr, is fairly straightforward, avoiding most enemies and then killing the boss quickly and effectively. Then it immediately becomes a circus.\n\nSoon, Olzku is tumbling through Vordt like it's nothing, ascending and descending the area with ease. The requisite ghouls laying in wait are simply too slow for them, though you can hear them wailing ominously in the background. This becomes a recurring theme, as it's a common trope among speedrunning in general because unnecessary combat is just a waste of time.\n\nAround Wolnir is when it starts going wild. Dropping a cliff in the area unlocks a skip where you can skip a significant amount of the game through clipping out of the map. These kinds of glitches are always entertaining, showing even the most foreboding and stringent piece of work can be malleable.\n\nOnce in Aldrich, Olzku's character becomes invisible except for the torch they\u2019re carrying, and they can now float in the air. Video games! This record outdoes the previous one by almost a full minute, setting the precedent for going under 25 minutes total. How much tighter can it get? Well, that's for the community to decide.\n\nI'll stop spoiling it now, because you should watch the whole thing. I promise you one thing - you won't think any of these bosses are as hard afterward.\n\nIf this has you in the mood to test your skills, check out the 10 best games like Dark Souls.",

      "text": "\"Immortal king of speedrunning\" can only say \"that's a great run, gg\" after MMO mad lad beats him in 3-year revenge match with a new world record just minutes ahead\nAin't no speedrun like an Old School RuneScape speedrun\nThere have once again been significant developments in RuneScape technology. A revenge match years in the making came to a dramatic conclusion in a new speedrun entry for Old School RuneScape (OSRS), with the creator of the whole category returning more than three years later to one-up the venerable speedrun legend who previously obliterated his first time by nearly 50%.\nWay back in December 2021, OSRS YouTuber Settled \u2013 well known around the game's community for long character playthroughs with absurd restrictions, as well as short runs with intense goals \u2013 set about \"creating a Runescape world record.\"\nThe plan was to make a new account, choose the Ultimate Ironman account type, which can't trade other players or use banks to store items, and obtain the coveted Fire Cape from a difficult PvE gauntlet called the Fight Caves. You'd have to train up your account, access the Fight Caves, and clear 63 waves of enemies \u2013 including the iconic boss TzTok-Jad \u2013 as fast as possible.\nThis \"speedrun\" took just over 34 hours to complete, which is actually pretty fast by some RuneScape standards.\nBefore Settled could even release his final run, however, another player by the name of Evonaabi shared his own Fire Cape clear using the same rules. Evonaabi, known for his enduring reign at the top of many Speedrun.com RuneScape leaderboards, managed to do it in just over 19 hours. At the time, Evonaabi reckoned the run could be cut down to 13 hours.\nIn a new video proudly taking aim at \"beating Evonaabi,\" who Settled dubs \"Runescape's immortal king of speedrunning,\" Settled revisits the challenge with several more years of experience under his belt, and with many more routes available as references.\nAnother player, Rendi, previously claimed a 12-hour win, only for Evonaabi to beat him again with 11 hours and 14 minutes. That's where the record sat for years, but with his latest entry, which outpaces Evonaabi by a solid 41 minutes, Settled hopes the category \"continues for many years to come.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n\"That's a great run, gg,\" Evonaabi said in a YouTube comment on the video. \"I wish I had the time to do speedruns again, but unfortunately it's not going to be me who lowers the time.\"\nI don't want to spoil or summarize the entire 36-minute video here, but beyond calling attention to the commendable effort and fascinating tinkering that goes into a speedrun like this, I do want to highlight a few key stressors tied to this run. It's also my duty to mention lines like \"optimal levels to drink Lizardkicker,\" because nobody else will, and that is primo, grade-A material.\nLong speedruns are always nerve-wracking because the runner has so much to lose from a mistake. Even if they're brutally precise, runs measured in minutes are at least quickly repeated. But this OSRS speedrun comes with a few unique headaches.\nWith every new record in this category, competitors forced each other to adopt new and riskier methods of beating it. There'd be no way to surpass their time otherwise. This steadily upped the ante on the Fire Cape, forcing people to play more and more aggressively.\nOSRS actions are measured on the game's side in \"tics\" of 0.6 seconds, and optimal play involves tic manipulation that requires near-perfect timing on your clicks. Tic manipulation is often used to trick the game engine during long actions or to negate negative effects that only kick in after a certain number of tics.\nIn his run, Settled used tic manipulation to speed up a training grind that previously slowed down Evonaabi. More importantly, he used it to maintain virtual invincibility during the Fight Caves by abusing RuneScape's protection prayers, which (as a general rule) grant you immunity to certain damage types in PvE. The Fight Caves are intended for more mid-level players, and even they rely on protection prayers \u2013 so as a very fresh account, Settled found that protection was even more important.\nIf you miss a tic, you risk losing one of the limited prayer points that provide this protection. Plus, the routing for this category has gotten so extreme, any way to replenish prayer points has been cut out \u2013 all but demanding tic perfection.\nOn top of that, normally harmless enemies that appear in the Fight Caves jump from \"weak little bats\" to \"run-ending threats\" due to their ability to drain prayer points on contact.\nThe preparation stage of Settled's run only took about five hours, so he ends up with \"nearly six hours of near-perfect gameplay ahead of me.\"\n\"I feel like I've started to hallucinate a little at the end,\" he says at one point. \"My forearm started to tense up so bad at the end,\" he concludes.\nThe whole video is an interesting, white-knuckled watch, so you should definitely give it a look.\n\"I also need to give a massive shoutout to Evonaabi,\" Settled adds. \"He set the standards for this run, he showed everyone what's possible, and I don't want to take credit for that. He optimized this run to a brilliant level, and I'm really glad he was the first domino to creating a history for this category.\"\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

      "text": "Frenched-out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 cast takes psychic damage watching speedrunner skip the cutscenes they worked so hard on: \"Thank you so much\"\nBen Starr had some choice words during a live Clair Obscur speedrun\nSpeedrunners work fast - it's kinda part of the territory - and despite Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 being out less than two months, the completion record is down to sub-90 minutes. That's a pretty incredible feat for a story-dense action-RPG, and Ben Starr, one of the voice actors, poked some fun at the notion of someone glossing over all the narrative elements.\nA fundamental element of any speedrun is skipping as much as humanly possible. In Clair Obscur, there's a lot of cut-scenes to bypass, vastly reducing how much of the plotting and performance work the player encounters.\nDuring an episode of Devs React to Speedrun on IGN focusing on the French game, the cast got to see speedrunner Oh Snap do his thing with Expedition 33, for which he's currently fifth in the world for completion time. In the demonstration, they chat about seeing players already carve out such impressive records, leading Starr to sprinkle in some sarcasm.\n\"Thank you so much for respecting our work, it really is amazing,\" he says, adding on a more sincere note: \"It's so cool to see the ways in which audiences have engaged with this. [Director] Guillaume [Broche] has said himself, he wants to see people do no-hit runs.\"\nStarr goes on to state there are multiple ways to enjoy something like Clair Obscur: \"This game is obviously a really beautiful narrative and an amazing, immersive world, an amazing story, but also it's a playground for fun.\"\nHe then makes another lighthearted jab as Oh Snap clips through a bush. \"It's just really cool to see people play the game the way that it was intended,\" Starr laughs.\nSpeedrunning gives a whole other perspective on most games, as people demonstrate wild ways of traversing any given release. Clair Obscur is a gorgeously presented, incredibly deep RPG, and it's positively cartoony to watch someone quite literally fall through parts of it to make progress.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAchieving these outrageous runs takes a lot of discipline and granular knowledge. If you just want to enjoy a game, playing the regular way, with all the cast doing their thing in full, is advised.\nAnthony is an Irish entertainment and games journalist, now based in Glasgow.

      "text": "Elden Ring Nightreign masters somehow beat every single boss and encounter in the entire map in one run: \"To do this, I assembled my team of nerds\"\n\"It is very, very difficult\"\nFromSoftware games attract challenge runners like bees to honey. Streamer Bushy recently assembled his \"team of nerds\" to see if they could complete an Elden Ring Nightreign map in the limited amount of time you get before the circle closes in on you, and they managed to do it.\n\"It is very, very difficult,\" Bushy begins a video explanation. \"This is not something you should do if you're just trying to have fun with the game.\" But, if you want to know how they did it, Bushy breaks it all down on YouTube.\nFirst, the team figured out what they meant by \"completing the map\"; they decided they needed to unlock every possible Site of Grace by completing each Evergaol, field boss, camp, fort, cathedral, and ruin, and the central castle spawns.\nThe best map for this plan is Mountaintop, because it has the fewest Sites of Grace and also only one boss Bushy and his friends consider an actual challenge: the big frost dragon Caligo.\nIn total, the group needed to clear 31 Sites of Grace in 29 minutes \u2013 which is a pretty tall order.\nNext up was figuring out which Nightfarers would be best, and it's a little more complex than you might expect.\nBushy says, \"We're not just looking for maximum damage output. We instead need characters that are good immediately, but they don't necessarily need to have the highest ceilings.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nSo, Duchess and Recluse aren't good because they start off too slowly, even though they get stronger later. Three Executors isn't great, either, because they don't scale well enough as Nightreign's days go on. The Raider is solid, though, as he does high damage early on and scales well.\nEventually, the group opted for two Raiders and one Iron Eye. Finally \u2013 vindication for the archer class.\nWatch the full video to see the group put their theory crafting into practice. It's quite the sight to behold.\nJust remember, Bushy says, \"This is very nerdy and I wouldn't recommend playing the game normally like this.\"\nInstead of doing this absurdly difficult challenge run, you could always check out the other best online games you can play with your friends.\nI'm Issy, a freelancer who you'll now occasionally see over here covering news on GamesRadar.

      "text": "10 games like Dark Souls that will test your survivability\nPunish yourself in these games like Dark Souls if you'd like to kick it up a notch\nThe trouble with games like Dark Souls is, it's easy to just create a list of the best FromSoftware games. This studio has spent over a decade creating some of the most challenging and creative action-RPGs, and that has spawned a mass of Soulslikes that have tried to go for the crown.\nBut that moniker's nothing to sniff at; combining original worlds, stories, and enemy design while thoughtfully reworking FromSoft's formula is the key to success for many of the best games like Dark Souls, and we've crowned our top 10 right here. Beware, though: they're every bit as tough as their inspiration, so be prepared to die a lot.\n10. Ashen\nDeveloper: A44\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch\nAnnapurna and A44's Ashen is arthouse Dark Souls, an inspired spin on the style with eclectic art direction. Its passive, Journey-esque co-op systems and evocative combat make for a delightfully difficult game that still feels like a breather from the oppression of what we know as Souls. Sure, it\u2019s a little too derivative at times, but if it was going to imitate any game closely, you can\u2019t really go wrong with Dark Souls baked-to-perfection systems. This choice is for player\u2019s who are looking for something as close to the original as possible or those who perhaps want to experience a hard-fought hero\u2019s journey over the course of around 15 to 20 hours, not 40 or 50. Enemy combat A.I is consistently clever, as are the character designs and biodiversity of the ominous open world. The expanding settlement is also a clever spin on the firelink formula that should keep you coming back for more.\n9. Nioh\nDeveloper: Team Ninja\nPlatform(s): PS5, PS4, PC\nBefore Shinobi Souls was made cool by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, we had Nioh, its punishing precursor. This is another souls-like that adapts a lot of lessons from Miyazaki\u2019s work but puts enough meaningful spin on them to keep you interested. Developed by Koei Tecmo, the game is set in the Warring States period where you play as an Irish samurai known as William who rocks up in Japan ready to take down some phantoms. The variety of authentic Japanese weapons is delightful, as well as its nods to historical events if you\u2019re Sengoku savvy. It also has a cool system with Ki Pulse where you can replenish your stamina mid-battle. It feels about as good as performing an active reload in Gears of War, which is saying something.\nRead our Nioh review\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n8. The Surge\nDeveloper: Deck13\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One\nWhat if we put Dark Souls in space? That must have been one of the roundtable questions when Deck13 was coming up with The Surge. Following on from its middling success with Lords of the Fallen, The Surge provided what was missing: an inspired setting and a suite of mechanics that fit the environment. You play as Warren, a wheelchair-bound man who takes part in a botched experiment with an exoskeleton and is let loose in a decrepit dystopian facility full of evil robots and drones. There\u2019s even a sequel on the way if you fall in love with the dazzling environment. Whilst it wasn\u2019t universally loved when it first came out and does feel a bit more clunky than the other, more tightly-controlled games in this list, there is still really nothing like it if you really want a change of scene. Its oppressive world is a great success.\n7. Elden Ring\nDeveloper: FromSoftware\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One\nElden Ring is not only one of the best games of 2022, it's one of the best action games of all-time. FromSoftware built on everything it learned with Dark Souls, stuffed all of that knowledge into an incredible open world, and then left players to fend for themselves in a hostile fantasy setting. Combat is punishing, exploration is awe-inspiring, and the experience is utterly mesmerizing from start to finish. If you're looking for a great alternative to Dark Souls, you needn't look any further than Elden Ring.\nRead our Elden Ring review\n6. Dead Cells\nDeveloper: Motion Twin\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Switch\nA surprise smash hit that dropped in late 2018, Motion Twin's Dead Cells is a mix of Roguelike and Metroidvania that opts to graft some of the Souls magic to color its world. Expect to die a whole lot in this game and be punished for it, and spend the rest of your time learning enemy move sets. If you\u2019d like to see how the combat of Souls works in a different dimension with some genius iterations, Dead Cells could be the refreshing change you need. You play as a parasite who inhabits a cadaver, exploring a labyrinth full of dangerous foes and cheeky secrets. The combat is lightning fast and brutally punishing, but gorgeous to look at with its fluid and vibrant animations. Whilst the story is a bit lackluster, it\u2019s not the main focus and the exploration does make up for it. Well worth a punt if you\u2019re burnt out on the 3D perspective of Dark Souls.\n5. Titan Souls\nDeveloper: Acid Nerve\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4\nA deeply inventive game that wears its influence on its sleeve, Titan Souls is a delightful little indie Souls-like from Manchester developers Acid Nerve. Constantly inventive, Titan Souls focuses on the beauty of souls-like boss battles - it\u2019s one epic boss rush game that keeps the adrenaline pumping with each new challenge. Its simple combat system offers up a sole arrow for use in battle, which really doubles down on the tension as you\u2019re dashing and weaving from each titan\u2019s attacks. This tricky top-down title is worth a look-in if you want your reflexes tested, but also your grey matter. Figuring out the trick behind each boss battle often relies on your brain as well as your coordination, which results in some powerful eureka moment that will fill you full of endorphins.\n4. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice\nDeveloper: FromSoftware\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4 and Xbox One\nPut down your ax and pick up a samurai sword to take on FromSoftware\u2019s latest, wildly different take on the Souls formula. Dark Souls fans can leave their muscle memory at the door as the game introduces the controversial but deeply satisfying Posture System, which threatens to turn any veteran series fan into mulch. It follows the same hard but fair rules as its predecessors, offering up some of the most rewarding gameplay in all of the Souls series, if you can hack it, that is. Despite being quite a marmite game, it\u2019s still absolutely worth pushing through the pain to experience a powerful narrative and some of the best boss fights of all time. Sekiro makes you pick on someone your own size, resulting in death-defying bouts that ensure you\u2019ll be hearing your heartbeat when you triumph or falter.\nRead our Sekiro review\n3. Salt and Sanctuary\nDeveloper: Ska Studios\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Switch\nSalt and Sanctuary was one of the first games to take on the Souls formula in a different setting and really succeed, and the game has become a cult indie hit because of it. Developed by Ska Studios, the team behind the excellent Xbox Live Arcade series The Dishwasher, the game is hand-drawn Dark Souls mixed with a good dose of Castlevania, finished off with asynchronous multiplayer features and tight combat. With wonderful cartoon art direction and a morbid, brooding world full of all kinds of evil creatures, this is an inspired homage that is brimming with passion and challenge for veterans and series newcomers alike. It\u2019s a bit too derivative in places, but like with Ashen, they couldn\u2019t have picked a better target to iterate on.\n2. Hollow Knight\nDeveloper: Team Cherry\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch\nA game that practically received a dual launch after it first dropped on PC in 2017 and then home consoles a year later, Hollow Knight was a strong contender for game of the year on both occasions, which speaks for itself. Lending from Dark Souls in its boss battles, soul reclamation, and hard but fair combat, Hollow Knight innovates everywhere else to provide a sense of discovery unmatched by its peers. Hollow Knight nails the breadcrumb storytelling that made Dark Souls such an atmospheric homerun and is set in Hallownest, a kingdom full of malicious creatures inspired by insects. It\u2019s a vast, ruthless world that is a delight to get lost in\u2026 that is until you fall prey to its rogue\u2019s gallery of inspired creepy crawlies. Come for the rewarding combat and upgrades but stay for the underdog story which has captured the imagination of fans worldwide. Beat it and you can look out for the hotly anticipated sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, which is well on the way.\n1. Bloodborne\nDeveloper: FromSoftware\nPlatform(s): PS4\nDark Souls defined the rules of an entire genre until Bloodborne came along and broke the rickety wheel. Doing away with shields and the muddy pace of some battles, From Software\u2019s Lovecraftian epic injected the secret Souls formula with pace, forcing players into high-intensity engagements amid a gothic world, Miyazaki\u2019s most grim offering yet. Despite the incredible switch in combat, perhaps Bloodborne is most recommended for Dark Souls fans due to its return to form in level design following the original game\u2019s sequels. And of course, we must mention its narrative, which offers up plenty of memorable twists and turns and unbelievable locations to explore, the likes of which you would never expect when you first set foot in Yharnam. An unforgettable adventure that should be on any Dark Souls fans bucket list, Bloodborne will frustrate and delight those who can bear its madness in equal measure.\nRead our Bloodborne review\nCheck out all the new games on the horizon for 2025 and beyond\nRachel Weber is the former US Managing Editor of GamesRadar+ and lives in Brooklyn, New York.
