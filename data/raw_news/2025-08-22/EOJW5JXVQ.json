The Dow industrials and Nasdaq Composite both slipped 0.3% for the day. Most megacap tech stocks closed another day in the red, bringing their average loss so far this week to 3.7%.\n\nWalmart felt the tariff heat. The retail giant said Thursday that its scale has allowed it to keep its tariff-related price hikes below the national average. But the shares still fell as earnings came in below Wall Street's targets. Walmart lost 4.5% during the day, making the company the biggest decliner in the Dow.\n\nHome sales surprised. Sales of existing homes rose unexpectedly in July, raising hopes that the long-stalled housing market might finally be picking back up.",
