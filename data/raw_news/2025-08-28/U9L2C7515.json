  "title": "Everton 2 Mansfield 2: Grealish\u2019s good start continues, Moyes speaks on youngsters\u2019 futures",
  "description": "Patrick Boyland breaks down the main talking points from Everton's 2-0 win over Mansfield Town in the Carabao Cup",
  "content": "Jack Grealish caught the eye again as Everton beat League One Mansfield Town to make the third round of the Carabao Cup.\n\nDavid Moyes\u2019 side face a mid-September trip to face Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux after goals from Carlos Alcaraz and Beto saw them to victory on Wednesday night.\n\nMoyes made six changes to the team that beat Brighton in the Premier League on Sunda, notably resting goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and Idrissa Gueye, but gave Grealish his second start since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City.\n\nGoalscorer Alcaraz was one of several fringe players to impress, while there was a debut for new addition Tyler Dibling, who arrived from Southampton for an initial \u00a335m earlier this week.\n\nHere, Patrick Boyland takes a look at the main talking points from the game.\n\nNew loan signing Grealish has made an instant impression on Everton supporters.\n\nFor the second home game in a row, his name received the loudest cheer before kick-off and he left the pitch on Wednesday night to a standing ovation and chants of \u201csuper Jack\u201d.\n\nOn his way out of the stadium at 11.30pm, he posed for pictures with supporters who had waited behind and signed merchandise too.\n\nEverton fans have a new hero; Grealish a fresh lease of life.\n\nSpeaking after Sunday\u2019s 2-0 Premier League win over Brighton, a game in which he assisted both goals, Grealish admitted he had had stopped \u201cenjoying football as much as he should\u201d and had moved to Everton to reignite that passion.\n\nEven at this early stage, Grealish has become a reference point for Moyes\u2019 team. The bulk of attacks have been sent down his side and he was given the freedom by his manager to drift around and create.\n\nThe England international set up team-mate Harrison Armstrong in the first half with some quick thinking from a free kick and has a knack for dragging opposition bodies towards him, opening up space for others. At times, he could also be seen gesturing to team-mates and telling them where to pass.\n\nGrealish is still rusty, hence this outing so soon after Sunday\u2019s game while other first-team regulars like Pickford and Gueye were rested completely. He blazed one golden chance over when well placed in the box before the break.\n\nBut Grealish has already shown moments of quality few others in the squad could hope to replicate and his work-rate has been impressive. No player made more ball recoveries against Brighton on Sunday, while it has also been common to see Grealish tracking back into the full-back channels to help team-mates.\n\nWhen he is fully up to speed, even better nights should follow.\n\nGoalscorer Alcaraz may no longer be a preferred pick in Moyes\u2019 team but the Argentine showed again on Wednesday that he has something to offer in a central role.\n\nAlcaraz, who joined Everton on a \u00a312.5million permanent deal from Flamengo over the summer, offered dynamism and dribbling ability during an otherwise low-key first half.\n\nHis best moment, though, was the opener; a precise, curled short high into the South Stand goal from the edge of the box. As Moyes strives for more goals from his squad, the 23-year-old will need to contribute more moments like that if he is to work his way back into Everton\u2019s strongest line-up.\n\nEighteen-year-old midfielder Armstrong, meanwhile, picked up Everton\u2019s man of the match award after bagging two assists. While he wasted an opportunity to square for Thierno Barry in the first half, his decision-making improved after the break and his blend of athleticism, competitiveness and technical ability continues to excite.\n\nAfter scoring the second, Beto notably pushed the teenager in front of the South Stand, pointing at him as though he should receive all of the adulation.\n\nMoyes praised Armstrong\u2019s performance but said the club would make a decision on his future in the coming days, with most of the Championship interested in signing him on loan.\n\nStriker Youssef Chermiti, left out of the matchday squad altogether, is also likely to head out on loan. Moyes confirmed there was a \u201cchance he leaves\u201d on loan before the close of the window, and that he did not want to risk the Portuguese striker getting a move.\n\nWinger Dwight McNeil, however, did not seize his chance to impress. For the second game on the spin, he missed a decent chance in the box after being set up by Grealish.\n\nMcNeil has his work cut out getting regular minutes after the additions of Grealish, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Tyler Dibling, and looked more at home when he moved over to the left flank midway through the second half.\n\nKick-off was delayed by 15 minutes in order, Everton said, to \u201callow fans safe access to the stadium\u201d. Large queues had formed outside the stadium shortly before the scheduled 7.45pm start, prompting the late change.\n\nThere were complaints from supporters throughout the day over the difficulties in downloading digital tickets, but Everton officials suggested technical issues were not to blame.\n\nWith so many people still entering the dockside site, the decision was taken to allow an extra 15 minutes to get all of the 48,500 crowd into the stadium.\n\nDefensive options could be needed before the deadline\n\nMoyes has twice bemoaned the lack of defensive options at his disposal in recent days. With regular pick Vitalii Mykolenko and summer signing Adam Aznou both ruled out of the first two Premier League games, the latter after pulling up in the warm-up against Brighton, utility midfielder James Garner has filled in at left-back.\n\nMykolenko was fit to face Mansfield on Wednesday night, with Garner reverting to a central-midfield role. The Ukrainian\u2019s return is a boost, adding a left-footed option in defence and more balance, while club captain Seamus Coleman also delivered a strong showing on his first full 90 minutes since August 2024.\n\nBut Aznou and right-back Nathan Patterson both remain out, as does key central defender Jarrad Branthwaite. Patterson could still join Sevilla on loan provided Everton have the requisite cover.\n\nMoyes is likely to assess defensive options before Monday\u2019s deadline. At least one new full-back, preferably someone who can add attacking thrust, would give his side much-needed cover and an extra dimension.",

      "text": "For the second time in less than two weeks, a new Everton signing stood on the Hill Dickinson Stadium touchline. Socks rolled down, in his new club colours, his name adorned the big screens and LED lights around the \u00a3800million arena\u2019s perimeter.\nThe aim has been for new signings, and those around them, to feel immediately valued and part of the family, while highlighting the grandeur of the new waterfront facility in which they will be aiming to make their mark.\nAdvertisement\nA fortnight ago, Everton welcomed Jack Grealish this way before his season-long loan move from Manchester City. On Monday, they did the same before announcing Tyler Dibling\u2019s move from Southampton.\nTyler is a Toffee! \ud83d\udd35 pic.twitter.com/YSHGLrR1po\n\u2014 Everton (@Everton) August 25, 2025\nThings had moved quickly \u2014 at a pace that had taken even some Everton officials by surprise. Dibling had only been given permission to travel to Merseyside for a medical over the weekend, which he undertook on Monday before heading to the new stadium to pose for photos with club media and complete the move. By the evening, he was officially an Everton player. Rarely are the final stages of transfer processes quite this smooth or brisk.\nThe addition of the 19-year-old, who joins for an initial \u00a335m ($47.2m) plus add-ons, brings an end to the long summer search for a new right-winger and a transfer saga that twisted and turned at regular junctures.\n\u201cThere is a price for every player,\u201d Southampton CEO Phil Parsons told a fans forum as recently as August 7, in response to a question about Dibling. \u201cWe are not a club that\u2019s going to roll over and just accept a bid because they feel like they want him on the cheap. If you want a player, bid for them and bid well.\u201d\nAt that stage, the clubs had reached an impasse in negotiations. Everton had made three bids for Dibling, their last \u00a332m plus bonuses, but Southampton were playing hardball. The Championship club\u2019s counter-offer valued the teenager comfortably in excess of \u00a350m and contained a hefty sell-on clause.\nEverton had originally envisaged paying somewhere around \u00a335m and there was enough distance between the respective valuations for them to walk away from talks and inform Southampton of their intention to pursue other targets.\nNegotiations paused for around three weeks, during which time Everton looked at alternatives. They asked Leicester City about Abdul Fatawu, but the valuation was considered prohibitive. Ipswich Town\u2019s Omari Hutchinson was also considered before he moved to Nottingham Forest.\nAdvertisement\nThat turn of events was in keeping with the club\u2019s protracted and initially problematic search for a new right-winger. Considered a priority position by manager David Moyes, Everton had missed out on top target Francisco Conceicao to Juventus. PSV\u2019s Johan Bakayoko was high on their list but opted for Germany\u2019s RB Leipzig, while Lyon\u2019s Malick Fofana informed them of his desire to join a Champions League side. He remains a Lyon player for now.\nFor those reasons and more, speculation over Dibling\u2019s future continued. As Everton continued to be heavily linked even after talks ended, the suspicion on Merseyside was that they were being used to alert the market, or that Southampton needed a sale.\nThey had several factors in their favour. The first was that Dibling had made it abundantly clear that he was open to the move, having been enticed by the prospect of a quick return to the Premier League and Everton\u2019s project. As a result, he had spent a period training away from the Southampton squad and missed their Championship opener against Wrexham.\nThe second, and equally as significant, was that he had just two years left to run on his deal. The logic followed that Southampton could not really afford to risk missing out on a big fee for a player keen to move elsewhere, especially with his contract ticking down.\nSo it proved. The decisive movement came not from Everton, but the Championship club last Friday. They indicated their willingness to negotiate a package of around \u00a340m, comprised of an initial \u00a335m fee and a further \u00a35m in bonuses, which was much closer to Everton\u2019s initial valuation. The up-front fee is higher than the Merseyside club\u2019s third offer, with the add-ons remaining the same. The sell-on amount is lower.\nThe bonuses are performance-based and relate to Dibling\u2019s success and that of the team in general. While neither party has been willing to disclose the exact nature of the sell-on clause, The Athletic has been told, by sources who wished to remain anonymous to protect relationships, that it is not as high as the 20 per cent figure reported in some quarters.\nSome of those close to talks always suspected that Southampton\u2019s desire for a hefty sell-on clause, irrespective of profit, was as problematic as their near \u00a350m valuation. Others felt the Championship club were always budgeting for a sale at around \u00a340m and that a deal remained possible. Likely, even.\nAdvertisement\nRegardless, this became a game of who blinked first. Interested parties believed at the start of the summer that Dibling was valued closer to \u00a370m.\nNegotiations between the player\u2019s camp and Everton were handled by the club\u2019s head of trading, Nick Hammond, while CEO Angus Kinnear agreed the deal with Southampton. Monday\u2019s 7.30pm announcement came slightly earlier than expected due to how quickly the deal was concluded and with Everton looking to continue the sense of momentum after Sunday\u2019s 2-0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion in their first Premier League game at Hill Dickinson Stadium.\nEverton see the teenager\u2019s immediate future on the right wing. Despite the notable additions of midfielders Grealish and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, they have lacked genuine right-sided options since the summer departures of loanees Jack Harrison and Jesper Lindstrom. Although left-footed, the hope is that Dibling can add pace, dynamism and another ball-carrying threat from that flank.\n\u201cDibling ranked in the 2024-25 Premier League top 20 players for attempted take-ons (110) and successful dribbles per 90 minutes (2.15) in his first campaign in England\u2019s top-flight,\u201d Everton noted in their press release confirming the move.\nThere is a feeling, based on their scouting intel, that he could develop into a central player, capable of operating as a No 8 or No 10, in time.\nThe move to Merseyside was seen as a logical next step for Dibling, an England Under-21 international, after his breakthrough season at Premier League level.\nWhile exciting, he remains a work in progress. Across 33 top-flight appearances in 2024-25, comprising 20 starts, he registered just two goals and zero assists. His expected goals (xG) and expected assists (xA) totals were 2.5 and 1.5 respectively, showing a slight underperformance versus those underlying metrics.\nAdvertisement\nNurturing his end product will take time and patience, with Moyes describing him as a \u201ctalented young English player with lots of potential\u201d who will be supported in his \u201cfuture development\u201d.\nOther Premier League clubs tracked Dibling\u2019s progress, but some were deterred by what they saw as a dip in performances once Russell Martin had been replaced in the Southampton dugout by Ivan Juric. The sense was that Dibling responds better to an arm-around-the-shoulder type of management and needs to be nurtured.\nBorn in the city of Exeter in England\u2019s south-west, a 2022 move from boyhood club Southampton to Chelsea did not work out. Within two months, and after just two appearances for Chelsea\u2019s under-18 side, Dibling was back at St Mary\u2019s. It remains to be seen how he deals with moving north and the weight of expectation that comes with his significant price tag.\nHarnessed correctly, though, Dibling is a precocious talent possessing pace, fearlessness and, even at 19, the raw strength to hold off seasoned professionals.\nIn an interview with The Rest is Football, former manager Martin called him the \u201cmost talented (player) I\u2019ve ever seen or worked with\u201d.\n\u201cTyler has every capability to go and play for England for a very long time because he\u2019s powerful, really quick and can shoot with both feet,\u201d Martin, now the Rangers manager, added. \u201cHe has something I\u2019ve not seen in a British player for a very long time, being able to take the ball in the middle of the park, swivel and go.\u201d\nIt may take time, but Everton have a potential gem on their hands, one who could eventually be worthy of having his name up in lights on a regular basis.\n(Top photos: Everton FC)"
