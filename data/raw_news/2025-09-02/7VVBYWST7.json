  "title": "Fans Of FC Barcelona Wouldn\u2019t Have Forgiven Fermin Chelsea Sale",
  "description": "FC Barcelona fans would have never forgiven the board for selling Fermin Lopez to Chelsea had the move come to fruition.",
  "content": "As we now know for sure given the closure of the European summer transfer window, FC Barcelona midfielder Fermin Lopez will stay put at its boyhood club after numerous reports of a potential move to Premier League giant Chelsea.\n\nHad the switch been realized, however, Culers would have never forgiven the Barca board for offloading a fan favorite.\n\nHow did Fermin become linked with an FC Barcelona exit?\n\nWith Barca still recovering from the economic crisis which thrust it to the brink of oblivion in 2020, and struggling to navigate Financial Fair Play (FFP) or register new players or contracts, offers for some players that aren\u2019t untouchables such as Lamine Yamal and Pedri will always be entertained.\n\nNever a darling in La Masia tipped for big things as the superstar of his age group, Fermin had to work hard to get to where he is today.\n\nLoaned out to fourth tier Linares in 2022, he never looked so far away from the first team and probably thought his days in Blaugrana were numbered upon return.\n\nWhen an impressive temporary spell at his only other professional club besides Barca was done, however, Fermin took advantage of international players turning up to preseason training later than the rest of the group and impressed then-head coach Xavi Hernandez enough to stay with the senior team.\n\nBreaking out impressively in 2023/2024, Fermin was also useful for Xavi\u2019s successor Hansi Flick the following term and an integral part of a treble winning outfit.\n\nBecause of his important goals, intensity and competitive spirit, however, it is unsurprising that the Premier League came calling for him.\n\nWhile Barca is not in the best of shape financially speaking, there is no way it would have accepted a $46.5 million (\u20ac40 million) offer according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\nThat comes despite Fermin\u2019s sale being interesting because his sale as an academy product would have presented pure profit.\n\nYet with Gavi out injured and Dani Olmo out of sorts, Flick perhaps didn\u2019t want to lose one of his three CAM choices for good.\n\nMARCA reported that Fermin was intent on staying in Catalonia too, meaning that the soap opera can be tied up - at least until January.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t FC Barcelona fans have forgiven the board for selling Fermin?\n\nLoved by Culers for the reasons listed above, Fermin\u2019s hypothetical exit would have angered fans in Catalonia.\n\nHad an offer been too good to refuse, and something around the $100 million mark which Fermin is worth, then perhaps some could understand.\n\nYet arming a European rival, which Barca will face in the Champions League, for a cut rate would be a show of weakness and an acceptance that the La Liga holder no longer sits at the top table of the continental game - at least from a transfer market perspective.\n\nThankfully for all concerned, except the English club in question, Fermin remains an FC Barcelona player who could occupy a starting central attacking midfield berth against Valencia after the international break.",

  "summary": "FC Barcelona midfielder Fermin Lopez, who has been linked with a potential move to Premier League giant Chelsea, will stay at the club after the European summer transfer window ended. However, fans of FC Barcelona would have never forgiven the club board for selling a fan favorite. The move to Chelsea was not widely anticipated due to Barcelona's financial difficulties and ongoing struggles with Financial Fair Play (FFP) and inability to register new players or contracts. Despite this, Fermin remains an FC Barcelona player and could potentially play a starting central attacking midfield berth against Valencia after the international break.",

      "text": "Deco se cansa del drama de Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez y el Chelsea: Lo que pide para que lo fichen\nEl Bar\u00e7a fija el precio de Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez para poder abandonar el Bar\u00e7a\n\u00daltimos suspiros en el mercado de fichajes y la incertidumbre en el Bar\u00e7a sigue creciendo en ciertos aspectos. Mientras la operaci\u00f3n salida se ha ido desencallando con la cesi\u00f3n de I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a al Elche y la rescisi\u00f3n del contrato de Oriol Romeu, se podr\u00eda tambi\u00e9n dar alguna salida dolorosa. La calidad en la medular del conjunto blaugrana es tan grande que algunos de sus integrantes despiertan mucho inter\u00e9s entre los grandes europeos.\nLa situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en Can Bar\u00e7a contin\u00faa siendo complicada y una gran venta dar\u00eda un gran bal\u00f3n de ox\u00edgeno a la entidad. Joan Laporta lo sabe y aunque la venta sea dolorosa, es casi imprescindible para la entidad para evitar problemas de tesorer\u00eda. El principal handicap de Laporta la tiene en el staff t\u00e9cnico donde Flick no es partidario que ning\u00fan peso pesado de la plantilla abandone el club.\nEl t\u00e9cnico alem\u00e1n ya fue muy reticente con la probable salida de Marc Casad\u00f3 a la Premier cuando el catal\u00e1n recibi\u00f3 ofertas. Ahora, le toca el turno al andaluz Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez que a pesar de no ser titular indiscutible, es muy valorado por Flick. El Chelsea va en serio a por el fichaje de Ferm\u00edn y el Bar\u00e7a ha fijado el precio de salida del canterano.\nEl Bar\u00e7a fija el precio de salida de Ferm\u00edn\nLa directiva del Bar\u00e7a, conscientes del gran inter\u00e9s que despierta Ferm\u00edn en las filas del Chelsea, ha aumentado su precio de salida. El conjunto ingl\u00e9s estar\u00eda valorando en hacer llegar una propuesta de fichaje que rondar\u00eda los 50 millones de Euros. El Bar\u00e7a, por su parte, ha fijado su precio de salida en 70 millones.\nAunque el mediapunta andaluz no ha contado con demasiados minutos en el inicio liguero, Hansi Flick ha afirmado que quiere a Ferm\u00edn en la plantilla. De momento, el Bar\u00e7a no se plantea desprenderse del futbolista a no ser que sea el propio Ferm\u00edn que lo solicite. El jugador tiene contrato hasta 2029 y tiene la \u00faltima palabra sobre su futuro inmediato.\nEl Chelsea quiere ficharlo\nTal como indicado, la postura del Bar\u00e7a es clara, no pretende forzar la salida del onubense pero si el futbolista quiere salir, su precio queda fijado en 70M. Una cifra millonaria que permitir\u00eda de todas, todas que el club regresara a la famosa norma del 1:1 de fair play financiero. El Chelsea ha hecho llegar una oferta al jugador para que la analice y les responda si acepta formar parte de su plantilla.\nLa incertidumbre en la respuesta de Ferm\u00edn es manifiesta, se mueve entre dos aguas, el amor al Bar\u00e7a y la posibilidad de ser protagonista en un equipo como el Chelsea. Los londinenses le ofrecen un rol protagonista y un salario, que supera con creces, al que recibe en el Bar\u00e7a. Si el jugador acaba aceptando la oferta inglesa, est\u00e1 por ver si los londinenses acaban pagando los 70M que exige el Bar\u00e7a.\nM\u00e1s noticias:"

      "text": "FC Barcelona can lose up to $273 million (\u20ac263 million) thanks to the debacle surrounding Dani Olmo's registration, or lack thereof, as explained by SPORT.\nBarca received terrible news late on New Year's Eve in Spain, with La Liga releasing a statement detailing that it would not allow the forward to be registered for the rest of the 2024/2025 season as things stand.\n\"La Liga informs that, as of today, December 31, FC Barcelona has not presented any alternative that, in compliance with La Liga's economic control regulations, would allow it to register any player from next January 2,\" the correspondence read.\nThose choosing to remain positive believe that Barca can turn things round by January 3, but pessimism is the general vibe among Culers and the \"entorno\" that engulfs the club.\nOlmo is technically a free agent as things stand. And though his agent Andy Bara said to Fabrizio Romano that the decision made by the player is to \"stay at Barcelona\" while they are \"not considering any other option\", the huge amount of money that Barca would lose if he does end up walking cannot be ignored.\nFirst there is the $50 million (\u20ac48 million) Barca is obliged to pay up for the rest of his contract until 2030 - even if the Euro 2024 winner is no longer on its books.\nAdd that to the $57 million (\u20ac55 million) it still needs to cough up to his last club RB Leipzig, and the potential, non-existent transfer fee that the Catalans would also forego.\nAccording to German transfer market expert site Transfermarkt, Olmo is currently rated at $62 million (\u20ac60 million).\nFurthermore, Barca sold its VIP boxes for the Spotify Camp Nou - still yet to be reopened while a renovation runs past schedule - for ($104 million) \u20ac100 million. Yet it is believed that this could have been done for a figure of $208 million (\u20ac200 million) instead meaning that an additional ($104 million) \u20ac100 million was missed out on.\nThrow this altogether, and we're talking about a roughly huge $273 million (\u20ac263 million) sum which a financially-challenged club like Barca really can't afford as a black hole in its accounts."

      "text": "FC Barcelona ace Lamine Yamal answered a question for critics of his partying lifestyle on the day that his contract renewal was made official and that the teenager inherited the number 10 shirt from Ansu Fati.\nThe Ballon d\u2019Or candidate has come under fire recently for his lavish 18th birthday party and other trips to Ibiza and Brazil over Barca\u2019s summer holidays.\nWith Hansi Flick\u2019s men returning to work and starting their preseason campaign on the landmark day for Lamine becoming of adult age, July 13, his contract renewal and inheritance of the number 10 from past greats such as Ronaldinho, Diego Maradona, Rivaldo and Lionel Messi was made official on Wednesday.\nLamine answered questions in Catalan from the Catalan press and others in Spanish, and towards the end of a press conference, he was asked about his activities away from the pitch.\n\u201cAt the end of the day I work for Barca, and I play for Barca. And when I\u2019m away from the Ciudad Esportiva (i.e. the Club\u2019s Joan Camper HQ) I enjoy my life and that\u2019s it,\u201d he stated in Spanish.\n\u201cThe truth is that both criticism and praise, if they are not from my family or from people very close to me, I am indifferent, because if not, one day I will be very high and another very low,\u201d Lamine also said elsewhere.\nRegarding Messi, who he is often compared to because of their similarities as left-footed La Masia geniuses, Lamine noted how the Argentine \u201cmade his way\u201d while vowing to make his own.\n\u201cThe 10 comes from Ansu now, so I will try to make all the Culers happy, those who are there (at Camp Nou) and those who are at home,\u201d he promised.\nLamine called Maradona, Ronaldinho and Messi \u201cthree legends of football, three legends of this club\u201d.\n\u201cI would keep everything from each of them. I am grateful for the trust of the club, and I will try to continue that legacy,\u201d he added.\nLamine has pressure to live up to past greats at FC Barcelona\nAs Ansu could tell Lamine, there are fewer jerseys heavier than the number 10 at FC Barcelona. Being a first team star is one thing, but doing the shirt justice and living up to the names of those that have gone before him will add extra pressure on a figure that we must remember is still a boy despite having recently become an adult."

      "text": "FC Barcelona midfielder Gavi said that \"of course\" bitter rival Real Madrid is \"worried\" about the Catalans, while speaking from a preseason tour of Asia.\nGavi was given the captain\u2019s armband during Thursday\u2019s 7-3 win over Seoul in South Korea, and even got on the scoresheet.\nFor the Andalusian, being the team\u2019s leader was a dream come true and a source of great pride.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always dreamed of being able to wear the Barcelona armband. It is a [source of] pride for me and I feel very motivated every time I wear it. It inspires me more. If at the end of this season I\u2019m not one of the captains, it\u2019s fine. Even though I\u2019ve been in the first team for many years, I\u2019m young and I still have to learn from the veterans. It will come when it is time,\u201d he explained, about being named one of permanent skippers.\nWith Barca bested by Inter Milan in the semifinals of the competition last term, Gavi agreed that winning the Champions League is one of the main goals in this upcoming season.\n\u201cIn the end, everyone remembers the Champions League. It\u2019s the most important trophy and hopefully we can be in the final. I am sure and I trust that my team will give everything possible to be there and give us that Champions League that Culers crave so much,\u201d he confidently stated.\nWhile the Champions League is the most coveted team trophy, Lamine Yamal could be awarded the highest individual honor in the sport which is the Ballon d\u2019Or.\n\u201cI hope he wins it. If he doesn\u2019t do it this year, he\u2019s 18 years old and still very young. Being there among the favorites is already something unique. I\u2019m happy for what he\u2019s doing with us,\" Gavi said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an incredible player. Every day is better. In training he is amazing. He has to continue like this, with that mentality, and I'm sure that if he doesn't win the Ballon d'Or this year, he will win many in the future.\u201d\nReal Madrid will be Barca\u2019s main rival domestically. And with Madrid spending heavily to avoid the Catalans lifting all three main trophies in Spain again, Gavi said that \u201cof course\u201d Los Blancos are worried about the Blaugrana.\n\u201cOf course they are worried. It was four out of four [Clasicos we won] and that had never happened in histor. It is logical that they are worried. In the end, we were spectacular last season and they didn\u2019t win anything. This year they have reinforced themselves with very good players to be honest, but we will see what they will do this season. They have a great team but we have to be us and that\u2019s it,\u201d Gavi concluded.\nGavi will once again have a difficult fight for minutes at FC Barcelona\nWith the likes of Dani Olmo and Fermin Lopez his competition for the CAM spot, while Pedri and Frenkie de Jong have the more retreated spots locked down, Gavi once again faces a tough battle for minutes in FC Barcelona\u2019s midfield this season."

  "argos_summary": "FC Barcelona midfielder Fermin Lopez will remain at the club after the summer transfer window closed, sparking speculation that a sale to Chelsea would have angered fans. Lopez, a product of La Masia who broke into the first team under Xavi and Hansi Flick, drew interest from the Premier League club but Barcelona set a \u20ac40\u2011million asking price and declined offers. The club\u2019s financial struggles and the desire to keep a fan favourite in a key attacking midfield role were cited as reasons for keeping him, with the board unlikely to accept a higher bid. Fans would have viewed a transfer to a European rival as a sign of weakness and a threat to Barcelona\u2019s competitive standing.",
