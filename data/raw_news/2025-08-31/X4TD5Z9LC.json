  "title": "Why The Phoenix Mercury Are Built For A Deep 2025 Playoff Run",
  "description": "The Phoenix Mercury have clinched a playoff spot for the 15th time in the last 17 years. Their model of consistency is now being carried by a team of versatile stars.",
  "content": "The only thing Nate Tibbetts needed was time.\n\nTime to get his feet wet in the WNBA landscape. Time to work alongside Phoenix Mercury GM Nick U\u2019Ren to scout and target the right players. And, most importantly, time to learn how he could take his offensive principles from a decade-plus of NBA coaching experience, tweak his system, and apply everything to a unique group.\n\nNow, almost two years since he took over the coaching reigns for a 9-31 team, Tibbetts has the Mercury in championship contention.\n\nThe Mercury are the latest WNBA team to clinch a 2025 playoff spot, securing a seat with only six games remaining in the regular season.\n\nDue to the WNBA\u2019s increased competitive nature and influx of talent, Phoenix won\u2019t know its playoff seeding or matchup until the final day of the season. Currently sitting fourth in the league with a 24-14 record, they are only one game behind second and 3.5 games ahead of sixth.\n\nThere are important tiebreakers in the mix, too. Here\u2019s a cheat sheet to simplify those:\n\u2022 If Phoenix and Atlanta (25-14) finish with the same record, Atlanta wins the tiebreaker because of head-to-head matchups.\n\u2022 If Phoenix and Las Vegas (26-14) finish with the same record, Las Vegas wins the tiebreaker because of head-to-head matchups.\n\u2022 Phoenix and New York (24-15) still have an undecided tiebreaker. If Phoenix beats New York on Saturday during their final meeting of the season, the Mercury claim it. If the Liberty win, it triggers the second tiebreaker (better winning percentage against all teams with a .500 or better record). Currently, the Liberty own that with a 13-10 record compared to Phoenix\u2019s 13-12 record.\n\nThis is the Mercury\u2019s 15th postseason appearance in the last 17 years, which makes sense for a franchise that prides itself on consistency and the ability to craft winning cultures despite roster turnover.\n\nBut for this version of the team, the first without Diana Taurasi since before the iPhone was invented, the on-court product is different than anything we\u2019ve seen.\n\nThe true beauty of this Mercury group is their fluidity. Unlike many teams around the league, including last year\u2019s iteration in Phoenix, they have plenty of avenues to victory. It has practically reached a point where no two wins look the same.\n\nCertain nights will feature Satou Sabally, the team\u2019s leading scorer, emitting flames from the perimeter. While her outside shooting is down this year compared to her final days in Dallas, her volume and comfortability launching from deep gives Phoenix a multiplier they\u2019ve never had from a player of her size.\n\nAnother ingredient of their winning habits can be Kahleah Copper, who isn\u2019t shy to remind everyone how slithery she can be driving to the basket. A heavy portion of her season might have been affected by injuries, but when she needs to give the Mercury\u2019s offense some juice, you don\u2019t have to ask twice.\n\nAfter scoring 28 points on her birthday \u2013 in efficient fashion \u2013 Copper now has three games this season surpassing 25 points on 70% true shooting. She\u2019s one of only 10 players with at least three of those performances \u2026 and she\u2019s missed 16 games.\n\nThey can also smother you defensively, creating havoc in passing lanes and crowding opposing stars who aren\u2019t aniticpating how well Phoenix helps each other and communicates. After being one of the worst teams last year in forcing turnovers (11th out of 12 teams), they have jumped to fourth in opponent turnover rate. Natasha Mack, even in a reduced role for much of the season, has become a centerpiece of that movement by evolving into one the toughest pick-and-roll defenders across the WNBA.\n\nIt falls directly in line with everything franchise owner Mat Ishbia envisioned when he promised a shift in the Suns and Mercury\u2019s identity. Four months ago when the Suns\u2019 season concluded, Ishbia discussed the value of having a gritty, resilient group that fights hard defensively for the entire game, not just in flashes.\n\nLast but not least, there isn\u2019t another playoff-caliber team benefitting this greatly from rookie contributions. All four of Monique Akoa Makani, Kathryn Westbeld, Kitija Laksa, and Lexi Held have left their fingerprints on a few wins this season.\n\nAkoa Makani proved to be a sharpshooting talent and feisty defender since day one in training camp, and she\u2019s already blossomed into a valuable starter equipped with the right skill-set for Tibbetts\u2019 preferred style.\n\nThere are nights where she tips the scale in Phoenix\u2019s favor \u2013 when Akoa Makani drills at least two 3-pointers, the Mercury are 10-2 this season.\n\nThe path to wins can look different from night to night, which keeps every player in the rotation feeling involved and knowing how vital they are. \u201cYou never know what you\u2019re going to get\u201d can apply to Mercury basketball the same way it does to a box of chocolates.\n\nWith the Mercury, roster balance was mandatory before they could reach this point. None of their success happens without U\u2019Ren building a unit that\u2019s hungry to win, focused on the right things, and leaves all egos at the door. It\u2019s precisely why he\u2019s the strongest candidate to win Executive of the Year.\n\nThe optionality they have found with shooters, athletic defenders, and high-IQ leaders is an enviable trait other WNBA teams will try to mimic.\n\nOf course, all of these winning factors are blended together by the leadership of Alyssa Thomas, who has rightly earned all of the superlatives during the best season of her career.\n\nThomas\u2019s versatile approach is what allows them to randomize their attack, spread the wealth, and become a team nobody wants to face in a playoff series.\n\nDespite all of the unpredictable components she unlocks for the Mercury, there is still one area that remains a given: Nobody will outwork them in a close game.\n\nAcross the board, Phoenix steps on the throttle when games are hanging in the balance. In \u2018clutch\u2019 moments, defined as any possession played when the margin is within five points in the last five minutes, the Mercury have the highest scoring efficiency in the league (118.1 points per 100 possessions).\n\nMost of it stems from the hallmarks of a great offense: Hunting for the most desirable shots and taking care of the ball. They own the second-lowest turnover rate in the clutch and second-highest effective field goal percentage, leaning into the \u2018paint and spray\u2019 philosophy Tibbetts has preached since arriving in the Valley. His teams will aggressively attack the paint and bend defenses until they concede open threes \u2013 which tends to happen frequently.\n\nBut, as Thomas will always note, their defensive pressure is what allows Phoenix to thrive. While her passing metrics will lead any MVP campaign her team institutes, the very next line should be how much she\u2019s helped transform the Mercury\u2019s defense in such a short period of time.\n\nThey aren\u2019t doing all of this in the halfcourt. They are closing out possessions with rebounds (first in defensive rebound rate in the clutch), and quickly pushing up the floor to wear down the opponent.\n\nMost teams slow down when the pressure heightens. It usually leads to poor shots late in the clock. But not the Mercury, who average the fastest pace in WNBA during those minutes:\n\nHow does a team achieve such dominance late in games, especially when there are multiple players who could thrive with the ball?\n\nAs Tibbetts explained before their last win against Chicago, it\u2019s a testament to how easily his players have bought in.\n\nIt\u2019s typically the first sign of a top-flight championship contender. Phoenix has exhibited that behavior since the season began.\n\n\u201cI just think when you put a new group together, everyone has to give a little bit to get what we want,\u201d Tibbetts said. \u201cSo we\u2019re all being asked to do some things differently.\u201d\n\nThe most prominent example of that is Sabally, who is playing a vastly different role than she previously did with the Wings. She now has the luxury of playing more off the catch and finishing plays, instead of trying to create them all the time.\n\n\u201cI think earlier in the year, her [on-ball] usage was as high as it\u2019s been in her career,\" he said. \u201cBut as the season has evolved, just us moving her around to different spots, posting up mismatches, and getting her into some of our motion or split-action has been really good for her.\u201d\n\nTibbetts recently praised Sabally\u2019s willingness to get off the ball when she doesn\u2019t have an advantage, pivoting to the \u2018second side\u2019 to keep the offense flowing and not letting the ball stick.\n\nDay by day, the Mercury are building tighter chemistry. The players are settling into their roles and learning how to overcome different challenges along the way, which is always a prerequisite for postseason success.\n\nWith all of the tools in place to make a run, this final stretch is about obtaining homecourt and being healthy when it matters.",

      "text": "During any random moment of a Phoenix Mercury game, chances are, you\u2019ll catch Alyssa Thomas with a smile on her face.\nThe beauty of it?\nYou won\u2019t exactly know why.\nAs a veteran superstar habitually forcing her way into MVP races, Thomas has plenty of reasons to smile. After all, watching her teammates succeed \u2013 mostly by empowering them and boosting their point totals \u2013 gives her the ultimate satisfaction.\nPerhaps it\u2019s the joy of watching her four rookies thrive in an offense centered on sharing the rock. Or, maybe they are evil smiles because she\u2019s already deciphered the opponent\u2019s gameplan and knows Phoenix is about to have an easy night.\nOnly she knows the answer. But we can try to get a small glimpse into her basketball mind.\nEven after 12 years in the league, Thomas is showing a level of improvement that nearly all 33-year-olds would struggle to achieve. This is currently the most efficient she\u2019s ever been on the floor, averaging 1.14 points per scoring attempt. And that\u2019s without earning a ton of free throws, or being a 3-point threat.\nHowever, in order to win, she knows where the bread is buttered: Her elite court vision.\nI recently sat down with Thomas, as she was generous enough to pull back the curtain on her playmaking genius. In these next six videos, Thomas walks me through how she analyzes defenses in real time, manipulates space, and transforms the game into her own playground.\nTurn up your audio as she takes you inside each possession, breaking down what she saw.\nAlyssa Thomas on leveraging the open space certain defenders give her, and why it actually plays into her strengths:\nShe doesn\u2019t always need to be the one setting the table, or facilitating from the top of the key. Among her best attributes is making high-impact decisions after screening for her guards, and rolling downhill to make the defense panic.\nAlyssa Thomas on playing in the pocket, and making decisions out of pick-and-roll action:\nOther times, like the play below, she doesn\u2019t require a ball-screen at all. Just give her the ball and watch her deliver the goods.\nAlyssa Thomas on using her patience and basketball IQ to anticipate when help defenders are coming, and how to capitalize in those moments:\nIt\u2019s because of Thomas\u2019 expert-level manipulation and the team\u2019s improved spacing under Nate Tibbetts that Phoenix has a healthier shot diet. They are creating more threes and rim opportunities than last year, sitting fourth in the league with a 65.9% combined frequency (also known as Morey Rate).\nWith her next assist on a 3-pointer, Thomas will break the WNBA record for the most in a single season. She is currently tied with Courtney Vandersloot, who helped create 121 threes during the 2023 campaign.\nVandersloot played 39 games that year while Thomas has only appeared in 26 \u2026 with 13 remaining.\nAlyssa Thomas demonstrates her unselfish, pass-first mentality on this post possession late in the shot clock:\nWithout feeling rushed, she can execute with time ticking down.\nOr, she can make defenses pay immediately after crossing halfcourt, not allowing them to correct their matchups.\nAlyssa Thomas explains how she pinpoints mismatches early in the shot clock, not letting any opponent off the hook:\nThe Mercury desperately needed an uptick in pace. With major roster turnover and four new rookies on board, it only made sense to push the tempo to simplify everyone\u2019s job.\nThomas is the engine behind that movement. She\u2019s the catalyst that ignites everyone after a turnover. Immediately after Phoenix collects a loose ball, Thomas is sprinting up the floor, directing her teammates to fill the gaps and gain every advantage.\nThis year, the Mercury have climbed to third in \u2018average seconds until a shot attempt\u2019 after finishing ninth last season with an older group.\nWhile getting younger definitely helped, this new pace has AT\u2019s fingerprints all over it.\nIf her shooters make themselves available, they will reap the benefits.\nAlyssa Thomas on Phoenix\u2019s shooters embracing her love for fastbreaks and organized chaos in transition:\n\u201cI think, just throughout my career, when I get in transition, everyone runs hard,\" she said. \"I think they see it\u2019s an opportunity. If they\u2019re open, I\u2019m going to get them a shot. Transition is the easiest way to get points.\u201d\nIf you would like to watch the full uninterrupted session, look no further:\nDiving Into The Numbers\nAs the saying goes \u2013 film never lies.\nBut, if somehow it did, the statistical achievements would certify Thomas as the most skilled (and prolific) passer in the league.\nBefore this year, only two players in WNBA history finished a season with an assist rate above 40 percent while maintaining a turnover rate under 20 percent. Those were Sue Bird in 2018 and Courtney Vandersloot in 2020. For Vandersloot, it was a shortened season due to the pandemic. Bird, of course, went on to capture her third championship with the Storm.\nThomas is searching to become the third member of this club, while also setting the WNBA record for highest assist percentage. For the first time ever, we\u2019re seeing a player facilitate over half of her teammates\u2019 field goals while on the floor:\nFun fact for the NBA junkies out there \u2013 only six players have ever been a passing force to that degree in the regular season. They are all historical point guards: Chris Paul, John Stockton, Steve Nash, James Harden, Rajon Rondo, and Russell Westbrook.\nThat\u2019s what makes Thomas different. She\u2019s a unicorn in her own right, serving as the Mercury\u2019s point-forward and disrupting conventional playing styles.\nThrough a broad lens, Thomas is producing more for her team as a playmaking hub than any player in the league. One glance at her volume in Assist Points Generated is enough to paint the picture \u2013 she\u2019s in a class of her own.\nAnnihilating the competition. Lapping the field. Insert your favorite expression that applies to legends across every sport.\nWith 589 points created by her assists in only 26 games, Thomas is averaging 35% more than second-place Courtney Williams. The gap between first and second is 119 points, and it\u2019s nearly equivalent to the margin between second and eighth:\nLooking at raw totals, her 234 assists are the second most by any WNBA player through their first 26 games of a season. It\u2019s behind only \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Vandersloot, who dished six more during the 2021 campaign:\nYou don\u2019t have to travel too far in the pantheon of Valley basketball to find Thomas\u2019 early inspiration.\nJust like her, it was the leader of a dynamic Phoenix offense that magically found a way to marry halfcourt principles with an aggressive run-and-gun style.\n\u201cI always grew up and loved watching Steve Nash,\u201d Thomas told Forbes. \u201cI was a big Nash fan, just the way he was able to get his teammates easy shots. I\u2019m also a huge fan of watching [Nikola] Jokic. The way he\u2019s able to manipulate the game and take advantage of what the game is giving him. I just enjoy watching people do that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s no surprise Thomas holds Jokic in such high regard, either. They are cut from the same cloth. Both genuinely find greater joy in their teammates having career years, or helping them carve their own path, than anything they accomplish individually.\nThomas will be the last one to ask for any credit. She will continually downplay her importance, shying away from any MVP promotion every step of the way.\nIt\u2019s that selfless demeanor that makes fans wonder \u2026 how does she do it? How does she remain so impactful?\nDeWanna Bonner knows the secret. She\u2019s witnessed it for years.\nBonner did spend over 200 games playing alongside Thomas in Connecticut, watching her operate in every scenario possible \u2013 through the regular season and intense playoff battles.\n\u201cEvery single day, whether it\u2019s practice, media or the game, she leads,\" Bonner said. \u201cShe\u2019s always the first one at the gym and always one of the last to leave. She takes care of her body and works really, really hard. So it just motivates everybody else. Like 'okay, we got to be on our s**t too, you know? She sets the standard for our team and we try to follow.\u201d\nEvery play Thomas makes on the floor is a reflection of her sharpness, but also her decade-plus of time spent memorizing coverages and player tendencies.\nHowever, if we listen to Bonner, those traits are intertwined with AT\u2019s leadership and practice habits. Those remain the foundation as she chases her first WNBA title."

      "text": "Alyssa Thomas still has work to do while polishing an MVP r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and solidifying a top seed for the Phoenix Mercury. Part of that journey, though, is consistently raising the bar and making it harder for contemporaries to match her greatness.\nThomas made history \u2013 yet again \u2013 Thursday night, becoming the only player to log a triple double in three consecutive games.\nBefore that instance, there was only one player to achieve it in two straight games: Alyssa Thomas, numerous times with the Connecticut Sun.\nShe is now making a habit out of the \u2018joining herself\u2019 stat-lines.\nThe latest performance was similar to her entire 2025 campaign: Sublime, efficient, and selfless. She finished with 18 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, while continuing to build on her career-high True Shooting mark (56.9%). She\u2019s shooting 66.9% at the rim, also the best of her 12-year career.\nAs the fourth quarter was winding down Thursday, her teammates were visibly amped to lift her into the record books. They weren\u2019t going to let her get subbed out with nine assists. Every pass she threw, whether in a halfcourt or transition setting, was met with an immediate shot attempt. Everyone knew the assignment.\nThe Mercury cruised to a 35-point blowout, the team\u2019s third-highest margin of victory in franchise history. Phoenix is currently three wins ahead of last year\u2019s pace after 30 games. With Thomas leading the way, there\u2019s more cohesion on the court, fewer defensive mistakes, more accountability, and simply better vibes.\nThis is the first year Mercury head coach Nate Tibbetts has been able to spend time with Thomas, which includes watching her lead every day.\nAfter a few months around her, the only thing that surprises Tibbetts is how underrated she remains in the grand scheme of WNBA discourse.\n\u201cAT is an unbelievable player,\u201d Tibbetts said after the win. \u201cShe would probably be the first to tell you, or wouldn\u2019t want to talk about it \u2026 but I think she\u2019s been overlooked her whole career on how great she is. Just the way that she plays is special. She competes on each and every possession defensively. She wants to see her teammates succeed with the way she passes the ball.\u201d\nThomas now has 19 triple doubles throughout her career \u2013 15 with Connecticut and four with Phoenix.\nNot only is that more than quadruple the next player on the list, Sabrina Ionescu, but it\u2019s more than players 2-8 combined.\nIn some ways, are triple doubles an arbitrary achievement? Sure.\nAfter all, sports audiences are infatuated by round numbers and triple doubles don\u2019t always correlate with impact. Like anything else, the proper context should be applied. Thomas could still be squarely in the MVP hunt if she routinely delivered 25-point performances with seven rebounds and six assists.\nBut that\u2019s not the type of player she is.\nThe phrase \u201cone of one\u201d is a descriptor of Thomas, and not only because she\u2019s accumulating unprecedented box scores. It\u2019s because of her uncanny ability to control a game without attempting more than 12 shots.\nShe doesn\u2019t try to rack up triple doubles \u2013 it\u2019s her natural cadence and personality that allows her to walk casually into each one.\nAnd if she did chase them for fun? It shouldn\u2019t matter, as long as the Mercury are fulfilling their primary goal of winning. Sitting at 19-11, only a half-game out of second place in the standings, I\u2019d say they\u2019re in solid shape on that front.\nDuring a five-month season, which can feel like a grind, you need joy and entertainment. You need measurable targets, both on the individual and team level. But most importantly, players need realistic, achievable benchmarks to celebrate with their teammates.\nWithout the triple double excitement, we probably don\u2019t hear the thunderous ovation in PHX Arena Thursday night, with MVP chants reverberating through the lower bowl. We also probably don\u2019t get Thomas\u2019 teammates losing their minds on the bench when history was made, capped by Kahleah Copper passionately shouting into the microphone who her MVP vote would be.\nBy the time she hangs up the sneakers and walks away from the sport, which won\u2019t be any time soon, Thomas will become synonymous with the triple double \u2013 the same way someone uttering the words \u201cCaitlin Clark\u201d automatically gives you a visualization of her launching 30-foot bombs.\nExcluding Thomas, we\u2019ve seen 1,130 players appear in at least one game throughout WNBA history. That\u2019s over the course of 29 seasons. In the last week alone, Thomas has registered more triple doubles than 1,127 of those players logged in their careers.\nThat\u2019s not just impressive. It\u2019s proof that she\u2019s brought a unique style to the league since being drafted in 2014, and she will be an inspiration to future stars who still want to leave a major imprint on the game without being a top-tier scorer.\nWith only 345 career games under her belt, Thomas is already eighth on the all-time leaderboard in assists (on the verge of becoming seventh), and 12th in total rebounds. She will stand out as the statistical anomaly of this era, valuing the other components of the game instead of high-volume scoring.\nStill only 33 years old, she will inevitably put herself in elite conversations if she opts to play another five to seven years.\nNicknames are often silly in sports, and not exactly reflective of the player\u2019s identity or tendencies.\nThomas doesn\u2019t fall into that category.\nBilled as \u201cThe Engine,\" it\u2019s a direct representation of what she provides for the Mercury. It\u2019s also what allows her to stand out and separate herself from the pack in a league surging in popularity.\nShe is the WNBA\u2019s version of Nikola Jokic, reading the floor and dictating the terms of every possession to generate the best possible outcome. She can also be a version of Giannis Antetokounmpo, gobbling rebounds and operating as the de facto point guard in those grab-and-go scenarios while creating easy transition points.\nBut let\u2019s be honest. Future Hall-of-Famers would rather carve their own path, in their own league.\nShe\u2019s the WNBA\u2019s Alyssa Thomas. Just like the statistical feats we witness every week \u2026 the only comparison she needs is herself."

  "argos_summary": "The Phoenix Mercury, under new coach Nate Tibbetts, have turned a 9\u201131 start into a playoff berth, finishing 24\u201114 and fourth in the WNBA. The team\u2019s success stems from a fluid offense led by Satou Sabally and Alyssa Thomas, a defensive overhaul that moved them from 11th to 4th in turnover rate, and the emergence of rookie contributors such as Monique Akoa Makani. Tibbetts\u2019 \u201cpaint\u2011and\u2011spray\u201d system and Thomas\u2019 playmaking have produced the league\u2019s highest clutch efficiency and fastest transition pace. With a tight race for playoff seeding and a strong roster mix, the Mercury are poised for a deep postseason run.",
