      "feedback": "Your draft is a useful high‑level snapshot, but it falls short of a world‑class scenario analysis for a 3–6‑month horizon. To upgrade it, (1) **separate the themes** into distinct sections (UAS, pharma dividends, Toyota SUV, and Inghams) and build a **scenario map** for each: base case, upside, downside, with clear **triggers** (e.g., Fed rate cuts, supply‑chain normalization, tariff easing for Toyota) and **invalidation** points (persistent inflation, trade tensions, patent cliffs). (2) **Quantify every claim** with source‑specific numbers and citations: e.g., UAS jobs 1,400 in 2025, average salary $105,912 (FOM34PUWA); Abbott dividend yield 1.8% and 53‑year streak (WISLWAJ15); AbbVie dividend CAGR 6.8%, FCF $18.2 B (WISLWAJ15); Pfizer yield 6.7%, forward P/E 8.3 (WISLWAJ15); Toyota RAV4 475,193 units 2024, 239,451 units 2025, hybrid‑only shift 2026 (H8880U45S). (3) **Integrate macro data** (US CPI, Fed minutes, GDP growth) and policy (tariff schedules) into the transmission logic, and show how they feed into each scenario. (4) **Add path‑dependency** for Toyota’s electrification: once the hybrid‑only lineup launches, the cost structure and supply chain lock‑in will shape margins for 2026–2027. (5) **Include a watch‑list** with specific signals (CPI releases, Fed minutes, automotive supply‑chain updates, UAS regulatory announcements) and a confidence rating (e.g., moderate). (6) **Cite every source** by ID (e.g., (FOM34PUWA), (WISLWAJ15), (H8880U45S)) and reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., UAS job growth vs. data gaps). Finally, present the analysis in a concise, structured format (bullet points or a short table) rather than a single paragraph to improve readability and coherence.",
