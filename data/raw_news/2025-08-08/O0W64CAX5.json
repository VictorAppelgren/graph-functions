      "text": "RFK Jr. is winding down mRNA vaccine development. What does that mean for vaccines in NY?\nMany New Yorkers planning to use a vaccine to protect themselves and their children from COVID-19 in 2025 now face an increasingly uncertain path to getting the shots.\nThat warning from some doctors came after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Aug. 5 revealed his agency will be cutting funding to mRNA vaccine development, calling the vaccine technology \"ineffective\" and claiming it poses more risks than benefits.\nRFK Jr.'s latest federal vaccine policy change came after his agency's prior measures left COVID-19 vaccines only recommended for those over 65 and people with existing health problems. That change could remove health insurance coverage for the vaccines, leaving many people paying up to $200 out-of-pocket for the shot.\nWhat are mRNA vaccines?\nThe mRNA vaccine discussion gripped the nation during the pandemic's darkest days in 2020 and 2021. But in reality, more than 50 years of public and private laboratory research laid the groundwork for the rapid development of these life-saving vaccines, according to the National Institutes of Health.\nMessenger RNA, or mRNA, is genetic material that tells your body how to make proteins.\nTo trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into bodies. Not mRNA vaccines. Instead, mRNA vaccines use mRNA created in a laboratory to teach cells how to make a protein \u2014or even just a piece of a protein \u2014 that triggers an immune response inside bodies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This immune response, which produces antibodies, is what helps protect you from getting sick from that germ in the future.\nCurrently, the only mRNA vaccines available in the U.S. are to protect against COVID, the Mayo Clinic said, adding ongoing research aims to provide mRNA vaccines for other infectious diseases and cancer.\nThere are currently two mRNA vaccines available for COVID-19, which are made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. The only non-mRNA vaccine available in the U.S. for COVID-19 is made by Novavax.\nWill health insurance in NY drop COVID vaccines?\nThe Infectious Diseases Society of America, a trade group representing thousands of doctors, scientists and other medical experts, urged health insurers in New York and nationally to maintain coverage for COVID-19 vaccines for all ages, despite any federal policy changes.\nIn 2024, state health officials noted, New York had more children under age 4 admitted to a hospital related to COVID than for flu \u2014 over 1,300 for COVID and 1,100 for flu.\nSome national health insurance trade groups have indicated they expect to provide coverage for COVID-19 vaccines this fall based on federal guidance, though the specifics vary based on the federal agency involved and type of plan. Put differently, health plans provided by large employers may cover the shots while those using other insurance plans may find it more difficult to get shots.\nWill New York mandate health insurers cover COVID vaccine?\nIn June, state lawmakers in New York introduced new legislation seeking to mandate health insurance coverage for the COVID-19 vaccine, citing in part Kennedy's policy changes.\n\u201cRFK Jr. said himself that no one should take his medical advice, and I agree,\u201d state Senator Andrew Gounardes, D-Brooklyn, said in a statement announcing the legislation.\n\u201cThe Trump administration may continue to spew misinformation and confusing, contradictory advice, but New York should stay laser-focused on protecting the health of our children, expectant parents and everyone else in our community,\" Gounardes said, adding the bill \"ensures everyone who wants the COVID-19 vaccine can get it.\u201d\nStill, the prospects of the legislation passing before the fall are slim. State lawmakers are on summer recess and don't reconvene session until January. At the same time, some state lawmakers have been pushing recently to hold a special session before 2026, citing in part a need to address negative impacts of federal measures related to health care funding and policy.\nIncludes reporting by Adrianna Rodriguez and Ken Alltucker of USA TODAY."

      "text": "Clinical Research & Medicines\nUnlocking the Next Generation of Cancer-Fighting Treatments\nJune 09, 2025\nRegeneron\u2019s proprietary VelociVax\u2122 platform enables development and validation of potential new mRNA-based immunotherapies.\nBy: Johanna Hansen, PhD, Senior Director of Vaccine Technology\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) is the biological blueprint that instructs cells to produce proteins\u2014the essential building blocks that power nearly every process in the body. It stands for messenger ribonucleic acid and is a molecule that carries genetic information from DNA to the part of a cell that makes proteins. This capacity to swiftly deliver precise instructions has made mRNA a groundbreaking tool in drug development, enabling rapid design and manufacturing of targeted therapies. From enhancing cancer treatments to combating infectious diseases, mRNA\u2019s adaptability is redefining what\u2019s possible in medicine. For cancer therapeutics, the aim is to design mRNA to match the genetic signature of a patient\u2019s tumor, enabling a more personalized treatment that could potentially result in a positive reaction from the body\u2019s immune system.\nBuilding on this transformative potential, we developed VelociVax\u2122\u2014a novel mRNA-backbone technology that provides a flexible foundation for designing and producing targeted proteins, and the latest technology to join our VelociSuite\u00ae technology platform. By enabling more agile combination testing and accelerating preclinical research, VelociVax sets the stage for potential breakthroughs in immune-modulating therapies.\nJohanna Hansen,\nPhD, Senior Director of Vaccine Technology\nStrengthening Our In-House mRNA Capabilities\nAt Regeneron, we have long recognized the immense potential of tapping into genetics to address human health. While external collaborations remain an important part of our research ecosystem, we also saw an opportunity to accelerate our work by building an in-house platform. By doing so, we could design, produce, and validate mRNA constructs more rapidly, enabling our teams to pivot quickly based on emerging data and tailor our efforts to a wide range of research programs. This vision ultimately led to the creation of VelociVax, an internal platform that strengthens our capabilities and positions us to explore the full promise of mRNA technology. When you hear \u201cvax,\u201d people often think of preventative vaccines, however, this platform enables us to develop potential treatments. We use the term \u201cvax\u201d or \u201cvaccine\u201d here because, like preventative vaccines, the investigational treatments produced by our platform stimulate the body\u2019s own immune system to fight cells with abnormal growth \u2013 in this case, cancer cells that are already present in the body.\nAt its core, VelociVax focuses on generating mRNA constructs that encode key antigens, cytokines, or antibody fragments to spark or strengthen an immune response. The term \u201cmRNA\u201d may be familiar because of its recent use in infectious disease vaccines, but in fact this naturally-occurring biological component has been used for decades in treatments for multiple conditions. Using our standardized mRNA backbone\u2014which serves as a foundational template our scientists can quickly customize to express proteins that stimulate a beneficial immune response\u2014we have achieved greater flexibility and efficiency.\nBut, this is not just about faster turnaround; it\u2019s about reimagining how we develop and optimize immunotherapies. Our platform empowers us to test multiple iterations in parallel, thereby identifying the most potent lead for further development.\nVelociVax also offers the flexibility to combine mRNA-based agents with other potential strategies within our oncology portfolio\u2014such as checkpoint inhibitors and bispecific antibodies\u2014enabling rapid evaluation of potential synergies. By seamlessly layering new mRNA constructs onto other immunotherapy regimens, we can more swiftly pinpoint combinations with the greatest promise.\nAdvancing Research & Preclinical Development\nVelociVax\u2019s strength lies in its end-to-end approach. From the moment a gene of interest is identified\u2014be it a tumor neoantigen uncovered by advanced sequencing techniques or an immune modulator that could enhance T cell activation\u2014the process begins with cloning this sequence into our unique mRNA backbone. The subsequent in-house in vitro transcription reaction transforms the DNA template into high-quality mRNA, which is then rigorously validated for both integrity and protein expression using cell-based assays.\nThis streamlined workflow means that what once took months can now be accomplished in weeks. This rapid cycle reduces cost and resource expenditures while creating a dynamic environment where new data can swiftly be incorporated and acted on.\nVelociVax is designed to integrate seamlessly with our broader oncology portfolio. In preclinical models, our mRNA constructs are being evaluated in combination with our bispecific antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors. The idea is simple yet powerful: by priming the immune system to target tumor-specific neoantigens and then release the brakes on immune cells with checkpoint blockade, our goal is to orchestrate a more robust antitumor response.\nLooking Ahead\nThe implications of VelociVax extend beyond its immediate applications. While our initial focus has been on oncology, VelociVax\u2019s utility is not limited to cancer alone. We can also use the technology to design mRNA vaccines with the potential to promote immune tolerance\u2014training the immune system not to attack the body\u2019s own cells\u2014in hopes of helping prevent autoimmune diseases or other immune-related conditions like chronic hepatitis. This versatility is key to our long-term vision, as it positions Regeneron to respond quickly to emerging health challenges by generating custom-tailored mRNA solutions.\nThough VelociVax is currently a research tool, its impact is already being felt across Regeneron\u2019s research and preclinical pipelines. Our goal is to continuously refine this platform, using the insights gained from each study to drive further innovation. In time, we expect VelociVax to not only support but also accelerate the translation of groundbreaking mRNA-based immunotherapies from the lab bench to the clinic.\nVelociVax represents more than just an mRNA generation tool\u2014it is a critical enabler, one that empowers our teams to innovate faster and smarter as we work to move science to medicine.\nAll therapies discussed herein are investigational and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority."
