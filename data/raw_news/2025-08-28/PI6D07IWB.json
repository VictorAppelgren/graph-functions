  "title": "Best Pixel 10 Deals: Snag Massive Discounts on Google's Newest Lineup",
  "description": "The Pixel 10 is now available for purchase, and you don't have to pay the full price for it.",
  "content": "Google revealed its latest phone lineup last week during its Made by Google event: the Pixel 10 series, and the phones are now finally available for purchase. Several models of the Pixel 9 series have earned a spot on our list of the best phones this year, so we have no doubt that the Pixel 10 will be another worthy device from Google.\n\nSeveral retailers and carriers are welcoming the new generation with some great deals, including trade-in offers, direct discounts and free gift cards that offer significant savings value. We've rounded up the best in this article.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\nHow much does the Pixel 10 series cost?\n\nPricing on the new models is similar to the Pixel 9 lineup. The base Pixel 10 costs $799, the Pixel 10 Pro costs $999 and the premium Pixel 10 Pro XL costs $1,199. There's also the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which starts at $1,799 and will be available on Oct. 9.\n\nDeals are showing up at multiple retailers and carriers, helping you save on the latest flagship devices.\n\nWhen will the Pixel 10 series be available for purchase?\n\nThe Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are available for purchase starting today. However, if you want the Pixel 10 Pro Fold or the Pixel Watch 4, you're going to have to wait a bit longer. Those will not be available online or in store until Oct. 9.",

      "text": "I spend every day trying to find deals that really save you money. And with Labor Day weekend coming up in just a few days, you'll want to know where to shop and what the best deals are. And we mean genuine savings, not fake reductions that will barely save you anything. My team and I are tracking and personally handpicking sales at top retailers, like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and more, for our CNET Deals text subscribers. We'll deliver the best sales to your phone, helping you score must-have items with minimal effort at the best price possible.\nWhy would you go through the effort of finding the best sales when we're here to do it for you? We do it really well, and for free. Signing up for the CNET Deals text group \u2014 scroll down \u2014 takes less than a minute. It's safe and trusted, and you can opt out anytime. The service is free, and the goal is to help save you money on products you'll love.\nMore about our deals text curation\nThis is the good stuff, not just \"discounts\" on prices that were artificially inflated last week. We're vetting every deal to ensure the price is what it says it is and that the product is in stock when we send the text. We send out a Deal of the Day, and during major shopping events we'll send two texts a day on standout sales. And if we find multiple deals under an ultra-low price, we'll hook you up with multiple deals in a single text.\nWith daily deals texting, my team and I apply the same care as we do across all of CNET, just in a bite-sized format. You'll receive the same level of deep research, the same confirmation that these discounts are legitimate and useful. And there's no AI here pulling the strings. We're a passionate, dedicated team of people finding actual deals. If we uncover something interesting for an affordable price \u2014 usually under $50 with a significant discount \u2014 you'll hear about it so you never miss a great deal. If we find a cool thing on sale, we share that discovery. It's truly as simple as that. I hope you join us."

      "text": "The next Made by Google event is coming on Aug. 20, where it's highly likely that the company will reveal its Pixel 10 series of phones. The announcement arrived from Google Wednesday, with a press release and invites for an event in New York.\nThe event, like previous Made By Google briefings that have taken place in the late summer or fall, is likely to focus on Google's Pixel phones, watches, earbuds and potentially more. It's uncertain what other devices Google might show off during the event, but we may see the company's Android XR Smart Glasses. Like with Google I/O earlier this year, we can expect plenty of focus on AI features that further show off the recently released Android 16.\nAt the moment, rumors suggest that the Pixel 10 series will be powered by the Google's custom Tensor G5 chip. Unlike past Tensor chips, this one wouldn't be made by Samsung fabrication and instead will be manufactured by TSMC. The move to TSMC means Google can use the fabricator's 3nm process, meaning more transistors can be packed on a single chip for greater power and efficiency.\nOn the camera side, rumors suggest the base Pixel 10 might get a telephoto senor and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold may have a 50-megapixel Samsung GN8 main camera. At least, in a period of inflationary pressure and tariff fears, insiders have suggested that pricing for Google's Pixel devices will remain the same as last year.\nThe Made by Google event announcement comes a week after Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 in New York. Samsung typically unveils its folding phones separately from the Galaxy S line, but Google is expected to unveil the Pixel 10 Pro Fold alongside a standard Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL.\nWhile Google is primarily known as an online search and software company, it's been making hardware for over a decade. In the past, Google would partner with other phone manufacturers, such as HTC and LG, to release its Nexus phones running cleaner versions of its Android operating system. With the launch of the Pixel series of devices starting in 2016, Google brought production in-house, giving the company greater control. It allowed Google to create its vision of a mobile phone and signal which features its hardware partners should focus on.\nThe Pixel line hasn't been known for having the highest-end specs, but made up for it with industry-leading cameras and photo processing. While Samsung and Apple control much of the global smartphone market, Pixel has been gaining larger chunks of market share, especially in the North American market."

      "text": "The best phones in 2025 have a battery life that lasts a day or more, cameras that take stunning photos and vibrant displays, perfect for TikTok or watching The Gilded Age. 2025 has been an incredible year for smartphones. We test dozens of phones each year, but only consider a few to be truly great. From Google's Pixel 9 series and Apple's iPhone 16 family to Samsung's Galaxy S25 series and foldable phones including the Motorola Razr Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 7, these are the best phones you can buy. If you're looking for a new Pixel phone or iPhone, we recommend waiting a few weeks as both Google and Apple will likely be unveiling their newest phones soon.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat is the best phone for most people?\nThe best phone for most people is the $799 iPhone 16. It comes in two sizes: a 6.1-inch regular iPhone 16 model or a larger 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus model that starts at $899. The phones have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that performs better in low light and can now take macro photos, meaning you'll be able to focus close to take amazing food snaps. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a handful of Apple Intelligence tools for writing, removing distractions from photos and doing summaries of messages and webpages. There's also adds a ChatGPT integration to Siri.\nThe phones also have an Action button that can be programed for different functions like turning on the flashlight, recording a voice memo, changing the focus mode and more. There's also a new Camera Control button that not only lets you take photos and quickly change things like zoom, Portrait mode aperture and Photographic Styles, but can also trigger a new feature called Visual Intelligence, which will add context to whatever the camera is pointed at, a bit like Google Lens. We think the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are ideal for most people looking for a great phone that will last for years.\nBest phones of 2025\nPros\n- Camera Control is useful for switching camera settings\n- Photographic Styles makes photos pop\n- Ultrawide camera is better in low light\nCons\n- Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t out yet\n- No always on display\n- No changes to wired charging speeds\n- No upgrades to the Action button\nWhen I tested the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus I was definitely impressed by the new photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. I consider these phones to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16\u2019s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they\u2019ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t perfect -- it\u2019s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it\u2019s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because the phones appeal to both novice users and power players a like. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of the box, Apple has a long track record of updating its software and security patches for years.\nWho it's best for\nWhen you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, the iPhone 16 is a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older iPhone, especially if that person is on an iPhone 13 or older. For those who don\u2019t need the Pro\u2019s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won\u2019t disappoint.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera.\nPros\n- Camera consistently delivers good images\n- Impressive battery life\n- More AI features feel practical\nCons\n- Several gimmicky AI features\n- Not many changes over the S24\nThe Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra \u2013 but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM \u2013 making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty.\nAnd while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.\nWhy we like it\nHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24.\nPros\n- Robust design\n- Bright high resolution inner screen\n- Battery life should last you a day or more\n- It's so damn fun to use\nCons\n- Cameras take decent photos but suffer from motion blur\n- Only three years of major OS updates\n- Gets warm playing games and using the camera frequently\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra is a beefed-up version of last year's Razr Plus, which won a CNET Editor's Choice Award. It's as if the Razr Plus hired a trainer and nutritionist and then got absolutely ripped -- warranting its name: Ultra. After testing, I've come to adore the Razr Ultra. It does all the \"normal\" non-folding phone things I want, and offers me a truly unique experience thanks to its cover screen. I feel like the coolest kid in the coffee shop when Google Pay-ing for my cortado with my Razr Ultra closed.\nBut in taking nearly every aspect of the phone to the extreme, Motorola lost one of the most important parts of recent Razrs: the amazing value. The catch for all this ultra-ness: the Motorola Razr Ultra costs $1,300.\nWhy we like it\nThis is the best built foldable flip phone I've ever used. Motorola took the best parts of the Razr Plus and improved nearly everything else. The battery life is outstanding and easily lasts a day on a single charge and can get you mostly through a second day even. The displays are brighter. The main 7-inch foldable display is larger and has more resolution than the Razr Plus and the cameras are improved. The fabric backing is delightful.\nWho's it best for\nSomeone who wants a fun, unique an robust foldable phone. You're willing to pay top-dollar to get the best processor, battery, design and cameras Motorola has ever made.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you're unsure of foldables, this might not be the best fit. If you find yourself in places with sand, dirt and other fine particles, the Razr Ultra (like all foldable phones) isn't worth the risk. The Razr Ultra has the same class-leading IP-rating for dust and water resistance, but the dust resistance is only for particles 1-mm or larger.\nPros\n- Larger screens/thinner bezels\n- 4K slo-mo OMG\n- Audio Mix is brilliant\n- iOS 18\nCons\n- No Apple Intelligence out of the box\n- Camera Control placement not optimal for one-handed shooting\n- Elegant finishes aren't very colorful\n- Only 128GB of storage for $1,000\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything I've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including one of the best batteries on any phone I've tested as well as. In our testing it will easily last a day on a single charge.\nThe phones also have larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button, iOS 18 goodies and a handful of Apple Intelligence tools. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for $1,000; there are only drab color options, and a the new camera button is easy to tap accidentally. Read our full iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max review.\nWhy we like it\nThis year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket (and mine) if you can afford them.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. Also, I should note that the entry-level $999 iPhone 16 Pro only has 128GB of storage.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you are looking for a budget phone or don't need a phone with the latest features or tech.\nPros\n- Thin 4.2mm design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- Durable build\nCons\n- Steep $2,000 price tag\n- Same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's Fold\n- 25-watt wired charging\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has finally addressed some of the key issues with its previous book-style foldables. The impressively thin build and wider, 6.5-inch cover screen makes this feel like a standard phone when closed, and that wider 8-inch inside display is great for multitasking, with the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously. Perhaps most notably, the camera gets a major upgrade with the addition of a 200-megapixel main camera, which takes shots on par with the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.\nAltogether, it\u2019s a great choice if you want a bigger, tablet-like display without the bulk or a compromise on camera quality.\nWhy we like it\nThe Z Fold 7 does a solid job combining what's great about standard slate phones and what's great about foldables. It feels wonderfully normal to hold when closed, thanks to its sleek design and lightweight build. It also packs great cameras and has an expansive main display that's 11 percent bigger than last year's Z Fold 6.\nThankfully, a slimmer build doesn't force the battery to take a hit; the Z Fold 7 maintains that same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's foldable. That pales in comparison to batteries from Chinese competitors, but at least it's not a downgrade. The Z Fold 7 also packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor to power the many AI features you'll get onboard, from Galaxy AI photo and audio editing tools to Google's Gemini Live and Circle to Search. The phone also supports seven years of software and security updates.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're bored of standard slate phones and want something that feels a little more exciting, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a great choice. The slim design and wider cover screen helps it to feel as normal as possible when closed, with the added perk of an expansive main display that's great for multitasking and watching videos. The cameras are also impressive for a foldable that's so thin.\nWho shouldn't get it\nThe Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag is perhaps its biggest caveat. Also, if you don't need a bigger display, it may not be worth the splurge. Ironically, the cover screen is so practical that you\u2019ll rarely need to open the phone -- unless you\u2019re watching movies or multitasking, in which case a phone like the Galaxy S25 Ultra might be a better fit.\nPros\n- Best screen on any phone\n- Versatile cameras\n- Most powerful phone I've tested\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- $1,300 price\n- Design is almost too minimal\n- AI features are hit-or-miss\n- S25/S25 Plus have similar features and cost less\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.\nIf you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nWhy we like it\nThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.\nWho's it best for\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit.\nPros\n- The screen is delightfully bright\n- Cameras are good for $499\n- Gemini Live Video AI has potential to be useful\n- Solid build\n- The under-$500 price\nCons\n- Battery life is just OK, will get through a day\n- Processor is serviceable (curious about longevity)\n- Lacks emergency SOS satellite texting\nFor $499, Google's Pixel 9A truly feels like you're getting more bang for your buck. It comes with several significant upgrades from last year's Pixel 8A: a fresh design, new display, larger battery, slightly more powerful chip, increased durability and upgraded software features.\nBut don't get me wrong -- it's not a perfect phone. There are places where Google had to compromise to keep the price under $500, like the lack of satellite connectivity for emergencies available on the $799 Pixel 9. Overall, though, I think the compromises Google made were smart and that the Pixel 9A is worth every penny. Read our Google Pixel 9A review.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9A is proof that you don't need to spend more than $500 to get a great phone. It can handle all you daily tasks from scrolling social media and news feeds and swiping through TikTok videos to taking a beautiful photo and lasting a day on a single charge.\nWho's it best for?\nIn theory: anybody. The Pixel 9A is for anyone who wants 95% of what a $1,000 phone can do at half the price.\nWho shouldn't get it\nAnyone who wants the absolute fastest processor or the most cutting edge cameras.\nPros\n- USB-C port is more convenient charging\n- Colorful matte design\n- Improved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits\n- Dynamic Island brings better multitasking\nCons\n- No always-on display\n- Find My Friends feature only works with other iPhone 15 phones\n- Discounted iPhone 14 Pro may be a better value\n- Galaxy S24 offers a longer optical zoom\nWith the launch of the iPhone 16, the regular iPhone 15 is being sold at a discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more convenient charging and a high resolution camera and a sharper digital zoom, I found the iPhone 15 to be a significant upgrade for those with older iPhones.\nThe iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro, the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd which I found handy. Read our full iPhone 15 review.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are heavily influenced by the iPhone 14 Pro. That includes the Dynamic Island, a dedicated area near the top of the screen for viewing time-sensitive data like your Uber's ETA, and the A16 Bionic processor. Overall, these changes come together to make the iPhone 15 feel like a big step forward for those upgrading from an aging iPhone.\nWho it's best for\nThe iPhone 15 is for someone coming from an iPhone 12 or older. In 2025, Apple sells it for $699. But I recommend looking for one that's discounted. If you're contemplating the iPhone 16E but really want an ultrawide camera (remember the 16E only has a single rear camera) and MagSafe charging, then grab an iPhone 15.\nWho shouldn't get it\nApple sells the $599 iPhone 16E which makes the iPhone 15 a curious value. If you can score a discounted iPhone 15 I'd go that way. But otherwise, the iPhone 16E might be a better buy.\nPros\n- Genuinely fun new AI skills\n- Sleek new design\n- Seven years of software updates\n- Cameras can take great daytime shots\nCons\n- Camera hardware hasn't improved much over Pixel 8 Pro\n- Gemini AI will eventually require a paid subscription\nThe Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have a lot going for them, from their shiny new designs and long software support period. But it's the AI skills that really stand out, from the deep integration of the conversational Gemini Live, to the new Pixel Studio that creates weird and wonderful images from your text prompts.\nThe phones aren't perfect. While the cameras are good and can take excellent photos in bright light, they're just okay in low-light and in night mode. The best AI features will require a monthly subscription (though you get the first year for free) But if you're keen to experiment with AI on your phone then the new Pixel 9 Pro range is a superb way to experience it. Read our Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL review.\nWhy we like it\nGoogle's Pixel line of phones has gone from strength to strength and its latest model is unquestionably the best phone the company has ever made. It's not just the slick-looking design; the Pixel 9 Pro offers a superb camera system, a generous support period and a host of new AI skills making it one of the most accomplished Android phones around. The 9 Pro XL takes that further by accommodating a bright and vibrant 6.8-inch display.\nWho it's best for\nIt's a great phone for those of you looking for an elegant everyday Android phone. The interface is easy to navigate and the camera takes great photos with almost no effort on your part. If you feel overwhelmed by the plethora of settings and menus on other Android flagships, Google's Pixel 9 Pro is the way to go. If playing mobile games or watching videos on the go is a priority, opt for the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you don't need the best cameras Google makes, consider the regular Pixel 9. I do like the fit and finish better on the 9 Pro, but it starts at $999.\nPros\n- The 6.9-inch screen is immersive, with lovely colors and contrast\n- The 4.1-inch screen looks incredible\n- It's durable and survived a drop onto concrete\n- One UI 8 (Android 16) runs wonderfully\n- $1,100 is still a lot, but Samsung gives the phone more value than the Flip 6\nCons\n- Gets warm when recording videos and playing games\n- Battery life is the same as the Flip 6 despite a bigger battery\n- Cover screen software has room to grow\nWhen I first got my hands on Samsung's new Galaxy Z Flip 7, I was delighted to discover that it has a smaller crease, larger cover screen, thinner design and bigger battery compared to last year's Galaxy Z Flip 6. But as I tested the new clamshell phone, I became enthralled by its inner screen. At 6.9 inches, this is the biggest screen on any Samsung phone aside from the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has an 8-inch foldable display.\nThe Z Flip 7's large screen size makes content feel more immersive and colors look lovely and vivid. This led to epic TikTok and Instagram sessions, watching widescreen films such as A Working Man and Back to the Future, as well as jumping back and forth between two apps stacked vertically on the screen thanks to One UI 8's 90:10 split tool.\nEvery time I open the Flip 7, I'm consistently dumbfounded by how such a large display can unfurl from something about the size of a makeup compact. And when it's closed, there's a 4.1-inch cover screen that's fantastic in its own ways, with new clever animations for when you're recording a video, charging the phone or taking a selfie, all efficiently using the extra display real estate. In terms of functionality, though, the cover screen's software is about the same as the 3.4-inch one on the Flip 6.\nThe Flip 7 impressed me in nearly every way but one: its battery life. It has a larger battery than the Flip 6, but it doesn't last any longer in daily use. It did consistently get me through a day on a single charge, often having 15 to 20% left, but there were also a few days where it needed an early evening top-off.\nWhy we like it\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the most fully realized version of Samsung's ideal of a flip phone since the launch of the original Galaxy Z Flip in 2020. The Flip 7's appeal is simple: It's a thin phone with a big, bold screen that folds in half into a coaster-sized square. The larger cover screen and inner screen make content more immersive. It's design is thin (for a clamshell foldable) and comfortable to hold. Plus you get twice the storage this year compared to last.\nWho is it best for\nIf you've been tempted by a clamshell-style foldable, you should definitely consider the Flip 7. If you have a Galaxy Z Flip 4 or older, the Flip 7 will be an upgrade in every way. It's harder to make that same recommendation for Flip 5 owners unless your phone is showing its age. And if you have a Galaxy Z Flip 6, you can sit this one out unless you really want those larger screens.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you spend a ton of time around dirt or sand, this phone isn't for you.\nPros\n- Lightning fast charging\n- Nice big screen\n- 7 years of OS and security upgrades\n- Great performance with games, movies and animations\nCons\n- Battery life is a day, similar to baseline S25\n- Similar specs as the S25 at a higher price\n- Rival phones at the same price have better cameras\nIf the baseline Galaxy S25 appeals to you but you'd rather have a bigger screen and higher battery capacity \u2013 without upgrading all the way to the Ultra \u2013 the S25 Plus may be the phone for you. The entire S25 lineup shares many features, from AI capabilities to processing power to memory, so the Plus may be a viable choice if you're looking for something right in the middle.\nThat said, the Plus' minimal upgrades over the baseline S25 may not justify the $200 price difference. But if a bigger phone just feels better to hold and you'd rather have a 4,900 mAh battery (over the S25's 4,000mAh one), then that $1,000 starting price might ultimately be worth every penny. Read CNET's full Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus review.\nWhy we like it\nWhile the baseline S25 checks all the key boxes, the S25 Plus can simply feel like a more comfortable device to use, especially if you're a fellow member of the bigger hands club. In addition to sharing many of the same features as the pricier S25 Ultra, the S25 Plus has a higher battery capacity than the baseline model -- though in CNET's tests, there weren't any major discrepancies in how the two batteries actually performed. Still, sometimes you just want to live a little larger, and this phone can be the perfect fit.\nWho it's best for\nIf you like having a larger screen to watch movies or play games on, the S25 Plus can be a great choice. While the S25 Ultra might be a top pick for someone who wants both a bigger phone and the most premium features, the S25 Plus can be that goldilocks device that meets you right in the middle -- without you having to spend $1,300 on the Ultra.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you want the absolute best in terms of cameras, don't get the S25 Plus. For $1,000 phones like the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro have better cameras. Or if you can afford to buy a $1,300 phone, check out the Galaxy S25 Ultra which has an amazing set of lenses\nPros\n- Beautiful design that feels durable\n- Fun and somewhat useful AI features\n- New ultrawide camera takes good photos\n- 7 years of software updates for longevity\nCons\n- More expensive that previous Pixels and competitors\n- Doesn't feel that different from Pixel 8\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the Pixel 9, from its respectable camera to its classy new design and lengthy 7-year timeline for software updates. But Google\u2019s phones have always shined for their clean, slick software, and that once again applies to the Pixel 9 series. Pixels are also among the first to get new software updates, making them an ideal choice for those who want to get their hands on the latest version of Android first. Aside from Android updates, Google also brings new features to Pixel phones throughout the year through updates it calls Feature Drops.\nThe Pixel 9 comes with a few new AI tricks that you may find useful, like the ability to search for content in screenshots, generate images from scratch in the Pixel Studio app and add new objects in photos. These features aren\u2019t must-haves, and they\u2019re not without flaws. Plus, at a starting price of $799, the Pixel 9 has a higher bar to live up to. But the Pixel 9 feels like it belongs in that class of device. Read our full review for the Google Pixel 9.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9 and Google's Gemini assistant still feel like a first step toward what the company is hoping to achieve: Making phone software more intelligent so that we can spend less time swiping, tapping, scrolling and digging. In the meantime, the Pixel 9 shines for its great camera, elegant design and clean software, just like the less AI-centric Pixels of years past.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're a Pixel fan upgrading from an older phone, like the Pixel 6 or earlier, you'll find a lot to love about the Pixel 9. But keep in mind that for the same price, Samsung's Galaxy S25 has a brighter screen and a dedicated telephoto lens for taking zoomed photos.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you want the absolute best cameras that Google makes, including having a dedicated telephoto lens, I'd recommend the Pixel 9 Pro.\nBest phones compared\n| Product | Apple iPhone 16 | Apple iPhone 16 Pro | Apple iPhone 15 | Google Pixel 9 | Google Pixel 9 Pro | Google Pixel 9 Pro XL | Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | Moto G Power 5G (2024) | Motorola Razr Plus (2024) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556 x 1,179 pixel resolution; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,622 x 1,206 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz adapative refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556x1,179 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate | 6.3-inch LTPO OLED; 2,856x1,280 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.8-inch LTPO OLED; 2,992x1,344 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.8-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch LCD; 2,400 x 1,080 pixels, 60-120Hz refresh rate | 4-inch pOLED; 1,272 x 1,080 pixels; 1-165Hz variable refresh rate; 6.9-inch pOLED; 2,640 x 1,080 pixels, 1-165Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 422 ppi | 495 ppi | 486 ppi | 416 ppi | 509 ppi | 501 ppi | 391 ppi | Cover: 417 ppi; Internal: 413 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches | 5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches | 2.82x5.81x0.31 inches | 6x2.8x0.3 inches | 6x2.8x0.3 inches | 6.4x3x0.3 inches | 5.78 x 2.78 x 0.28 in. | 6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in. | 6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 in. | 6.6 x 3 x 0.3 in. | Open: 6.75 x 2.91 x 0.28 in Closed: 3.47 x 2.91 x 0.6 in |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm | 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm | 71.6x147.6x7.8 mm | 152.8x72x8.5 mm | 152.8x72x8.5 mm | 162.8x76.6x8.5 mm | 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm | 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm | 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm | 167.2 x 76.4 x 8.5mm | Open: 171.42 x 74 x 7.09mm Closed: 88.09 x 74 x 15.32mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 170 g (6 oz.) | 199 g (7.03 oz.) | 171g (6.02 oz.) | 198g (7 oz.) | 199g (7 oz.) | 221g (7.8 oz) | 162g (5.71 oz.) | 190g (6.70 oz.) | 218g (7.69 oz.) | 201g (7.09 oz.) | 189g (6.67 oz) |\n| Mobile software | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 17 | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 14 | Android 14 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) 5x telephoto | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 200-megapixel (wide), 50-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto), 50-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 8-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide) 50-megapixel (2x telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 10.5-megapixel | 42-megapixel | 42-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 16-megapixel | 32-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 8K | 8K | 8K | 1,080p | 4K |\n| Processor | Apple A18 | Apple A18 Pro | Apple A16 Bionic | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G4 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Mediatek Dimensity 7020 | Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 |\n| RAM + storage | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 8GB RAM + 128GB | 12GB + 256GB |\n| Expandable storage | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None | None | None | None | None | None | Up to 1TB | None |\n| Battery | Up to 22 hours video playback; up to 18 hours video playback (streamed). 20W wired charging.

The Fold 7 replaces last year's Fold 6 and comes with a completely new design that makes it thinner, lighter and feel more like a \"regular phone.\" The Flip 7 is the best-built foldable flip phone we tested from Samsung. The thinner design and bigger displays are the headline features.\nFactors to consider when buying a new phone\nPick the most important feature: Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? This will help narrow down your choices. Phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max or Galaxy S25 Ultra cost well over $1,000, for example, but pack large batteries that will last most people a day and a half to two days on a single charge.\nDon't dismiss $500 to $800 phones: You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a more expensive flagship model can do for a fraction of the price. Google's Pixel 9 (which starts at $799) packs a great camera, a bright screen and unique AI features, but the $499 Pixel 8A has most of the same key specs and comes at a lower price.\nShop Cyber Monday: Look for sales and deals close to holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday.\nConsider last year's models: When a new phone gets launched, stores and carriers discount their older phones to sell off existing stock.\nSee the phone in person: It's worth going to a store and trying out a potential phone. You may love or hate the way it looks and feels.\nDecide on Android or iPhone: Do you have a lot of iPhone apps and Apple subscriptions? Stick with an iPhone. If you've invested in loads of Android apps, you may want to stay on that side of the fence. Otherwise, it's simple enough to switch platforms.\nBudget for a case and screen protector: Phones sold today are more durable than phones from even a few years ago, but it still might be a good idea to protect your phone with a case to keep it in tip-top shape.\nHow we test phones\nWe test every phone in real-world scenarios, focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates, or to compare it against new phones from competitors such as Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as 4K slow motion video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, or the new Magic Editor photo tools that launched with the Google Pixel 9 series.\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, as a simple, replicable measure of pure battery life, which isn't always included in the initial review but sometimes added later in an update.\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure each phone's performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Most noteworthy is how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations, and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models.\nPerformance measuring\nRead more: How We Test Phones\nOther phones we tested\nWhile Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro, you can still find it at carriers and third-party retailers. The 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch adaptive-refresh rate screen that adjusts between 1-120Hz depending on what's on the screen. It has excellent cameras, a fast processor, an always-on display, supports iOS 18 and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Driving all these upgrades is Apple's A17 Pro chip which in use feels peppy. The iPhone 15 Pro is still an excellent phone in 2025. Check out our iPhone 15 Pro review.\nPhone FAQs\nWhat is the best time to buy a phone?\nHow long should a phone battery last?\nHow much storage should I get on a phone?\nWhat are the best phone brands currently?\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nGoogle is expected to launch the Pixel 10 series in August. There's also buzz for the next iPhone, likely called the iPhone 17 -- from a slimmer version of the upcoming device to a new screen with a higher refresh rate on baseline models. We've rounded up rumors, leaks and analysis on the iPhone 17 Air (one of several nicknames for Apple's next iPhone). Read CNET's iPhone 17 rumor roundup for more info."
