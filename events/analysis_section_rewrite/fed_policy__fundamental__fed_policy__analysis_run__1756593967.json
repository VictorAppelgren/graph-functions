      "feedback": "The draft is conceptually sound but fails the acceptance gate because it never links the mortgage‑rate narrative to a canonical handle and it does not specify a concrete catalyst window. 1) **Add a handle mapping** – re‑frame the opening sentence to state that the 30‑year fixed‑rate mortgage is “tied to the UST 10 y yield (ust10y)”, citing the article’s data (ID LF0UUL917). 2) **Insert a catalyst window** – after the discussion of Fed policy, add a sentence such as “The next key catalyst is the Fed’s policy meeting on 2025‑10‑15 and the CPI release on 2025‑09‑01; a rate hike or a CPI rise above 3.5 % would lift the term‑premium and push mortgage rates up by 10–20 bp.” 3) **Trim extraneous detail** – remove the long paragraph on “real‑rate differentials, term‑premium expectations, and liquidity constraints” that is not directly tied to the handle; keep only the concise causal chain. 4) **Ensure every claim has a citation** – add inline citations (ID LF0UUL917) to the Fed policy, CPI, and Treasury issuance statements. 5) **Maintain focus** – eliminate any mention of “inflation expectations add a term‑premium” that is not directly linked to ust10y. After these edits, the piece will satisfy the mapping and catalyst requirements and remain concise and actionable.",
