  "description": "VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESS Newswire / September 4, 2025 / Core Silver Corp. (\"Core Silver\" or the \"Company\") (CSE:CC)(FSE:8ZR)(OTC.QB:CCOOF) is pleased to present 2025 diamond drilling plans and the first round of surface rock sample assay results from ...",
  "content": "Core Silver's President & CEO, Nick Rodway commented \"2025 marks another exciting year for Core Silver as we continue drilling at the Laverdiere Copper Project. With high-grade copper and silver mineralization confirmed for over 4 kilometers, and multiple new targets now ready to be tested, we see significant potential for both scale and grade. Our goal this season is to demonstrate that the Blue Property hosts multiple district-scale and robust polymetallic systems capable of delivering long-term value for shareholders.\"\n\nDiamond drilling is also planned for the Jackie Target at the Silver Lime Polymetallic Project. A new 3-D geological model has been developed, and numerous high-grade silver targets are being considered for the 2025 program. These targets will be presented in the coming weeks.\n\nPreliminary assay results from rock samples collected from outcropping porphyry veins exposed along the lower section of Copper Creek in 2025 have returned 0.63% Cu with 17g/t Ag, and 355ppm Mo (F421677; Figures 1-2). This vein system has since been mapped and sampled for just over 200m of exposed strike length.\n\nThe Laverdiere Copper Project is a low-elevation, drill-permitted, early-stage high-grade Cu-Mo-Ag-Au porphyry-skarn Target. The Project has been sporadically explored since the early 1900s, without ever having received a significant exploration program. Adits driven into the Laverdiere area in the early 1900s reportedly returned up to 27m grading 1.20% Cu. The Llewellyn Fault Zone, a regional and strongly metal-endowed fault, cuts through the Laverdiere Copper Project for 14 km of strike length and marks the contact between the Yukon-Tanana and Stikine Terranes in the Project area. Currently only 1km of the total strike length of this economically important fault zone has been explored. Diamond drilling completed 125m north of the French Adit in 1974 reportedly returned 175m of 0.27% Cu, including 6m of 1.60% Cu and 7.8m of 1.60% Cu. Core Silver's inaugural diamond drilling campaign at the Laverdiere Copper Project in 2022 returned up to 48.5m of 1.02% CuEq (0.90% Cu, 6g/t Ag, and 0.11g/t Au) from 31.46m depth in drill hole LAV22-001 (French Adit), 223m of 0.20% CuEq (0.11% Cu, 2g/t Ag, and 0.006% Mo) from 15m depth in LAV22-002 (French Adit), and 107.38m of 0.31% CuEq (0.11% Cu, 0.023% Mo, 0.9g/t Au, and 0.02g/t Au) from 144.62m depth in hole LAV22-006 (North Adit). The entirety of the 2022 Laverdiere Program results are summarized in the news release dated March 29th, 2023.\n\nDrilled and mapped high-grade copper-bearing skarn mineralization at Laverdiere is coincident with embayments in the contact zones of the expansive Cretaceous intrusions on the west side of Hoboe Creek. A large unexplored embayment in the intrusion is mapped 8km to the south of the to-date explored zone at Laverdiere and is in contact with Boundary Range metamorphic rocks at this location. Apophyses of the larger granodiorite intrusion are also mapped in contact with limestone and marbles amenable to massive sulphide skarn mineralization approximately 7km to the southwest of the known zones of high-grade porphyry-skarn mineralization.\n\nAt Laverdiere, an extensive Cretaceous granodiorite intrusion hosts widespread Cu-Mo-Ag\u00b1Au porphyry mineralization. The intrusion is associated with a very high-grade Fe-Cu-Au-Ag massive sulphide skarn occurrence (the \"Main Zone\") that is exposed at surface along the western flank of the prolific Llewellyn Fault Zone (LFZ) at the porphyry-marble contact. The Main Zone was drill-tested in 2022 and returned significant copper grades over extensive widths including: 267.05m of 0.21% CuEq (0.17% Cu, 1g/t Ag, 0.04g/t Au) from surface including 48.54m of 1.02% CuEq (0.90% Cu, 6g/t Ag, 0.11g/t Au) from 31.46m depth.\n\nIn 2024, high-grade porphyry Cu-Mo-Ag\u00b1Au mineralization at the newly defined Valley Zone, located 2.2km southwest of the Main Zone, was structurally mapped and sampled. At the Valley Zone, a series of sheeted mineralized porphyry veins and fractures hosted in altered granodiorite have been mapped and sampled over a 1-kilometer east-west trend following the Valley Fault that historically returned up to 3.24% Cu (with 82g/t Ag, 0.56g/t Au and 0.053% Mo) and 0.32% Mo (with 1.03% Cu, 4g/t Ag) in 2022. In 2024, a 20cm thick east-west striking quartz vein grading 0.83% Cu, 47g/t Ag, 0.44g/t Au and 0.007% Mo was discovered on the opposite side of the Valley Fault.\n\nReferences\n\n1White, W.H.

BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, Assessment Report 4996\n\nAll 2025 rock and drill core samples are transported by helicopter at the end of each field day to the core logging facility in Atlin, BC for processing. Field samples were chosen to capture homogenous lithology, alteration, mineralization, and veining. All rock and drill core samples are submitted to Bureau Veritas (BV) Labs in Whitehorse, YT. Each sample is crushed to 70% passing 2mm, then pulverized to 85% passing 200-micron mesh. All samples then undergo a 4-Acid digestion with an ICP-MS finish for a 59-element ultra trace package (Method Code MA-250), as well as fire assay by Pb collection with ICP-ES finish for Au, Pt, and Pd (Method code FA-330). Samples that hit upper detection limits for elements of interest on the primary multi-element method are further analyzed via a secondary 4-Acid digest with an ICP-OES finish (Method Code MA-370). Extremely high-grade Pb samples were analyzed via a tertiary overlimit method, GC-817.\n\nNicholas Rodway, P.Geo, (Licence# 46541) (Permit to Practice# 100359) is President, CEO and Director of the Company, and qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101- Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Mr. Rodway has reviewed and approved the technical content in this release.\n\nCore Silver Corp. is a Canadian mineral exploration company focused on the acquisition and development of mineral projects in British Columbia, Canada. The Company currently holds 100% ownership in the Blue Property Mineral Tenure, which covers a land area of114,074 hectares (~1,140 km\u00b2). The project lies within the Atlin Mining District, a well-known gold mining camp located in the unceded territory of the Taku River Tlingit First Nation and the Carcross/Tagish First Nation. The Blue Property hosts a major structural feature known as The Llewellyn Fault Zone (\"LFZ\"). This structure is approximately 140km in length and runs from the Tally-Ho Shear Zone in the Yukon, south through the Blue Property to the Alaskan Panhandle Juneau Ice Sheet in the United States. Core Silver believes that the south Atlin Lake area and the LFZ has been neglected since the last major exploration campaigns in the 1980's. The LFZ plays an important role in mineralization of near surface metal occurrences across the Blue Property Mineral Tenure. The past 50 years have seen substantial advancements in the understanding of porphyry, skarn, and carbonate replacement type deposits both globally and in British Columbia's Golden Triangle. The Company has leveraged this information at the Blue Property Mineral Tenure to tailor an already proven exploration model and believes this could facilitate a major discovery. Core Silver is excited to become one of Atlin Mining District's premier explorers where its team believes there are substantial opportunities for new discoveries and development in the area.\n\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors\n\n\n\nCORE SILVER CORP.\n\n\n\n\"Nicholas Rodway\"\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nTel: 604.681.1568\n\nNeither the Canadian Securities Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the CSE) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n\nStatements in this document which are not purely historical are forward-looking statements, including any statements regarding beliefs, plans, expectations, or intentions regarding the future.

Interval widths represent drilled HQ core lengths and true width is unknown currently. * indicates partial drill hole assay results were previously released. Silver equivalent (AgEq) and Copper equivalent (CuEq) grades are calculated using metal prices of silver US$21.25/oz., gold US$1,850/oz, copper US$4.00/lb, lead US$1.00/lb, molybdenum at US$30.00/lb, and zinc US$1.40/lb. Silver equivalent grade is calculated as AgEq (g/t) = Ag (g/t) + (Cu (%) * 129.08) + (Pb (%) * 32.27) + (Zn (%) * 45.18) + (Au (g/t) * 87.06). Copper equivalent grade is calculated as CuEq (%) = Cu (%) + Ag*0.0077) + (Pb (%) * 0.25) + (Zn (%) * 0.35) + (Au (g/t) * 0.674 + (Mo (%) * 7.5).\n| Table 3: 2022 Diamond Drilling Data \u2013 Sulphide City and Grizzly Targets | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| DDH | Target | Easting (m) | Northing (m) | Elevation (m) | Azimuth | Dip | DDH Depth |\n| SLM22-005 | Sulphide City Target | 536735 | 6558664 | 1645 | 0 | -45 | 137 |\n| SLM22-006 | Sulphide City Target | 536735 | 6558658 | 1645 | 0 | -90 | 470 |\n| SLM22-007 | Sulphide City Target | 536735 | 6558661 | 1645 | 0 | -60 | 416 |\n| SLM22-008 | Sulphide City Target | 536738 | 6558659 | 1645 | 60 | -45 | 461 |\n| SLM22-009 | Grizzly Target | 537176 | 6558673 | 1846 | 178 | -50 | 387 |\n| SLM22-010 | Grizzly Target | 537175 | 6558674 | 1846 | 240 | -65 | 422 |\n| SLM22-011 | Grizzly Target | 537175 | 6558674 | 1846 | 260 | -65 | 338 |\n| SLM22-012 | Grizzly Target | 537175 | 6558674 | 1846 | 300 | -55 | 350 |\n| SLM22-013 | Sulphide City Target | 536732 | 6558656 | 1645 | 225 | -45 | 400 |\n| SLM22-014 | Sulphide City Target | 536737 | 6558656 | 1645 | 150 | -50 | 414 |\n| SLM22-015 | Sulphide City Target | 536735 | 6558656 | 1645 | 185 | -50 | 471 |\nA total of 1,806 metres of diamond drilling were completed at the Laverdiere Skarn-Porphyry Project in 2022.

Map elements plotted on TauSf resistivity map (Resistive = cold colours, Conductive = hot colours). The blue-green resistive zone correlates with the mapped location of the Laverdiere Mo-Cu\u00b1Au Porphyry.\nSampling Protocol, Quality Assurance & Quality Control\nAll recovered drill core was transported by helicopter to the core logging facility in Atlin, British Columbia for processing. Down hole surveys were conducted on all drill holes upon termination, using a Reflex Gyro Sprint downhole survey tool equipped with an azimuth positioning capability. Drill core was typically sampled over two-meter intervals and occasionally reduced in areas of higher visual sulphide mineralization. Core samples were cut in half with an electric core saw, bagged, labelled, sealed, and submitted to ALS Minerals preparation facility in Whitehorse, YT with the remaining core stored in Atlin, BC. Half core samples were finely crushed and sieved to <75 microns. Samples were then shipped to ALS Geochemistry in North Vancouver, British Columbia where they were analysed for gold by fire assay with an AA finish, over limits for Ag, Pb Cu and Zn and additional elements were analysed using four acid digestion with an ICP-AES or ICP-MS finish.\nBlank rock (siliceous river rock), duplicate, and certified reference materials were inserted into the sample stream for at least every 20 samples. Certified reference materials were acquired from OREAS North America Inc. of Sudbury, Ontario and CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Langley, British Columbia for the 2022 diamond drill campaign.\nAbout the Silver Lime Porphyry-CRD Project\n5,565 metres of exploratory HQ-sized diamond drilling has been completed at the Silver Lime Porphyry-Skarn Project. 2022 drilling successfully confirmed the presence of high-grade carbonate replacement mineralization at depth, as well as widespread porphyry Mo mineralization and associated mineralized skarn. All surficial mineralized structures targeted during the 2022 drilling campaign are confirmed at depth.\nThe Silver Lime Project is predominantly hosted in carbonate rocks of the Florence Range Metamorphic Suite (ca. 1150Ma). Target limestone and marble host rocks are intercalated with upper amphibolite grade metapeltic rocks, quartzite, and amphibole-bearing gneiss. The protoliths to the metasedimentary units include continentally derived clastic strata and platform carbonate, whereas the amphibole-bearing gneiss is interpreted as probable basaltic flows, sills, dykes, and tuffaceous units related to early rifting of the ancestral North America continental margin (i.e., Mihalynuk, 1999). Younger felsic to intermediate intrusive rocks are also widespread within the project area and range from Triassic to Eocene in age. Widespread Eocene magmatic activity was associated with Cordillera-wide, brittle strike-slip faulting. Eocene volcano-plutonic centres in the western Cordillera are known to host porphyry, skarn, and epithermal-type mineralization extending from the Golden Triangle in NW British Columbia to the Tally-Ho Shear Zone in the Yukon (>100 kilometers).\nThree well-defined target areas exist at the Silver Lime Project and include the Jackie, Sulphide City, and Grizzly targets. The Jackie Target represents a dyke proximal expression of Ag-Pb-Zn-Cu CRM that consists of numerous massive-to-semi massive sulphide occurrences measuring up to 30 metres long and 6 metres wide and comprise an approximate area of 400 metres by 380 metres. Many sulphide occurrences at Jackie are clustered and hosted within NE-SW trending faults and fault splays, proximal to undeformed felsic dykes oriented sub-parallel to faulting. These fault-hosted sulphide bodies are interpreted as \u201cspokes\u201d that typically broaden at depth and express continuity back towards a causative intrusion. The Sulphide City Porphyry-Skarn Target is characterized by multiple semi-massive to massive sulphide occurrences measuring up to 40 metres along strike and 8 metres wide. In 2022, detailed geological mapping and diamond drilling discovered a Mo-Cu-bearing and causative porphyry intrusion. The Sulphide City Target boasts an average surficial grade of 13.3g/t Ag, 0.34% Cu, and 3.9% Zn (83 rock samples) that remains open. The Grizzly Ag-Zn-Pb-Cu-Au CRD Target represents the largest, untested surficial exposure of CRM globally. Carbonate replacement manto, chimney, and dyke-contact skarn mineralization at Grizzly are observable at surface across open strike lengths of up to 1 kilometer, and at widths of over 5 meters. Average surficial grade at the Upper Grizzly CRD Target yields values of 164.7g/t Ag, 0.42% Cu, 3.8% Pb, and 7.1% Zn over 450m strike length, whereas the Lower Grizzly Manto has an average surficial grade of 70 g/t Ag, 0.36% Cu, 0.2% Pb, and 7.1% Zn over an inferred strike length of 1km.\nAbout the Laverdiere Skarn-Porphyry Project\n1,806 metres of exploratory HQ-sized diamond drilling has been completed at the Laverdiere Project in June. 2022 drilling successfully confirmed and extended high-grade Fe-Cu-Au skarn, Cu-Mo endoskarn, and associated Cu-Mo porphyry style mineralization for 850 metres along the western flank of Hoboe Creek, between the historic North and South Adits, and remains open at depth.\nThe Laverdiere Project is located proximal to the Llewellyn Fault Zone, coincident with Hoboe Creek in the eastern Blue Property. Laverdiere is characterized as a fine-to-coarse grained and locally massive Fe-Cu-Au rich skarn (magnetite and/or magnetite-chalcopyrite-dominant\u00b1bornite-tetrahedrite-molybdenite-pyrite-pyrrhotite) hosted in dolomitic limestone and marble of the Devonian Boundary Ranges Metamorphic Suite. Along the western side of Hoboe Creek, dolomitic limestone is overlain by thin-bedded calcareous siltstone, quartzite, and schist \u2013 all of which are locally folded, dip moderately to the west, and are intruded by an Early Cretaceous post-accretionary granodiorite intrusion of batholith size (Coast Plutonic Complex). The granodiorite is locally foliated, Cu-Mo-bearing, and exhibits potassic alteration in the form of secondary K-feldspar and shreddy biotite after hornblende along the Fe-Cu-Au skarn contact.\nThe highest-grade skarn occurrences observed at Laverdiere are hosted in dolomitic limestone, near the siltstone contact and along the margins of the granodiorite intrusion. Disseminated and quartz-vein/fracture-hosted chalcopyrite, molybdenite, magnetite, and malachite have been observed in granodiorite outcropping along the Lewellyn Fault Zone (LFZ/Hoboe Creek) for up to 3.9km south from the main skarn body.\nNational Instrument 43-101 Disclosure\nNicholas Rodway, P.Geo, (Licence# 46541) (Permit to Practice# 100359) is President, CEO and Director of the Company, and qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101- Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Mr. Rodway has reviewed and approved the technical content in this release.\nAbout Core Assets Corp.\nCore Assets Corp. is a Canadian mineral exploration company focused on the acquisition and development of mineral projects in British Columbia, Canada. The Company currently holds 100% ownership in the Blue Property, which covers a land area of 114,074 hectares (~1,140 km\u00b2). The project lies within the Atlin Mining District, a well-known gold mining camp located in the unceded territory of the Taku River Tlingit First Nation and the Carcross/Tagish First Nation. The Blue Property hosts a major structural feature known as The Llewellyn Fault Zone (\u201cLFZ\u201d). This structure is approximately 140 km in length and runs from the Tally-Ho Shear Zone in the Yukon, south through the Blue Property to the Alaskan Panhandle Juneau Ice Sheet in the United States. Core Assets believes that the south Atlin Lake area and the LFZ has been neglected since the last major exploration campaigns in the 1980\u2019s. The LFZ plays an important role in mineralization of near surface metal occurrences across the Blue Property. The past 50 years have seen substantial advancements in the understanding of porphyry, skarn, and carbonate replacement type deposits both globally and in British Columbia\u2019s Golden Triangle. The Company has leveraged this information at the Blue Property to tailor an already proven exploration model and believes this could facilitate a major discovery. Core Assets is excited to become one of Atlin Mining District\u2019s premier explorers where its team believes there are substantial opportunities for new discoveries and development in the area.\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors\nCORE ASSETS CORP.\n\u201cNicholas Rodway\u201d\nPresident & CEO\nTel: 604.681.1568\nNeither the Canadian Securities Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the CSE) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements in this document which are not purely historical are forward-looking statements, including any statements regarding beliefs, plans, expectations, or intentions regarding the future.
