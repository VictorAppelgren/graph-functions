      "text": "Tropical Storm Erin set to become first hurricane of the season as US Virgin Islands prepare for the worst\nPreparations for potential impacts from Tropical Storm Erin are underway in the U.S. Virgin Islands as the system continues to become better organized and remains on track to become the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season.\nOfficials in the U.S. Virgin Islands said territory-wide sandbag distribution for hurricane season was set to begin in a matter of days, but with Tropical Storm Erin spinning across the Atlantic Ocean, those plans were accelerated.\n\u201cDue to the projected impact of Tropical Storm Erin on the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency (VITEMA), in partnership with the Virgin Islands Fire and Emergency Services, the Department of Public Works, the Office of ADA Coordinator, and the Department of Human Services, has accelerated the territory-wide sandbag distribution program,\u201d officials said in a Facebook post.\n\u201cWhile the exact impact of Tropical Storm Erin remains uncertain at this time, VITEMA is taking proactive measures to ensure all residents have access to critical hurricane preparedness resources before the storm\u2019s arrival.\u201d\nOfficials said this accelerated distribution represents the only sandbag distribution for the 2025 hurricane season.\n\u201cWe strongly encourage all residents to take advantage of this opportunity to protect their homes and property,\u201d officials said.\nHurricane Hunters are set to fly into Tropical Storm Erin on Thursday to try and get a better understanding of the organizing storm, which forecasters say could become a major hurricane (Category 3 or greater) over the weekend.\nThis comes after the storm, which was first dubbed Invest 97L, caused several deaths in the Cabo Verde Islands off the coast of Africa.\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Tropical Storm Erin had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, and strengthening was set to begin later on Wednesday afternoon or on Wednesday night.\nIt\u2019s expected to become a hurricane by Friday.\nTropical Storm Erin is located more than 1,300 miles to the east of the northern Leeward Islands and is moving off to the west at 17 mph.\nThe NHC said that general motion was expected to continue into Thursday, with a west-northwestward motion starting on Thursday night and continuing into the weekend.\nOn that track, the NHC said the center of Tropical Storm Erin is likely to move near or just north of the northern Leeward Islands over the weekend.\n\u201cInterests in the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of Erin,\u201d the NHC said.\nSwells generated by Tropical Storm Erin are expected to begin impacting portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this weekend.\nThose swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions at local beaches.\nAt least 7 dead in Cabo Verde islands\nBefore becoming Tropical Storm Erin, the system brought torrential rain and thunderstorms to the Cabo Verde, or Cape Verde, islands when it was Invest 97L.\nLocal officials said at least seven people, including children, were killed.\n\u201cThe Ministry of Education expresses its deepest sorrow for the tragic loss of seven lives, including four children, on the island of S\u00e3o Vincent,\u201d the Ministry of Education said in a translated Facebook post. The Ministry went on to say \u201cin this time of mourning and dismay, the pain of the bereaved families is the pain of the entire nation.\u201d\nGovernment officials said they declared two days of national mourning due to the loss of human lives and significant material damage caused by the passage of the system.\nNational Hurricane Center monitoring two other areas across the basin\nForecasters at the NHC have also highlighted a disturbance in the northern Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea for development, but chances for further organization remain low.\nThe disturbance in the North Atlantic is heading away from the U.S. while the disturbance in parts of the Caribbean and the Gulf will see a significant amount of land interaction, limiting its organization.\nOver the weekend, a few scattered showers may make it into the Brownsville, Texas region, but accumulations are expected to remain below one inch."

Greg Abbott ordered state authorities Monday to arrest dozens of House Democrats who fled to Illinois and New York rather than stay for a vote on redrawing the state\u2019s congressional map.\n\u201cTexas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cBy fleeing the state, Texas House Democrats are holding hostage critical legislation to aid flood victims and advance property tax relief. There are consequences for dereliction of duty.\u201d\nMoments before Abbott\u2019s announcement, the Texas House of Representatives voted 85-6 to approve a motion to call for the Democrats to come back.\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows subsequently directed the chamber\u2019s sergeant at arms \u201cto send for all absentees \u2026 under warrant of arrest, if necessary.\u201d\n\u201cTo ensure compliance, I ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to locate, arrest, and return to the House chamber any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans,\u201d Abbott proclaimed. \u201cThis order will remain in effect until all missing Democrat House members are accounted for and brought to the Texas Capitol.\u201d\nThe bulk of the 57 absent Texas Democrats fled to Illinois, where dozens joined Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker Sunday night at DuPage County Democratic Party headquarters.\n\u201cThey are attempting to cheat,\u201d Pritzker said of the Republican-led efforts to redraw Texas\u2019 House map.\nAbout half a dozen more joined New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in Albany on Monday.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what\u2019s called for, that\u2019s what\u2019s called for,\u201d Hochul said of the Texas Democrats abandoning Austin before calling Abbott \u201cun-American\u201d and accusing him of \u201crigging\u201d the next congressional election for the GOP.\n\u201cTo subvert the will of the people, they\u2019re hellbent on rigging the system. Rigging the system is un-American. Congressional districts are never drawn mid-decade,\u201d she argued.\nThe redrawn maps in Texas could net Republicans as many as five additional seats in the US House of Representatives \u2013 potentially allowing the GOP to expand its narrow majority in the 2026 midterms."

      "text": "What is corn sweat?\nA phenomenon known as \"corn sweat\" can combine with summertime heat in the Midwest to make for some unbelievably humid conditions.\nThe summer months can be downright brutal as temperatures soar and humidity rises, but it can be even worse in the Midwest thanks to an unusual phenomenon known simply as \"corn sweat.\"\nThat\u2019s not the technical term, but it\u2019s a lot easier to just say corn sweat.\nSo, what is corn sweat and what does it do exactly?\n\"The technical term is in fact evapotranspiration,\" FOX Weather Meteorologist Marissa Torres said. \"It occurs when you get large amounts of corn. I\u2019m talking fields of corn that release a lot of moisture, which then increases the humidity levels.\"\nIf you grew up or are living in the Midwest, you\u2019ve likely experienced it.\n\"Corn is a huge crop for the country, and the majority of that corn is grown where? In the Corn Belt, which includes Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, all the way east into even Ohio and as far north as Minnesota,\" FOX Weather Meteorologist Stephen Morgan said.\nDOWNLOAD THE FREE FOX WEATHER APP\nCorn (or any plant) pulls moisture out of the soil, and some of that moisture escapes through the corn's leaves and enters the surrounding air. This is called transpiration.\nJust as humans sweat, or perspire, to cool down, plants are no different. The higher the air temperature, the more the plant will sweat, or transpire.\nWHAT IS THE HEAT INDEX AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOUR HEALTH?\nThe transpired moisture will then evaporate off the plant's leaves to cool it down, just like how sweat evaporates off human skin. Evaporation is a cooling process.\nAdditional moisture also enters the air from lakes and other water sources in the area through evaporation. Combine all of this evaporation and transpiration, and you get evapotranspiration.\nDEW POINT VS. HUMIDITY: WHICH ONE IS A BETTER MEASURE OF HOW MUGGY THE AIR FEELS?\n\"So that crop, as it's really beginning to grow, those leaves and the plant itself is breathing,\" Morgan continued. \"In fact, when it releases this water into the atmosphere, a single acre of the corn crop can release 3,000 to 4,000 gallons of water every day.\"\n\"Corn sweat\" is simply a more colloquial way of referring to evapotranspiration in the vicinity of cornfields.\nThis process of evapotranspiration leads to increased moisture in the air near cornfields as the corn \"sweats\" to keep itself cool, ultimately leading to higher dew points in many areas surrounding the cornfields.\nCorn sweat to make expanding heat dome much, much worse\nA massive heat dome is settling across the central and eastern U.S. this week, sending temperatures soaring into dangerous territory before the heat expands to the Northeast by the end of the week.\nBefore that, tens of millions of people from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest and into the Great Lakes region are under various heat alerts.\nTemperatures in the Midwest are expected to range from the low 90s to upper 90s during the day on Wednesday.\nHowever, extreme dew points due in part to corn sweat will make it feel even hotter.\nThe heat index is forecast to rise well above 100 degrees across the region, including cities in the Corn Belt like Des Moines in Iowa, Peoria in Illinois and Rolla in Missouri."

      "text": "How to prepare for hurricane season\nFollowing these tips before a hurricane can help you stay safe during the storm\nHurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. In the Pacific Ocean, it starts May 15.\nPreparing for a hurricane or tropical storm and gathering your resources before one hits is critical to ensuring your safety and protecting your property.\nHere is a hurricane preparedness list and some tips to help you get ready for hurricane season.\nDetermine the risk to your area\nFirst things first, determine what type of risks you face in the event of a landfalling hurricane or tropical storm.\nThe wind is the first thing that comes to mind for most when they think about hurricanes, and rightly so. These storms can produce some terribly damaging wind. However, one of the biggest threats from any tropical system is flooding. That flooding can come in two forms \u2014 storm surge along the coast or inland flooding from heavy rain. Tropical systems can also produce tornadoes as they come ashore and rip currents along beaches.\nWith that list in mind, determine what types of problems you might face during a hurricane or tropical storm. In most cases, it will be more than one or maybe even all of them. Knowing this helps you develop a hurricane preparation plan.\nCreate a hurricane evacuation plan\nIf you live in a coastal region, you\u2019re most likely in some type of evacuation zone. Before a hurricane or tropical storm hits, you should determine whether you live in an evacuation zone. Some places handle evacuations by ZIP codes, while others handle it in predetermined zones. Your local or state emergency management office has maps available to help you determine whether you live in an evacuation zone.\nOnce you figure out your evacuation zone, start figuring out where you would go for shelter. Maybe it\u2019s a relative who lives outside the area. Maybe it\u2019s a hotel in a safe place. Maybe it\u2019s a hurricane shelter opened by local officials.\nHOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER ON YOUR TV\nFollow all the evacuation instructions that you\u2019re being given by local officials. Most evacuees will be required to use a specific evacuation route to get out of town. Familiarize yourself with the route. Don\u2019t get on the roads unless you\u2019re told to do so. Unnecessary traffic slows down the evacuation process.\nDon\u2019t forget about your pets when developing your evacuation plan. Shelters and hotels may not allow animals. Pet hotels in the area may not be open in the event of a storm.\nOne last thing, make sure you bring important documents such as insurance paperwork with you.\nAssemble your hurricane supply kit\nYou\u2019ll need to assemble emergency supplies that you can use during and after a hurricane before one is bearing down on your area. People will flock to stores upon word of an approaching storm, so getting those supplies ahead of the rush will save you critical time and a lot of stress.\nHere are some things the National Weather Service says you should include in your kit:\n- Enough non-perishable food, water and medicine to last each person in your family a minimum of three days.\n- Extra cash.\n- A battery-powered radio.\n- Flashlights.\n- A portable crank or solar-powered USB charger for your cell phones.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency also has a list of emergency items you should include.\nCheck your insurance policy's hurricane coverage\nThe last thing you want to deal with during and after a storm is the insurance company. Give your agent a call now and make sure that your coverage is adequate to cover the risks that you may face during a hurricane or tropical storm.\nPROPERTY SUSTAIN HURRICANE DAMAGE? HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO\nIt\u2019s worth noting that standard home insurance policies do not cover flooding from a storm. If your area is prone to flooding, you should consider getting flood insurance. There\u2019s a 30-day waiting period for most flood insurance policies, so sooner is better. You can get more information about the National Flood Insurance Program at floodsmart.gov.\nPrepare your home for a hurricane\nBefore a storm hits, prepare your home for the storm.\nInstall storm shutters that will be helpful in providing protection from the wind for your windows and doors. According to the National Weather Service, a garage door is the most vulnerable part of a home. Make sure it can stand up to the wind.\nTrim trees to prevent branches from falling into your house. Also, secure any loose items like patio furniture or garbage cans so that they don\u2019t become projectiles during the storm."
