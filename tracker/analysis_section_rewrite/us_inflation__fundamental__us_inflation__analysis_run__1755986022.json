      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but still feels like a collection of facts rather than a coherent, first‑principles driven scenario. To reach world‑class quality, 1) anchor the analysis in invariant macro drivers: real‑rate differentials (Fed rate – inflation), tariff‑induced cost shocks, and productivity‑linked labor‑cost regimes; 2) explicitly map the causal chain from each trigger (Fed rate hike, tariff change, EV tax‑credit expiration, Tesla robotaxi pilot, Rivian R2 launch) to corporate cost structures, margin evolution, and ultimately equity pricing; 3) replace vague “high‑rate environment” with concrete numbers (Fed rate 5.5% → higher borrowing costs → wage‑price spiral → layoffs, IBM’s 26k back‑office cuts ≈ 10% of workforce → productivity loss, etc.); 4) include key quantitative anchors from the sources: JUST Capital index outperforms Russell 1000 by 17.3% (4LQD15CFU), Tesla’s gross margin 17.9% (source 6), Rivian’s Q4 2024 gross profit $170 m (source 6), R2 price $45k vs R1 >$100k (JVKCZAPVG), safe withdrawal rate 4.7% (P0K0UEOHU); 5) state the regimes (high‑inflation/interest, low‑inflation, high‑labor‑cost, low‑labor‑cost, EV‑growth vs mature) and the precise transition conditions (Fed rate hikes, tariff adjustments, tax‑credit expiration); 6) distinguish catalysts (Fed policy meetings, tariff announcements, Tesla earnings, Rivian R2 launch) from invalidators (Fed cuts, tariff reductions, Tesla delivery rebound, Rivian scaling failure); 7) remove the Kevin O’Leary reference (X25AHBVDO) as it adds no macro insight; 8) add inline citations using the source IDs (e.g., (4LQD15CFU), (JVKCZAPVG), (P0K0UEOHU), (6)) to satisfy citation density; 9) tighten the narrative into a single paragraph that follows the required structure: base case, key risks, watch list, confidence. Implement these edits and the analysis will meet the depth, clarity, and first‑principles rigor expected for a multi‑year structural outlook.",
