  "content": "The sole survivor of a deadly lunch laced with toxic mushrooms said on Monday he felt only half alive following the death of his wife and he continued to grieve the loss of his two closest friends.\n\nIan Wilkinson read the first victim impact statement in the Victoria state Supreme Court at the sentencing hearing of Erin Patterson.\n\nA jury convicted Patterson, 50, in July of murdering Wilkinson\u2019s wife Heather Wilkinson, her sister Gail Patterson, and her husband Don Patterson with a lunch of Beef Wellington pastries and foraged death cap mushrooms in July 2023.\n\nErin Patterson was also convicted of attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, who spent weeks in hospital and survived after receiving a liver transplant.\n\nWilkinson, a Baptist pastor, described his wife as a woman who took her faith seriously and was full of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness and self-control.\n\n\u201cI only feel half alive without her,\u201d Wilkinson said before weeping.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the distressing shortcomings of our society that so much attention is showered on those who do evil and so little on those who do good,\u201d he added.\n\nHe described Gail and Don Patterson, the parents of Erin Patterson\u2019s estranged husband Simon Patterson, as the closest people to him after his wife and family.\n\n\u201cMy life is greatly impoverished without them,\u201d Wilkinson said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m distressed that Erin has acted with callous and calculated disregard for my life and the lives of those I love.

She wore a paisley top with a light brown jacket.\n\nSeven relatives of victims either read impact statements to the court on Monday or had them read on their behalf.\n\nThe sentencing hearing is scheduled to continue on Tuesday.\n\nShe faces a potential life sentence for each of the murders and 25 years for attempted murder.",

      "text": "Erin Patterson, the woman accused of murdering three guests with a meal laced with death cap mushrooms, told her trial on Wednesday she may have inadvertently added foraged mushrooms to the lunch because her duxelles tasted \u201ca little bland.\u201d\nOn the third day of evidence on Wednesday, Patterson was taken through the events of July, 2023, when she\u2019s accused of deliberately adding lethal death cap mushrooms to a Beef Wellington meal she cooked for four guests, including her parents-in-law, at her house in the small Australian town of Leongatha in rural Victoria.\nPatterson has denied three counts of murder over the death of her in-laws, Don Patterson and Gail Patterson, and Gail\u2019s sister, Heather Wilkinson. She also denies attempting to kill a fourth lunch guest, Heather\u2019s husband, Ian Wilkinson, her local pastor.\nTaking Patterson back to the days before the lunch, defense lawyer Colin Mandy SC asked where she\u2019d bought the ingredients. Patterson said all ingredients came from Woolworths, a major Australian supermarket.\nPatterson said she found the recipe in a cookbook, which she followed with \u201csome deviations.\u201d For example, she said she couldn\u2019t find a beef tenderloin log, so she bought twin packs of individual steaks. The recipe had called for mustard, which she didn\u2019t use, nor did she use prosciutto because Don \u201cdoesn\u2019t eat pork,\u201d she said.\nOn the Saturday morning of the lunch, she said she fried garlic and shallots and chopped up the store-bought mushrooms in a food processor. She cooked the sauteed mixture, known as a duxelles, for perhaps 45 minutes so it was dry and didn\u2019t make the pastry soggy, she said.\nPatterson told the court she tasted the mixture, and as it was \u201ca little bland,\u201d she added dried mushrooms that she\u2019d previously stored in a plastic container in the pantry.\nAsked by Mandy what she believed to be in the plastic container in the pantry: \u201cI believed it was just the mushrooms that I bought in Melbourne,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cAnd now, what do you think might have been in that tub?\u201d Mandy asked.\n\u201cNow I think that there was a possibility that there were foraged ones in there as well,\u201d she said, her voice breaking.\nAfter the meal\nPatterson told the court that Ian and Heather Wilkinson ate all of their meal. Don finished what Gail hadn\u2019t eaten. Patterson only ate about a quarter or third of her Beef Wellington, because she was talking a lot and eating slowly, she said.\nAfter lunch, they cleaned up and sat down to eat an orange cake that Gail had brought.\n\u201cI had a piece of cake, and then another piece of cake, and then another,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cHow many pieces of cake did you have?\u201d Mandy asked. \u201cAll of it,\u201d Patterson replied. She said that amounted to around two-thirds of the original cake.\n\u201cI felt over full, so I went to the toilets and brought it back up again,\u201d she said. Patterson has previously told the court that she had battled bulimia for much of her life and was self-conscious about her weight.\nPatterson said she felt nauseous after the lunch, and later that evening, took medication for diarrhea. The next day she skipped Sunday mass due to the same symptoms and still had diarrhea later that day.\nThat night, she said, she removed the pastry and mushrooms from the leftover Beef Wellington and put the meat in the microwave for the children to eat for dinner.\nThe next day, Monday, she thought she might need fluids so went to the hospital, where a doctor told her that she may have been exposed to death cap mushrooms. Patterson said she was \u201cshocked and confused.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t see how death cap mushrooms could be in the meal,\u201d she said.\nEarlier Wednesday, Patterson told the court she hadn\u2019t seen websites that purported to show the location of death cap mushrooms near her house.\nShe said she was aware of death cap mushrooms and had searched online to find out if they grew in the area. She said she found that they didn\u2019t.\nPatterson also told her trial on Wednesday that she foraged for mushrooms at the Korumburra Botanical Gardens in May 2023, and may have picked some mushrooms near oak trees. The court has previously heard that death cap mushrooms grow near oak trees.\nPatterson said she would dehydrate any mushrooms she didn\u2019t want to use immediately and store them in plastic containers in the pantry. She said that around that time she also bought dried mushrooms from an Asian grocer in Melbourne. Because they had a pungent smell, she said she put them in a plastic container in the pantry.\nMandy asked: \u201cDo you have a memory of putting wild mushrooms that you dehydrated in May or June of 2023 into a container which already contained other dried mushrooms?\u201d\nPatterson replied: \u201cYes, I did do that.\u201d\nLater in proceedings, Patterson recalled a conversation she had with her husband, Simon, as his parents were gravely ill in hospital. She said she mentioned she had dried mushrooms in a dehydrator. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Is that how you poisoned my parents, using that dehydrator?\u2019\u201d she told her trial.\nShe said his comment caused her to do \u201ca lot of thinking about a lot of things.\u201d\n\u201cIt got me thinking about all the times that I\u2019d used (the dehydrator), and how I had dried foraged mushrooms in it weeks earlier, and I was starting to think, what if they\u2019d gone in the container with the Chinese mushrooms? Maybe, maybe that had happened.\u201d\nPatterson said she became \u201creally scared,\u201d and by the time she returned home from the health center, she was \u201cfrantic.\u201d She felt \u201cresponsible\u201d because she\u2019d made the meal, and served it, and \u201cpeople got sick,\u201d she said.\nOn August 2, Patterson said she dropped her children at school, then took the dehydrator to the trash dump. She said child protection officers were due to visit her house that afternoon, and she was \u201cscared\u201d about having a conversation about the meal and the dehydrator. \u201cI was scared that they would blame me for it\u2026. for making everyone sick,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI was scared they\u2019d remove the children,\u201d she added.\nAsked whether she had come to the realization that death cap mushrooms may have been in the meal, Patterson said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nShe said she thought there might be evidence of \u201cany foraged mushrooms\u201d in the dehydrator.\nPatterson also told the court she was responsible for three factory resets of her phone. Her son did the first. She said she knew there were images of mushrooms and the dehydrator in her Google photos. \u201cI just panicked and didn\u2019t want them to see them,\u201d she said. Asked who she was talking about, she said: \u201cThe detectives.\u201d\nPatterson\u2019s evidence will continue Thursday."

      "text": "Erin Patterson, the Australian woman accused of killing three relatives with a meal of death cap mushrooms baked in a Beef Wellington lunch, has been found guilty of three counts of murder and the attempted murder of the lone survivor.\nA 12-member jury reached the verdict after around six days of deliberation following a 10-week trial in Morwell, a tiny town about an hour\u2019s drive from the suburban dining room in Leongatha, Victoria, where the lethal lunch was served in July 2023.\nDozens of media crews raced to the court when it was announced the jury had reached a verdict in the case that has captivated audiences worldwide and spawned four podcasts dedicated to unpacking each day\u2019s evidence.\nDuring weeks of testimony, Patterson was accused of deliberately tainting the lunch with death cap mushrooms, highly toxic fungi that she picked after seeing their location posted on a public website.\nIn the days after, her former parents-in-law, Don and Gail Patterson, died along with Gail\u2019s sister Heather Wilkinson. Heather\u2019s husband Ian, their local pastor, survived after a weekslong stay in hospital.\nHer defense lawyers had argued the deaths were a \u201cterrible accident\u201d that occurred when Patterson tried to improve the taste of the meal, and that she repeatedly lied to police out of panic when she realized she may have added foraged mushrooms to the mix.\nPatterson sat in court, listening as prosecutors called witness after witness, whose testimony, they alleged, told a compelling story of a triple murder that the jury ultimately found satisfied the legal standard of beyond reasonable doubt.\nUnder Australian law, none of the jurors can be publicly identified, and they\u2019re prohibited from disclosing jury room deliberations even after the trial ends.\nIt will never be known which pieces of evidence influenced each juror\u2019s decision, but all 12 were required to agree on the verdict.\nThe fateful lunch\nThe agreed facts were that Patterson asked five people to lunch on July 29, 2023, including her estranged husband Simon Patterson, who pulled out the day before.\nWithin hours of the meal, the four lunch guests \u2013 Simon\u2019s parents Don and Gail, and his aunt and uncle, Heather and Ian Wilkinson \u2013 became ill with vomiting and diarrhea. They went to hospital where they were placed in induced comas as doctors tried to save them.\nGail and Heather died on August 4 from multiorgan failure, followed by Don on August 5, after he failed to respond to a liver transplant. Ian Wilkinson survived and was finally discharged from hospital in late September, after almost two months of intensive treatment.\nDeath cap mushrooms contain amanita toxins that prevent the production of proteins in liver cells, leading to cell death and possible liver failure from about two days after ingestion.\nNative to Europe, the lethal mushrooms have been found growing in several Australian states, and around the time of the lunch, they had been seen within a short drive of Patterson\u2019s home in rural Victoria.\nDuring the trial, the prosecution argued that Patterson had the opportunity to pick lethal mushrooms after seeing their location posted on the citizen science iNaturalist website.\nThe guilty verdict suggests the jury accepted the prosecution\u2019s argument that she likely traveled to two sites in April and May 2023, and deliberately picked the mushrooms used in the meal.\nProsecution alleged \u2018calculated deceptions\u2019\nProsecutor Nanette Rogers SC alleged that \u201cfour calculated deceptions\u201d were at the heart of the case. \u201cThe first deception was the fabricated cancer claim she used as a pretence for the lunch invitation,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe second deception was the lethal doses of poison the accused secreted in the homecooked beef Wellingtons. The third deception was her attempts to make it seem that she also suffered death cap mushroom poisoning and the fourth deception, the sustained cover-up she embarked upon to conceal the truth.\u201d\nPatterson admitted that on April 28 \u2013 the same day as cellphone signals put her in the vicinity of death cap mushrooms \u2013 she bought a dehydrator that she later dumped at a waste recycling center on August 2, as her guests lay in hospital.\nIt had her fingerprints on it and contained remnants of death cap mushrooms.\nThe prosecution alleged that Patterson faked illness in the days after serving the lunch and tried to cover her tracks by disposing of the dehydrator and factory resetting her devices to delete evidence.\nPatterson\u2019s defense lawyer Colin Mandy SC accused the prosecution of being selective with the evidence and pushing \u201cfour ridiculous, convoluted propositions.\u201d\nThe first was that Patterson would do this \u201cwithout any motive,\u201d Mandy said.\nHe said there were several reasons why Patterson would not want to kill her guests. She had no money issues, lived in a big house, and had almost full-time custody of her two young children, who were very close to their grandparents, he said.\nThe prosecution did not have to prove motive.\nRogers accused Patterson of having two faces: One she showed the world that suggested she had a good relationship with the Pattersons, and a hidden face she showed only her Facebook friends that suggested she wanted \u201cnothing to do with them.\u201d\nIn Facebook messages sent in December 2022, Patterson had expressed anger and frustration over Don and Gail\u2019s reluctance to get involved in their son\u2019s marriage breakdown.\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this shit I want nothing to do with them,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI thought his parents would want him to do the right thing but it seems their concern about not wanting to feel uncomfortable and not wanting to get involved in their son\u2019s personal matters are overriding that so f*** em.\u201d\nAnd another message read: \u201cThis family I swear to f***ing god.\u201d\nDuring eight days of testimony including cross-examination, Patterson consistently pleaded her innocence, claiming she inadvertently added foraged mushrooms to the meal.\nIn his directions to the jury, Justice Christopher Beale said that Patterson\u2019s admission that she told lies and disposed of evidence must not cause them to be prejudiced against her.\n\u201cThis is a court of law, not a court of morals,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe issue is not whether she is in some sense responsible for the tragic consequences of the lunch, but whether the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that she is criminally responsible for those consequences,\u201d he said.\nThe jury found that Patterson had intended to kill all four lunch guests and lied repeatedly on the stand to claim she didn\u2019t.\nPatterson will be sentenced at a later date."
