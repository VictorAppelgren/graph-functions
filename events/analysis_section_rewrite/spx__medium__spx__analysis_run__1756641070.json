      "feedback": "The draft is on the right track but needs tightening and a sharper focus on the S&P 500 itself.  Remove the sentence that introduces the Invesco S&P 500 Equal‑Weight ETF (RSP) – it drifts to a separate asset and violates the “exclusive asset” rule (flagged sentence: *“A secondary scenario is that the market will pivot to a more diversified exposure, such as the Invesco S&P 500 Equal‑Weight ETF (RSP), which historically outperforms during recoveries…”*).  Add concrete macro data to back the causal chain: cite the current Shiller P/E (≈ 35.0, CG8ZKHFI2), the June‑July payroll growth (≈ 200 k jobs, FAN5RYW6T), July CPI (2.7 % YoY) and PCE (2.9 % YoY, FAN5RYW6T), and the Fed’s policy rate (5.25‑5.50 %, implied in FAN5RYW6T).  Explicitly state the base‑case figure (3–5 % decline over 3–6 months) and the alt‑case (Fed cuts in September → 1–3 % rally) with the same citations.  Keep the watch‑list signals (Fed minutes, CPI/PCE, top‑10 concentration ratio, Shiller P/E) and confidence rating, but trim any redundant wording.  This will satisfy the truth‑over‑verbosity, causal‑transmission, and citation‑density requirements while staying strictly within the S&P 500 focus.",
