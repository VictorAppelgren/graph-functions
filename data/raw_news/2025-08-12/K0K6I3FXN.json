(NYSE American: ARMP) (\"Armata\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of high-purity, pathogen-specific bacteriophage therapeutics for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant and difficult-to-treat bacterial infections, today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2025, and provided a corporate update.\n\n\"We achieved another significant milestone during the second quarter with positive topline data from our Phase 1b/2a diSArm study of AP-SA02, our high-purity, multi-phage therapeutic candidate that we are developing as a treatment for complicated S. aureus bacteremia,\" stated Dr. Deborah Birx, Chief Executive Officer of Armata. \"Notably, these data are the first clear evidence in a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of phage in treating a serious systemic bacterial infection, with demonstrated efficacy regardless of antibiotic resistance patterns or site of infection. Findings from the diSArm study, including the favorable safety and tolerability profile of AP-SA02, will inform the design of a larger definitive efficacy study to demonstrate superiority of AP-SA02 in treating complicated S. aureus bacteremia, and will form the basis for an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA which the Company intends to hold later this year. Importantly, Armata's planned superiority pivotal trial design will have the potential to change standard of care for a serious systemic pathogen that is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in the United States. We are very grateful for the ongoing support of Innoviva and the U.S. Department of Defense for providing critical funding to enable us to continue to advance this promising program.\"\n\n\"Together with previously announced promising trial results for our second clinical candidate, AP-PA02, a novel, inhaled multi-phage therapeutic for the treatment of chronic pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in people with cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, I continue to be very pleased with our progress. With two promising therapeutic candidates and a state-of-the-art manufacturing platform that can achieve the high purity necessary for clinical success, we are very well positioned to address areas of high unmet need while creating significant long-term value for our company,\" Dr. Birx concluded.\n\nGrant and Award Revenue. The Company recognized grant and award revenue of $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025. This represents MTEC's share of the costs incurred for the Company's AP-SA02 program for the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia. The Company recognized no grant revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2025 were approximately $6.4 million, compared to approximately $8.5 million for the comparable period in 2024.
