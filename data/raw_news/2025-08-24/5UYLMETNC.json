  "content": "More women in the U.S. die during childbirth or soon after than in many developed countries.\n\nJordyn Albright's pregnancy-and-delivery journey was difficult from the start. Her pregnancy was high risk, due to both in vitro fertilization (IVF) and high blood pressure during pregnancy. She was induced three weeks early and went through 60 hours of labor before delivering.\n\nWith her son in her arms, the worst should have been behind her. But within moments, her doctor realized her placenta was stuck to her uterine wall. Hospital staff gathered around her, trying to remove the placenta manually \u2014 \"a horribly painful experience,\" Albright, 32, said. She wouldn't stop bleeding.\n\nMere minutes after giving birth, Albright passed out from blood loss. What she didn't hear was her care team calling for a rapid response, which is an alert in labor-and-delivery units that brings an emergency team of doctors and nurses rushing to the room. This team saved Albright's life with 4 pints of blood (she would later need 2 more) and whisked her to emergency surgery to remove the retained placenta.\n\nThis harrowing experience was followed by a traumatic few days in the intensive care unit (ICU) and separation from her newborn. It was compounded by weeks in the neonatal ICU for the new baby, who contracted a rare bacterial infection after birth. But Albright and her husband, Jeffrey Albright, credit their care team with saving both mom and child.\n\n\"This could have been so much worse,\" Jeffrey Albright, 32, told Live Science. \"In any way you can think of it, it could have been worse.\"\n\nFor too many families, it is worse. A higher percentage of people die in pregnancy, childbirth or the postpartum period in the U.S. than in comparable wealthy countries. It's a problem of health disparities, access to health care, and how individual hospitals handle emergencies \u2014 and the problems could deepen with recent policy decisions in the U.S., experts say.\n\nDespite the bleak numbers, there is hope. Evidence suggests that most of these deaths are preventable and that some relatively straightforward interventions could slash the maternal death rate. Those measures include better prenatal monitoring to prevent emergencies in the first place, as well as more training for hospital personnel to react when emergencies do happen.\n\n\"We know what to do,\" said , past president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. \"We just have to implement it.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines maternal mortality as the death of a patient during pregnancy or up to 42 days after delivery from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or pregnancy care. For example, someone who dies in a car wreck during pregnancy wouldn't be counted, but someone with a preexisting heart condition whose condition worsened due to pregnancy would be.\n\nAlthough maternal death is rare in the U.S., the rate is higher than in other wealthy nations. Provisional CDC data suggest that in 2024, there were 19 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births, compared with 8.4 per 100,000 in Canada, 8.8 per 100,000 in South Korea, 5.5 per 100,000 in the U.K. and zero in Norway, according to , a health policy foundation.\n\nThe U.S. has long been an outlier among its wealthy peers in maternal mortality, even though the country spends about twice as much per person on health care as other large, wealthy nations do, according to the Peterson Center on Healthcare and the health policy organization KFF , a health policy research organization.\n\n\"We rank very poorly on the world stage,\" said , an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the Yale School of Medicine and the CEO and co-founder of Enrich Health, a startup that aims to provide evidence-based prenatal care.\n\nAccording to , about half of U.S. maternal deaths happen the day after birth, and about a third occur during pregnancy. During pregnancy, one-third of the deaths are due to stroke and heart conditions, according to the , while emergencies such as hemorrhage cause the most deaths during labor and delivery. Bleeding, high blood pressure (including pregnancy-induced conditions such as preeclampsia, a life-threatening persistent rise in blood pressure that can develop during pregnancy or up to six weeks postpartum), infection and cardiomyopathy (a weakening of the heart muscle) cause the most deaths after delivery.\n\n\"What's coming out of our research is that cardiovascular disease is really increasing,\" Conry told Live Science.\n\nWhile the U.S. has of certain conditions that increase the risk of complications , and the \u2014 such as obesity \u2014 other countries with high rates of these risk factors have much lower rates of death than the U.S.\n\nOne factor in the U.S.' comparatively poor outcomes is that many women live in \"maternity deserts\" \u2014 areas where there is no nearby hospital that offers maternity services or neonatal specialists. Thirty-five percent of counties in the United States are maternity care deserts, according to the March of Dimes.\n\nAs of 2022, 52% of rural hospitals did not offer obstetric care, and the problem has worsened since then. According to , 238 rural hospitals stopped offering obstetrics between 2010 and 2022, and only 26 rural hospitals added obstetrics to their offerings in that time period. (During the same period, 299 urban hospitals lost obstetrics, but 112 added in new offerings.)\n\nIn addition, a found that women had a higher rate of maternal morbidity rate \u2014 a measure of serious and life-threatening complications around pregnancy and childbirth \u2014 if they gave birth after an obstetrical unit closed in a nearby hospital.\n\nLack of maternity care is a big problem in rural areas, but it's not exclusively a rural one. Around 35% of urban hospitals lack obstetric care. In addition, other health care access problems can make it difficult for women to get to prenatal appointments where problems can be spotted and managed early on.\n\nEven in dense Chicago, \"if your Medicaid provider is not in network, you're a lot of times forced to use public transport in horrible weather, often with other children, to get preventative care,\" said Star August Ali, a certified professional midwife and the executive director and founder of the Black Midwifery Collective in Chicago, which aims to train and support Black midwives.\n\nThe Medicaid cuts in the \"Big Beautiful Bill Act\" signed into law in July could spell deep trouble for maternal mortality. The cuts are expected to hit rural hospitals hard, according to KFF, with the likely closure of 144 rural labor and delivery wards.\n\nAnd about 41% of U.S. births are While it's not clear how the cuts will affect enrollment during pregnancy, without that coverage, people may not have access to treatments and monitoring that could head off some life-threatening emergencies.\n\nThe impact of these policies is not equal. Medicaid covers about 28% of births to white mothers, to Black mothers, and of births to American Indian or Alaska Native moms. Younger women are also more likely to be covered by Medicaid than by private insurance, with almost 79% of births to moms under age 20 being .\n\nIf fewer pregnant women are covered, \"we're going to see a huge uptick of emergency room utilization, a huge decrease in preventative care and early detection,\" during pregnancy, Ali told Live Science.\n\nThe same groups that may lose the most coverage under the Medicaid cuts are also those that are at higher risk of poor outcomes for mom and baby. Black and Native American women are two to three times more likely than white women to die during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period, .\n\nSome of this disparity has to do with access to care and poorer quality of care for people of color. A 2025 study of over 3,000 hospitals showed sparser staffing and worse mortality outcomes in hospitals that served predominantly Black patients compared with hospitals with lower percentages of Black patients. And the 2021 study on maternity unit closures also found that severe maternal morbidity was worse in hospitals that served many Black patients.\n\nResearch also suggests that American Indian and Alaska Native patients face serious gaps in their health care coverage, which could prevent them from accessing lifesaving preventive care.\n\nRacial bias by health care providers may play a role as well. A on doctor-patient communication found that Black patients experienced \"poorer communication quality, information-giving, patient participation, and participatory decision-making\" compared with white patients. This could lead to a lack of trust between doctor and patient that affects clinical decision-making, the study researchers wrote. For example, the doctor may view the patient as less engaged and fail to give them important recommendations about how to care for their health.\n\nDespite big-picture problems with the healthcare system, the data suggest that there are opportunities to prevent a large number of maternal deaths.\n\nA 2024 study in the looked at deaths across 42 states and found that over 90% of deaths from preeclampsia and eclampsia in the U.S. could have been prevented. So could more than 80% of deaths from hemorrhage and cardiovascular conditions and about 70% of deaths from infection. Harder to prevent are deaths from stroke or amniotic fluid embolism, an emergency in which amniotic fluid enters the maternal bloodstream, but even then, 40% of deaths were found to be preventable.\n\nThe fraction of deaths that could have been prevented with immediate improvements in medical care varied dramatically among states, from 45% to 100%, the study found.\n\n\"The number one finding is this variability,\" said study author , a public health researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nThat variability is actually a cause for hope, experts say, because it suggests there are clear measures that states, hospitals and providers can implement to reduce maternal mortality.\n\nThe first step in preventing these deaths is to study each death in detail, Rainford said.\n\nStates that have studied these deaths and used those lessons to make concerted efforts to reduce maternal mortality have seen success. California's long-running Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, for example, prompted a dramatic decline in maternal mortality in the decade after it was started in 2006, putting the state almost on a par with Canada.\n\nThe collaborative helps to investigate the causes of individual deaths, looking for preventable factors. \"It's transformed things,\" Conry said.\n\nBut current policies and politics may be hindering efforts to learn from past experiences. After the investigative news organization ProPublica reported a series of preventable likely caused by hospitals delaying care out of fear that doctors would be prosecuted under the states' strict abortion laws, Georgia abruptly fired every member of its committee on maternal deaths. The state will not disclose who is now on the committee . The board in Idaho, which also has a strict abortion ban, was before being reestablished in 2024, leading to gaps in analysis and methodology changes. Texas' committee , the two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and enabled the state to enact laws restricting nearly all abortions.\n\nThe lack of transparency stemming from abortion politics is a barrier to reducing maternal mortality.\n\nCreating and implementing standards of care is another way to lower death rates. For instance, after the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative analyzed maternal deaths in detail, they found a clear pattern: Too many women were dying of postpartum hemorrhage, one of the most common causes of maternal mortality.\n\nSo they provided hospitals tool kits to handle emergency scenarios, including standardized drills, training, and instructions to stock a \"crash cart\" of supplies to handle postpartum hemorrhage.\n\nThe same concept of standardized care could be extended to other conditions beyond hemorrhage, Conry said. For instance, the Collaborative will soon release guidance on better recognizing sepsis, a type of life-threatening infection that can occur during or after childbirth.\n\nThere is also a need to improve monitoring before labor and delivery. Over time, the immediate causes of death have been shifting from rapidly-developing emergency situations, such as hemorrhage, toward chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, Creanga said.\n\nThis underscores the importance of people receiving regular care through pregnancy and for increased monitoring of high-risk individuals. For example, Johns Hopkins has launched an initiative called The Maryland Maternal Health Innovation Program (MDMOM) that includes at-home, telehealth-supported blood-pressure monitoring for pregnant patients with high blood pressure. That could help catch patients whose health is deteriorating, before an emergency happens. (The Preeclampsia Foundation offers a nationwide.)\n\nCreanga and her colleagues are also working to improve education for health care professionals and community groups around warning signs for high-risk pregnancy. The goal is to get tools into the hands of patients and their families, Creanga said, and to move the U.S. into the company of countries like Norway, where maternal death is vanishingly rare.\n\n\"Maternal mortality is a marker of the health of your country,\" she said. \"It's maybe the most important marker.\"",

      "text": "'These decisions were completely reckless': Funding cuts to mRNA vaccines will make America more vulnerable to pandemics\nmRNA expert Jeff Coller spoke with Live Science about the future of mRNA vaccines in the United States in the aftermath of huge federal funding cuts.\nCells use mRNA to build proteins, and after years of research, scientists learned how to harness this molecule to develop effective, safe and quick-to-make vaccines. Since the advent of this Nobel Prize-winning technology, a handful of mRNA vaccines have been approved in the United States \u2014 namely, COVID-19 and RSV shots. Vaccines still in development could someday protect against seasonal flu, bird flu, HIV and more.\nBut now, the U.S. federal government is slashing its investments in mRNA vaccines \u2014 a move that will immediately impact 22 projects totaling nearly $500 million, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced Tuesday (Aug. 5).\nSome projects in late stages will be allowed to wrap up, but \"no new mRNA-based projects will be initiated,\" the statement said. The department will also cease \"all mRNA-based equity investments\" coordinated through its partner Global Health Investment Corp., a nonprofit that supports the development of public health technologies through venture capital.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., HHS secretary and founder of the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, claimed in the statement that mRNA vaccines \"fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections\" and said that the HHS will shift to funding \"safer, broader vaccine platforms.\" These alternatives are later defined as whole-virus vaccines and unspecified \"novel\" technologies.\nPer the statement, this retreat from mRNA vaccines will not impact \"other uses of mRNA technology.\" But \"I can tell you that the industry doesn't trust that,\" said Jeff Coller, the Bloomberg distinguished professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, who has studied mRNA for more than 30 years. \"Even though the cancellation was specific to infectious disease, it really was a shot across the bow to the entire industry.\"\nmRNA is useful for more than combating infectious diseases. It could potentially be applied as a cancer therapy, a vehicle to deliver gene-editing treatments into the body, a way to rein in autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, or a treatment for the dangerous pregnancy disorder preeclampsia, for example.\nLive Science spoke with Coller about the recent funding cuts and their anticipated impacts on the mRNA field and health of Americans.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nRelated: What are mRNA vaccines, and how do they work?\nNicoletta Lanese: Can you talk about how the HHS stance on mRNA vaccines had been shifting prior to Tuesday's cuts?\nJeff Coller: It was clear early on, before Robert F. Kennedy was nominated for the position of secretary of HHS, that he was, first of all, a vaccine skeptic, and highly critical of mRNA-based vaccines, as well. His statements before his appointment included some things like, \"The mRNA vaccines were some of the most dangerous medicines introduced into the human population.\"\n[After his appointment], one of the first things that he did was to dissolve the committee that oversees the procedures of vaccinations within the United States called ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices], and he appointed new individuals to that committee. One of those includes an individual who is an mRNA skeptic: Robert Malone, who has claimed on TV and Joe Rogan that mRNAs are dangerous.\nIn addition to that, in about March of this year, there was an internal memo sent to NIH [National Institutes of Health] employees, asking them to disclose if they were working on mRNA vaccines, as well as to disclose who their colleagues were. This was made public and was published in journals like Science and was a warning sign that they were potentially going to target individuals associated with this type of research.\nSo we are already starting to feel that there was a growing anti-mRNA sentiment within the HHS, and then the cancellation of Moderna's bird flu contract that happened about maybe six weeks ago was probably the first direct action of an mRNA program being canceled by the federal government. And now, what happened two days ago [was that] funding was canceled for 22 of these mRNA projects that were investigating various vaccines.\nNL: Are you aware of the specifics of any of those projects?\nJC: We do know of some clinical trials that were already underway [and were impacted], and this included influenza \u2014 which is, of course, the big one \u2014 as well as respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV; cytomegalovirus, which is often called CMV; Zika, Epstein-Barr virus; and hepatitis B.\nNL: The HHS statement drew a line between mRNA vaccines and \"other uses\" of mRNA. Do you think that those other projects will be unaffected?\nJC: Well, I can tell you that the industry doesn't trust that. And the reason why I know that is that I'm one of the founders of the Alliance for mRNA Medicines. This is an organization of over 75+ members, many are biotech \u2014 small biotech, large biopharma, as well as major academic medical centers, including [Johns] Hopkins and Penn [the University of Pennsylvania] and the Mayo Clinic. We did a survey very early in the [Trump] administration to ask about some of these policy changes that were coming down from HHS. The overwhelming response from our membership was that they felt that the United States was becoming an unfriendly place for mRNA-based technology.\nEven though the cancellation was specific to infectious disease, it really was a shot across the bow to the entire industry. It sent a chilling effect through the industry that basically makes everyone question, should we continue to invest in these programs within the United States?\nThe arguments that were made [by RFK Jr.] were vague and are not based on what is accepted in the scientific community. In fact, most of his statements are false. So, given that that decision was clearly made on nonscientific beliefs, then the industry is going to be scratching their head and thinking, \"Well, maybe we should probably look elsewhere to develop our products, other countries.\"\nNL: One example I was thinking about was \"cancer vaccines,\" which are more of an immunotherapy. Do you think HHS will carve out an exception for those?\nJC: We don't know. And we've tried to move away from using the word \"cancer vaccine\" on purpose. We started referring to them as \"cancer neoantigen therapies.\" To start thinking about you changing your wordage because you're worried about how the administration is going to perceive what it is you're doing is alarming.\nMany of these technologies that are being developed for cancer are still very early in research and development. These are still not even in the biotech space; a lot of them are still in the academic setting. If you're an academic lab, are you really going to continue down this road if you are not going to be able to get funding? I personally know of investigators that are doing clinical trials on mRNA-based approaches for cancer who are scared \u2014 they're actually scared to talk to reporters like you. They're scared to even mention that they have mRNA-based medicines, because their patients will suffer if the funding gets cut off.\nNL: Another example I was thinking of was gene editing, and specifically CRISPR-based treatments. How could those be affected?\nJC: When CRISPR was discovered, gene editing had a huge promise of being able to cure rare genetic disorders. But the limitation of gene editing was that if you introduce a gene editor, you have to be able to stop it. You have to be able to go and correct the mutation, and then you have to stop that machinery from working because you don't want it to overdo its job. If it does so, it's going to continue to edit and edit and edit the genome, and then you have a problem.\nWhat has now made gene editing possible in a human patient is mRNA. In the case of baby KJ [the first-ever recipient of a customized CRISPR treatment], the CRISPR technology was introduced as an mRNA. That is the critical feature that was necessary to get this to work. The beauty of the human body is that it makes mRNA and then it clears the mRNA; it gets it out. So by introducing the gene-editing technology as an mRNA, we could go in, get an effect for a very short period of time, and then let the body do what it normally does and get rid of it. So that was perfect to do on this little baby.\nBy undermining mRNA-based work, we're potentially limiting the ability to do this true personalized medicine approach of gene editing that could save millions of people's lives every year.\nNL: How do you anticipate this divestment could affect pandemic preparedness in the U.S.?\nJC: I actually think that these decisions were completely reckless in that regard and put America in significant harm's way, in terms of our national defense.\nThrough Donald Trump's leadership under Operation Warp Speed, we were able to identify a pathogen, have a sequence, make a possible vaccine, develop that in nine months, and deploy it to the American people in the next three months. That's unparalleled in human history. The reason why we're able to do that is because of the power of the mRNA platform, that it is so easy to develop and easy to produce at scale, and then easy to deploy to the greater population.\nTraditional vaccines, meaning before the advent of mRNA vaccines, typically take between three to five years to develop. And you don't even know if it will be efficacious. If you have a pandemic, you do need a technology that can be rapidly deployed. Not continuing to investigate the usage of a technology that has proven itself is completely reckless and puts America and Americans in harm's way.\nAnd the truth is that other countries recognize the power of mRNA vaccines and mRNA medicines and are doubling down on their investment \u2014 especially China. Quite frankly, if a pandemic comes out, we're going to be caught asking China for their vaccines.\nNL: Do you think this could also prompt \"vaccine tourism,\" in which Americans go abroad to get vaccinated?\nJC: If there's a pandemic, like what might happen with avian flu, and we're not prepared, absolutely \u2014 if Canada has a vaccine, people are going to migrate north.\nAnd you have to think about it even more broadly than that. The study that came from [Memorial] Sloan Kettering [Cancer Center] that showed such good efficacy on pancreatic cancer \u2014 if that research stops, and continues in Europe or in China and you're diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, you're going to go there. Right? So you can think about the different types of tourism outside of vaccine tourism, sort of medical tourism.\nNL: From an industry standpoint, what could these cuts mean for mRNA developers?\nJC: First of all, you have other countries that are trying to recruit American companies to their shores through incentives. And they're trying to do the same with scientists through easy pathways to citizenship and grant and funding mechanisms. In addition to moving their brick-and-mortar operations overseas, these American companies will start developing drugs that are specific to other countries. There are viruses that are more resident in South America; the market in the United States just doesn't make sense, but we could easily sell those drugs to Brazil, for example.\nThat's what I think will happen in the short course. These companies will start making drugs and marketing them to other countries. But then, in the long term, they actually will move brick and mortar.\nNL: Are there other impacts that you anticipate these cuts having?\nJC: I think that this will certainly impact America's leadership in biomedical discovery. We're going to lose an entire generation of scientists through these types of actions.\nLet's not fool ourselves: mRNA is one of the three most important molecules in the body, with the other two being DNA and protein. It's the intermediary between them. When the federal government sends a message that mRNA-based medicine and research is not wanted, you're basically saying that there's a whole branch of science that is no longer welcome within the U.S.\nSo if you're a young individual thinking about going to graduate school and becoming a scientist to try and use your talents to improve human health, you may not do that. You may not do that in the United States, at least. So I think the United States is going to fall dramatically behind in its leadership in biotech.\nWe're going to see, over the next five to 10 years, a significant brain drain, where other countries build up their infrastructure, and new scientists are not trained in the United States, and preexisting scientists flee.\nNL: What's something you hope the public understands about these funding cuts and mRNA?\nJC: I think that most Americans don't understand that mRNA is a natural substance, a natural part of your body. Every cell in your body has mRNA \u2014 thousands of copies of mRNA.\nWith mRNA-based medicines, we're not doing something that is dangerous or reckless. What we're doing as medical professionals is we're actually taking advantage of a natural system that exists within your body and using your body to help itself. It's really quite remarkable that we're able to do this. All we are doing is taking advantage of that remarkable system that preexists.\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\nNicoletta Lanese is the health channel editor at Live Science and was previously a news editor and staff writer at the site.

      "text": "Racial Disparities in Maternal and Infant Health: Current Status and Efforts to Address Them\nNOTE: This brief was updated on November 4, 2024 to incorporate additional information about the role of midwives in maternal and infant care.\nSummary\nStark racial disparities in maternal and infant health in the U.S. have persisted for decades despite continued advancements in medical care. The disparate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for people of color increased attention to health disparities, including the longstanding inequities in maternal and infant health. Additionally, the overturning of Roe v. Wade, increased barriers to abortion and may widen the existing disparities in maternal health. Given these factors, there recently has been increased attention to improving maternal and infant health and reducing disparities in these areas.\nThis brief provides an overview of racial disparities for selected measures of maternal and infant health, discusses the factors that drive these disparities, and provides an overview of recent efforts to address them. It is based on KFF analysis of publicly available data from CDC WONDER online database, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) National Vital Statistics Reports, and the CDC Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System. While this brief focuses on racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and infant health, wide disparities also exist across other dimensions, including income, education, age, and other characteristics. For example, there is significant variation in some of these measures across states and disparities between rural and urban communities. Data and research often assume cisgender identities and may not systematically account for people who are transgender and non-binary. In some cases, the data cited in this brief use cisgender labels to align with how measures have been defined in underlying data sources. Key takeaways include:\nLarge racial disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes persist. Pregnancy-related mortality rates among American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) and Black women are over three times higher than the rate for White women (63.4 and 55.9 vs. 18.1 per 100,000). Black, AIAN, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI) women also have higher shares of preterm births, low birthweight births, or births for which they received late or no prenatal care compared to White women. Infants born to Black, AIAN, and NHPI people have markedly higher mortality rates than those born to White people.\nMaternal and infant health disparities reflect broader underlying social and economic inequities that are rooted in racism and discrimination. Differences in health insurance coverage and access to care play a role in driving worse maternal and infant health outcomes for people of color. However, inequities in broader social and economic factors, including income, are primary drivers for maternal and infant health disparities. Moreover, disparities in maternal and infant health persist even when controlling for certain underlying social and economic factors, such as education and income, pointing to the roles racism and discrimination play in driving disparities.\nIncreased attention to maternal and infant health has contributed to a rise in efforts and resources focused on improving health outcomes and reducing disparities in these areas. These include efforts to expand access to coverage and care, increase access to a broader array of services and providers that support maternal and infant health, diversify the health care workforce, and enhance data collection and reporting. However, addressing social and economic factors that contribute to poorer health outcomes and disparities will also be important. Moreover, the persistence of disparities in maternal health across income and education levels, points to the importance of addressing the roles of racism and discrimination as part of efforts to improve health and advance equity.\nMoving forward, legislative and policy efforts and the outcome of the 2024 presidential election could all have important implications for efforts to address racial disparities in maternal and infant health. For example, state variation in access to abortion in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade may exacerbate existing racial disparities in maternal health. Further, differences in records and proposed approaches by Vice President Harris and former President Trump on abortion, reproductive health, and maternal health will likely have different implications for disparities in maternal health going forward.\nRacial Disparities in Maternal and Infant Health\nPregnancy-Related Mortality Rates\nIn 2020, approximately 900 women died in the U.S. from causes related to or worsened by pregnancy. Pregnancy-related deaths are deaths that occur within one year of pregnancy. Approximately one quarter (26%) occur during pregnancy, another quarter (27%) occur during labor or within the first week postpartum, and nearly half (47%) occur one week to one year postpartum, underscoring the importance of access to health care beyond the period of pregnancy. Recent data shows that more than eight out of ten (84%) pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. Although leading causes of pregnancy-related death vary by race and ethnicity, infection (including COVID-19) and cardiovascular conditions are the leading causes of pregnancy-related death among women overall, illustrating the importance of care for chronic conditions on pregnancy-related outcomes. Additional data from detailed maternal mortality reviews in 38 states found mental health conditions to be the overall leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths.\nAIAN and Black people are more than three times as likely as White people to experience a pregnancy-related death (63.4 and 55.9 vs. 18.1 per 100,000 live births) in 2020 (Figure 1). Hispanic people also have a higher rate of pregnancy-related deaths compared to White people (22.6 vs. 18.1 per 100,000). The rate for Asian people is lower compared to that of White people (14.2 vs. 18.1 per 100,000). Data from one year were insufficient to identify mortality among NHPI women. However, earlier data showed that NHPI (62.8 per 100,000) people had the highest rates of pregnancy-related mortality across racial and ethnic groups.\nResearch shows that these disparities increase by age and persist across education and income levels. Data show higher pregnancy-related mortality rates among Black women who completed college education than among White women with the same educational attainment and White women with less than a high school diploma. Similarly, studies find that high income Black women have the same risk of dying in the first year following childbirth as the poorest White women. Other research also shows that Black women are at significantly higher risk for severe maternal morbidity, such as preeclampsia, which is significantly more common than maternal death. Further, AIAN, Black, NHPI, Asian, and Hispanic women have higher rates of admission to the intensive care unit during delivery compared to White women, which is considered a marker for severe maternal morbidity.\nMaternal death rates declined across most racial and ethnic groups between 2021 and 2022 following the large increase in maternal deaths rates due to COVID-19. Maternal mortality and pregnancy-related mortality are similar concepts but maternal mortality is a narrower measure, limited to deaths that occur while pregnant or within 42 days or pregnancy and excluding those due to accidents or acts of violence. However, more recent maternal mortality data are available allowing for examination of trends since COVID-19. Black women had the highest maternal mortality rate across racial and ethnic groups between 2018 and 2022 and also experienced the largest increase during the pandemic (Figure 2). Maternal mortality rates decreased significantly across most racial and ethnic groups between 2021 and 2022. This decline may reflect a return to pre-pandemic levels following the large increase in maternal death rates due to COVID-19 related deaths. Despite this decline, the U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate among high-income countries and the maternal mortality rate for Black women remained over two and a half times as high as the rate for White women.\nBirth Risks and Outcomes\nBlack, AIAN, and NHPI women are more likely than White women to have certain birth risk factors that contribute to infant mortality and can have long-term consequences for the physical and cognitive health of children. Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks gestation) and low birthweight (defined as a baby born less than 5.5 pounds) are some of the leading causes for infant mortality. Receiving pregnancy-related care late in a pregnancy (defined as starting in the third trimester) or not receiving any pregnancy-related care at all can also increase the risk of pregnancy complications. Black, AIAN, and NHPI women have higher shares of preterm births, low birthweight births, or births for which they received late or no prenatal care compared to White women (Figure 3). Notably, NHPI women are four times more likely than White women to begin receiving prenatal care in the third trimester or to receive no prenatal care at all (22% vs. 5%). Black women also are nearly twice as likely compared to White women to have a birth with late or no prenatal care compared to White women (10% vs. 5%).\nWhile teen birth rates overall have declined over time, they are higher among Black, Hispanic, AIAN, and NHPI teens compared to their White counterparts (Figure 4). In contrast, the birth rate among Asian teens is lower than the rate for White teens. Many teen pregnancies are unplanned, and pregnant teens may be less likely to receive early and regular prenatal care. Teen pregnancy also is associated with increased risk of complications during pregnancy and delivery, including preterm birth. Teen pregnancy and childbirth can also have social and economic impacts on teen parents and their children, including disrupting educational completion for the parents and lower school achievement for the children. The drivers of teen pregnancy are multi-faceted and include poverty, history of adverse childhood events, and access to comprehensive education and health care services. Research studies have found that increased use of contraception as well as support for comprehensive sex education have helped lower the rate of teen births nationally.\nReflecting these increased risk factors, infants born to AIAN, Hispanic, Black, and NHPI women are at higher risk for mortality compared to those born to White women. Infant mortality is defined as the death of an infant within the first year of life, but most cases occur within the first month after birth. The primary causes of infant mortality are birth defects, preterm birth and low birthweight, sudden infant death syndrome, injuries, and maternal pregnancy complications. Infant mortality rates have declined over time although there was a slight increase between 2021 and 2022 (5.4 vs. 5.6 per 1,000 births, respectively). However, disparities in infant mortality have persisted and sometimes widened for over a century, particularly between Black and White infants. As of 2022, infants born to Black women are over twice as likely to die relative to those born to White women (10.9 vs. 4.5 per 1,000), and the mortality rate for infants born to AIAN and NHPI women (9.1 and 8.5 per 1,000) is nearly twice as high (Figure 5). The mortality rate for infants born to Hispanic mothers is similar to the rate for those born to White women (4.9 vs. 4.5 per 1,000), while infants born to Asian women have a lower mortality rate (3.5 per 1,000). Data also show that fetal death or stillbirths\u2014that is, pregnancy loss after 20-week gestation\u2014are more common among NHPI, Black and AIAN women compared to White and Hispanic women. Moreover, causes of stillbirth vary by race and ethnicity, with higher rates of stillbirth attributed to diabetes and maternal complications among Black women compared to White women.\nAbout one in five AIAN, Asian or Pacific Islander, and Black women report symptoms of perinatal depression compared to about one in ten White women (Figure 6). Hispanic women (12%) have similar rates of perinatal depression compared to their White counterparts (11%). Other research shows that the prevalence of postpartum depression has grown dramatically over the course of the past decade increasing from 9.4% in 2010 to 19.3% in 2021, driven by increases among Black and Asian and Pacific Islander women. Women of color experience increased barriers to mental health care and resources, along with racism, trauma and cultural barriers. Research suggests that perinatal mental health conditions are a leading underlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths and that individuals with perinatal depression are also at increased risk of chronic health complications such as hypertension and diabetes. Infants of mothers with depression are more likely to be hospitalized and die within the first year of life.\nFactors Driving Disparities in Maternal and Infant Health\nThe factors driving disparities in maternal and infant health are complex and multifactorial. They include differences in health insurance coverage and access to care. However, broader social and economic factors and structural and systemic racism and discrimination also play a major role (Figure 7). In maternal and infant health specifically, the intersection of race, gender, poverty, and other social factors shapes individuals\u2019 experiences and outcomes. Recently there has been broader recognition of the principles of reproductive justice, which emphasize the role that the social determinants of health and other factors play in reproductive health for communities of color. Notably, Hispanic women and infants fare similarly to their White counterparts on many measures of maternal and infant health despite experiencing increased access barriers and social and economic challenges typically associated with poorer health outcomes. Research suggests that this finding, sometimes referred to as the Hispanic or Latino health paradox, in part, stems from variation in outcomes among subgroups of Hispanic people by origin, nativity, and race, with better outcomes for some groups, particularly recent immigrants to the U.S. However, the findings still are not fully understood.\nDisparities in maternal and infant health, in part, reflect increased barriers to care for people of color. Research shows that coverage before, during, and after pregnancy facilitates access to care that supports healthy pregnancies, as well as positive maternal and infant outcomes after childbirth. Overall, people of color are more likely to be uninsured and face other barriers to care. Medicaid helps to fill these coverage gaps during pregnancy and for children, covering more than two-thirds of births to women who are Black or AIAN. However, AIAN, Hispanic, and Black people are at increased risk of being uninsured prior to their pregnancy, which can affect access to care before pregnancy and timely entry to prenatal care. Beyond health coverage, people of color face other increased barriers to care, including limited access to providers and hospitals and lack of access to culturally and linguistically appropriate care. Several areas of the country, particularly in the South have gaps in obstetrics providers. AIAN women also are more likely to live in communities with lower access to obstetric care. These challenges may be particularly pronounced in rural and medically underserved areas. For example, research suggests that closures of hospitals and obstetric units in rural areas has a disproportionate negative impact on Black infant health.\nResearch also highlights the role racism and discrimination play in driving racial disparities in maternal and infant health. Research has documented that social and economic factors, racism, and chronic stress contribute to poor maternal and infant health outcomes, including higher rates of perinatal depression and preterm birth among Black women and higher rates of mortality among Black infants. In recent years, research and news reports have raised attention to the effects of provider discrimination during pregnancy and delivery. News reporting and maternal mortality case reviews have called attention to a number of maternal and infant deaths and near misses among women of color where providers did not or were slow to listen to patients. A recent report determined that discrimination, defined as treating someone differently based on the class, group, or category they belong to due to biases, stereotypes, and prejudices, contributed to 30% of pregnancy-related deaths in 2020. In one study, Black and Hispanic women reported the highest rates of mistreatment (such as shouting and scolding, ignoring or refusing requests for help during the course of their pregnancy). Even controlling for insurance status, income, age, and severity of conditions, people of color are less likely to receive routine medical procedures and experience a lower quality of care. A 2023 KFF survey found that about one in five (21%) Black women say they have been treated unfairly by a health care provider or staff because of their racial or ethnic background. A similar share (22%) of Black women who have been pregnant or gave birth in the past ten years say they were refused pain medication they thought they needed.\nEfforts to Address Maternal and Infant Health Disparities\nIncreased awareness and attention to maternal and infant health have contributed to a rise in efforts and resources focused on improving health outcomes and reducing disparities. These include efforts to expand access to coverage and care, increase access to a broader array of services and providers that support maternal and infant health, diversify the health care workforce, and enhance data collection and reporting.\nSince the launch of the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis in 2022, there has been a variety of actions and investments across federal agencies to improve maternal health. The Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s Blueprint focuses on increasing coverage for perinatal services, improving data collection and analysis, expanding the maternity workforce, strengthening social supports, and improving patient-provider relations. Federal initiatives have included a pilot project with distribution of newborn supply kits, a $27.5 million program for specialized maternity care training to over 2,000 OB/GYNs, nurses, and other providers. In March 2024, the Biden Administration issued a new Executive Order to advance women\u2019s health research and innovation, including support to fund research to identify warning signs of maternal morbidity and mortality among Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) recipients. The Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs (IEA) and the March of Dimes have created a public-private partnership, Maternal Health Collaborative to Advance Racial Equity, to improve maternal health outcomes among Black mothers. Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration recently launched the Expanding Access to Women\u2019s Health grant program, which will provide funding to 14 states and the District of Columbia to address disparities in maternal health outcomes with an emphasis on improving access to reproductive and maternal health coverage and services.\nNearly all states have expanded access to Medicaid coverage during the postpartum period, helping to stabilize coverage. Medicaid covers four in ten births nationally. However, historically, many pregnant women lost coverage at the end of a 60-day postpartum coverage period because eligibility levels are lower for parents than pregnant women in many states, particularly those that have not implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion. The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021 initially provided states a new option to extend postpartum coverage to a full year beginning April 1, 2022. As of August 1, 2024, 47 states, including DC, had implemented a 12-month postpartum coverage extension, with additional states planning to implement the extension. KFF analysis suggests that the coverage extension could prevent hundreds of thousands of enrollees from losing coverage in the months after delivery. Additional actions to expand coverage may also help to reduce disparities, including adoption of the ACA Medicaid expansion in the ten remaining states that have not yet expanded, as nearly six in ten adults in the coverage gap in these states are adults of color, and Medicaid expansion promotes continuity of coverage in the prenatal and postpartum periods.\nIn addition, many state Medicaid programs have implemented policies, programs, and initiatives to improve maternity care and outcomes. This includes outreach and education to enrollees and providers about maternal health issues; expanding coverage for benefits such as doula care, home visits, and substance use disorder and mental health treatment; and using new payment, delivery, and performance measurement approaches. For example, Ohio\u2019s Comprehensive Maternal Care program aims to develop community connections and culturally aligned supports for women with Medicaid as they and their families navigate pre- and post-natal care. Participating obstetrical practices are required to measure and engage with patients and families to hear firsthand accounts of how access to care, cultural competence, and communication methods affect patient outcomes. Some states also are leveraging managed care contracts to require Medicaid plans to develop an explicit focus on reducing disparities related to maternal and child health .\nImplementation of evidence-based best practices may help to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. As part of its maternity care action plan, CMS has launched a \u201cBirthing-Friendly\u201d hospital designation to provide public information on hospitals that have implemented best practices in areas of health care quality, safety, and equity for pregnant and postpartum patients. Currently, more than 2,200 hospitals nationwide have received the \u201cBirthing Friendly\u201d designation, however, some argue that additional quality metrics and efforts are needed to improve the impact and utility of this designation. CMS is also proposing new baseline health and safety requirements for hospitals, including topics related to delivery of care in obstetric units, staffing, and annual training on evidence-based maternal health practice and cultural competencies. Moreover, in 2024, CMS has launched a new effort within its maternal and infant health initiative to focus on maternal mental health, substance use, and hypertension management.\nSome states include a focus on equity as part of their Maternal Mortality Review Committee (MMRC). Nearly all states have an MMRC that reviews pregnancy associated deaths and offers recommendations to prevent future deaths. However, state MMRCs vary in how they examine racial disparities, with some specifying identifying and addressing disparities as a key focus. Beginning in 2020, discrimination was added to the list of circumstances surrounding a pregnancy-related death that can be reported by MMRCs. For example, in California, each death is examined through a health equity lens and considerations include how social determinants of health, discrimination, and racism may have contributed to the death. Similarly, Vermont amended the charge of its committee in 2020 to include considerations of disparities and social determinants of health, including race and ethnicity in perinatal death reviews. States also vary in the membership of their committees, with some having requirements related to Tribes and doulas or midwives. Washington, Montana and Arizona are examples of states that have a Native or Tribal Government representative, while Oregon and Louisiana have doula representation, and Vermont and Pennsylvania have midwife representation on their MMRCs.\nA variety of efforts are underway to increase workforce diversity and expand access to doula services to improve maternal and infant health outcomes and reduce disparities. Studies have shown that a more diverse healthcare workforce and the use of midwives and doulas may improve birth outcomes. Midwives are an important component of the health care workforce, attending approximately one in ten births in 2021. Midwife-attended births are associated with fewer medical interventions, and there are efforts to grow and diversify the midwifery workforce to help improve maternal health outcomes and reduce mortality and morbidity.\nThe percent of maternal health physicians and registered nurses that are Hispanic or Black is lower than their share of the female population of childbearing age. The Biden Administration\u2019s Blueprint includes efforts by HRSA to provide scholarships to students from underrepresented communities in health professions and nursing schools to grow and diversify the maternal care workforce.\nExpanding access to doula services is another approach to increase diversity and expand the maternal health workforce. Doulas are trained non-clinicians who assist a pregnant person before, during and/or after childbirth by providing physical assistance, labor coaching, emotional support, and postpartum care. People who receive doula support have been found to have shorter labors and lower C-section rates, fewer birth complications, are more likely to initiate breastfeeding, and their infants are less likely to have low birth weights. The HHS FY2025 budget directs $5 million towards growing and diversifying the doula workforce and $5 million towards addressing emerging issues and social determinants of maternal health. Additionally, in recent years, there has been growing interest in expanding coverage of doula services through Medicaid. The MOMNIBUS is federal legislation that has been introduced to address maternal health disparities, and proposes to expand access to coverage of midwife and doula services. Some states are taking steps to include coverage through their state programs. As of early February 2024, 12 states reimburse services provided by doulas under Medicaid (CA, DC, FL, MD, MI, MN, NV, NJ, OK, OR, RI, VA), with two states, Louisiana and Rhode Island, also implementing private coverage of doula services. Some states also are seeking to increase access to these providers by providing patient education about these services, supporting training and credentialing of these providers, and raising reimbursement rates.\nSome states are seeking to improve access to culturally responsive maternal and childcare through community engagement and collaboration with community stakeholders. For example, as part of its Birth Equity Project, Washington held listening sessions with Black, immigrant, and Indigenous families and birth workers to understand the challenges to birth equity in the state. In 2021 and 2022, Utah conducted the Embrace Project Study to reduce disparities among NHPI women by providing culturally responsive health services, with a focus on mental health and self-care practices rooted in ancestral NHPI cultural traditions. California has a Black Infant Health Program that includes empowerment-focused group support services and client-centered life planning to improve the health and social conditions for Black women and their families. Arizona hosts a maternal and infant mortality summit which brings together stakeholders to discuss how to improve equity and a Tribal maternal task force that develops a Tribal maternal health strategic plan and provides training about maternal health and family wellness from an Indigenous perspective.\nA range of organizations are advocating for more interventions and support to address maternal mental health and substance use issues, major causes of pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity. Some studies have found higher rates of postpartum depression among some pregnant and postpartum women of color, but many mental health conditions are undiagnosed and untreated due to stigma and poor access to treatment. These issues also limit access to services for pregnant and postpartum people with substance use disorders. Additionally, some states have laws that take a punitive approach toward substance use during pregnancy, which may discourage some, particularly people of color, from seeking care. Community-based and provider organizations are calling for a number of policy and structural changes to address these challenges, including broader insurance coverage for behavioral health care, higher reimbursement for existing treatment services, greater education and awareness about screening for mental health and substance use conditions among health care providers and childbearing people. Federal initiatives in this area include the launch of the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline by HRSA to provide support, resources and referrals to new mothers and their families.\nLooking Ahead\nImproving maternal and infant health is key for preventing unnecessary illness and death and advancing overall population health. Healthy People 2030, which provides 10-year national health objectives, identifies the prevention of pregnancy complications and maternal deaths and improvement of women\u2019s health before, during, and after pregnancy as a public health goal. Further, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pathways to Prevention panel recently recommended a \u201cmaternal mortality moonshot\u201d with a goal of reducing preventable maternal mortality by 50% and eliminating racial disparities within the next 10 years.\nWhile there are a range of efforts underway to reduce disparities in maternal and infant health, state abortion bans and restrictions may exacerbate poor maternal and infant health outcomes and access to care. Since the Dobbs ruling in June 2022, about half of states have banned abortion or restricted it to early in pregnancy. People of color are disproportionately affected by these bans and restrictions as they are at higher risk for pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity, are more likely to obtain abortions, and more likely to face structural barriers that make it more difficult to travel out of state for an abortion. There are many documented cases of people being forced to continue pregnancies that are endangering their lives because they could not obtain abortion care, and the recent deaths of two pregnant women in Georgia were attributed directly to delays in pregnancy termination. State-level bans and restrictions criminalize clinicians who provide abortion care which also has cascading effects on other aspects of maternity care, and as a result some clinicians are choosing not to practice in these states, potentially widening existing clinician shortages. Research also suggests that rates of infant mortality have increased since the Dobbs ruling.\nThe outcome of the presidential election also could have important implications for disparities in maternal and infant health. While both candidates have taken actions focused on improving maternal health, former President Trump and Vice President Harris have widely differing records and proposals related to health coverage and health. Vice President Harris has been an outspoken advocate for eliminating maternal health disparities and promoting access to abortion and contraception services in addition to maternity care for all. Trump expresses his support for letting states set their own abortion policy, which can limit the availability of other related services, including maternity care."

Areas with no access to maternal care effect over 2.3 million women of reproductive age and 150,000 births in 2022. Our data confirms that women living in maternity care deserts and counties with low access to care have poorer health before pregnancy, receive less prenatal care, and experience higher rates of preterm birth. Our analysis revealed an excess of over 10,000 preterm births among those living in maternity care deserts and limited access counties in 2020-2022.

      "text": "FDA panel has cast doubt on whether antidepressants are safe in pregnancy. Here's what the science actually says.\nDecades of research show that SSRIs can be safely used during pregnancy. Meanwhile, untreated depression during pregnancy is associated with poor health outcomes like preterm birth and preeclampsia.\nAt a meeting held by the Food and Drug Administration on July 21, 2025, a panel convened by the agency cast doubt on the safety of antidepressant medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, in pregnancy.\nPanel members discussed adding a so-called black box warning to the drugs \u2014 which the agency uses to indicate severe or life-threatening side effects \u2014 about the risk they pose to developing fetuses. Some of the panelists who attended had a history of expressing deep skepticism on antidepressants.\nSSRIs include drugs like Prozac and Zoloft and are the most commonly used medicines for treating clinical depression. They are considered the first-line medications for treating depression in pregnancy, with approximately 5% to 6% of North American women taking an SSRI during pregnancy.\nWe are a psychologist certified in perinatal mental health and a reproductive psychiatrist and neuroscientist who studies female hormones and drug treatments for depression. We are concerned that many claims made at the meeting about the dangers of those drugs contradict decades of research evidence showing that antidepressant use during pregnancy is low risk when compared with the dangers of mental illness.\nAs clinicians, we have front-row seats to the maternal mental health crisis in the U.S. Mental illness, including suicide and overdose, is the leading cause of maternal deaths. Like all drugs, SSRIs carry both risks and benefits. But research shows that the benefits to pregnant patients outweigh the risks of the SSRIs, as well as the risks of untreated depression.\nThe panel did not address the safety of SSRIs following delivery, but numerous studies show that taking SSRI antidepressants while breastfeeding is low risk, usually producing low to undetectable drug levels in infants.\nRelated: 'Love hormone' oxytocin can pause pregnancy, animal study finds\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe biology of maternal brain health\nPregnancy and the months following childbirth are characterized by so many emotional, psychological and physical changes that the transition to motherhood has a specific name: matrescence. During matrescence, the brain changes rapidly as it prepares to efficiently take care of a baby.\nThe capacity for change within the brain is known as \"plasticity.\" Enhanced plasticity during pregnancy and the postpartum period is what allows the maternal brain to become better at attuning to and carrying out the tasks of motherhood. For example, research indicates that during this period, the brain is primed to respond to baby-related stimuli and improve a mother's ability to regulate her emotions. These brain shifts also act as a mental buffer against aging and stress in the long term.\nOn the flip side, these rapid brain changes, fueled by hormonal shifts, can make people especially vulnerable to the risk of mental illness during and after pregnancy. For women who have a prior history of depression, the risk is even greater.\nClinical depression interferes with brain plasticity, such that the brain becomes \"stuck\" in patterns of negative thoughts, emotions and behaviors.\nThis leads to impairment in brain functions that are essential to motherhood. New mothers with depression have decreased brain activity in regions responsible for motivation, regulation of emotion and problem-solving. They are often withdrawn or overprotective of their infants, and they struggle with the relentless effort needed for tasks that arise with child-rearing like soothing, feeding, stimulating, planning and anticipating the child's needs.\nResearch shows that SSRIs work by promoting brain plasticity. This in turn allows individuals to perceive the world more positively, increases the experience of gratification as a mother and facilitates cognitive flexibility for problem-solving.\nAssessing the risks of SSRIs in pregnancy\nPrescription drugs like SSRIs are just one aspect of treating pregnant women struggling with mental illness. Evidence-based psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, can also induce adaptive brain changes. But women with severe symptoms often require medication before they can reap the benefits of psychotherapy, and finding properly trained, accessible and affordable psychotherapists can be challenging. So sometimes, SSRIs may be the most appropriate treatment option available.\nMultiple studies have examined the effects of SSRIs on the developing fetus. Some data does show a link between these drugs and preterm birth, as well as low birth weight. However, depression during pregnancy is also linked to these effects, making it difficult to disentangle what's due to the drug and what's due to the illness.\nSSRIs are linked to a condition called neonatal adaption syndrome, in which infants are born jittery, irritable and with abnormal muscle tone. About one-third of infants born to mothers taking SSRIs experience it. However, research shows that it usually resolves within two weeks and does not have long-term health implications.\nThe FDA-convened panel heavily focused on potential risks of SSRI usage, with several individuals incorrectly asserting that these drugs cause autism in exposed youth, as well as birth defects. At least one panelist discussed clinical depression as a \"normal\" part of the \"emotional\" experience during pregnancy and following birth. This perpetuates a long history of of women being dismissed, ignored and not believed in medical care. It also discounts the rigorous assessment and criteria that medical professionals use to diagnose reproductive mental health disorders.\nA summary of the pivotal studies on SSRIs in pregnancy by the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Women's Health discusses how research has shown SSRIs to not be associated with miscarriage, birth defects or developmental conditions in children, including autism spectrum disorder.\nThe risks of untreated mental illness\nUntreated clinical depression in pregnancy has several known risks. As noted above, babies born to mothers with clinical depression have a higher risk of preterm birth and low birth weight.\nThey are also more likely to require neonatal intensive care and are at greater risk of behavioral problems and impaired cognition in childhood.\nWomen who are clinically depressed have an increased risk of developing preeclampsia \u2014 a condition involving high blood pressure that, if not identified and treated quickly, can be fatal to both mother and fetus. Just as concerning is the heightened risk of suicide in depression. Suicide accounts for about 8% of deaths in pregnancy and shortly after birth.\nCompared with these very serious risks, the risks of using SSRIs in pregnancy turn out to be minimal. While women used to be encouraged to stop taking SSRIs during pregnancy to avoid some of these risks, this is no longer recommended, as it exposes women to a high chance of depression relapse. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all perinatal mental health treatments, including SSRIs, continue to be available.\nMany women are already reluctant to take antidepressants during pregnancy, and given the choice, they tend to avoid it. From a psychological standpoint, exposing their fetus to the side effects of antidepressant medications is one of many common reasons for women in the U.S. to feel maternal guilt or shame. However, the available data suggests such guilt is not warranted.\nTaken together, the best thing one can do for pregnant women and their babies is not to avoid prescribing these drugs when needed, but to take every measure possible to promote health: optimal prenatal care, and the combination of medications with psychotherapy, as well as other evidence-based treatments such as bright light therapy, exercise and adequate nutrition.\nThe panel failed to address the latest neuroscience behind depression, how antidepressants work in the brain and the biological rationale for why doctors use them in the first place. Patients deserve education on what's happening in their brain, and how a drug like an SSRI might work to help.\nDepression during pregnancy and in the months following birth is a serious barrier to brain health for mothers. SSRIs are one way of promoting healthy brain changes so that mothers can thrive both short- and long-term.\nShould the FDA, as a result of this recent panel, decide to place a black-box warning on antidepressants in pregnancy, researchers like us already know from history what will happen. In 2004, the FDA placed a warning on antidepressants describing potential suicidal ideation and behavior in young people.\nIn the following years, antidepressant-prescribing decreased, while the consequences of mental illness increased. And it's easy to imagine a similar pattern in pregnant women.\nThis edited article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Texas\u2019 maternal mortality committee faces backlash for not reviewing deaths from first two years post-Dobbs\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nAt times speaking through tears, mothers, health care providers and community advocates implored Texas\u2019 maternal mortality committee to fully review deaths from the first two years since the state banned nearly all abortions.\nAt a public meeting Friday, members of the committee defended the decision to skip from 2021 to 2024 as a necessary step to offer more timely recommendations.\n\u201cI know that we've always talked about how we want to be as contemporary as possible,\u201d Nakeenya Wilson, a former member of the committee, testified. \u201cWhat I am concerned about is the fact that the two years that we were skipping are the most crucial years of reproductive health in this country's history.\u201d\nTexas banned most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy in September 2021, and in summer 2022, expanded that ban to all abortions from the moment of conception, except to save the life of the pregnant patient.\nThere have since been countless stories of doctors delaying or denying pregnancy care due to fear and confusion about how the law would be applied. At least three women have died, ProPublica has reported, due to delayed or mismanaged miscarriage care. Doctors found to have violated the law face up to life in prison, fines of at least $100,000 and the loss of their medical license.\nTexas\u2019 maternal mortality committee, responsible for reviewing maternal deaths and near-misses, has come under increased scrutiny since these laws went into effect. Some of the criticisms lay at the feet of the Legislature, which created the committee in 2013. The original statute prohibits the review of abortion-related deaths, a caveat that even committee members were not aware of until a few months ago.\nThe Legislature also allocated money last year with the intent of cutting Texas out of the federal maternal death tracking system, despite committee members\u2019 concerns. Lawmakers also expanded the committee, replacing the single community advocate position with two community member roles, one representing urban areas and one for rural areas.\nThis change pushed Wilson, a Black woman who experienced a traumatic birth, off the committee. She was replaced by two doctors; the rural position went to an anti-abortion OB/GYN from San Antonio.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nThe committee\u2019s last report, released in September, showed that maternal deaths surged in 2020 and 2021, even with COVID deaths excluded. Black women remain far more likely to die than anyone else, although every group except white women saw their odds of dying increase.\nThat same month, the committee announced its next report would look at deaths from 2024. The committee, which often works on a several year delay, has previously skipped certain years to try to catch up. At Friday\u2019s meeting, Dr. Carla Ortique, a Houston OB/GYN and committee chair, rejected the implication of political influence and said the fact that the committee was skipping the first two years of the abortion ban was a \u201ccoincidence.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no input from the executive or any other branch of our state government regarding our plans for cohort review,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is imperative that we become more contemporary in our review process.\u201d\nOrtique didn\u2019t discuss the recently reported Texas deaths, but did address the fallout from similar reporting in Georgia. After ProPublica reported on two pregnancy-related deaths the Georgia maternal mortality committee deemed preventable, the state dismissed all members of the committee.\nOrtique reminded members of Texas\u2019 committee that they signed confidentiality agreements, and said that \u201cregardless of personal belief and opinion,\u201d members must respect the integrity of the process.\n\u201cThe work that we do is for the greater good,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is critical that none of us act individually in a way that threatens the ability to continue the work assigned to this committee.\u201d\nShe also said the committee would be dropping its request that the state health agency not redact personal information from the files they review. The committee has long argued that the redaction process was an unnecessary delay since their work is confidential. Ortique attributed this change of position to a new feature in the state\u2019s data collection system that can automatically redact information more quickly.\nThese announcements were met with frustration from the community members who filled the room to testify. Judy Ward, of Richardson, north of Dallas, testified as a concerned citizen, and said there was a growing sense that the committee\u2019s work was becoming politicized.\n\u201cI suggest that this committee needs to bend over backwards to avoid such an interpretation,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease, don't be afraid to look at all the data and prove those of us who are skeptical of the motives of some of the committee members, prove us wrong.\u201d\nSerita Fontanesi, with the advocacy group United for Reproductive and Gender Equity, spoke as a Black woman preparing to start a family. She said she was worried about the high risk of maternal mortality or morbidity in Texas, and whether her doctors would be able to provide the full spectrum of care.\n\u201cFurthermore, should I or my child not make it, I am not confident that my state and this committee would do their due diligence to ensure that it doesn\u2019t happen to someone else, to investigate what went wrong,\u201d she said.\nShe urged the committee to rethink their decision to not fully review the 2022 and 2023 deaths.\n\u201cToo many birthing people and their children whose lives were lost, perhaps for preventable reasons, will go unheard, unseen, unremembered,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir deaths will be in vain.\u201d\nInformation about the authors\nLearn about The Texas Tribune\u2019s policies, including our partnership with The Trust Project to increase transparency in news."

Increases occurred across all maternal ages, race and Hispanic-origin groups, and educational levels shown in this report. Women under age 20 and those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher were the least likely to have obesity; however, these groups had greater percentage increases in prepregnancy obesity from 2016 through 2019 than women aged 20 and over and women with less education.\nPrepregnancy obesity increased in all states but Vermont in 2019 compared with 2016; increases ranged from 4% to 22%. The lowest level in 2019 was seen in D.C.; the highest in Mississippi.\nDefinitions\nBody mass index (BMI): Measure of body fat based on height and weight and calculated as\nkg/m2 (703 \u2219 lbs/in2). BMI values under 18.5 were classified as underweight; those from 18.5 to 24.9 were classified as normal or healthy weight; values from 25.0 to 29.9 were classified as overweight; and values of 30.0 and over were classified as obese.\nEducational attainment: The highest degree or level of school completed by the mother at the time of birth. The education categories are 8th grade or less; 9th through 12th grade, with no diploma; high school graduate or GED completed; some college, but no degree; associate\u2019s degree; bachelor\u2019s degree; master\u2019s degree; and doctorate or other professional degree.\nPrepregnancy weight and height: Mother\u2019s weight immediately before pregnancy was reported by the mother via the question, \u201cWhat was your prepregnancy weight, that is, your weight immediately before you became pregnant with this child?\u201d Mother\u2019s height also was reported by the mother via the question, \u201cWhat is your height?\u201d\nData source and methods\nThis report is based on data from the Natality Data Files from the National Vital Statistics System. The vital statistics\u2019 natality file is created from birth certificates and includes information for all births occurring in the United States. The natality files include information on a wide range of maternal and infant demographic and health characteristics for babies born in the United States.\nRace and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the birth certificate. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. Persons of non-Hispanic ancestry are further classified by race. Race categories are based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget standards. Single race is defined as only one race reported on the birth certificate.\nReferences to differences in prepregnancy obesity percentages between groups mean that the difference is statistically significant at the 0.05 level based on a two-tailed z test. References to increasing trends are statistically significant at the 0.05 level and were assessed using the Cochran\u2013Armitage test for trends, a modified chi-squared test.\nAnalyses of educational attainment were limited to women aged 25 and over.\nAbout the authors\nAnne K.

National birth certificate data on the principal source of payment for the delivery became available in 2016, when all states implemented the 2003 U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. This certificate provides information on payment through private insurance; Medicaid; CHAMPUS, TRICARE, and other types of government insurance; and self-pay, which has been shown to reflect the uninsured status of the mother at the time of delivery (2). This report describes the principal source of payment for the delivery in 2021 overall and by maternal race and Hispanic origin, age, and education.\nKeywords: Race and Hispanic origin, educational attainment, National Vital Statistics System\nPrivate insurance and Medicaid were the largest sources of payment for the delivery in 2021.\n- Private insurance was the most common principal source of payment for the delivery in 2021 (51.7%), providing coverage for more than one-half of mothers giving birth in the United States (Figure 1).\n- More than two out of five mothers who gave birth in 2021 had Medicaid as the principal source of payment for the delivery (41.0%).\n- The percentage of mothers covered by other payment sources was 3.4%, while 3.9% of mothers self-paid for the delivery.\nFigure 1.

The remaining 3.9% were \u201cself-pay\u201d and likely to be uninsured at the time of delivery. This distribution has essentially remained the same since 2016, when data on the principal source of payment for the delivery became available (3\u20136). Private insurance was the most common primary source of payment for American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White mothers, and for mothers aged 25 and over and those with higher levels of educational attainment. Medicaid was the most common primary source of payment for Black and Hispanic mothers, mothers under age 25, and those with lower levels of educational attainment. Nearly 4% of mothers self-paid for their delivery, with the highest rates among mothers with less than a high school education and Hispanic and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander mothers. Mothers who self-pay for their delivery are more likely to receive late or no prenatal care than women with some source of healthcare coverage (1). Healthcare coverage provides the services needed to maximize the likelihood of a healthy pregnancy and baby (7).\nDefinitions\nEducational attainment: The highest degree or level of school completed by the mother at the time of birth. The education categories are: less than high school, high school graduate or GED completed, some college credit but no degree, associate degree, and bachelor\u2019s degree or higher.\nPrincipal source of payment for the delivery: The principal form of payment for the delivery at the time of delivery. Four options for source of payment at delivery are identified in a checkbox format on the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth: 1) private insurance, 2) Medicaid, 3) self-pay, and 4) other.\n- Private insurance: Providers such as Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna.\n- Medicaid: Includes state programs comparable with Medicaid.\n- Self-pay: No third-party payer identified; generally considered uninsured.\n- Other: Includes Indian Health Service, TRICARE (formerly known as CHAMPUS), other government programs, and miscellaneous payment sources.\nData source and methods\nThis report uses data from the Natality data file from the National Vital Statistics System. The vital statistics natality file is based on information from birth certificates and includes information for all births occurring in the United States (8). The race and Hispanic-origin groups shown in this report follow the 1997 Office of Management and Budget standards and differ from the bridged-race categories in reports before 2016 (8). These groups are the six largest race and Hispanic-origin groups (Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native non-Hispanic, Asian non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander non-Hispanic, and White non-Hispanic). Analyses of educational attainment were limited to women aged 25 and over. References to differences in percentages indicate differences are statistically significant at the 0.05 level based on a two-tailed z test. References to decreasing or increasing trends are statistically significant at the 0.05 level and assessed using the Cochran\u2013Armitage test for trends, a modified chi-squared test. Computations exclude records for which information is unknown.\nAbout the authors\nClaudia P. Valenzuela and Michelle J.K.

      "text": "8 babies spared from potentially deadly inherited diseases through new IVF 'mitochondrial donation' trial\nA groundbreaking trial in the U.K. has released data on eight babies born through a special IVF procedure to lower their risk of mitochondrial DNA disease.\nMitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, contain their own special DNA that gets passed from mother to child \u2014 but that DNA can sometimes carry mutations, causing diseases for which there are currently no cures.\nNow, in a new clinical trial, eight babies who had a high risk of inheriting such diseases from their moms appear to have been spared, thanks to an emerging technique called \"mitochondrial donation.\"\nThe approach used in the trial has been in development for many years and is only just making its way into human patients. Early attempts at mitochondrial donation were first described in mouse experiments published in the 1980s, said study co-author Mary Herbert, a professor of reproductive biology at Monash University in Melbourne.\nAfter that came studies in human embryos that were fertilized through in vitro fertilization (IVF) but unfit for use, so they were instead donated for research. Then, world-first legislation passed in the United Kingdom in 2015 enabled research with good-quality human embryos, which was necessary to show the technique could actually result in a viable pregnancy. Since then, scientists have refined the approach for transferring healthy mitochondria into embryos, troubleshooting the many problems that arose along the way.\n\"There were hurdles at every stage,\" said Herbert, who also holds appointments at Newcastle University and the Newcastle Fertility Centre in the U.K. Now, the trial results, described in two reports published Wednesday (July 16) in The New England Journal of Medicine, may offer a solution to parents who otherwise have a very high likelihood of passing these diseases to their kids.\n\"It's just such a burden that goes down through the generations of women in these families,\" Herbert said. \"It really is gratifying to be able to do something, to offer some kind of way out.\"\nRelated: 8-year-old with rare, fatal disease shows dramatic improvement on experimental treatment\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\"This has brought joy and relief to the parents\"\nInherited mitochondrial diseases, estimated to affect about 1 in 5,000 births, can cause a wide range of symptoms, including seizures, muscle weakness, fatigue, vision loss, heart disease, developmental delay and learning disabilities. These symptoms can range from mild and manageable to severe and life-threatening, with more serious presentations typically arising shortly after birth.\nAlthough it's known that the mutations behind these diseases are inherited from mom, their transfer from parent to offspring is still somewhat unpredictable. That's because, in a given egg, the \"mutational load\" can vary \u2014 some eggs carry mitochondrial DNA with few to no harmful mutations, while others carry mitochondria with only mutated DNA.\nIf affected parents conceive without the help of reproductive technologies, \"they might have a child who's perfectly healthy or a child who dies in the first few days of life, essentially,\" Herbert said.\nMoms-to-be who carry a mix of high-load and low-load eggs have the option to handpick eggs with low loads using preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), a technique paired with IVF. However, \"the ones who are not suitable for PGT are people who have very high mutation loads in all their eggs \u2014 sometimes 100% mutation loads,\" Herbert explained.\nThese patients, who aren't necessarily super sick themselves but would likely pass on concerning mutations, are the ones who could benefit from mitochondrial donation.\nIn the trial, researchers directly compared the PGT approach to mitochondrial donation. All the participants carried disease-causing mitochondrial DNA mutations, and they all underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a form of IVF in which a single sperm cell is injected straight into an egg to trigger fertilization. Patients with low enough mutational loads in some of their eggs were offered PGT, while those whose mutational loads were too high were offered mitochondrial donation.\nThe donation itself could be done a few different ways, but in the trial, the researchers used \"pronuclear transfer,\" in which an egg is fertilized before having its nucleus removed and placed in a different, donated egg cell. The donated egg had been screened for known mitochondrial mutations and also had its own nucleus removed. As such, the resulting embryo carries the nuclear DNA from the egg and sperm used for fertilization, as well as mitochondrial DNA from the donor egg.\nUltimately, 16 of 39 patients given PGT became pregnant, resulting in 18 babies born (including some twins). By comparison, 8 of 22 patients who received mitochondrial donation got pregnant, resulting in the birth of eight babies, so far, as there's one pregnancy still ongoing. Both techniques resulted in a similar proportion of pregnancies out of the total people treated.\n\"This process has brought joy and relief to the parents of these children, who thought they were never going to be able to have children without the risk of mitochondrial disease,\" said study co-author Dr. Bobby McFarland, a professor of pediatric mitochondrial medicine and honorary consultant pediatric neurologist at Newcastle University.\n\"To be part of the team effort to make that happen has been very special indeed,\" he told Live Science in an email.\nRelated: In a 1st, child treated for rare, often-fatal disorder while still in the womb\nRefining the technique even further\nAll the babies conceived through mitochondrial donation were born healthy and are meeting their developmental milestones, the team reported.\n\"We are now proud parents to a healthy baby \u2014 a true mitochondrial replacement success,\" one mother to a baby boy said in a statement. \"This breakthrough has lifted the heavy cloud of fear that once loomed over us.\"\nThe children's health will continue to be monitored closely going forward. \"We have cast a wide net for clinical health data reporting on these children and also included a detailed developmental assessment at 18 months,\" McFarland said. \"We are in the process of amending the study to look for more subtle developmental problems at 5 years.\"\nNotably, the pronuclear transfer procedure doesn't guarantee that every last scrap of mitochondrial DNA in the baby will be from the donor egg. That's because, in the process of moving the nucleus from one egg to another, some small amount of mom's mitochondrial DNA can be carried over with the nucleus, Herbert explained.\nIn the eight babies born so far, some had undetectable levels of maternal mitochondrial DNA in their blood cells while others have a detectable amount, but the concentration is below that which would be expected to cause disease. However, the team will need to watch to see if that mutation-carrying DNA becomes more plentiful over time, Herbert said.\n\"We have to view these technologies as risk reduction; we cannot guarantee prevention,\" she said, emphasizing that parents are informed of this limitation prior to the procedure and counseled about all their options. Looking forward, the scientists hope to refine the technique to reduce the risk of that carry-over as much as possible, while also making the process more efficient and easy to reproduce.\n\"Long-term monitoring of the children is essential,\" said Dr. Paula Amato, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) and past president American Society for Reproductive Medicine. \"But it is reassuring that they appear healthy at the time of birth,\" she told Live Science in an email. She added that she'll be interested to see how the risk of maternal DNA carry-over could be mitigated in the future.\nAlthough the two groups of parents in the trial differed from one another, especially in terms of their mutational loads, it was good to compare the groups directly, Robin Lovell\u2011Badge, a principal group leader at the Francis Crick Institute in the U.K., wrote in an accompanying commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\"Having the group that underwent PGT as the comparison group strengthens the conclusion that pronuclear transfer is a valid method to reduce the risk of mtDNA [mitochondrial DNA] disease,\" he wrote. \"The articles, which were hotly anticipated, show a (cautiously) good outcome and are well worth the wait,\" he added.\nResearch into mitochondrial donation will continue in the U.K., as well as in Australia, which passed similar regulations to the U.K. in 2022 to enable such studies, Herbert noted. McFarland added of the current trial that \"this is still a relatively small number of babies so we do need to follow up more and for longer.\"\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration does not currently allow clinical research into these types of \"mitochondrial replacement techniques\" in humans, in part due to long-standing regulations passed by Congress.\n\"From a policy perspective,\" Amato said, \"it is unfortunate that similar clinical studies are currently not allowed in the U.S. because of the FDA rider that prohibits the FDA from considering clinical trials that involve genetic modification of a human embryo.\" Additionally, the Dickey-Wicker amendment \"prohibits federal funding for studies involving human embryo research,\" she said.\nShe noted that these restrictions are especially unfortunate given pioneering work done by Shoukhrat Mitalipov and other OHSU scientists helped to spur the field of mitochondrial replacement therapy. \"Perhaps this represents an opportunity for U.S. patients to demand access to these experimental therapies,\" she suggested, \"by pressuring lawmakers to reconsider and make changes to the current legislation.\"\nEditor's note: This story was updated on July 17, 2025, to add comments from Dr. Paula Amato.\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\nNicoletta Lanese is the health channel editor at Live Science and was previously a news editor and staff writer at the site.

The doctor stitched me back up and gave me a 50 cent coin. His kindness and care sparked my first interest in medicine,\u201d says Dr. Rainford, who grew up in Jamaica. \u201cI also had a female pediatrician who had a positive influence on me.\u201d\nIn medical school, Dr. Rainford says she was 99% sure she would specialize in pediatrics\u2014until she did a rotation in Ob/Gyn and assisted in a delivery. \u201cI remember all the love and emotion and happiness. It was so powerful, and I was sold,\u201d she says.\nDr. Rainford provides general Ob/Gyn care and one of her goals is eliminating health disparities for African American women.

      "text": "Jeanne A. Conry, MD, PhD\nGreetings. I am Jeanne Conry, MD, PhD, and I have devoted my career to improving the health and well-being of women. As an obstetrician gynecologist, I have been fortunate to share in the most intimate moments of a woman\u2019s life, whether that might be giving birth, losing a life, facing cancer, or facing a loss of a loved one. Women seek guidance from their health care providers, and we seek to help. But sometimes that help is not enough. Sometimes both questions and answers are complex - and that is what led to my interest in environmental exposures.\nIn 2006, I received a simple phone call: Do women need to worry about lead levels in their lipstick? WHAT?! Who knew there was lead in lipstick? Has it been studied, why is there a need, and who can address the need. WHY is there lead in lipstick. And, if a physician cannot speak to these needs, who can?\nI realized THEN that women needed guidance and health care providers were not ready to guide. There exists an awareness gap, a knowledge gap and a research gap. I also realized that our ability to advocate for what is right has been impacted by legislative and regulatory processes. It is not enough to advise a patient about what is right, it is as important to change what is wrong.\nEHLF is here to assist health care providers through education and advocacy. We recognize that by empowering regional leaders we will see global health policy change.\nIn October 2018, Dr. Jeanne Conry was voted President-elect of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), an organization that was founded in Geneva, Switzerland in 1954 and now represents 130 organizations globally.\nJeanne Conry, MD, PhD was the 64th President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a membership organization representing over 57,000 practicing obstetricians and gynecologists.\nShe has led guideline development and national policy on the important role of Reproductive Health and the Environment. She is leading the Women's Preventive Services Initiative, a national collaboration to define and implement optimum women's health services across their lifespan.\nShe has led efforts on Quality and Safety in Maternity Care through improved standards and responses in high risk obstetrics. For twenty-eight years, Dr. Conry was a practicing obstetrician gynecologist at Kaiser Permanente, the largest health maintenance organization in the United States.\nShe served in a leadership capacity as the Assistant Physician-in-Chief for Kaiser Permanente's Sacramento Roseville region. She developed the Women and Children's Center, the largest obstetric delivery service in KP.\nDr. Conry earned her medical degree from the University of California, Davis, where she also completed her residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology. She served as an Associate Clinical Professor at the University of California, Davis. She earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in biology from the University of Colorado.\n2017- PRESENT\nPresident-elect: The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)\nCEO: Environmental Health Leadership Foundation: Consultant to global organizations for implementation of clinical guidance regarding the impact of the environment on health\nConsultant to The Forum Institute: Pregnancy to Infancy Program\nChair: The Women\u2019s Preventive Services Initiative.

      "text": "Georgia recently relaunched its maternal mortality review committee after dismissing all 32 of its members last year. But state officials won\u2019t say who the current members are.\nThe dismissals were in response to ProPublica obtaining internal reports in which the committee detailed the \u201cpreventable\u201d deaths of two women who were unable to obtain legal abortions or timely care after Georgia banned abortion.\nIn September, ProPublica published stories on the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller. They were the first reported cases of women who died without access to care restricted by a state abortion ban. Before those stories, the state Department of Public Health had released the names of committee members to ProPublica. Now it\u2019s saying that releasing the names would be a violation of state law.\nThe law states that the work of the committee is confidential and that some records and reports obtained and created by the committee are not covered by public records laws. The law does not state that committee members\u2019 identities are confidential. However, Department of Public Health spokesperson Nancy Nydam said the department\u2019s review of the law \u201cdetermined that the broad confidentiality protections directed toward the committee should be extended to the identities of the committee members.\u201d She did not respond to questions about why the department could share committee members\u2019 names in August but not now.\nThe newly appointed committee, which reviews maternal deaths and makes recommendations to improve care for pregnant women, held its first meeting Feb. 21.\nIf the public doesn\u2019t know who is on a committee, it could create mistrust of its findings, said Elizabeth Dawes, director of maternal and reproductive health at the Century Foundation, a public-policy nonprofit. She has been an advocate for Black mothers, who die from causes related to pregnancy or birth at higher rates than other groups.\n\u201cIf everything is confidential, there\u2019s no way to really be able to trust what comes out of it,\u201d Dawes said. \u201cThey could completely ignore abortion. They could completely ignore race, racism, discrimination, and say what they want to say.\u201d\nDawes said those questions are particularly important in Georgia. The state has one of the nation\u2019s highest rates of maternal death, especially among Black women, who die at twice the rate of white women.\nThe stories of Thurman and Miller sparked widespread outrage about the effects of abortion bans; Georgia law bans the procedure after six weeks.\nThurman, who traveled to North Carolina and obtained abortion pills, died from sepsis after doctors in Georgia delayed the removal of infected tissue that remained in her uterus. Her case, and others identified in Georgia and Texas, show the dangers women face in states that force hospitals and doctors to weigh criminal laws against abortion before providing care.\nLess than two months after ProPublica published the stories, the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health, Dr. Kathleen Toomey, sent a Nov. 8 letter to all members of the committee stating that information had been inappropriately shared with an outside source.\n\u201cEven though this disclosure was investigated, the investigation was unable to uncover which individual(s) disclosed confidential information,\u201d Toomey wrote. \u201cTherefore, effective immediately the current MMRC is disbanded, and all member seats will be filled through a new application process.\u201d\nThat application process ended earlier this year. The Department of Public Health denied ProPublica\u2019s Open Records Act request for the names of new members on Feb. 27, three weeks after the request was made. In a response, a staff member said 30 people had been appointed to the board and attached language from a letter inviting new members to the committee\u2019s first meeting on Feb. 21.\nAll 50 states, as well as other localities, have maternal mortality review committees. They examine the deaths of pregnant women and new mothers to identify gaps in care and provide recommendations to improve treatment. ProPublica recently found that the names of committee members in 18 states with abortion restrictions were publicly available, or accessible through a public records request.\nRecently, some states have come under fire for allegedly politicizing the work of these committees.\nThe maternal mortality review committee in Idaho was allowed to go dormant in 2023 after conservative groups attacked its recommendation to expand Medicaid for postpartum women. The state has since revived the committee as an advisory body to the State Board of Medicine.\nAlso in 2023, Texas lawmakers changed the composition of the state\u2019s committee more than a year after a member spoke out about a delay in releasing a report. She lost her seat. Officials later appointed an anti-abortion obstetrician, Dr. Ingrid Skop, to the group. The Texas MMRC is also not reviewing deaths from 2022 or 2023, a period covering the first year and a half after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\nIn the letter last year dismissing the members of Georgia\u2019s committee, Toomey wrote that the shake-up of the board would not delay its work. Nydam said in February that Department of Public Health staff members have continued their work while the committee has been inactive.\n\u201cThe work of the MMRC has not stopped,\u201d Nydam wrote in an email. \u201cIt has continued with our staff doing case abstractions, which they do regardless, before the cases go to the MMRC.\u201d\nHowever, a person familiar with the committee\u2019s work, who because of her continuing work with the Department of Public Health asked not to be named, said the full committee usually met every other month. Subcommittees met even more frequently to review cases.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way there\u2019s not going to be a delay unless they are going to meet every week,\u201d she said.\nThe Georgia MMRC was beginning to identify deaths from 2023 when all members were dismissed.\nKavitha Surana and Cassandra Jamarillo contributed reporting. Mariam Elba contributed research."

      "text": "Abstract\nWe aimed to evaluate the association between obesity and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) after cesarean delivery (CD). This was a retrospective cohort study using a multicenter database of 20 hospitals in the United States. We analyzed 27,708 patients undergoing CD from 2015 to 2019. The exposure of interest was BMI, and the primary outcome was PPH (estimated blood loss [EBL] \u2265 1000 mL). Simple logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between obesity and intrapartum complications. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for any confounding demographic variables. Hosmer and Lemeshow\u2019s purposeful selection algorithm was adapted to develop a multivariable logistic regression model of PPH. Analyses were conducted using STATA 16.1 (College Station, Texas) with p \u2264 0.05 considered significant. BMI exerted a significant effect on the frequency of PPH (p = 0.004). Compared to patients with BMI 18.5\u201324.9 kg/m2, patients with BMI between 25 and 59.9 kg/m2 had an increased odds of PPH. The odds of PPH in patients with BMI > 60 kg/m2 was not increased compared to patients with BMI 18.5\u201324.9 kg/m2. Obesity was associated with a decreased odds of blood transfusion (aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55\u20130.97). In conclusion, higher BMI was associated with PPH yet a lower odds of transfusion after CD.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nObesity (defined as body mass index [BMI] \u2265 30 kg/m2) is one of the most common pregnancy complications, affecting more than one-third of women of reproductive age1,2. In addition, the prevalence of obesity and severe obesity (BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater) is increasing in the United States2. Obesity has been associated with multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss, gestational diabetes, venous thromboembolism, and increased risk for cesarean delivery (CD)3,4,5,6.\nPostpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide, accounting for more than 80 thousand maternal deaths in 20157. Obesity has been considered to be a potential risk factor for PPH for physiologic reasons; animal models have demonstrated a decreased ability to maintain blood pressure in response to hemorrhage among rats with obesity8. Obesity is also associated with other factors that increase the risk of blood loss, including CD and surgical tissue injury3,9. However, others have hypothesized that the pro-inflammatory and relative hypercoagulable state found in patients with obesity may actually be protective against increased blood loss10. While obesity is often cited as a risk factor for uterine atony and PPH, the obstetric literature is mixed in regard to the effect of BMI on PPH11,12. In a large cohort in Sweden, the risk of atonic PPH increased with increasing BMI regardless of mode of delivery, with a twofold increased risk of PPH in patients with class III obesity13. In contrast, one retrospective cohort study in California reported a decreased odds of severe hemorrhage after CD9. Furthermore, in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of studies including patients who developed atonic PPH, obesity was not found to be associated with atonic PPH14.\nThe primary objective of our study was to determine if obesity is associated with an increased odds of PPH or hemorrhage-related complications (including blood transfusion) during delivery. To eliminate the potential confounding effect of mode of delivery and its associated variables on PPH, only women undergoing CD were eligible for inclusion in this study. To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter retrospective cohort study specifically examining the effect of obesity on PPH after CD.\nMaterials and methods\nData were obtained from a multicenter database of women admitted to labor and delivery units from 2015 to 2019 in the Universal Health Services (UHS) system in the United States. All patients who underwent CD during their admission were eligible for inclusion in this study (N = 38,334). A total of 8252 patients were excluded from analysis due to missing data for BMI at time of delivery as this was the exposure of interest. Of those excluded for missing BMI at delivery, approximately 65% were missing data for \u2265 60% of analysis-relevant variables. An additional 2374 patients in the dataset with vacuum- or forceps-assisted delivery were also excluded to ensure that patients who had a vaginal delivery were not included in the analysis. A total of 27,708 patients were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. CD were reported by 20 hospitals across the Eastern (N = 5; 18.2%), Western (N = 7; 48%), and Central (N = 8; 33.8%) United States. The requirement for informed consent was waived by The George Washington University Committee on Human Research Institutional Review Board due to the retrospective nature of the study, and all data were de-identified prior to analysis. The study was determined to be research that is exempt from IRB review by The George Washington University Committee on Human Research Institutional Review Board under Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulatory category 4 (IRB number NCR203136). All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. No experimental protocols were performed as this was a retrospective study.\nThe main exposure of interest was BMI at time of delivery. BMI at delivery was sorted into six categories (BMI below 18.5, 18.5 to 24.9, 25.0 to 29.9, 30.0 to 34.9, 35.0 to 39.9, and above 40) according to guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization1,15, of which 5 were employed for descriptive and demographic analysis (Table 1). In the primary analysis, maternal BMI was treated as a dichotomous categorical variable to evaluate obesity (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2). The primary outcome was PPH, defined as EBL \u2265 1000 mL for the purpose of analysis. Additional outcomes such as estimated gestational age (EGA) less than 37 weeks, intrapartum complications including pre-eclampsia and chorioamnionitis, abnormal hematologic parameters including thrombocytopenia, and pharmacologic interventions including oxytocin use were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Descriptive statistics included counts, proportions, means, and standard deviations calculated as necessary using standard definitions. To evaluate the association between BMI classification and other patient-level variables, we used chi-square or Fischer\u2019s exact test (when N \u2264 5) for categorical variables and analysis of variance for continuous variables16.\nWe employed simple logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between obesity and intrapartum complications, including PPH. We used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for any confounding demographic characteristics that were associated with obesity at the 0.1 alpha level. To determine the demographic and intrapartum variables most associated with PPH, we adapted Hosmer and Lemeshow\u2019s purposeful selection algorithm to develop a multivariable logistic regression model of PPH17,18. Candidate variables were screened with simple logistic regression, using the Wald test and a p-value cutoff of \u2264 0.25 to exclude variables from consideration. During the iterative process of variable selection, covariates were sequentially removed from the model if they were not significant at the 0.1 alpha level and did not exert a confounding influence. We tested for multicollinearity between covariates by determining the variance inflation factor. A literature review was also used to support the choice of covariates as potential confounders influencing the odds of PPH19,20,21,22,23.\nEBL was not reported for 1918 deliveries (6.92%), maternal age was not reported for 227 deliveries (0.82%), and EGA was not reported for 451 deliveries (1.63%), with approximately 9% of deliveries missing any combination of these variables. Because these data could not be assumed to be missing completely at random, we treated them as missing at random and employed multiple imputation by chained equations with 10 total imputations to account for statistical uncertainty while addressing missing data24. Missing data were also observed for race/ethnicity, marital status, insurance type, and parity. Missing data from these variables were included in the multivariable models as dummy variables. All analyses were conducted using STATA 16.1 (College Station, Texas) with p \u2264 0.05 considered significant.\nResults\nOur cohort included 27,708 CD from 20 hospitals in the Universal Health Services (UHS) system across the United States. The majority of patients included in our study were White (55.0%) and between ages 20 and 34 years (75.5%); 49.1 percent were married. A large proportion of the patients in our cohort had private insurance (42.4%) and delivered at hospitals in the West Coast (48.0%). The majority of patients (79.9%) had no prior CD. We compared demographic and medical characteristics across 5 BMI categories, with several differences noted between groups. The prevalence of asthma, pre-gestational diabetes, and chronic hypertension increased as BMI increased between groups (p < 0.001 for all) (Table 1).\nConcerning our primary outcome of interest, obesity in its dichotomized form (defined as BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2) did not significantly influence the odds of EBL \u2265 1000 mL. Increasing BMI category was, however, associated with EBL \u2265 1000 mL (p < 0.001) (Table 2). While categorical obesity did not influence the odds of EBL \u2265 1000 mL, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to gauge the extent to which the extremes of BMI, relative to BMI 18.5\u201324.9 kg/m2, influence the odds of EBL \u2265 1000 mL in this population. The odds of EBL \u2265 1000 mL increased with BMI between 25 and 59.9 kg/m2 relative to that observed in patients with BMI 18.5\u201324.9 kg/m2 in a multivariable model (p = 0.004). The greatest odds of EBL \u2265 1000 mL was observed among patients with BMI 50\u201359.9 kg/m2 (aOR 1.69 [1.28\u20132.21]), relative to patients with BMI 18.5\u201324.9 kg/m2 (Table 3). Additional variables that were associated with an increased odds of PPH included age greater than 35 years (aOR 1.12 [1.02\u20131.23]), history of PPH (aOR 1.80 [1.43\u20132.27]), and general anesthesia (aOR 1.87 [1.53\u20132.28]). Delivering on the West Coast was associated with significantly lower odds of PPH (aOR 0.62 [0.57\u20130.68]) (Table 3).\nWe found significant associations between BMI category and the frequency of secondary maternal outcomes in our cohort including pre-eclampsia (p < 0.001), gestational diabetes (p < 0.001), and any antibiotic use (p = 0.001) (Table 4). Considering secondary neonatal outcomes, BMI category was significantly associated with preterm delivery (p < 0.001) and NICU admission (p < 0.001) (Table 5). Categorical obesity was associated with increased odds of pre-eclampsia (aOR 1.92 [1.63\u20132.26]). Obesity was associated with decreased odds of preterm delivery at less than 37 weeks gestation (aOR 0.74 [0.69\u20130.80]), HELLP (aOR 0.30 [0.13\u20130.69]) and intrapartum placental abruption (aOR 0.67 [0.53\u20130.84]). Among patients with obesity, we observed an increased odds of oxytocin (aOR 1.26 [1.14\u20131.39]), dinoprostone (aOR 1.52 [1.37\u20131.68]), misoprostol (aOR 1.44 [1.30\u20131.59]), and magnesium sulfate usage (aOR 1.14 [1.02\u20131.26]). We observed a decreased odds of blood transfusion among patients with obesity (aOR 0.73 [0.55\u20130.97]) (Table 6).\nDiscussion\nIn our cohort of 27,708 CD across the United States, we observed an association between increasing BMI and EBL \u2265 1000 mL after adjusting for maternal demographic characteristics known to be associated with PPH. The observation that further discretized BMI was associated with increased odds of EBL \u2265 1000 mL while categorical obesity was not suggests that the BMI cutoff of \u2265 30 kg/m2 BMI to define obese versus non-obese is not itself predictive of PPH. We found an association between obesity and other intrapartum complications, including pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. Despite an increased odds of EBL \u2265 1000 mL, we found a decreased odds of blood transfusion in patients with obesity after CD.\nOur findings contrast with prior work investigating the relationship between obesity and PPH. Butwick et al. conducted a large population-based cohort study that found an increased odds of hemorrhage after vaginal delivery and decreased odds of hemorrhage after CD for women with obesity; however, the effect was small and without strong evidence of a dose\u2013response relationship between BMI and PPH9. In addition, the absolute event rate for PPH was 2.8%, which was lower than the frequency observed in our cohort (11.9%)9. Paglia et al. found a reduced risk of severe PPH among women with obesity after controlling for mode of delivery; of note, this was a case\u2013control study of women with PPH who received blood components, indicating severe hemorrhage11. Our study focused on EBL \u2265 1000 mL, which may or may not have clinical effects.\nInterestingly, despite an increased odds of PPH, we observed a decreased odds of blood transfusion among women with obesity. This finding implies that the increased blood loss we observed in patients with obesity may lack clinical relevance, and is consistent with prior work demonstrating greater blood volume and hemoglobin mass in individuals with obesity25. This finding also lends support to the notion that estimated blood loss is an unreliable indicator of clinically significant hemorrhage, and variation exists among hospitals in the use of quantitative over estimated blood loss. One formula devised for estimating allowable blood loss prior to transfusion includes allowable blood loss as directly proportional to the patient\u2019s estimated blood volume, implying that patients with obesity with a higher estimated blood volume are able to tolerate a higher estimated blood loss prior to requiring blood transfusion26. However, there is little consensus in the literature regarding the impact of obesity on maternal blood volume, with one study reporting similar circulating blood volume between gravidas with and without obesity27.\nWe found that women with obesity in our cohort more frequently used oxytocin, dinoprostone, misoprostol, and magnesium sulfate, lending support to the theory that the mechanism by which obesity could increase PPH risk is related to uterine atony. Future work may examine variation in the etiology of PPH among women with and without obesity, as well as variations in PPH management based on BMI. The impact of obesity on maternal blood volume and the threshold for estimated blood loss at which clinically significant changes in hematologic parameters or transfusion risk occurs in women with obesity should also be investigated further due to our finding that despite a higher estimated blood loss, transfusion was not more frequent among women with obesity.\nLimitations of our study include limitations common to studies using large databases, including potential misclassification errors and missing data. To address this limitation, we treated missing data as missing at random and employed multiple imputation by chained equations to account for statistical uncertainty while addressing missing data. Our dataset was unable to distinguish quantitative blood loss from estimated blood loss, which limits the accuracy of the blood loss reported and may contribute to variation in reporting blood loss among the hospitals in our dataset. Pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain were not reliably captured in our dataset, yet may affect pregnancy outcome more significantly than BMI at the time of delivery. Our study is also limited by the lack of ability to capture postpartum complications that occur after hospital discharge, such as delayed PPH, which is a potential explanation for the lack of association we observed between obesity and venous thromboembolism in our study despite the known increased risk of venous thromboembolism among gravidas with obesity6,28.\nDespite these limitations, our study has a number of strengths. We included a large number of patients across multiple sites in different geographic regions across the United States, increasing the generalizability of our results. We excluded patients with missing BMI data since this variable was the focus of our study. We focused on including only CD to eliminate the potential confounding effect of mode of delivery in the relationship between BMI and blood loss. Our findings have significant clinical implications due to the rising prevalence of obesity in the United States as well as the high number of CD performed annually, currently accounting for more than 30 percent of all deliveries in the United States29. Our results demonstrate several potential risk factors for PPH after CD that can be used for population-based risk assessment, which can aid clinicians in identifying groups of patients that are at highest risk for PPH as part of an ongoing effort to lower hemorrhage-related morbidity and mortality.\nIn conclusion, we found an association between BMI and estimated blood loss after CD, with elevated BMI associated with an increased frequency of PPH. Despite a higher estimated blood loss, we did not find a higher frequency of blood transfusion among women with obesity after CD, implying that there may be no difference in clinically significant blood loss between women with and without obesity (Supplementary Information). Future work may investigate the amount of blood loss at delivery associated with maternal morbidity among patients with obesity, as well as variation in the etiology and management of PPH based on BMI.\nData availability\nThe dataset analyzed during the current study is not publicly available due to the sensitive nature of de-identified electronic health record data.

      "text": "Making self-monitored blood pressure accessible for all pregnant and postpartum moms\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) during pregnancy and right after delivery is one of the leading causes of mothers dying or getting very ill. Monitoring blood pressure is therefore an essential part of prenatal and postpartum care. Masked hypertension, where blood pressure levels are elevated at home despite normal blood pressure in a clinical setting, may lead to cardiovascular and obstetric complications. Sudden rises in blood pressure can threaten pregnant women between prenatal appointments or if they have limited access to healthcare.\nAccess to blood pressure measurement devices, economic hardship, or limited knowledge should not be barriers to home-based monitoring. Early detection of high blood pressure in pregnancy may improve outcomes. Every woman should be able to check her own blood pressure at home.\nThe Cuff Kit\u00ae Project creates solutions to this problem and raises awareness of the importance of self-monitored blood pressure. Our initial response was the Cuff Kit\u00ae, a package of care for high-risk mothers which includes automatic blood pressure monitors and a variety of educational tools that explain how and why to take your blood pressure, what the numbers mean, and when to seek help. Read our announcement about the Cuff Kit\u00ae here.\nWe\u2019re staying in touch with the healthcare providers giving Cuff Kits\u00ae to their patients to ensure we are meeting the needs of our community.

      "text": "Key Points\nToo many pregnant and parenting people in the U.S. die during or after pregnancy because of health problems related to pregnancy.\nIn the United States, communities of color are disproportionately affected by racism. More Black and Native American/Alaska Native pregnant and parenting people die from health problems related to pregnancy than white pregnant and parenting people.\nRacism and unequal living conditions affect their health and well-being and puts them at higher risk of pregnancy complications, such as pregnancy-related death.\nThe leading causes of pregnancy-related deaths are heart conditions and stroke. They cause more than 1 in 3 deaths.\nMost pregnancy-related deaths can be prevented. Getting regular health care before, during and after pregnancy can help prevent them.\nLearning warning signs of health complications may help save your life. Sharing the signs with others may save more lives.\nThe death of a parent is tragic, with devastating effects on families. In this country, more and more parents are dying from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. This is especially true for pregnant and parenting people who are exposed to racism. The maternal death rate for pregnant Black and American Indian/Alaska Native people is about 3 times higher than it is for white people who are pregnant. These disparities increase by age. The maternal death rate of Black and American Indian/Alaska Native pregnant people who are 30 years old or older is about 4 to 5 times higher than it is for white people who are pregnant. This is not acceptable.\nLearn about March of Dimes\u2019 efforts to combat the epidemic of health disparities in pregnancy-related deaths. Join our advocacy network to take action today and help us lead the fight for the health of all moms and babies.\nHelp Save Moms\u2019 Lives\nWhat are maternal death and pregnancy-related death?\nYou may have heard these terms in the news lately. They mean similar things, but they\u2019re not exactly the same. Here\u2019s what they mean:\n- Maternal death is when a pregnant or birthing person dies during pregnancy or up to 42 days after the end of pregnancy from health problems related to pregnancy. Maternal death and maternal mortality mean the same thing.\n- Pregnancy-related death is when a pregnant or birthing person dies during pregnancy or within 1 year after the end of their pregnancy from health problems related to pregnancy.\nThese deaths may be caused by:\n- A health condition (such as heart disease) that someone had before pregnancy that gets worse because of pregnancy\n- A pregnancy complication, such as preeclampsia (a serious blood pressure condition that can happen after the 20th week of pregnancy or after giving birth)\n- Treatment provided during pregnancy\nThe differences between pregnancy-related death and maternal death are important to health care providers and researchers who study this topic to help us understand more about why moms die from conditions related to pregnancy. The statistics and information in this article focus on pregnancy-related death.\nWho is at risk for pregnancy-related death?\nAbout 700 moms die each year in the United States from complications during or after pregnancy.\nRace and pregnancy-related death\nIn the United States, Black pregnant people are 3 to 4 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white pregnant people are. American Indian/Alaska Native pregnant people are 2 to 3 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes\nWe call this a health disparity (difference). To understand why these groups are at a higher risk of pregnancy-related death, we need to look at the social factors affecting them. These are known as \u201csocial determinants of health.\u201d These are the conditions in which you are born, grow, work, live and age. These conditions affect your health throughout your life. In many cases, social determinants of health and health disparities are related to racism.\nRacism refers to the false belief that certain groups of people are born with qualities that make them better than other groups of people.\nRacism isn\u2019t limited to personal attacks such as ethnic slurs, bullying, or physical assault. In a racist culture, one group of people has more power than other groups. People in the dominant racial or ethnic group make important decisions that affects everyone\u2019s lives. For example, they have a lot of control over the way that schools, health care, housing, laws and law enforcement work. This control means that people in the dominant group are more likely to:\n- Have better education and job opportunities\n- Live in safer environmental conditions\n- Be shown in a positive light by media, such as television shows, movies, and news programs.\n- Be treated with respect by law enforcement\n- Have better access to health care\nIn contrast, people from racial or ethnic minority groups who live in a racist culture are more likely to:\n- Experience chronic stress\n- Live in an unsafe neighborhood\n- Live in areas that have higher amounts of environmental toxins, such as air, water, and soil pollution\n- Go to a low-performing school\n- Have limited access to healthy foods\n- Have little or no access to health insurance and quality medical care\n- Have less access to well-paying jobs\nBeing a person of color is not a cause for pregnancy-related death. However, communities of color are disproportionately affected by racism. Racism and unequal living conditions affect their health and well-being. This puts them at higher risk of pregnancy complications, such as pregnancy-related death.\nMarch of Dimes recognizes that racism and its effects are factors in the health disparities in pregnancy outcomes and babies\u2019 health. We must work together to bring fair, just and full access to health care for all moms and babies.\nAge, health and pregnancy-related death\nThe risk of pregnancy-related death also increases with age. In the United States, pregnant and birthing people age 35 to 39 are about twice as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than are pregnant and parenting people age 20 to 24. The risk for pregnant and birthing people who are 40 and older is even higher.\nThe rate of pregnancy-related death in the U.S. has increased over the last 30 years and continues to rise. This increase may be because more pregnant people have health conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes that may increase the risk of complications during pregnancy. High blood pressure is when the force of blood against the walls of the blood vessels is too high. It can stress your heart and cause problems during pregnancy. Diabetes is a medical condition in which there\u2019s too much sugar (called glucose) in the blood. This can damage organs, including blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys.\nWhat can you do to reduce your risk of pregnancy-related death?\nGetting regular health care before, during and after pregnancy can help you and your provider identify conditions that can cause serious health problems. Learning the signs and symptoms of these conditions may help you spot them early so you can get treatment right away. Signs of a condition are things someone else can see or know about you, such as having a rash or coughing. Symptoms are things you feel yourself that others can\u2019t see, such as having a sore throat or feeling dizzy.\nTrust your instincts! If you\u2019re worried about your health or your pregnancy or you have signs or symptoms of conditions that can cause problems during pregnancy, call your provider or go to the hospital. If you know someone who\u2019s pregnant or is a new parent, encourage them to go to their checkups and to tell their provider if they think something\u2019s wrong. Sharing the word about how to prevent maternal death can help save lives.\nIf you\u2019re planning pregnancy\n- Get a preconception checkup. This is a checkup you get before pregnancy to help make sure you\u2019re healthy when you get pregnant. Pregnancy-related death can be caused by health conditions you have before pregnancy. Finding out about them and getting treatment before you get pregnant can help prevent death.\n- Tell your provider about any medicines you take. Make sure any health care provider who prescribes you medicine knows you\u2019re trying to get pregnant. You may need to change to a medicine that\u2019s safer for you and your baby during pregnancy.\n- Protect yourself from infections. For example, talk with your provider about vaccinations (such as the flu shot) that can help protect you from certain diseases. Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom or blowing your nose. Stay away from people who have infections. Don\u2019t eat raw meat, fish or eggs. Use a condom to protect yourself from sexually transmitted infections (also called STIs). If you have a cat, ask someone else to change the litter box.\n- Get to a healthy weight. Eat healthy foods and do something active every day.\n- Don\u2019t smoke, or use harmful drugs. Tell your provider if you need help to quit.\nDuring pregnancy\n- Go for your first prenatal care visit as soon as you think you\u2019re pregnant.\n- Go to all your prenatal care checkups, even if you\u2019re feeling fine. This can help your health care provider spot and treat any health problems that may affect your pregnancy.\n- Tell your provider about any medicines you take. Make sure any provider who prescribes you medicine knows that you\u2019re pregnant.\n- If you\u2019re at risk for preeclampsia, talk to your provider about taking low dose aspirin to help reduce your risk. Preeclampsia is a serious condition that condition that can cause pregnancy-related death.\n- Protect yourself from infections. For example, talk to your provider about vaccinations (like the flu shot) that can help protect you from certain diseases. Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom or blowing your nose. Stay away from people who have infections. Don\u2019t eat raw meat, fish or eggs. Use a condom to protect yourself from STIs. And if you have a cat, ask someone else to change the litter box.\n- Eat healthy foods and do something active every day.\n- Don\u2019t smoke, drink alcohol or use harmful drugs. Tell your provider if you need help to quit.\n- If you are not receiving the care you deserve, find a new provider. If you feel you are being exposed to racism, file a report with your provider\u2019s office and find a new provider.\nAfter pregnancy\nTell your provider right away if you have you have any of the following signs or symptoms:\n- Chest pain\n- Dizziness\n- Fever and chills (temperature of 100.5 or higher)\n- Headache\n- Nausea and/or vomiting\n- Trouble breathing,\n- Severe abdominal pain\n- Swelling, pain, or redness in the legs, hands, or face\n- Visual changes\n- If you\u2019re worried about anything or something doesn\u2019t seem right, call your provider.\n- If you\u2019re having a medical emergency, call 911.\nWhat causes pregnancy-related death?\nWe know most of the causes of pregnancy-related death. The leading causes can be different depending on timing:\n- During and after pregnancy: Heart conditions and stroke cause more than 1 in 3 pregnancy-related deaths.\n- During birth: Emergencies, such as heavy bleeding and amniotic fluid embolism, cause the most deaths during birth. Amniotic fluid embolism is when some of your baby\u2019s cells or amniotic fluid (fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb) gets into the bloodstream.\n- The week after giving birth: Heavy bleeding, high blood pressure and infection cause the most deaths in the week after giving birth.\n- One week after birth to 1 year after birth: Cardiomyopathy (weakened heart muscle) causes the most deaths during this time.\nGetting early treatment for conditions that can cause complications during and after pregnancy may help prevent death. If you have signs or symptoms of any of the following health conditions, tell your health care provider right away.\nHeart and blood vessel conditions\nCardiomyopathy. This condition affects the heart muscle. It can make the heart larger, thicker or more rigid (stiffer) than normal, so it\u2019s harder for the heart to pump blood. Signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy include:\n- Swelling in your legs\n- Fatigue (being really tired)\n- Chest pressure or having a pounding, fast or fluttering heartbeat\n- Fainting or feeling out of breath, dizzy or lightheaded\nHeart disease (also called cardiovascular disease). Heart disease includes conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. They often affect the heart muscle or involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Common signs and symptoms of heart disease include:\n- Chest pain, discomfort or tightness\n- Dizziness or fainting\n- Extreme tiredness\n- Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach)\n- Really fast or really slow heartbeat\n- Shortness of breath\n- Swelling in the legs, ankles or feet\nPreeclampsia and eclampsia. Preeclampsia is a serious blood pressure condition that can happen after the 20th week of pregnancy or after giving birth (called postpartum preeclampsia). It\u2019s when a pregnant or birthing person has high blood pressure and signs that some of their organs, like the kidneys and liver, may not be working normally. Eclampsia is a very serious complication of preeclampsia, when a person has seizures. These seizures can result in a coma, brain damage, or even death to mom and baby. Tell your provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of preeclampsia, such as:\n- Changes in vision\n- Headache that doesn\u2019t go away\n- Nausea, vomiting or dizziness\n- Pain in the upper right belly area or shoulder\n- Sudden weight gain (2 to 5 pounds in a week)\n- Swelling in the legs, hands or face\n- Trouble breathing\nStroke. A stroke is when blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced. Stroke can happen when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel that brings blood to the brain, or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts open. The risk of stroke increases during pregnancy. Signs and symptoms of a stroke come on suddenly and can include:\n- Numbness or weakness in your face, arms or legs\n- Feeling confused\n- Having trouble talking and understanding what other people are saying\n- Having trouble seeing or walking\n- Feeling dizzy\n- Having a severe headache\nThrombotic pulmonary embolism. This is the sudden blockage of an artery in the lung. It usually happens when a blood clot in the leg travels to the lungs and blocks the flow of blood to the lungs. When a blood clot forms in a deep vein in your leg or somewhere else in your body, it\u2019s called deep vein thrombosis (also called DVT). You\u2019re at increased risk for thrombotic pulmonary embolism during pregnancy. Tell your provider if you have any of the following signs or symptoms:\n- Shortness of breath, chest pain and cough\n- Having a fever\n- Feeling dizzy or lightheaded\n- Leg pain or swelling\n- Having a fast heart rate\n- Sweating or having clammy skin or skin that has a bluish color\nHemorrhage (also called heavy bleeding)\nCauses of hemorrhage that can lead to pregnancy-related death include:\n- Problems with the placenta, including placental abruption, placenta previa and placenta accreta, increta and percreta. The placenta grows in the uterus and supplies the baby with food and oxygen through the umbilical cord. Placental abruption is when the placenta separates from the uterus before birth. Placenta previa is when the placenta lies low in the uterus and covers all or part of the cervix. The cervix is the opening to the uterus that sits at the top of the vagina. Placenta accreta, increta, and percreta happen when the placenta grows too deeply into the wall or muscles of the uterus, or grows through the uterus. If you have bleeding during pregnancy, tell your health care provider right away. If the bleeding is severe, go to the hospital.\n- Uterine rupture. This is when the uterus tears during labor. Signs and symptoms of a rupture include pain, bleeding, long labor and problems with the baby (called fetal distress), like having a slow heart rate during labor.\n- Ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This is when an ectopic pregnancy breaks open. An ectopic pregnancy happens when a fertilized egg implants itself outside the uterus and begins to grow. An ectopic pregnancy always ends in pregnancy loss. It can cause serious problems. Most of the time, ectopic pregnancies are removed by surgery. Signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy include:\n- vaginal bleeding;\n- pain in the shoulder, lower back or pelvic area (the part of the body between the stomach and legs)\n- feeling dizzy or faint.\n- Retained products of conception. This is tissue from the placenta or from the baby that stays in the uterus after a pregnancy ends. Signs and symptoms include fever, bleeding, pelvic pain and tenderness of the uterus.\n- Uterine atony. This is when the uterus doesn\u2019t contract (tighten) as strongly as it should after the placenta is delivered after the baby is born. Normally, contractions help stop the bleeding after the placenta separates from the uterus. But when these contractions aren\u2019t strong enough, hemorrhage can happen. Signs and symptoms of uterine atony include heavy bleeding and not having contractions after giving birth.\n- Tears in the cervix, vagina or a blood vessel in the uterus\nInfection\nWhen you\u2019re pregnant, your immune system isn\u2019t as quick to respond to infections (illnesses caused by bad germs), so you\u2019re more likely to get infections that can cause problems for you and your baby. Infections that can cause pregnancy-related death include:\n- Chorioamnionitis. This is an infection of the amniotic fluid and tissue that surround a baby in the womb. Signs and symptoms of this infection include fever, fast heart rate in you or your baby, a uterus that\u2019s tender to the touch and discharge from the vagina that smells bad.\n- Flu (also called influenza). The flu is a serious disease that can cause fever, chills, cough, sore throat and body aches. It\u2019s safe to get the flu shot during pregnancy. It protects you and your baby from serious health problems during and after pregnancy.\n- Genital tract infections. The genital tract includes reproductive organs, like the vulva, vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. Signs and symptoms of genital tract infections may include fever, chills and pain in the lower belly.\n- Sepsis. Sepsis is the body\u2019s extreme response to an infection. It can be life-threatening. Signs and symptoms of sepsis include fever, fast heart rate and fast breathing.\nNon-cardiovascular medical conditions\nThese are medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease and pneumonia, that aren\u2019t directly associated with the heart and blood vessels. You may have had the condition before you got pregnant.\nAmniotic fluid embolism\nThis is a rare condition that can happen during or right after birth. Tell your provider if you have signs or symptoms of amniotic fluid embolism, including:\n- Shortness of breath\n- Feeling anxious (worried)\n- Chills or a fast heart rate\n- Seizures\n- Bleeding from the vagina, from an incision (cut) from surgery, or from an IV site (when you get fluid or medicine through a needle into a vein)\nHow are mental health conditions involved in pregnancy-related death?\nMental health conditions affect your emotions, feelings, and behaviors. They\u2019re medical conditions that need treatment to get better. They can happen for the first time during pregnancy and the postpartum period (the time right after you give birth), and they can reoccur or happen again (called a relapse) during these times. Mental health conditions that affect pregnancy include:\n- Depression (also called major depression). Depression is a medical condition that causes strong feelings of sadness, anxiety (worry), tiredness, and a loss of interest in things you like to do. It can affect how you think, feel, and act. It can last for a long time and can interfere with daily life.\n- Postpartum depression (also called PPD). PPD is a kind of depression some women get after having a baby. PPD can make it hard for you to take care of yourself and your baby.\nMental health conditions can lead to pregnancy-related death. Having an untreated mental health condition can make it hard for you to take care of yourself and your baby.\nIf you think you have a mental health condition, tell your health care provider. You can get treatment to make you feel better. If you\u2019re being treated for a mental health condition before, during or after pregnancy, talk to your provider about any medicine you take. You and your provider can work together to decide about treatment options. It\u2019s best to talk to your prenatal care and mental health providers about a treatment plan before you get pregnant.\nWhat is a \u201cnear-miss\u201d?\nA near-miss is when a birthing parent has unexpected and severe complications from labor and childbirth. These complications are also known as \u201csevere maternal morbidity,\u201d or SMM. In the United States, it\u2019s more common to experience a near-miss than it is to die, and SMM isn\u2019t uncommon. Between 2006 and 2015, the rate of SMM increased 45 percent.\nIf you\u2019ve had a near-miss, you may have lots of different feelings. You may feel like you should be happy or grateful. Or you may have trouble dealing with what happened. You may feel sad, upset, worried, scared or angry.\nSome parents who\u2019ve had a near-miss have a condition called post-traumatic stress disorder (also called PTSD). This is a severe form of anxiety (strong feelings of worry or fear). PTSD may happen when you go through something shocking, scary or dangerous. If you have PTSD, you may feel stressed or scared even when you\u2019re not in a dangerous situation.\nSigns and symptoms of PTSD include:\n- Serious anxiety\n- Flashbacks of the event. A flashback is when you relive a traumatic (scary or troubling) event so that it feels like the event is happening again.\n- Nightmares\n- Physical responses (like sweating or a racing heartbeat) when you\u2019re reminded of the event\nIf you think you have PTSD:\n- Tell your health care provider.\n- See a mental health professional. This is a person with training and education to help people with emotional or mental health conditions like PTSD. Mental health providers include social workers, therapists, counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners. Ask your health care provider to help you find a mental health professional.\n- Talk with family and friends about how you\u2019re feeling.\n- Connect with other parents and families who have had experiences like yours at Share Your Story, the March of Dimes online community.\nLast reviewed: April, 2024\nSee also: March of Dimes Advocacy, Your checkup before pregnancy, Your first prenatal care checkup, Warning signs of postpartum health problems"

  "argos_summary": "The United States has a higher maternal mortality rate than comparable wealthy nations, driven by health disparities, limited access to care, and uneven emergency response capabilities, with Black and Indigenous women disproportionately affected. Evidence shows most deaths are preventable through better prenatal monitoring, rapid response training, and standardized protocols, yet policy changes such as Medicaid cuts and abortion bans threaten to worsen outcomes. Individual stories, like Jordyn Albright\u2019s near\u2011fatal postpartum hemorrhage, illustrate how timely intervention can save lives, while systemic gaps\u2014such as maternity deserts and hospital closures\u2014create preventable risks for many families. Efforts to reduce mortality focus on data\u2011driven reviews, workforce diversification, expanded coverage, and community\u2011based supports to address both medical and social determinants of maternal health.",
