  "content": "Taylor Swift has only released a tracklist for her upcoming album, but already the masses are searching for meaning behind the titles of the 12 songs that will be featured on \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d\n\nA brief glance at Google trends on Thursday will show you that in the less than 24 hours since she revealed details about the album on boyfriend Travis Kelce\u2019s \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast, Swift has piqued interest in \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d based on Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHamlet,\u201d and \u201cwhat is the fate of Ophelia?\u201d It will also show you that Kelce is not the only one who Swift may have inspired to learn the definition of words such as \u201cengulfed\u201d or \u201cesoteric,\u201d at least according to his brother and pod cohost, Jason Kelce.\n\nPeople are also curious about \u201copalite,\u201d a man-made opal-reminiscent glass that, according to an AI overview, is said by some to promote all manner of healing and transformative powers. The word serves as the title to the third track on her upcoming record.\n\nOther popular search terms in the last day include the Eras Tour, the Kelce brothers\u2019 \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast (no surprise), her album producers, and for reasons not entirely clear, Swift\u2019s friend, Blake Lively.\n\nThe full tracklist for \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d follows below:",

      "text": "Taylor Swift got candid in a nearly two-hour pre-recorded podcast with her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce that at one point brought more than a million viewers to a YouTube stream on Wednesday evening.\nTeasers released ahead of her inaugural appearance on \u201cNew Heights\u201d revealed the singer would be talking about her new album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d and opening up about her historic Eras Tour, which concluded in December 2024.\nShe hit on both subjects at length in the episode, but some of the most exciting moments came from conversations that were less anticipated \u2013 like when she got emotional speaking about the moment she learned she was going to once again own her entire catalog of music or when she opened up about her parents\u2019 health struggles this summer.\nHere are some of the highlights from their conversation:\n\u2018The Life of a Showgirl\u2019 is a record she\u2019s \u2018been wanting to make for a very long time\u2019\n\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d will be released on October 3 and will include 12 tracks \u2013 a nod to this being the pop superstar\u2019s 12th studio album \u2014 including a final song featuring Sabrina Carpenter.\n\u201cThis is the record I\u2019ve been wanting to make for a very long time,\u201d Swift said.\nThe album marks a reunion between Swift and legendary producers Max Martin and Shellback, who worked with her pop-heavy hits \u201cRed,\u201d \u201c1989\u201d and \u201cReputation.\u201d These albums also feature several of her top songs, including \u201cShake It Off,\u201d \u201cDelicate,\u201d \u201cBlank Space\u201d and \u201cI Knew You were Trouble.\u201d\nSwift said her goal for the new album was to have \u201cmelodies that were so infectious that you\u2019re almost angry at it\u201d and lyrics that were \u201cjust as vivid but crisp and focused and completely intentional.\u201d\nSwift said the album\u2019s theme is \u201ceverything that was going on behind the curtain,\u201d later saying she wanted the cover to communicate the same idea. It\u2019s \u201cthe life beyond the show,\u201d she said.\nAsked of the significance behind the album\u2019s orange iconography, Swift explained that it is \u201cenergetically how my life has felt,\u201d she said, describing it as \u201cexuberant and electric and vibrant.\u201d\nJason Kelce, a retired center for the Philadelphia Eagles and Super Bowl champ, then asked if he\u2019d get to hear the album ahead of time, to which Swift said no.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t trust you at all,\u201d she said.\nHe replied: \u201cHonestly, smart.\u201d\nTravis Kelce\u2019s way with words and Swift\u2019s \u2018green flag\u2019 moment\nHow Travis Kelce and Swift came to be one of the most famous power couples around is now well-known lore, and Swift joked that the podcast \u201cgot me a boyfriend.\u201d But her beau said he actually gives the Eras Tour credit for their relationship.\n\u201cIf I never would have gone to that show and just been mesmerized and just been captivated and then left with such a desire to want to meet you, I would have never went on here and told everybody how butthurt I was (when he didn\u2019t get a chance to give her a friendship bracelet he\u2019d made for her). I had never been so engulfed in the curiosity of who you were,\u201d he said.\nSwift made an audible \u201caww\u201d and added \u201cthat\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d\nHis brother quipped in response: \u201cThe best part of that statement is that you didn\u2019t know what the word \u2018engulfed\u2019 meant before you met Taylor.\u201d\nSwift and Travis Kelce appeared incredibly comfortable with one another throughout the episode, often sitting with arms intertwined.\nAt another point in the episode, Swift revealed the \u201cgreen flag\u201d she saw early on as she got to know Travis Kelce was his ability to maintain friendships.\n\u201cTravis has had the same friends since he was probably four years old,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly good at maintaining friendships and is so loyal and his friends are equally loyal and the funniest, most hilarious group of people.\u201d\nSwift\u2019s mom and brother played a major role in helping her buy her masters back\nTravis Kelce described Swift\u2019s \u201creclaiming\u201d of her master recordings as one of his favorite things that happened this summer, launching Swift into a detailed account of how it came to be.\nSwift said she sent her mother and brother to Los Angeles to discuss acquiring her music catalog with the private equity company Shamrock Capital that previously owned her music.\n\u201cThey sat down with Shamrock Capital and they told them what this meant for me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey told them the whole story of all the times we\u2019ve tried to buy it, all the times it\u2019s fallen through.\u201d\nSwift said she received news that she acquired her master recordings a few months after the Super Bowl.\n\u201cI get a call from my mom and she\u2019s like, \u2018You got your music,\u2019\u201d Swift said while tearing up. \u201cIt\u2019s literally been so long since this happened, and it\u2019s every time I talk about it\u2026.I just like very dramatically hit the floor for real. Honestly, just started like bawling my eyes out, and I\u2019m just like weeping.\u201d\nTravis Kelce admitted he started crying, too.\n\u201cYou were weeping,\u201d she echoed.\nIn May, Swift became the owner of her entire catalog of music, roughly six years after she protested the sale of the master recordings of her first six albums by her former record label.\nSwift announced the news in a letter posted to her website at the time, writing that \u201call of the music I\u2019ve ever made\u2026 now belongs\u2026 to me.\u201d\nThe Grammy-winner specified that she owns all her music videos, concert films, album art and photography, along with unreleased songs and that she purchased her music \u201coutright with no strings attached, no partnership, full autonomy,\u201d from Shamrock Capital.\nSwift keeps busy\u2026baking bread\nHer schedule might appear perpetually packed, but Swift actually does have free time and hobbies, which include painting, cooking and \u201ca different baking obsession every six months.\u201d\nTravis Kelce joked: \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest man in the world.\u201d\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re very deep in a sourdough obsession that has taken over my life,\u201d she added.\nTravis Kelce says he is very grateful to be running and training as much as he is right now, because \u201cI am getting the caloric intake.\u201d\nTaylor Swift said he asked her to send him two loaves of sourdough at training camp.\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about bread 60% of the times now,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, she has been perfecting a \u201cfunfetti sourdough\u201d for Jason Kelce\u2019s children \u201cbecause they love sprinkles.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna blow their mind,\u201d Jason Kelce said.\nSwift\u2019s Eras Tour performance recovery is as intense as Kelce\u2019s post-game ritual\nWork hard, recover harder \u2013 that\u2019s a principle both Travis Kelce and Swift seem to follow dutifully.\nSwift opened about about the grueling toll her three-hour performances would take on her.\n\u201cIt was a lot of physical therapy and it was a lot of being in a state of perpetual discomfort,\u201d she said.\nShe told Travis Kelce, \u201c(It\u2019s) kind of like when you\u2019re in season. I\u2019m not getting hit by huge 300-pounders, but the heels\u2026\u201d\nTravis Kelce recalled seeing what he called \u201cthe recovery station\u201d at the hotel.\n\u201cS**t, I\u2019m telling you, dude, the similarities were crazy,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my Gosh. She does more than I do.\u2019\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe related on how much torture we put our bodies through.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Alli Rosenbloom, Megan Thomas and Dan Heching contributed to this report."
