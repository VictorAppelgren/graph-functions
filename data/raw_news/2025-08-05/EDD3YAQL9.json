  "content": "The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics \u2014 strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. New Mountain Finance Corporation (Symbol: NMFC) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most \"interesting\" ideas that merit further research by investors.\n\nBut making New Mountain Finance Corporation an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Friday, shares of NMFC entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $11.78 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of New Mountain Finance Corporation, the RSI reading has hit 24.7 \u2014 by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 33.8. A falling stock price \u2014 all else being equal \u2014 creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, NMFC's recent annualized dividend of 1.2/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 9.84% based upon the recent $12.20 share price.\n\nA bullish investor could look at NMFC's 24.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on NMFC is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.\n\nClick here to find out what 9 other oversold dividend stocks you need to know about \u00bb",
