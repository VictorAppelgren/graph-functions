  "title": "Earnings Beat: Hillman Solutions Corp. Just Beat Analyst Forecasts, And Analysts Have Been Updating Their Models",
  "description": "NasdaqGM:HLMN 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Hillman Solutions's Fair Values from the Community and select...",
  "content": "Explore Hillman Solutions's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nHillman Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:HLMN) investors will be delighted, with the company turning in some strong numbers with its latest results. It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 3.3% to hit US$403m. Hillman Solutions also reported a statutory profit of US$0.08, which was an impressive 38% above what the analysts had forecast. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Hillman Solutions' eight analysts is for revenues of US$1.56b in 2025. This would reflect a satisfactory 3.9% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to jump 89% to US$0.21. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$1.55b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.16 in 2025. Although the revenue estimates have not really changed, we can see there's been a great increase in earnings per share expectations, suggesting that the analysts have become more bullish after the latest result.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Hillman Solutions\n\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 11% to US$11.91. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Hillman Solutions, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$15.00 and the most bearish at US$10.00 per share. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.\n\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Hillman Solutions' past performance and to peers in the same industry. It's clear from the latest estimates that Hillman Solutions' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 8.0% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2025 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 1.6% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 4.8% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Hillman Solutions to grow faster than the wider industry.",
