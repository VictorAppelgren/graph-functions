Dodge's newest muscle car makes its official public debut with Dodge smoke and fury in downtown Pontiac, Michigan, today to kick off the 10th anniversary of Roadkill Nights Powered by Dodge.\n\n\"For 60 years, Dodge Charger has been known for delivering legendary muscle car performance, and we have every intention of continuing that legacy,\" said Dodge CEO Matt McAlear. \"This next-generation Charger lineup delivers the most horsepower and most torque of any muscle car in its class, the widest body of any car in the industry, an award-winning interior, and, perhaps most important, what our customers have told us they want: the power to choose what fuels them. The all-new turbocharged 2026 Dodge Charger Scat Pack is the most powerful car customers can buy priced less than $55,000.\"\n\nOrders for the 2026 Dodge Charger Scat Pack powered by the SIXPACK H.O. will open on August 13. Vehicles are scheduled to begin arriving at dealerships before the end of the year.\n\nPower to Choose Your Powertrain\n\nDodge is again leaning into its rich history to fuel the future. Well-known in the 1970s, the Dodge \"SIXPACK\" badge referred to three two\u00e2\u20ac'barrel carburetors for a total of six barrels. Today, the 2026 Dodge Charger Scat Pack revives that SIXPACK spirit with a straight six-cylinder layout.\n\nDodge launches the award-winning 3.0-liter Hurricane Twin Turbo Straight Six as the SIXPACK. In the new Dodge Charger lineup, the SIXPACK will be available in both high-output and standard-output variants that continue to push the nameplate further in performance:\n\u2022 Charger Scat Pack with the SIXPACK H.O. engine delivers 550 horsepower, 531 lb.-ft. torque, top speed of 177 mph\n\u2022 Charger R/T with the SIXPACK standard-output (S.O.) engine delivers 420 horsepower, 468. Lb.-ft. of torque, top speed of 168 mph\n\nBoosted High Horsepower\n\nThe turbo-powered SIXPACK H.O. engine in Charger Scat Pack is the most powerful version of the Hurricane in production. The engine uses a new, low-restriction air induction system and low-restriction exhaust system to enhance horsepower and torque. Designed for maximum performance, the SIXPACK's power is centered on a solid foundation of a deep-skirt cast-aluminum block and structural aluminum alloy oil pan. Cross-bolted steel main bearing caps hold the forged steel crankshaft and forged steel connecting rods. Deck-plate honing of the block during manufacturing optimizes the cylinder bore shape.\n\nThe SIXPACK H.O. engine delivers its 550 horsepower with oil-jet-cooled, forged-aluminum pistons with an anodized top ring and a diamond-like coating (DLC) on the pins to minimize friction. It runs with a 9.5:1 compression ratio and produces maximum output on 91 octane premium fuel.\n\u2022 Boost that delivers 88% of peak torque at 2,500 rpm for immediate low-end response and more than 90% of peak torque from 3,000 to 6,000 rpm for sustained performance\n\u2022 Plasma transfer wire arc coating in the cylinder bores for an ultra-thin, durable, low-friction wear surface\n\nA carbon-styled engine cover stamped with a red-accented SIXPACK text logo announces the presence of the ICE engine under the hood.\n\nTwin Turbos Tear It Up\n\nPowerful twin-turbos feed the SIXPACK-powered Dodge Charger Scat Pack, built with performance features that include:\n\u2022 Twin Garrett GT2054 turbochargers, 54mm, low inertia and high flow to spin up fast, with a peak boost of 30 psi and an RPM of 185,000 for the SIXPACK H.O., which pushes more air into the combustion chamber, delivering more horsepower and torque\n\u2022 Turbine material is constructed with Inconel 100, the first industry application, providing exceptional high-temperature strength and resistance to oxidation and thermal fatigue, making it ideal for withstanding the extreme heat and stress of turbocharger operation\n\u2022 Twin counter-rotating turbos reduce turbo lag and balance airflow dynamics, improving throttle response and overall engine efficiency in high-performance applications\n\nAll-wheel Drive When You Need It, Rear-wheel Drive When You Want It\n\nThe new 2026 Dodge Charger SIXPACK-powered models are the world's only AWD muscle cars with rear-wheel-drive capability. The robust 880RE TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic transmission features a multi-disc wet clutch system that opens at the push of a button to enable on-demand RWD functionality, capable of sending 100% of torque to the rear wheels.\n\nFrom street to strip, the Charger's AWD system enhances capability in inclement weather and on various road surfaces, as well as delivering when it comes time to launch at the drag strip. The Charger Scat Pack can be put in Line Lock or rear-wheel drive to perform a burnout to clean and heat the tires before a pass down the strip. When ready to launch, the driver can switch back to AWD and reap the benefits of launching off the line with all four tires, providing extra grip in the rear.\n\nCharger's standard AWD system also includes a Front-Axle Disconnect feature to provide improved fuel economy. This system uses sensors throughout the vehicle to determine the optimal parameters to disconnect the front axle to reduce parasitic driveline losses.\n\nBoosted, Brutal and Built to Turn Heads\n\nThe Dodge Charger Scat Pack's exclusive performance-tuned active exhaust includes a dual mode with electronically controlled valves and a unique aggressive tuning character for each drive mode. Active noise cancelling is engineered to minimize unwanted sound frequencies in the cabin while allowing in visceral external exhaust notes. The 100mm rolled dual exhaust tips for both SIXPACK-powered models are available in bright or Eclipse chrome finish.\n\nEngineered for Exhilaration\n\nAll models in the all-new Charger lineup are engineered with standard AWD, delivering wicked fast launches off the line while loaded with performance features that ignite the drive, including:\n\u2022 Standard mechanical limited slip differential increases traction and performance while enhancing stability by using a preloaded clutch pack that limits wheel speed difference under load, ensuring both rear wheels stay locked for maximum grip during hard launches and straight-line acceleration\n\u2022 Line Lock \u2013 standard on SIXPACK-powered Charger Scat Pack \u2013 lets the driver lock the front brakes only, while disconnecting the AWD transfer case clutch packs and removing torque from the front axle, enabling rear wheel spin to help clean/warm the tires before launch and to perform tire-smoking burnouts with a push of a button and punch of the throttle\n\u2022 Selectable Launch Control lets drivers dial in RPM based on surface conditions while holding brake pressure, unleashing full power to all four wheels the moment the brake pedal lifts\n\u2022 Launch parameters are configurable through the vehicle's race options, allowing adjustment of engine speed setpoints to optimize torque delivery based on surface conditions. During staging, brake pressure is actively maintained by the stability control system while the throttle is held wide open, enabling the turbos to build boost. At brake release, the powertrain control module precisely manages torque across all four wheels to deliver maximum traction and acceleration off the line\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 For maximum efficiency, Eco Mode prioritizes fuel economy by biasing torque delivery to the rear wheels and engaging AWD only when necessary. The transmission delivers softer, slower shifts and upshifts earlier to keep torque low and RPMs down. Steering effort is reduced for a relaxed feel, and the active exhaust valves remain closed for quiet operation\n\u2022 \n\u2022 For low-grip surfaces, Wet/Snow Mode optimizes traction by locking the torque split to a balanced 50/50 front-to-rear distribution. Shift schedules remain soft and early to limit torque buildup, while reduced steering effort improves control in slippery conditions. Exhaust valves stay closed for quieter, more composed operation\n\u2022 \n\u2022 For performance driving, Sport Mode sharpens reflexes with a performance-tuned torque split and more aggressive shift patterns. The transmission delivers quick, firm gear changes, and steering feedback is increased for more direct control. The active exhaust valves open fully, unleashing the full sound signature of the SIXPACK engine\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Provides drivers the freedom to configure their Charger exactly the way they want it. From propulsion characteristics and paddle shifter behavior to traction settings and steering weight, nearly every aspect of performance can be tailored to individual preference\n\u2022 SIXPACK-powered Charger Scat Pack features standard front 380-by-36mm and rear 360-by-32mm ventilated discs and Brembo six-piston front fixed 36mm and rear floating 52mm calipers enhance braking performance and provide brake fade resistance\n\u2022 Brake by Wire eBoost intelligent braking system uses a central module to control vehicle deceleration, with optimized response depending on drive mode, and to avoid heat-related system fade and pad wear\n\u2022 Charger raises the bar on handling with a purpose-built suspension system designed for serious control. Up front, a multi-link suspension with forged aluminum links, and in the rear, a fully independent 4-link setup: This equates to real world improvements over the previous generation Charger:\n\u2022 10% improvement in steady-state response for faster and more confident cornering\n\u2022 15% improvement in lateral response time or how quickly the vehicle reacts to rapid steering inputs, such as high-performance driving or accident-avoidance maneuvers\n\u2022 An impressive 25% improvement in steady-state limit handling balance, significantly reducing understeer and delivering a more neutral, planted feel through corners\n\u2022 Performance Pages deliver info on key performance metrics, such as acceleration timers, gauges, g-force and more\n\u2022 Body structure of SIXPACK-powered Dodge Charger models features a 55%/45% weight distribution, improving vehicle handling and control, and an increase in overall rigidity, which assists with performance and ride quality, minimizing cabin and driveline vibrations\n\nWidebody Muscle Design \u2013 Widest Body of Any Car in the Industry\n\nThe new Dodge Charger exterior is unmistakable \u2013 pure Dodge muscle inspired by heritage, driven by performance. The next-generation Dodge Charger SIXPACK-powered models feature a modern, muscular widebody exterior design with a unique hood, front fascia/grille and exhaust.\n\nThe SIXPACK Charger performance hood announces its internal-combustion identity with a black SIXPACK-logoed grille-style bezel.

Dodge's newest muscle car makes its official public debut with Dodge smoke and fury in downtown Pontiac, Michigan, today to kick off the 10th anniversary of Roadkill Nights Powered by Dodge.\n\"For 60 years, Dodge Charger has been known for delivering legendary muscle car performance, and we have every intention of continuing that legacy,\" said Dodge CEO Matt McAlear. \"This next-generation Charger lineup delivers the most horsepower and most torque of any muscle car in its class, the widest body of any car in the industry, an award-winning interior, and, perhaps most important, what our customers have told us they want: the power to choose what fuels them. The all-new turbocharged 2026 Dodge Charger Scat Pack is the most powerful car customers can buy priced less than $55,000.\"\nOrders for the 2026 Dodge Charger Scat Pack powered by the SIXPACK H.O. will open on August 13. Vehicles are scheduled to begin arriving at dealerships before the end of the year.\nPower to Choose Your Powertrain\nDodge is again leaning into its rich history to fuel the future. Well-known in the 1970s, the Dodge \"SIXPACK\" badge referred to three two\u00e2\u20ac'barrel carburetors for a total of six barrels. Today, the 2026 Dodge Charger Scat Pack revives that SIXPACK spirit with a straight six-cylinder layout.\nDodge launches the award-winning 3.0-liter Hurricane Twin Turbo Straight Six as the SIXPACK. In the new Dodge Charger lineup, the SIXPACK will be available in both high-output and standard-output variants that continue to push the nameplate further in performance:\n- Charger Scat Pack with the SIXPACK H.O. engine delivers 550 horsepower, 531 lb.-ft. torque, top speed of 177 mph\n- Charger R/T with the SIXPACK standard-output (S.O.) engine delivers 420 horsepower, 468. Lb.-ft. of torque, top speed of 168 mph\nBoosted High Horsepower\nThe turbo-powered SIXPACK H.O. engine in Charger Scat Pack is the most powerful version of the Hurricane in production. The engine uses a new, low-restriction air induction system and low-restriction exhaust system to enhance horsepower and torque. Designed for maximum performance, the SIXPACK's power is centered on a solid foundation of a deep-skirt cast-aluminum block and structural aluminum alloy oil pan. Cross-bolted steel main bearing caps hold the forged steel crankshaft and forged steel connecting rods. Deck-plate honing of the block during manufacturing optimizes the cylinder bore shape.\nThe SIXPACK H.O. engine delivers its 550 horsepower with oil-jet-cooled, forged-aluminum pistons with an anodized top ring and a diamond-like coating (DLC) on the pins to minimize friction. It runs with a 9.5:1 compression ratio and produces maximum output on 91 octane premium fuel.\nKey features of the SIXPACK H.O. engine include:\n- Boost that delivers 88% of peak torque at 2,500 rpm for immediate low-end response and more than 90% of peak torque from 3,000 to 6,000 rpm for sustained performance\n- High-pressure (5,075 psi/350 bar) direct fuel injection with centrally mounted injectors\n- Dual overhead camshafts with wide-range, fully independent variable valve timing\n- Engine-mounted water-to-air charge air coolers with dual inlets, with a separate cooling circuit\n- Plasma transfer wire arc coating in the cylinder bores for an ultra-thin, durable, low-friction wear surface\nA carbon-styled engine cover stamped with a red-accented SIXPACK text logo announces the presence of the ICE engine under the hood.\nTwin Turbos Tear It Up\nPowerful twin-turbos feed the SIXPACK-powered Dodge Charger Scat Pack, built with performance features that include:\n- Twin Garrett GT2054 turbochargers, 54mm, low inertia and high flow to spin up fast, with a peak boost of 30 psi and an RPM of 185,000 for the SIXPACK H.O., which pushes more air into the combustion chamber, delivering more horsepower and torque\n- Turbine material is constructed with Inconel 100, the first industry application, providing exceptional high-temperature strength and resistance to oxidation and thermal fatigue, making it ideal for withstanding the extreme heat and stress of turbocharger operation\n- Twin counter-rotating turbos reduce turbo lag and balance airflow dynamics, improving throttle response and overall engine efficiency in high-performance applications\nAll-wheel Drive When You Need It, Rear-wheel Drive When You Want It\nThe new 2026 Dodge Charger SIXPACK-powered models are the world's only AWD muscle cars with rear-wheel-drive capability. The robust 880RE TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic transmission features a multi-disc wet clutch system that opens at the push of a button to enable on-demand RWD functionality, capable of sending 100% of torque to the rear wheels.\nFrom street to strip, the Charger's AWD system enhances capability in inclement weather and on various road surfaces, as well as delivering when it comes time to launch at the drag strip. The Charger Scat Pack can be put in Line Lock or rear-wheel drive to perform a burnout to clean and heat the tires before a pass down the strip. When ready to launch, the driver can switch back to AWD and reap the benefits of launching off the line with all four tires, providing extra grip in the rear.\nCharger's standard AWD system also includes a Front-Axle Disconnect feature to provide improved fuel economy. This system uses sensors throughout the vehicle to determine the optimal parameters to disconnect the front axle to reduce parasitic driveline losses.\nBoosted, Brutal and Built to Turn Heads\nThe Dodge Charger Scat Pack's exclusive performance-tuned active exhaust includes a dual mode with electronically controlled valves and a unique aggressive tuning character for each drive mode. Active noise cancelling is engineered to minimize unwanted sound frequencies in the cabin while allowing in visceral external exhaust notes. The 100mm rolled dual exhaust tips for both SIXPACK-powered models are available in bright or Eclipse chrome finish.\nEngineered for Exhilaration\nAll models in the all-new Charger lineup are engineered with standard AWD, delivering wicked fast launches off the line while loaded with performance features that ignite the drive, including:\n- Standard mechanical limited slip differential increases traction and performance while enhancing stability by using a preloaded clutch pack that limits wheel speed difference under load, ensuring both rear wheels stay locked for maximum grip during hard launches and straight-line acceleration\n- Line Lock \u2013 standard on SIXPACK-powered Charger Scat Pack \u2013 lets the driver lock the front brakes only, while disconnecting the AWD transfer case clutch packs and removing torque from the front axle, enabling rear wheel spin to help clean/warm the tires before launch and to perform tire-smoking burnouts with a push of a button and punch of the throttle\n- Selectable Launch Control lets drivers dial in RPM based on surface conditions while holding brake pressure, unleashing full power to all four wheels the moment the brake pedal lifts\n- Launch parameters are configurable through the vehicle's race options, allowing adjustment of engine speed setpoints to optimize torque delivery based on surface conditions. During staging, brake pressure is actively maintained by the stability control system while the throttle is held wide open, enabling the turbos to build boost. At brake release, the powertrain control module precisely manages torque across all four wheels to deliver maximum traction and acceleration off the line\n- Five distinct drive modes include Auto, Eco, Wet/Snow, Sport and Custom\n- Eco Mode\n- For maximum efficiency, Eco Mode prioritizes fuel economy by biasing torque delivery to the rear wheels and engaging AWD only when necessary. The transmission delivers softer, slower shifts and upshifts earlier to keep torque low and RPMs down. Steering effort is reduced for a relaxed feel, and the active exhaust valves remain closed for quiet operation\n- Wet/Snow Mode\n- For low-grip surfaces, Wet/Snow Mode optimizes traction by locking the torque split to a balanced 50/50 front-to-rear distribution. Shift schedules remain soft and early to limit torque buildup, while reduced steering effort improves control in slippery conditions. Exhaust valves stay closed for quieter, more composed operation\n- Sport Mode\n- For performance driving, Sport Mode sharpens reflexes with a performance-tuned torque split and more aggressive shift patterns. The transmission delivers quick, firm gear changes, and steering feedback is increased for more direct control. The active exhaust valves open fully, unleashing the full sound signature of the SIXPACK engine\n- Custom Mode\n- Provides drivers the freedom to configure their Charger exactly the way they want it. From propulsion characteristics and paddle shifter behavior to traction settings and steering weight, nearly every aspect of performance can be tailored to individual preference\n- Eco Mode\n- SIXPACK-powered Charger Scat Pack features standard front 380-by-36mm and rear 360-by-32mm ventilated discs and Brembo six-piston front fixed 36mm and rear floating 52mm calipers enhance braking performance and provide brake fade resistance\n- Brake by Wire eBoost intelligent braking system uses a central module to control vehicle deceleration, with optimized response depending on drive mode, and to avoid heat-related system fade and pad wear\n- Charger raises the bar on handling with a purpose-built suspension system designed for serious control. Up front, a multi-link suspension with forged aluminum links, and in the rear, a fully independent 4-link setup: This equates to real world improvements over the previous generation Charger:\n- 10% improvement in steady-state response for faster and more confident cornering\n- 15% improvement in lateral response time or how quickly the vehicle reacts to rapid steering inputs, such as high-performance driving or accident-avoidance maneuvers\n- An impressive 25% improvement in steady-state limit handling balance, significantly reducing understeer and delivering a more neutral, planted feel through corners\n- Performance Pages deliver info on key performance metrics, such as acceleration timers, gauges, g-force and more\n- Body structure of SIXPACK-powered Dodge Charger models features a 55%/45% weight distribution, improving vehicle handling and control, and an increase in overall rigidity, which assists with performance and ride quality, minimizing cabin and driveline vibrations\nWidebody Muscle Design \u2013 Widest Body of Any Car in the Industry\nThe new Dodge Charger exterior is unmistakable \u2013 pure Dodge muscle inspired by heritage, driven by performance. The next-generation Dodge Charger SIXPACK-powered models feature a modern, muscular widebody exterior design with a unique hood, front fascia/grille and exhaust.\nThe SIXPACK Charger performance hood announces its internal-combustion identity with a black SIXPACK-logoed grille-style bezel. The front fascia is unique to SIXPACK-powered models, with a larger, more pronounced grille area than Daytona models. In the back, bright, rolled, stainless-steel exhaust tips are housed in a rear fascia that features a debossed Charger text logo, with Eclipse exhaust tips available with the optional Blacktop Package. A standard Gloss Black rear spoiler on the Scat Pack enhances the drivability at high speeds.\nWheel center caps feature the Fratzog logo, the new symbol of next-gen Dodge performance vehicles.
