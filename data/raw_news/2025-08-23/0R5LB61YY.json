  "title": "Hurricane forecasters track 2 systems, expect Fernand to form",
  "description": "The National Hurricane Center is tracking a system in the Atlantic Ocean south of Bermuda, which could become the next named tropical storm, Fernand.",
  "content": "Hurricane forecasters have turned their attention from Erin to other developing tropical systems in the Atlantic, including one that could become Tropical Storm Fernand and may follow a path similar to Erin's.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is tracking two disturbances, Invest AL90 and Invest AL99 \u2212 so-called as \"invest\" is short for \"investigation\" \u2212 in the Atlantic, with the chance of developing into something stronger. The more likely to do so is Invest AL90, which is expected to develop into a tropical depression and intensify into a tropical storm on Sunday, Aug. 24, as it moves northward, the NHC said in an outlook issued at 8 a.m. ET Saturday, Aug. 23.\n\nAlso being tracked: four more tropical waves in the Caribbean to the east of Invest AL99, which is also a tropical wave located about 850 miles east of the Windward Islands.\n\nForecasters have warned those in Bermuda to monitor the progress of Invest AL90, which is associated with showers and thunderstorms, as it is currently about 500 miles south-southwest of Bermuda, the NHC said. The system has a near 100% chance of formation over the next 48 hours, the NHC said.\n\nThe storm could follow a path similar to that of Hurricane Erin, but is expected to turn northward much sooner, which means it could come close to, or directly hit, Bermuda as a hurricane, according to AccuWeather. \u201cThis storm is expected to produce several inches of rain, wind gusts of 60-80 mph, rough seas and surf and storm surge of several feet,\u201d AccuWeather lead hurricane expert Alex DaSilva said in a forecast.\n\nWhen the system develops into a tropical storm, it will be named Fernand. An Air Force Reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to investigate the system on Saturday afternoon, the NHC said.\n\nThe other disturbance, Invest AL99, made up of disorganized showers and thunderstorms, is located 850 miles east of the Windward Islands. It is expected to bring locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds to parts of the islands, which include Grenada and St. Lucia, but forecasters put its likelihood of development at 20% over the next seven days., the NHC said.\n\nIn addition to Invest AL90 and Invest AL99, the National Hurricane Center is tracking four tropical waves in the Atlantic:\n\u2022 A far eastern Atlantic tropical wave is moving across the Cabo Verde Islands moving west.\n\u2022 A central Atlantic tropical wave, located near Invest AL99, is moving west also.\n\u2022 An eastern Caribbean tropical wave near Puerto Rico to western Venezuela is expected to bring some widely scattered showers and an isolated thunderstorm from near the U.S. Virgin Islands to south of the coast of Puerto Rico to the Mona Passage.\n\u2022 A western Caribbean tropical wave near the Gulf of Honduras through Honduras to far northwest Nicaragua into the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nEach of the tropical waves are moving west and do not pose a threat at this time. However, experts say to be prepared for hurricane season.\n\nA tropical wave in the Pacific, which is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms several hundred miles south of the coast of southwestern Mexico, is expected to become a tropical depression by early next week, the center said. Forecasters give the system, which is moving west-northwesterward, a 40% chance of formation over the next two days and 70% chance over the next seven days.\n\nThe term \"tropical wave\" describes atmospheric conditions, according to AccuWeather.com.\n\nTropical waves are elongated areas, or troughs, of relatively low pressure that move east to west across the tropics, moving westward from Africa into the Atlantic.\n\nA wave can lead to the formation of a tropical cyclone, which in turn may develop into a tropical storm or hurricane, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\n\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reaches 39 miles per hour. When its winds reach 74 mph, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.\n\nDelaying potentially life-saving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" NOAA recommends.\n\u2022 Develop an evacuation plan: If you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\n\u2022 Assemble disaster supplies: Whether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering-in-place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for the potentially lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\n\u2022 Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions: Contact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance check-up to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and/or belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance doesn\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy for it. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent, or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\n\u2022 Create a family communication plan: NOAA said to take the time now to write down your hurricane plan, and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places, and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\n\u2022 Strengthen your home: Now is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricane impacts. Trim trees; install storm shutters, accordion shutters, and/or impact glass; seal outside wall openings.",

      "text": "What is a low pressure area?\nWhen meteorologists use the term: low pressure area, what are they referring to?\nThere are quite a number of scientific terms commonly used in weather forecasting and low pressure is one of the most widely used terms. However, many people may not be exactly sure of what a low pressure area is.\nQuite simply, a low pressure area is a storm. Hurricanes and large-scale rain and snow events (blizzards and nor'easters) in the winter are examples of storms. Thunderstorms, including tornadoes, are examples of small-scale low pressure areas.\nOn a weather map, low pressure areas are label with an \"L\" and high pressure areas are labeled with an \"H.\"\nA low pressure area usually begins to form as air from two regions collides and is forced upward.\nThe rising air creates a giant vacuum effect. Hence, a zone of low pressure is produced with the lowest pressure near the center of the storm.\nAs a storm approaches a particular area, the barometric pressure will lower.\nIn some sensitive people, body aches may be more severe due to the pressure change.\nAs the air in the storm rises, it cools.\nAs the air cools, moisture within the air condenses to form clouds and rain and snow.\nFalling barometric pressure, or the approach of a low pressure area, is often an indicator of rain, ice and snow arriving soon.\nThis satellite image taken Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2015, at 12:45 AM EST shows a strong nor'easter over the Atlantic coast of the United States producing blizzard conditions. Heavy snow and strong winds occurred across much of New England and into New York, New Jersey and the Delmarva Peninsula. (NOAA satellite)\nAs the amount of rising air increases, air must rush in from the sides to replace the rising air near the center of the storm.\nThe more violent the rising air near the center, the faster the air must rush in from the sides. This is what sometimes creates strong winds.\nThe rotation of the Earth creates a force that causes the rushing air coming in from the sides to spin counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.\nIn some rare causes, tornadoes may rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. This is because tornadoes are a very small-scale storm.\nOften as a storm approaches, winds blow from the south or east. Often as a storm departs, winds blow from the west or north.\nThis rotation is what helps to pump warm air in ahead of the storm and draw cold air in behind the storm.\nFor example, in the winter, snow may turn to ice and rain as a storm approaches, then rain may end as snow or flurries as the storm departs.\nHurricanes, typhoons: The most violent large-scale low pressure areas\nIn some of the most violent storms, such as hurricanes, typhoons and Indian Ocean cyclones, a doughnut-shaped area of high winds with rising air occurs near the storm center.\nHowever, right at the center of the storm, the air sinks enough to tame the winds and sometimes cloud-free conditions. This is called the eye of the storm.\nReport a Typo"

      "text": "TROPICAL DEFINITIONS\nTropical Wave\nAn inverted trough (an elongated area of relatively low pressure) or cyclonic curvature maximum moving east to west across the tropics. These can lead to the formation of a tropical cyclone. Also known as an easterly wave.\nTropical Disturbance\nA tropical weather system with organized convection (generally 100-300 miles in diameter) originating in the tropics or subtropics, having a non-frontal migratory character and maintaining its identity for 24 hours or longer. It may or may not be associated with a detectable perturbation of the wind field.\nTropical Cyclone\nA warm-core non-frontal synoptic-scale cyclone, originating over tropical or subtropical waters, with organized deep convection and a closed surface wind circulation about a well-defined center. Once formed, a tropical cyclone is maintained by the extraction of heat energy from the ocean at high temperature and heat export at the low temperatures of the upper troposphere. In this they differ from extratropical cyclones, which derive their energy from horizontal temperature contrasts in the atmosphere (baroclinic effects).\nPotential Tropical Cyclone (PTC)\nA term used in NWS advisory products to describe a disturbance that is not yet a tropical cyclone, BUT which poses the threat of bringing tropical storm or hurricane conditions to land areas within 48 hours.\nInvest\nA weather system for which a tropical cyclone forecast center (NHC, CPHC, or JTWC) is interested in collecting specialized data sets and/or running model guidance. The designation of a system as an invest does not correspond to any particular likelihood of development of the system into a tropical cyclone.\nExtratropical Cyclone\nA cyclone (of any intensity) for which the primary energy source is baroclinic (i.e., results from the temperature contrast between warm & cold air masses).\nPost-Tropical Cyclone\nA cyclone that no longer possesses sufficient tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone. Post-tropical cyclones can continue to carry heavy rains and high winds. Note: former tropical cyclones that become extratropical and remnant lows are 2 specific classes of post-tropical cyclones.\nRemnant Low\nA post-tropical cyclone that no longer possesses the convective organization required of a tropical cyclone and has maximum sustained winds of less than 34 knots.\nSubtropical Cyclone\nA non-frontal low pressure system that has characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones. Subtropical cyclones originate over tropical or subtropical waters and have a closed circulation about a well-defined center. In comparison to tropical cyclones, the maximum winds occur relatively far from the center (greater than 60 nautical miles) and have a less symmetric wind field and distribution of convection.\nTropical Depression\nA tropical cyclone that has maximum sustained surface winds (one-minute average) of 38 mph (33 knots) or less.\nTropical Storm\nA tropical cyclone that has maximum sustained surface winds ranging from 39-73 mph (34 to 63 knots).\nHurricane\nA hurricane is a tropical cyclone that has maximum sustained surface winds of 74 mph or greater (64 knots or greater).\nMajor Hurricane\nA hurricane that is classified as Category 3 or higher.\nNOTE: The number of Tropical Storms and Hurricanes increases substantially in August, peaks in mid-September and decreases towards a minimum by early November.\nEye Wall\nAn organized band of cumulonimbus clouds immediately surrounding the center of the tropical cyclone.\nRapid Intensification\nAn increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots in a 24 hour period.\nLandfall\nThe intersection of the surface center of a tropical cyclone with a coastline. Because the strongest winds in a tropical cyclone are not located precisely at the center, it is possible for a cyclone's strongest winds to be experienced over land even if landfall does not occur. Similarly, it is possible for a tropical cyclone to make landfall and have its strongest winds remain over the water.\nStorm Surge\nAn abnormal rise in sea level accompanying a tropical cyclone. This is the difference in height between observed level of the sea surface and the level that would have occurred in the absence of the storm. Storm surge is usually estimated by subtracting the normal or astronomical tide from the observed storm tide.\nStorm Tide\nThe actual level of sea water resulting from the astronomic tide combined with the storm surge.\nInundation\nThe flooding of normally dry land, primarily caused by events along the coasts, estuaries, and adjoining rivers. The winds drive large waves and storm surge on shore, and heavy rains raise rivers.\nTropical Storm Watch\nA Tropical Storm Watch is issued when Tropical Storm conditions, including winds of 39-73 mph, pose a POSSIBLE threat to a specified coastal area within 48 hours.\nTropical Storm Warning\nA Tropical Storm Warning is issued when Tropical Storm conditions, including winds of 39-73 mph, are EXPECTED in a specified coastal area within 36 hours or less.\nHurricane Watch\nA Hurricane Watch is issued when sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are POSSIBLE within the specified area of the Watch. Because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force, the Watch is issued 48 hours in advance of the onset of tropical storm force winds.\nHurricane Warning\nA Hurricane Warning is issued when sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are EXPECTED somewhere within the specified area of the Warning. Because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force, the Warning is issued 36 hours in advance of the onset of tropical storm force winds.\nNOTE: A Hurricane Warning can remain in effect when dangerously high water or a combination of dangerously high water and exceptionally high waves continues...even if the winds have subsided below hurricane intensity.\nExtreme Wind Warning\nExtreme Wind Warning (EWW) is issued for sustained surface winds of 115 mph or greater from a MAJOR Hurricane (Category 3, 4, or 5) are expected within the next hour. This is usually associated with the eyewall of a major hurricane and is considered your final call to shelter in place.\nStorm Surge Watch\nThe POSSIBILITY of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area, generally within 48 hours, in association with an ongoing or potential tropical cyclones, a subtropical cyclone or a post-tropical cyclone. The watch may be issued earlier when other conditions, such as the onset of tropical-storm-force winds are expected to limit the time available to take protective actions for surge (e.g., evacuations). The warning may also be issued for locations not expected to receive life-threatening inundation but which could potentially be isolated by inundation in adjacent areas.\nStorm Surge Warning\nThe DANGER of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area, generally within 36 hours, in association with an ongoing or potential tropical cyclones, a subtropical cyclone or a post-tropical cyclone. The warning may be issued earlier when other conditions, such as the onset of tropical storm force winds are expected to limit the time available to take protective actions for surge (e.g., evacuations). The warning may also be issued for locations not expected to receive life-threatening inundation but which could potentially be isolated by inundation in adjacent areas."

      "text": "How to Make a Family Disaster Plan\n07/22/2025\nPlan | Stay Safe \u2022 Earthquakes | Extreme Heat | Floods | Hail | Hurricanes | Lightning | Tornadoes | Tsunamis | Winter Storms\nWhere will your family or household be when disaster strikes? If you are not together when an emergency happens, will everyone know how to stay in contact \u2014 even if cell towers are down and phones don\u2019t work? Do you have a meeting place and will everyone have a way to get there?\nTo develop a family disaster plan, start by mapping out contact methods and meeting places. Then share and practice your plan with your family or household and out-of-town contact. While you develop your plan, keep in mind these specific household needs:\n- Ages of household members\n- Medical needs like prescriptions and equipment\n- Disabilities or access and functional needs\n- Dietary needs\n- Pets or service animals\n- Languages spoken\nAfter you make your plan, all you need to do is revisit and communicate your plan regularly so you\u2019re ready when disaster strikes.\nBuild your plan\n- Write it down.\n- Create a document with the contact information for your family, close friends, designated out-of-town contact, employers, and other service providers like doctors, schools, etc.\n- Plan to communicate.\n- Plan how to communicate with family or friends when disaster strikes.\n- Discuss the benefits of calling, texting, emailing, or using social media. Texting tends to work more reliably than calling, especially when systems are in high demand.\n- Determine how your family will receive emergency updates and alerts.\n- Choose a meeting place.\n- Pick two places to meet your family or household members.\n- Meet outside your home in case of a sudden emergency or at a friend's or neighbor's house in case you can't return home.\n- Ensure that these places are reachable for those with access and functional needs and that your pets are welcome.\n- Share the address and phone number for each of your meet-up locations.\n- Add the information to your phone\u2019s contacts and list them in your plan.\n- Plan to evacuate.\n- If an evacuation is necessary, determine where you will evacuate and how you will get there.\n- If you plan to shelter-in-place, identify the safest location in your home to shelter during a disaster.\n- Identify emergency contact(s).\n- Ask an out-of-town family member or friend to be your emergency contact.\n- Ensure everyone in your household knows the contact\u2019s name, location, phone number, email, and any social media contact options.\n- Schedule a meeting.\n- Set a meeting with your household to talk about the types of disasters and hazards you might face.\n- Work together and share responsibilities as a team.\nKnow your plan\nSend links to your disaster plan and make copies for all family or household members and emergency contacts. Post a copy in a prominent place in your home like a bulletin board.\nPractice the plan\nRegularly gather your family or household members to review and practice your plan. Discuss what information you would communicate during a disaster and send practice messages. Make sure all family members (including children) understand how and when to call 911.\nUpdate your communication plan at least once a year or whenever information changes.\nSpecial Considerations for Families with Children\nA natural disaster is often devastating for adults, but children can be especially vulnerable to stress and anxiety when disaster strikes. Prepare your children before a disaster and plan activities to keep them busy during and after an emergency.\nGetting kids involved in the planning process and letting them plan activities will distribute the workload and give your family a sense of control.\nPreparing Your Children for Disasters\n- Learn what types of emergencies are possible where you live, teach your children about them, and discuss the steps you\u2019ve taken to protect your family and home.\n- Discuss emergencies that may require evacuation, such as a hurricane, and shelter-in-place emergencies, such as a tornado.\n- Include your children when creating your family communication plans and building a disaster supply kit.\n- Have a disaster drill and practice your plan, making sure to give your children a role and way to participate.\n- Prepare fun, kid-friendly activities and games to keep them occupied. Choose games that they do not ordinarily play, so they have something special to enjoy.\n- Select activities that do not require power so you can conserve your batteries and back-up power sources.\nMore Resources"

      "text": "Hurricane names listed for 2025 Atlantic season\nThe 2025 Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1, but we already know what all the storms will be named.\nThe list of storm names is created by the World Meteorological Organization well in advance of the hurricane season. But we don't yet know how many storms will form this year, or how strong they will be.\nCould there be a Tropical Storm Andrea, or perhaps a Hurricane Karen in our future? How about Tropical Depression Jerry?\nHow bad will the 2025 hurricane season be? It's too soon to say for sure, but forecasters have started the year with some good news.\nA tropical storm gets a name when its sustained winds reach 39 mph; it becomes a hurricane when its winds reach 74 mph.\nA typical Atlantic hurricane season averages about 14 tropical storms, seven of which spin into hurricanes, based on weather records that date from 1991 to 2020.\nForecasts about the predicted severity of the 2025 hurricane season will be coming out in the weeks and months ahead from private, university and government groups.\nHere is the list of names for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season\nThe names are given out in alphabetical order, and each new storm gets the next name on the list. There are no Q, U, X, Y, or Z names because of the lack of names that begin with those letters.\nHow bad will the 2025 hurricane season be?

The eastern Pacific season begins on May 15, more than two weeks earlier than the Atlantic season.\nThere is also a separate list of names for Central Pacific hurricanes, which can occasionally hit or impact Hawaii. In addition, there are separate lists for typhoons in the western Pacific and tropical cyclones in Australia and the Indian Ocean.\nWhy \u2013 and how \u2013 do hurricanes get names?\nBefore hurricane forecasters started naming storms, they had to refer to storms by saying something like \"the storm 500 miles east-southeast of Miami.\" But six hours later, the storm's position would change.\nAlso, when more than one storm was going on at the same time, making it clear which storm was being described made the job even harder.\nHow bad will the 2025 hurricane season be? It's too soon to say for sure, but forecasters have started the year with some good news.\nIn 1953, the U.S. began using female names for hurricanes. By 1979, male and female names were being used. The names alternate between male and female.\nThe World Meteorological Organization, based in Geneva, chooses hurricane names several years in advance, based on strict criteria. If a hurricane is particularly deadly or costly, its name is \"retired\" by the WMO and replaced by another one."

      "text": "Prepare now for hurricanes, Trump warns. Here's what you should do.\nNOAA says the best time to prepare for oncoming storms is now \u2013 well before the official start of Hurricane season.\nNational Hurricane Preparedness Week was designated by President Donald Trump on May 5, a reminder that deadly hurricanes will soon be brewing.\nThe Atlantic Hurricane season starts June 1. Presidents dating back to at least George W. Bush have issued proclamations about the preparedness week tradition, which warns of danger ahead.\nAccording to Trump's latest proclamation, this is \"a time to raise awareness about the dangers of these storms and encourage citizens in coastal areas and inland communities to be vigilant in emergency planning and preparation.\"Yet another active year is predicted, with as many as 17 named storms possible, according to a forecast from Colorado State University experts.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says the best time to prepare for oncoming storms is now \u2013 well before the official start of the season. \"Take action TODAY to be better prepared for when the worst happens. Understand your risk from hurricanes, and begin pre-season preparations now.\"\nDelaying potentially life-saving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" NOAA recommends.\nHere are five things you should do now:\n1. Develop an evacuation plan\nIf you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\nYou do not need to travel hundreds of miles. Your destination could be a friend or relative who lives in a well-built home outside flood prone areas. Plan several routes and be sure to account for your pets.\n2. Assemble disaster supplies\nWhether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering-in-place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for the potentially lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\nHave enough non-perishable food, water and medicine to last each person in your family a minimum of three days (store a longer than 3-day supply of water, if possible). Electricity and water could be out for weeks. You\u2019ll need extra cash, a battery-powered radio and flashlights. You may need a portable crank or solar-powered USB charger for your cell phones. And lastly, don\u2019t forget your pets!\n3. Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions\nContact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance check-up to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and/or belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance doesn\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy for it. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent, or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\nAlso take the time before hurricane season begins to document your possessions: photos, serial numbers, or anything else that you may need to provide your insurance company when filing a claim.\n4. Create a family communication plan\nNOAA said to take the time now to write down your hurricane plan, and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places, and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\nWrite down on paper a list of emergency contacts, and make sure to include utilities and other critical services \u2013 remember, the Internet may not be accessible during or after a storm.\n5. Strengthen your home\nNow is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricane impacts. Trim trees; install storm shutters, accordion shutters, and/or impact glass; seal outside wall openings.\nRemember, the garage door is the most vulnerable part of the home, so it must be able to withstand hurricane-force winds. Many retrofits are not as costly or time consuming as you may think, NOAA said.\nIf you\u2019re a renter, work with your landlord now to prepare for a storm.\nAnd remember \u2013 now is the time to purchase the proper plywood, steel or aluminum panels to have on hand if you need to board up the windows and doors ahead of an approaching storm."

      "text": "What does fierce Hurricane Erin mean for the rest of the season?\nHurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, briefly reached Catagory 5 status. What does the intense storm mean for the rest of the 2025?\nHurricane Erin, a major storm that is forecast to churn offshore of the East Coast of the United States for the next several days, briefly attained Category 5 status on Aug. 16 as it intensified in the Atlantic.\nCategory 5 hurricanes are the rarest of storms, with only a small fraction of all tropical cyclones reaching that intense wind speed of 157 mph or more.\nCould this Category 5 storm \u2013 among the earliest on record \u2013 be a harbinger of a potentially catastrophic season to come? USA TODAY reached out to experts for their take on the question.\nIs Erin a sign of a potentially catastrophic hurricane season to come?\n\u201cErin's rapid intensification to Cat 5 does not mean potentially more Cat 5 hurricanes this year,\" said Yonggang Liu, an associate professor of physical oceanography at the University of South Florida and director of its Ocean Circulation Lab.\nColorado State University research scientist Levi Silvers, in an e-mail to USA TODAY, said that Erin's Cat 5 status doesn't affect the forecast for the rest of the season overall.\n\"Based on the atmospheric conditions and warm sea-surface temperature we do expect an above-average season. This includes a forecast of additional major hurricanes,\" he said. \"The rapid intensification of Erin to a Category 5 hurricane was a bit startling to see, but it does not change our forecast.\"\nDan Brown, branch chief of the hurricane specialists at the National Hurricane Center, shared similar thoughts with USA TODAY: \"There is little correlation between the occurrence of a Category 5 hurricane and the overall activity of the season.\"\nBrown pointed to two previous seasons for comparison.\n\"In 1992, the first hurricane of the season was Category 5 Hurricane Andrew, but that storm was the only major hurricane in the Atlantic basin that year and only seven named storms formed overall,\" he said. \"In contrast, during the 2024 hurricane season, Beryl became a Category 5 hurricane in July and four additional major hurricanes formed that year with a total of 18 named storms.\"\nThe most recent Colorado State University forecast, released earlier in August, calls for a total of a total of eight hurricanes in 2025, of which three are predicted to be major. Based on that forecast, seven hurricanes could still be expected to form in the remainder of 2025, of which two could be major.\nSilvers also clarified the definition of a \"catastrophic season.\"\n\"Unfortunately, it only takes one intense hurricane making landfall in a vulnerable region to result in a catastrophic season,\" he said. \"Fortunately, Erin is not forecast to make landfall.\"\nBrown agreed, saying \"the most important lesson is to remember it only takes one hurricane to affect you for it to be a bad year where you live.\"\n\"As we approach the peak of the hurricane season, now is the time to find out if you live in an evacuation zone and make sure you have a hurricane plan in place,\" Brown said.\nIs there any correlation between Cat 5s in August and activity in the remainder of the season?\nSilvers said he's \"not aware of a correlation between Category 5s in August and later season activity.\" But he added: \"Since we still have not reached the climatological peak of the hurricane season, we do expect a lot of further activity.\"\nThe climatological peak of the season is usually around Sept. 10, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nOverall, Silvers concluded that \"one of the difficulties with this type of correlation is the small number of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes that occur in August. They are certainly not unprecedented, but they are rare, and this makes calculating robust statistical relationships difficult.\"\nHow fast did Hurricane Erin intensify?\nHurricane Erin's wind speeds rocketed Aug. 16. Erin, the fifth named storm of this season, quickly exceeded expectations after undergoing a period of strengthening the hurricane center refers to as \"rapid intensification.\"\nErin's burst of intensification will be among the most rapid ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean.\nIts winds increased 45 mph in just 12 hours overnight on Friday, Aug. 15, from 75 mph to 120 mph. Ultimately, its wind speeds increased a total of 80 mph in just 18 hours.\nHurricane Milton last year surpassed that mark. In a postseason summary of the 2024 hurricane season, NOAA reported Milton's rate of intensification \u2013 90 mph in 24 hours in October 2024 \u2013 was \"among the highest ever observed.\"\nAt least two other hurricanes have exceeded that increase. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma's winds increased 125 mph in 24 hours. In 2007, wind speeds in Hurricane Felix increased by 100 mph in 24 hours.\nHow common are Cat 5s?\nNOAA's database shows slightly more than 40 hurricanes on record have reached wind speeds of 157 mph or more, the minimum threshold for a Category 5 hurricane. However, records show there has been at least one Category 5 hurricane every year since 2022.\nErin became the 11th Category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic since 2016. That is 11 in just nine years, according to University of Oklahoma student and hurricane mapmaker Michael Ferragamo.\nThat's the highest number of Cat 5 hurricanes recorded in a nine-year timeframe on record in a comprehensive database compiled by federal researchers, including the Hurricane Research Division of NOAA's Atlantic and Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory. The database, which dates to 1851, is supported by decades of research into storm records, including ships logs and other historical accounts from the 19th century.\nBy decade, there have been eight Category 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic during the first two decades of this century. There have been five since 2020. Before this century, the greatest number of Cat 5s occurred in the 1930s, when there were six, and the 1960s, when there were five.\nOcean temperatures can contribute to storm strength\nOcean temperatures \u2013 at the surface and below the surface \u2013 can contribute to the rapid intensification of storms, the experts said.\nRecent ocean data indicates Erin may be getting fuel from subsurface temperatures in the ocean, Liu said. \"Subsurface ocean temperature information is critical,\" he added.\nThe latest data indicates temperatures are climbing in the upper layer of the ocean and at the surface.\nThe heat content in the upper layer of the ocean in the main region of the Atlantic where hurricanes develop is lower than at this time last year, but still warmer than normal.\nSea surface temperatures also have warmed in mid-August.\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\nUSA TODAY journalists Doyle Rice and Dinah Voyles Pulver have covered hurricanes and other violent weather for decades.

      "text": "Next Atlantic tropical storm, hurricane in the making following Erin\nA tropical rainstorm moving north of the Leeward Islands is forecast to strengthen and could become the next hurricane in the Atlantic after Erin, with Bermuda potentially in its path.\nThere are two systems in the Atlantic that forecasters are closely watching for potential development into tropical storms right after the impacts of Hurricane Erin.\nA tropical rainstorm is likely to evolve into a named tropical storm, and potentially a hurricane, during the coming days in the central Atlantic, AccuWeather meteorologists warn. Additional areas are also being closely monitored for development in the wake of Hurricane Erin.\nThe next names on the queue of tropical storms and hurricanes for the 2025 Atlantic season are Fernand, Gabrielle and Humberto.\nRainstorm to strengthen before reaching Bermuda\n\"We expect this cluster of downpours and thunderstorm squalls to strengthen to a tropical storm over the weekend as it moves north of the Leeward Islands,\" AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said.\nThe Leeward Islands are a chain in the northeastern Caribbean, stretching from Dominica and Guadeloupe northward to the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.\nImpacts in the Leewards from this system are expected to be less significant than those from Erin. While this rainstorm is more spread out than Erin at this very early stage, its forecast track will steer most showers and thunderstorms away from the islands, rather than parallel across them.\nPuerto Rico should experience little to no direct impact from the tropical rainstorm, though a few indirect showers and thunderstorms may occur.\nBecause this system is forecast to turn northward much sooner than Erin, it raises the potential for a close approach or direct strike to Bermuda, possibly as a hurricane.\n\u201cThis storm is expected to produce several inches of rain, wind gusts of 60-80 mph, rough seas and surf and storm surge of several feet,\u201d AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said\nWaters along the projected path of the rainstorm are warm enough to help it strengthen into a tropical storm and potentially a hurricane.\nThe magnitude of impacts on Bermuda early next week will depend on the storm\u2019s exact track and intensity as it approaches this weekend and moves past the islands early next week. For example, if the track of the storm shifts much farther to the east, forecast conditions may vastly improve in Bermuda, even if the storm is more intense.\nBeyond Bermuda, the storm may track close enough to Newfoundland, Canada, to bring rough seas, strong winds and heavy rain during the middle of next week.\n\u201cBecause the storm is forecast to track much farther east than Erin and is likely to be smaller in overall size, indirect impacts should be significantly less than Erin\u2019s,\" AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said.\nAccuWeather tracking additional areas for potential tropical development\nA tropical wave of low pressure is tracking much farther south across the Atlantic than the most recent tropical rainstorm. On its current path, the disturbance is expected to move through the Windward Islands, in the southeastern Caribbean, and could later brush the northern coast of South America.\n\u201cThis tropical wave moving through the Atlantic\u2019s main development region has only a limited window for development over the next few days before encountering dry air and hostile atmospheric conditions,\u201d AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said.\nTropical storm possible near US in late August to early September\nThere is a low risk of tropical development late next week off the Southeast coast of the Atlantic and in the western Gulf.\n\u201cA front that will first deliver cooler, less humid conditions to much of the Southeast next week is forecast to stall near the Atlantic and Gulf coasts,\u201d AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said. \u201cThis stalled boundary could provide the focus for homegrown tropical development near the coastline from the end of the month into early September.\u201d\nHurricane Erin left behind a corridor of cooler water in its wake over the Atlantic, but sea-surface temperatures are expected to rebound during the next week or two.\n\u201cBy late next week, the Atlantic should again be warm enough to support tropical development, while the Gulf remains sufficiently warm for formation west of Florida,\u201d AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said.\nThe first part of September could also bring an active stretch of downpours in the Northeast, in part due to an increase in moisture originating from the tropics. Humidity levels will rebound significantly following the late-August cool spell, especially through much of next week.\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

      "text": "Will a hurricane impact your state in 2025? A final forecast has been released.\nTop experts from Colorado State University are still maintaining their prediction of a slightly above-average season.\nTop experts from Colorado State University released their final planned forecast for the Atlantic hurricane season on Aug. 6, including a state-by-state look at upcoming hurricane risk.\nOverall, the outlook maintains a prediction of a slightly above-average season of 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. A major hurricane has wind speeds of at least 111 mph.\nA \"normal\" year sees 14 named storms, of which seven become hurricanes.\n\"We're keeping the forecast the same as what we predicted in early July\" (16 named storms of which 8 become hurricanes), Colorado State meteorologist Phil Klotzbach told USA TODAY. This includes the four storms that have already formed.\nThe news comes as August brings a pivot point in hurricane season and increased tropical activity in the Atlantic.\nTropical Atlantic is now warm enough for hurricanes\nAccording to the updated forecast, the tropical Atlantic has warmed faster than normal over the past few weeks. \"When the waters in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean Sea are warmer than normal, it tends to favor an above-average season, since a hurricane\u2019s fuel source is warm ocean water. Additionally, a warm Atlantic leads to lower atmospheric pressure and a more unstable atmosphere. Both conditions favor hurricane formation,\" the forecast said.\n\"Water temperatures are pretty much warm enough everywhere in the tropical Atlantic to support hurricane formation,\" Klotzbach told USA TODAY.\nIn addition, the Colorado State team anticipates \"a slightly above-average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean for the remainder of the hurricane season.\"\nHurricane risk by state\nThe updated forecast includes a state-by-state look at hurricane risk. Those calculations predict the chances of a storm passing within 50 miles of the state.\nPer usual, the highest risk is in Florida, which faces an 89% chance of being impacted by a tropical storm and a 61% chance of being impacted by a hurricane.\nWill your state be impacted by a hurricane? Here's what to know about the risk in 2025, according to the new outlook:\nWill a hurricane impact Alabama in 2025?\nIn Alabama, there's a 63% storm chance and a 31% hurricane chance.

      "text": "Elusive rainbow snake spotted by residents in Florida: See pictures\nFWC research scientist Kevin Enge said the commission received approximately 30 reports since the wildlife commission's press release was put out.\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has received at least a dozen credible rainbow snake sightings since it sought the public's assistance in documenting the elusive reptiles.\nFWC research scientist Kevin Enge told USA TODAY over email on Friday, Aug. 22, that the commission received approximately 30 reports since its news release was put out. However, out of those, only 12 were credible, and only eight had photos that allowed confirmation of the species. Enge said more reports were also received, but they \"were not rainbow snakes based on photos, descriptions, or locations.\"\nWhile two reports were of rainbow snakes on the same driveway at night in a new subdivision in Yulee, Nassau County, albeit in different months, three other reports were from Wakulla County, with one of them being at the spring-fed Wakulla River boat launch on U.S. Hwy 98, a FWC environmental DNA sampling site.\nEnge said the most interesting rainbow snake sighting was under a boat motor on a sand bar on the lower Ochlockonee River, near Sopchoppy, about 35 miles south of Tallahassee.\nAnother sighting occurred in a small tributary of the Escambia River near Century in Escambia County, about 200 miles west of Tallahassee. Florida resident Roy Gebhard spotted the snake at a bridge crossing, which also happens to be a popular party spot, prompting him to move it downstream away from people, he told FWC.\nGebhard noted the animal did not attempt to bite him and was possibly hunting for eels in the area.\nSee pictures of rainbow snake sightings in Florida\nAre rainbow snakes under threat?\nThe elusive rainbow snake, scientifically known as Farancia erytrogramma, is a nonvenomous species whose population has declined in recent decades, according to the FWC. Their populations have been affected by habitat loss and declining food sources. Rainbow snakes primarily feed on American eels, a prey species that has also declined in Florida waters due to overfishing and dams, according to the wildlife commission.\nEnge told USA TODAY the common rainbow snake is found along streams and in tidal marshes in the Coastal Plain from southeastern Maryland to southeastern Louisiana. The snake is locally common in some streams from Virginia to Georgia along the Atlantic. However, snakes in the northern part of their range have been dying from snake fungal disease, raising concerns about the species\u2019 long-term survival.\nThe rainbow snake was officially last documented in 2020, FWC spokesperson Jonathan Veach told USA TODAY on Aug. 18. However, Veach added that other rainbow snake sightings in Florida since 2020 were possible, but either \"weren't reported, or we never learned of them.\"\nRainbow snake features\nWith bright and colorful scales, rainbow snakes are visually striking and can easily be identified. They are usually an iridescent black or violet-blue and have three red stripes along their back, with their lip and chin scales yellow, marked with violet spots, according to the commission. Adult snakes typically reach 3 to 4 feet in length.\nThese semiaquatic reptiles are usually \"found in or near water, including rivers, springs and brackish marshes,\" the commission says, adding that a south Florida subspecies was historically found in Fisheating Creek in Glades County, more than 150 miles south of the nearest known population in Lake County. However, that species has not been documented since 1952, and researchers are hoping to confirm their existence.\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle\nHow to report a rainbow snake sighting\nEnge said that while rainbow snake sightings are sometimes posted on social media, \"There has been no previous effort to solicit sightings from the public.\"\n\"Scientists rarely find rainbow snakes in Florida, but there are a lot of people fishing, boating, and swimming in our streams that can serve as our eyes,\" Enge said. \u201cWe need help from Floridians and visitors to better understand where rainbow snakes still occur in the state. Every sighting report gives us valuable data about their current distribution and helps us assess the health of the species in Florida.\u201d\nRainbow snakes are highly secretive and are rarely seen. They can occasionally be found crossing roads between bodies of water, usually on rainy nights, according to the University of Florida's Florida Museum.\n\"Swimmers and divers occasionally report seeing them slowly crawling along the bottom of clear, spring-fed rivers,\" the museum said.\nThe FWC is requesting those who spot a rainbow snake to report the sighting to the commission online.\n\"Photographs are especially helpful in confirming sightings and can be included when you submit your sighting online,\" the commission said. \"By sharing sightings, the public can play an important role in conserving this unique species.\"\nHow many people are bitten by snakes per year?\nWhile rainbow snakes are not venomous, snake bites are not uncommon in the United States, with approximately 7,000 to 8,000 people bitten by venomous snakes across the country annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAbout five people die from venomous snake bites in the United States each year, the CDC says, warning that the number would be higher if those bitten did not seek medical treatment.\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

We love you!\" one Instagram commenter said.\nWho is the man in the old Cracker Barrel logo?\nAccording to Cracker Barrel's website, the man in its old logo is not a specific person, but rather a representation of the brand.\n\"There\u2019s an image of a man relaxing by a cracker barrel, representing the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories,\" the website says. \"Our logo reflects our roots and the warm, welcoming atmosphere we\u2019ve always aimed to create.\"\nIn addition, the old logo featured the Cracker Barrel name up against a pinto bean shape, which was a nod to one of the restaurant's original sides, its website said.\nDan Evins, Cracker Barrel's founder, enlisted the help of Nashville-based designer Bill Holley to create the logo. Holley \"sketched his first draft of the Cracker Barrel logo on a napkin,\" according to the company.\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Weakened Hurricane Erin heads away from US, leaving flooding along East Coast\nAs Hurricane Erin moves away from the East Coast on Aug. 22, it leaves behind flooded-out and sand-covered roads, eroded beaches and dangerous waters for beachgoers.\nSome of the hardest hit areas were along the Outer Banks barrier islands of North Carolina, where waves crashed into beachfront homes and made a major road impassable. A state of emergency was also declared in New Jersey on Aug. 21 in preparation for flood impacts and high winds as Erin made its up the coast out at sea.\nDozens of people had to be rescued from stranded vehicles and restaurants as floodwaters rose in Margate City on the Jersey Shore, authorities there said the evening of Aug. 21.\nErin made a turn to the northeast and was finally moving away from the United States as a weakened Category 1 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm passed as close as about 200 miles from the North Carolina coast.\nThough Erin has weakened, dangerous surf conditions and rip currents remain a threat at beaches along much of the East Coast, forecasters said.\n\u201cIt may seem like a nice beach day, with sunshine and blue skies as the storm goes out to sea, but powerful rip currents will be lurking in the water through Saturday,\" AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said.\n50 people, 3 dogs rescued from Hurricane Erin floodwaters in NJ\nPhotos from Margate City, New Jersey, show cars stuck on roads covered in water and people standing in ankle-to-calf-deep floodwaters.\nThe Margate City Fire Department said in a late Aug. 21 update that it rescued 50 people and three dogs. Sixteen people and the dogs were rescued from vehicles, and 34 people were rescued from two restaurants that were flooded.\nThe department was also busy dealing with a gas leak, a transformer fire and an electrical fire at a business during the height of Erin's flooding.\nHurricane Erin produces coastal flooding in the East\nOn the Outer Banks, at a gauge on the beach at Duck, North Carolina, the National Weather Service said the high water level at high tide on Aug. 21 reached 6.97 inches. The water level was about 9 inches below the previous record, set in 2003 during Hurricane Isabel.\nRoads in the Outer Banks between Oregon Inlet and Ocracoke are expected to remain impassable, especially during morning and evening times of high tide, the weather service in Newport and Morehead City, North Carolina, said on Aug. 22. Damaged dune structures and large swells will contribute to continued flooding, the weather service said.\nHighway 12, a crucial artery in the Outer Banks, has already experienced additional dune breaches during high tide the morning of Aug. 22, the North Carolina Department of Transportation said. Portions of the highway remain closed, but there is so far no indication of pavement damage, the department said.\nIn New Jersey, coastal flooding closed U.S. 40 in both directions in Pleasantville, near Atlantic City, the weather service said on Aug. 21. Flooding also closed lanes of a road in North Wildwood, New Jersey. And in Ocean City, flooding began in coastal areas before high tide arrived, flooding 8th and 9th streets near the boardwalk.\nIn Delaware, the water washed over the tops of dunes and caused some beach erosion on the north side of Indian River Inlet in Sussex, according to the weather service.\nRip currents remain a dangerous threat at East Coast beaches\nThe rip current risk remains high along much of the East Coast, and the hurricane center said swimming is likely to continue to be dangerous for the next couple days.\n\u201cEven as Erin pushes out into the open Atlantic, dangerous conditions are expected at many beaches heading into the weekend. Do not let your guard down if you\u2019re spending time at the beach on Friday or Saturday,\u201d DaSilva said.\nRip currents accounted for about 10 to 15% of all fatalities from tropical storms or hurricanes in the U.S. in the last decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The fast-moving channels of water can drag swimmers away from shore and tire them out.\nBeaches in several East Coast states including North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, and others remained closed to swimmers on Aug. 22.\nMore in store in the tropics\nErin's departure may not mean a break in tropical impacts to the U.S. for very long. Hurricane forecasters are eyeing three developing systems in the Atlantic, including a developing tropical wave that could become the next named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season, Fernand.\nThat system has an 80% chance of cyclone formation within a week and a 70% chance of formation in the next 48 hours, the hurricane center said. It's currently located a couple hundred miles away from the northern Leeward Islands. It's likely to form into a tropical depression over the weekend, and if the depression's winds reach 39 mph, it would be the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season.\nIt's too soon to determine if it'll impact the U.S. Forecasters said it could turn northwestward and then northward.\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Dinah Voyles Pulver, Thao Nguyen and Jorge L.

      "text": "Gender-neutral baby names? BabyCenter releases 40 names popular with both genders\nFrom Avery to Yuri, parents are increasingly choosing gender-neutral names for their children. New data from BabyCenter reveals eight names, including Blake, Jojo and Sidney are suitable for both boys and girls. Additionally, there are 32 more names, such as Armani, Georgie, Rory, and Tatum that are used almost equally for both genders.\n\"From current megastars like Blake Lively to historical literary icons like Jules Verne, gender-neutral names are a thing of both the past and present,\" stated BabyCenter in a news release. \"And it looks like the trend isn't going away any time soon.\"\nThe list was compiled based on tens of thousands of entries received from parents who track their pregnancies with BabyCenter and register their babies' names with it each year, giving \"editors a unique glimpse into which names are actually being used equally (or very, very close to it) between baby boys and baby girls,\" according to the company.\nThe eight names that achieved exactly equal registrations between the genders are:\n- Blake: The name has two meanings - from the Old English word blaec, meaning \"black,\" and from the Old English word blac, meaning \"white\" or \"pale.\"\n- Jojo: A nickname for names beginning with \"Jo-,\" including Hebrew-rooted names like Jonathan (\"God has given\") and Joanne (\"God is gracious\").\n- Jules: Another nickname, usually short for Julian and Julia, which shares the same Latin root and may be tied to Jupiter, the Roman king of the gods.\n- Koi: Rooted in Japanese, the name is a word for a kind of fish, but can also mean \"love\" depending on which kanji, or characters, are used to spell it.\n- Landry: With French and English origins, one of the meanings of the name is \"ruler of the land.\"\n- Robin: While the name is also associated with a backyard bird that announces the arrival of spring, it is also an archaic nickname for Robert, a Germanic name meaning \"bright, famous one.\"\n- Sidney: While the name is another Old English word translating to \"dweller by the well-watered land,\" Sydney is a popular variation that happens to be the name of one of Australia's largest cities.\n- Sri: A Sanskrit name with multiple meanings, such as \"light, beauty, and prosperity,\" and \"power and royal majesty.\" It's sometimes used as an honor in Hindu culture and is another name for the goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswati.\nIn addition to the \"eight truly gender-neutral names, 32 more come close to being used equally for boys and girls,\" BabyCenter said.

      "text": "Sharks vs. hurricanes? Scientists say predators can help track huge storms.\nResearchers are looking at how sharks can help gather ocean data for improved hurricane predictions by using sharks as freely moving ocean monitors.\nIt's not a schlocky TV movie or teams in a hockey game. Sharks vs. hurricanes is real science.\nResearchers are looking at how sharks can help gather ocean data for improved hurricane predictions by using the predators as freely moving monitors by putting sensor tags on them. The goal is that the sharks will gather temperature and other data that will go toward improving hurricane forecasting \u2013 data that's challenging or expensive to get elsewhere.\n\"By attaching these tags ... to sharks, which are wide-ranging, mobile predators, we will be able to observe a much larger part of the ocean that typically remains unobserved,\" said marine ecologist Aaron Carlisle of the University of Delaware in an email to USA TODAY.\nHe said it's not so much that we can't obtain such data using other means (such as vessels or autonomous vehicles), it's that those other platforms are very expensive and are limited in where they can go. In addition, \"remote sensing via satellite-based sensors only looks at the surface, and it is what is going on below the surface that is really critical for many oceanographic/climate processes (such as hurricanes).\"\nWater temps drive hurricane formation\nAccording to Carlisle, water temperature and how it changes with depth is what drives ocean heat content, and that is generally what drives hurricanes in the Atlantic. He said salinity is important, too, but is less crucial. Indeed, according to the National Weather Service, the first condition for hurricane formation is that ocean waters must be above 79 degrees.\n\"Below this threshold temperature, hurricanes will not form or will weaken rapidly once they move over water below this threshold. Ocean temperatures in the tropical East Pacific and the tropical Atlantic routinely surpass this threshold,\" the weather service said.\nWhat species of sharks are being used?\nBlue sharks and mako sharks are two of the species best suited to carry the sensor tags because of their movement and diving characteristics.\nThis isn't the first time animals have been used in a similar way for scientific research. Marine life such as seals and narwhals have been tagged to track hard-to-reach areas in the Arctic and Antarctic, The Washington Post reports. Dolphins and whales have been used by Russia for military purposes.\nWill the data captured by the sharks be used during actual hurricanes?\n\"Our goal is to have a 'fleet' of sharks carrying these tags during the hurricane season, and they will be providing real-time oceanographic data across the North Atlantic that will be fed into various ocean models that are used to predict hurricane strength, intensity, direction, etc.,\" Carlisle said in an e-mail.\nHis team carried out tagging experiments with the sharks in May, with some success.\n\"As to whether the sharks will be in the actual hurricanes remains to be seen, but I suspect they will avoid them and won't be surfacing during hurricanes!\"\nIs the goal to have the sharks deployed this year, during the 2025 season?\nThis year, researchers are still working out bugs and are limited in the number of tags that can be deployed because of the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a huge impact on this project, Carlisle said.\n\"Our hope, if we obtain sufficient additional funding to keep things moving forward, is that we will be actually doing this type of work on a larger scale in 2026 (if lucky) or more likely 2027.\"\nFunding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been more than satisfactory for the project, and Carlisle said \"the agency has been incredibly supportive of us throughout this process.\" The teams' partner, the Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System, also has been helpful.\nAre the sharks harmed by having tags attached to them?\n\"That's a topic that we are keenly aware of in our field,\" Carlisle said. \"Attaching anything to an animal will have some impact on the animal, but we do everything in our power to minimize any negative impacts on the animal.\"\nIn addition, Carlisle and his team go through a permitting and review process that ensures they do everything they can to minimize the effect on animals. Beyond that, he said, researchers need the animals to be \"happy and healthy\" to provide the team with good data, because they are carrying expensive equipment (each tag costs about $6,000). So if the tag has too much of an effect on the animal, \"we aren't just hurting the animal but we're essentially throwing the tag away.\"\nThe tags will not be on the animals permanently: Researchers use parts that will corrode over time and allow the whole tag package to fall off."

  "argos_summary": "Hurricane forecasters have shifted focus from the recently weakened Hurricane Erin to two new Atlantic disturbances, Invest\u202fAL90 and Invest\u202fAL99.  Invest\u202fAL90, a low\u2011pressure system about 500\u202fmi south\u2011southwest of Bermuda, is expected to become Tropical Depression\u202f1 and then Tropical Storm Fernand, with a high chance of turning northward and potentially striking Bermuda as a hurricane.  Invest\u202fAL99, a weaker wave east of the Windward Islands, has only a 20% chance of development and is forecast to bring heavy rain to the Caribbean.  The National Hurricane Center also notes several other tropical waves moving westward across the Atlantic, but none pose an immediate threat, while the 2025 season is projected to be slightly above average with about eight hurricanes and three major ones.  Meanwhile, NOAA and AccuWeather urge residents to prepare for possible impacts by stocking supplies, reviewing evacuation plans, and staying alert to changing forecasts.",
