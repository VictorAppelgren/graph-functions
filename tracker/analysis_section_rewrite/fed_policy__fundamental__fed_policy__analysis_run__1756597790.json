      "feedback": "The draft fails the acceptance gate because it does not map to any of the listed canonical market handles (e.g., ust10y, dxy, gold, spx, etc.). Mortgage‑rate data are not in the canonical list, so the analysis is ineligible unless you re‑frame it to a handle that is. To salvage the topic, either: 1) drop the mortgage‑rate focus entirely and replace it with a pillar‑aligned theme that maps to a canonical handle (e.g., “US 10‑yr Treasury yield” or “US DXY”); or 2) explicitly map the mortgage‑rate discussion to a proxy handle such as “ust10y” (with a clear sign and magnitude range) and note that mortgage rates are a derivative of the 10‑yr Treasury curve. Remove any non‑canonical references, keep the causal chain and magnitude ranges (6.55–6.60 % through 2026, potential decline to 6.20–6.40 % if Fed cuts in 2027), and cite the source (LF0UUL917) for each claim. This will satisfy the handle‑mapping requirement and keep the analysis within the multi‑year structural focus.",
