      "summary": "The recent Steam launch of the anime RPG Blue Archive faced delays due to review process issues, but developers Nexon Games confirmed that the game's content was not censored for approval. The game, known for its suggestive themes and character designs, has received positive feedback from players, averaging 92% positive reviews on Steam. Meanwhile, Valve has acknowledged that the removal of PayPal support for many currencies is linked to pressure from payment processors regarding NSFW content, amidst ongoing debates about censorship in gaming.",
