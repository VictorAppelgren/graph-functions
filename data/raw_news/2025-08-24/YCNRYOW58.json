  "description": "",
  "content": "LOS ANGELES, CA, August 22, 2025 (EZ Newswire) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI ) (\u201cFaraday Future\u201d, \u201cFF\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, announced that it has officially launched its transformative \u201cEAI + Crypto\u201d Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Ecosystem Strategy \u2014 marking the beginning of a new chapter in AI mobility and Web3 integration.\n\nThis bold strategic initiative, which was revealed on Aug. 16 at an event in Pebble Beach, integrates Embodied AI (EAI) with the explosive growth of the crypto asset economy to create a two-way, independently operating circular growth engine between Web2 and Web3, positioning FF at the forefront of the next era in global industrial and financial evolution.\n\nEAI + Crypto Dual Flywheel: A New Growth Paradigm\n\nFaraday Future believes that AI represents the next great leap in productivity, while crypto and Web3 signify a revolution in the relations of production. Together, these forces offer a potential once-in-decades opportunity for transformation \u2014 a meta-chemistry that FF aims to drive through its newly launched strategy.\n\n\u201cThe next decade could be a super long bull cycle for the crypto market,\u201d said Ian Calderon, FF's co-creation officer and founding board member of the California Blockchain Working Group. \u201cFF is building a dual-engine circular growth system \u2014 combining the long-cycle, high-value EAI EV ecosystem with the short-cycle, high-velocity crypto ecosystem. These two flywheels will empower each other, redefining what\u2019s possible in mobility and financial innovation.\u201d\n\nBuilding the Bridge Between Web2 and Web3\n\nFF\u2019s Dual-Bridge Strategy positions the Company as one of the first U.S.-listed public companies directly connecting real-world business operations with on-chain assets. Plans are underway to launch the EAI Vehicle Chain, enabling tokenized vehicle sales, crypto-based deposits, and Web3-native user engagement \u2014 while leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent mobility economy.\n\n\u201cThe Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Strategy reflects our deep insights into the future of the global economy,\u201d said YT Jia, founder and co-CEO of Faraday Future. \u201cFF is not just transitioning into a Web3 era \u2014 we are architecting it. This is how we deliver value creation for our stockholders.\u201d\n\nIntroducing the C10 Index and C10 Treasury: A New Crypto Infrastructure for Capital Markets\n\nFF also announced the C10 Index, a market-cap-weighted basket of the top 10 global crypto assets, excluding stablecoins. The index launched at midnight Pacific time on Aug. 16, 2025, with a base value of 1,000, and will be tracked in real time on FF.com and the FF app.\n\nAlongside the index, FF is launching the FFAI C10 Treasury, targeting $500 million to $1 billion in initial crypto asset purchases, subject to funding, with an initial $30 million investment. Assets will be allocated using an 80% passive and 20% active strategy. The treasury is designed to generate sustainable returns, with staking yields estimated at 3% to 5%, which could support product innovation, potential stock buybacks, and further asset growth.\n\nFF is also exploring creating an ETF product based on the C10 Index.\n\nCrypto Flywheel to Reshape Faraday Future\u2019s Financial Structure\n\nThe Crypto Flywheel strategy, which the Company plans to operate through a wholly owned and independently managed subsidiary, FFAI Crypto Treasury and Bridging Holdings Inc., is designed to enhance FF\u2019s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. With on-chain assets serving as both reserves and flexible capital, the strategy enables FF to generate stable staking yields, potentially reducing reliance on high-cost financing, and improving net asset value and structure.\n\nStructure Ensures Risk Isolation and Transparency\n\nFF\u2019s crypto and EV businesses are planned to be operated under separate legal and financial structures to promote risk isolation, operational independence, and asset transparency. Digital assets will be held by third-party custodians and will be fully verifiable on-chain. The structure is designed to allow strategic synergies without direct cross-subsidization \u2014 while reinforcing each other.\n\nWith this launch, Faraday Future offers investors access to potential dual benefits from the AI mobility and crypto asset markets. This revolutionary move supports the Company\u2019s long-standing commitment to maximize stockholder value in a future-forward and sustainable manner.\n\nAbout Faraday Future\n\nFaraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.
