  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Revenue (GAAP) rose to $27.4 million, exceeding both analyst estimates and company guidance.\n\u2022 None Net loss (GAAP) increased year over year to $28.0 million despite better operating performance, driven by non-cash items and higher interest expense.\n\u2022 These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nSurf Air Mobility (NYSE:SRFM), a regional air mobility platform specializing in scheduled and on-demand commuter flights, reported its second-quarter 2025 earnings on August 12, 2025. The company delivered higher-than-expected GAAP revenue of $27.4 million and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $9.5 million. Revenue (GAAP) reached $27.4 million, topping the consensus GAAP estimate of $25.25 million and finishing above the high end of its guided range. The adjusted EBITDA loss improved to $9.5 million, also beating internal projections. Despite this operational progress, net loss (GAAP) increased to $28.0 million compared to $27.0 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to non-cash accounting items and increased interest expense. Overall, the quarter demonstrated notable steps toward operational efficiency and profitability at the airline level, though structural and financial challenges persist.\n\nSurf Air Mobility operates a network of scheduled commuter flights and on-demand charter services across the United States. The company\u2019s business is built around regional air connectivity, using a combination of proprietary technology and strategic partnerships to deliver service from smaller airports. It manages both its own airline operations and a growing technology platform known as SurfOS, aimed at bringing operating efficiencies to regional aviation.\n\nRecently, Surf Air Mobility has focused on becoming profitable by optimizing its airline network, enhancing operational reliability, and leveraging software partnerships. Key success factors include advancing new aircraft electrification programs, expanding its SurfOS software for aviation management, maintaining relationships with partners like Palantir Technologies and Textron Aviation, and balancing compliance requirements and customer experience. Contracted flying under government-subsidized Essential Air Service (EAS) routes also supports steady revenue and cash flow.\n\nThe company\u2019s revenue (GAAP) reached $27.4 million, coming in above both the analyst consensus and the top end of its internal guidance. This performance reflected growth in both main business lines compared to the previous quarter. Revenue improved 20% in the Scheduled Service segment and 5% in the On Demand charter segment compared to the previous quarter. However, when looking year over year, scheduled service revenue was down 12% and on-demand revenue dropped 26%, mostly a result of exiting unprofitable scheduled routes and prioritizing margin in the charter business.\n\nThe company delivered notably stronger airline operating results. It reached profitability in air operations on an adjusted EBITDA basis, reflecting improvements in key metrics like the controllable completion factor, which jumped from 82% to 95%. This factor measures the share of flights completed as scheduled and is considered an important reliability benchmark for regional carriers. In the On Demand segment, Surf Air Mobility achieved a seven-percentage point margin improvement compared with the previous quarter and turned a positive margin for June, driven by increases in charter volume and contributions from the BrokerOS module of SurfOS, the company\u2019s aviation management software suite.\n\nStrategic developments continued to shape Surf Air Mobility\u2019s trajectory. During the quarter, the company finalized a new interline agreement with Japan Airlines, expanding its connectivity to international travelers and marking its fifth such arrangement. Also notable were the renewals of its EAS contracts for Kalaupapa and Waimea in Hawaii, collectively valued at $14.1 million over four years, offering stable income and visibility. On the financing side, $29.9 million of convertible notes were converted to equity after the period\u2019s end (in July 2025), reducing debt levels but leading to shareholder dilution. The company also raised $44.7 million in new equity capital, adding to its cash reserves and supporting ongoing operations and investments.\n\nTechnology and product efforts showed further momentum. The SurfOS platform, which includes modular software tools like BrokerOS (charter management), OperatorOS (airline operations), and OwnerOS (fleet ownership), saw expanded use inside the company and among beta clients. Surf Air Mobility deepened its relationship with Palantir Technologies, gaining exclusive rights to configure and sell Palantir software to other Part 135 operators -- a designation for charter aviation companies under U.S. regulations. No new concrete electrification milestones were disclosed in the second quarter, but management referenced continued progress and ongoing partner discussions regarding the company\u2019s aircraft electrification initiative.\n\nLooking Ahead: Guidance and Key Factors to Monitor\n\nManagement guided to revenue between $27.0 million and $28.5 million, indicating expectations for flat to slightly increased performance in the near term. Adjusted EBITDA loss is forecast in the range of $10.0 million to $8.5 million, suggesting ongoing focus on operational efficiency. Management reiterated its goal to exceed $100 million in revenue for FY2025 and to reach profitability at the airline operating level on an adjusted EBITDA basis. There was no new guidance related to the timing or commercial impact of the electrification initiative.\n\nInvestors will want to keep an eye on several ongoing themes for Surf Air Mobility in coming quarters. These include the pace of operational improvement as the network optimization continues, progress on commercializing SurfOS for wider adoption, developments concerning government-subsidized EAS contracts, and updates on partnerships and electrification milestones.\n\nRevenue and net income presented using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) unless otherwise noted.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
