      "title": "Air Canada risks 'pyrrhic victory' in sending flight attendants to the picket lines, says TD analyst",
      "summary": "Air Canada flight attendants, represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees, have issued a 72‑hour strike notice and are set to picket over unpaid ground work and pay issues. Company management, as noted by Tom Fitzgerald, is urged to offer a 50‑100% increase in boarding pay and a modest annual raise to secure labour peace and avoid a costly strike. Fitzgerald warns that each day of stoppage could cost the airline $75 million EBITDA, totaling $300 million over a three‑day strike, and notes investor frustration with management’s approach. He believes that resolving the dispute will position the airline well for future growth post‑COVID.",
