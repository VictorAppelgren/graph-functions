  "content": "1. On September 2, 2025, the Company filed a Notice of Competing Objection and Disclosure of Bid Materials in which it confirmed that it is a Competing Objector, and therefore that it will present its Improved Bid to the Court and request that it be approved instead of the $2 billion lower-priced Amber Energy bid. In conjunction therewith, the Company filed bid materials that had not already been filed on the public docket. A copy of the filing will be posted here.\n\n2. On September 2, 2025, the Company filed a letter with the Court in which it joined the Venezuela Parties\u2019 request that the Court direct the Special Master to serve fully unredacted versions of the transcripts of the Special Master\u2019s August 11 and 13 ex parte conferences with the Court on parties that have signed a confidentiality agreement with the Special Master. A copy of the letter will be posted here.\n\n3. On August 30, 2025, the Company filed a letter with the Court requesting, in connection with the Special Master\u2019s Updated Final Recommendation, that the Court stay its decision on the Special Master\u2019s request to terminate the Dalinar Energy bid until the Court rules on Gold Reserve\u2019s pending Motion to Strike the Amber Energy bid or, in the alternative, that the Court set a briefing schedule for the Special Master\u2019s request that tracks the existing schedule for objections to the Updated Final Recommendation. A copy of the filing will be posted here.\n\nThis release contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of applicable U.S. federal securities laws and \u201cforward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities laws and state Gold Reserve\u2019s and its management\u2019s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions for the future.
