      "text": "Best monitor for programming of 2025\nWe tested out the the best monitors for programming and coding\nWe've rounded up the best monitors for programming - and what I'm looking for from these displays is a plenty of screen space and eye-care technology that's easy on the eyes when you're coding for long hours. Resolution may not be the chief concern here, but I've mainly selected 4K displays that serve up all the detail you need to zero in on the important lines of code for working on everything from app design to web development.\nBased on comprehensive testing, the BenQ RD320UA is my top choice for programmers. This 32in 4K monitor has been specifically designed for programming with a specialized coding mode that helps bring extra clarity to on-screen text. In our review, we called it a compelling choice for software developers, engineers, and business professionals thanks to prioritizing eye comfort and screen clarity. As an alternative, I'd also recommend the Dell UltraSharp U2723QE, which includes a useful USB-C hub ideal for connecting any of the best laptops for programming we've tested.\nQuick list\nBest overall\nBest monitor for programming overall\nThe BenQ RD320UA is a monitor built from the ground up for one main purpose - coding. It has a halo light bar to the rear, great color profiles, and good IO for use beyond coding.\nBest with USB-C hub\nBest monitor for programming with USB-C hubThe Dell U2723QE is an incredible option if you want a coding monitor with a USB-C hub for all your peripherals. It's even got a DisplayPort Out, letting you connect another monitor via MST even if your second display doesn't allow for daisy chaining.\nBest on a budget\nBest monitor for programming on a budgetDell's P2725HE is a great display for coding without breaking the bank. It even has a built-in USB-C hub, so if you are coding with a laptop, you can single-cable connect and work while plugging into extra peripherals.\nBest on Mac\nBest monitor for programming on a MacThe BenQ MA320U is one of my favorite monitors for programming, since it includes a coding mode, which brings out individual text character clarity and adjusts colors. Bonus points for being specially optimized for use with Mac devices.\nBest monitor for programming overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need precise color for dual displays: This monitor offers 98% DCI-P3 coverage and factory calibration for color consistency across setups.\n\u2705 You want ergonomic flexibility: The Ergo Arm supports tilt, swivel, pivot, and height adjustments, ideal for stacked or side-by-side setups.\n\u274c You require high refresh rates: The 60Hz refresh rate may not be sufficient for certain applications.\n\u274c You prefer a monitor without a chin: The RD models of BenQ's monitors have a hefty chin that houses the coding-specific hotkeys but also stands out.\nIt's not often that we see a monitor specifically designed for programmers and developers, but that's exactly what the BenQ RD320UA sets out to do.\nWe took the monitor for a test drive and were suitably impressed with the results. We've long been fans of BenQ monitors, which are generally well-balanced between features and cost, and the RD320UA is no exception. During review, we discovered the monitor boasts a built-in KVM, built-in backlight to reduce eye-strain - but more importantly, there are specialized coding modes designed to aid eye training and clarity of code. In our experience, it really helped improve on-screen readability and it's a must for professional coders.\nBuilt quality is, as expected, very good here, while the Nano Matte Panel eliminates reflections. We came away feeling like our eyes had been well-rested even when in use. We were also fans of the included Ergo arm, which mounts the display to your desk, saving some space and letting you adjust the monitor to your preferred viewing position. To the rear, you'll also find the Moon light ring\nOn the downside, it only hits 60Hz refresh rate, and we found the included USB-C cable was shorter than we would've liked. But these are, in fairness, minor issues with an otherwise excellent monitor for programming.\nIf you're looking for something a little bit smaller, but like the functionality of the RD320UA, BenQ also has the RD280U.\nRead our full BenQ RD320UA review.\nBest monitor for programming with USB-C hub\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need extensive connectivity: The built-in USB-C hub simplifies complex workstation setups.\n\u2705 You frequently use dual or multi-monitor daisy-chaining: Efficient connectivity for cleaner cable management.\n\u274c HDR is critical: HDR performance is modest and might disappoint for color-critical HDR workflows.\n\u274c You\u2019re budget-conscious: Less expensive alternatives with fewer ports exist.\nThe Dell UltraSharp U2723QE is a fantastic offering from Dell, featuring a built-in USB-C Hub. It boasts a beloved 27-inch frame and includes impressive HDR features. However, it lacks any modes specifically designed for coding. Despite this, the sharp display and crisp visuals help reduce eye strain more effectively than a lower-resolution monitor, especially during those long hours spent coding.\nWhile it's not expressly designed for coding, it excels as an all-around display. This effectiveness comes from the UHD monitor's 2000:1 contrast ratio and the inclusion of the USB-C hub. Together, they create a true office workhorse that enables you to accomplish significant tasks, even when your workday doesn't solely revolve around a coding terminal or the latest GitHub repository.\nSince this monitor has a built-in USB-C hub, you can easily connect to your laptop with a single cable, or you can run your tower PC on here too. Either one. And when your keyboard needs a charge, or if you need to charge your phone, or plug in a camera for those virtual meetings, you can easily plug them into the provided ports on the monitor, keeping you with a clean setup.\nRead our full Dell UltraSharp U2723QE review.\nBest monitor for programming on a budget\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Budget and convenience matter: An affordable solution for dual-monitor office setups.\n\u2705 You require straightforward USB-C docking: Ideal for laptop users seeking simple connectivity.\n\u274c You require higher resolutions: Only Full HD, unsuitable for precise graphics or video work.\n\u274c Professional color accuracy is critical: Moderate color accuracy is not designed for creative professionals.\nWe all wish we could spend the most amount of money possible on a monitor setup. we all wish that monitors were either less expensive or that we had a credit card we could swipe and never have to pay it when it comes to monitor purchases (and perhaps more, but that's for another conversation another time). However, reality sets in and sometimes we have to make a cut back from our dream monitor and computer setup to be a bit more budget-friendly.\nThe Dell P2725HE is a great example of how budget doesn't have to be some random monitor you find on the side of the road or a super dated monitor that you need to plug into just the right way so it works still. The P2725HE is a new monitor at a reasonable price that gives you a good chunk of the modern features that you desire while still providing a full 1920 x 1080 resolution on a 27-inch panel.\nIt's not the most crystal-clear display, but it will get the job done for your work, even in coding, all with the convenience of having a built-in USB-C hub to quickly connect your laptop with that all-so-lovely one-cable setup.\nRead our full Dell P2725HE review.\nBest monitor for programming on a Mac\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You require precise color accuracy: The monitor offers 99% sRGB and 97% DCI-P3 coverage, ensuring consistency across MacBook and external displays.\n\u2705 You prefer seamless macOS integration: Display Pilot 2 allows native control of brightness and volume directly from your Mac.\n\u274c You need Thunderbolt 4 connectivity: The absence of Thunderbolt 4 may limit future-proofing your setup.\n\u274c You rely on built-in speakers: The monitor\u2019s speakers may not meet high-quality audio expectations.\nBenQ Monitors all have great coding modes that help with making terminals look sharp and reduce eye strain.\nWhile the built-in coding mode on this is not as good as the RD series monitors, what I've noticed is that even when I am looking at terminals, I find it more beneficial and more useful all around to have a high-resolution monitor with great picture quality. Then, I don't find myself straining as much, even when coding, to see what's on my screen.\nThe BenQ MA320U Monitor has phenomenal macOS integration; it can be adjusted with keystrokes, adjusting everything from brightness to color profiles and more, all helping you stay more focused, more productive, and get more done.\nRead our full BenQ MA320U Monitor review.\nBest monitor for programming FAQs\nHow to choose the best monitor for programming\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nWhen choosing which programming monitor is best for you, there are five core areas to explore:\n- Pixel density matters when it comes to nice, crisp fonts. And nice crisp fonts make long coding sessions more comfortable. So go for a high resolution monitor.\n- Rotating a widescreen monitor into portrait mode provides plenty of space for viewing code without scrolling. Not all monitors can switch to portrait mode.\n- USB-C connectivity with power delivery makes life so much easier and tidier for laptop users. Simply hook up to the display and your peripherals with a single cable.\n- Don\u2019t worry about expensive features like HDR support, high refresh rates or low response times. You'll typically find these in the best monitors for photo editing and best video editing monitors. They won\u2019t help you streamline your code, but they will be important if you intend to use these for content creation or gaming.\n- Panel type isn\u2019t hugely critical, but we\u2019d still favour IPS or VA over a really cheap TN monitor when it comes to long term comfort and usability.\nFirst up, we\u2019d look for a fairly high resolution screen. 4K panels are now pretty affordable, especially in 27-inch and 28-inch form factors. That said, 1440p can be a reasonable choice for programming. If you\u2019re the kind of coder who likes to rotate a screen into portrait mode, a pair of cheaper 1440p panels with support for rotation into portrait mode could be an interesting value-orientated option.\nOn the other hand, if you like to code with several application windows lined up in parallel, an ultrawide panel can make a lot of sense, too. That\u2019s especially true now that one or two ultrawide monitors can be had with 2,160 vertical pixels. So, you\u2019re giving up little when it comes to vertical resolution.\nAll of that said, we\u2019d still prioritize a higher resolution 4K-plus panel in order to maximize pixel density. When you\u2019re looking at code all day, nice crisp fonts can really help keep eye strain to a minimum. Again, a panel with a fully adjustable stand with support for rotation into portrait would be our pick.\nAs for panel type and performance, well, IPS technology has the advantage of wide viewing angles, which can be especially helpful in multi-monitor situations. We wouldn\u2019t kick a VA 4K monitor out of bed, though, especially if it was attractively priced.\nWhat we wouldn\u2019t worry about so much is refresh, HDR support and the last word in pixel response. Paying extra for a 120Hz-plus panel provides little benefit for coding. The same applies to HDR monitors with fancy technology like mini-LED backlighting or wide gamut color support, or indeed uber-fast pixel response. All of that just adds cost without any significant upside.\nWhat we would be willing to pay extra for, however, is top notch connectivity. Of particular value is USB Type-C with power delivery. That allows you to hook up a laptop and both drive the display and power the laptop with a single cable. Many USB-C monitors also have USB hubs, so you can connect keyboard, mouse and peripherals like external storage to the display and have them all dock with your laptop with that single cable. It\u2019s pretty sweet. Once you\u2019ve tried USB-C, you won\u2019t want to go back to that rat\u2019s nest of cables.\nHow we test the best monitors for programming\nWhether we're going hands-on with programming monitors, analyzing the best monitors for the Mac mini, or testing out the best monitors for a dual screen setup, we take the same rigorous approach to our review process.\nWe test, rate, and review all the best monitors based on a number of factors, This includes price, design, build quality and materials, and performance. We consider the size of each display, along with panel type, resolution, refresh rate, color coverage and HDR support. We also compare connectivity, including HDMI, DisplayPort, USB-C and wireless interfaces, against other monitors in the same class.\nPixel density and color accuracy are particularly important for digital design monitors, but so are ergonomics, so we assess stand adjustability and stability. Finally, build quality and value for money are judged against competitors in the market.\nFind out more about our rigorous testing process in our guide to how we test, review, and rate monitors on TechRadar Pro.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

The feature lets you better organize screen space, letting you \u2018split\u2019 the screen to show different content on each side. Useful for previewing projects in a range of color spaces and screen sizes. One of the biggest drawbacks for us during testing was the quality of the built-in speakers. They're a lot weaker than rival monitors, and we found it best to hook up a headset or external speakers.\nConnectivity-wise, BenQ PD2725U is fairly well-kitted, with HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C. You\u2019ll also find a built-in KVM switch for switching between computers without switching keyboard and mouse. The video editing monitor\u2019s stand offers a good amount of flexibility, letting you adjust height, tilt, and pivot to find the best viewing angles. All those great features, though, means the display comes in at a premium price point.\nRead our full BenQ PD2725U review\nThe best budget video editing monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAsus's ProArt panels are usually pretty pricey. But the new Asus ProArt PA279CRV gives you the usual ProArt experience including accurate factory calibration and excellent color coverage in a surprisingly affordable package.\nConnectivity is also a strong point thanks to not only USB-C with 96W of power delivery and a dual-port USB-A hub, but also a downstream DisplayPort output allowing for display daisy chaining. The 27-inch 4K form factor is fundamentally great, too, and allows for excellent pixel density and lovely crisp fonts in both Windows and MacOS.\nSure, the HDR support is limited to DisplayHDR 400 with no local dimming. So this isn't a true HDR panel and the inherent contrast of the IPS panel isn't great. It's also limited to 60Hz rather than 120Hz or 144Hz. But then that's the norm for this class of productivity panel.\nAnyway, factor in the fully adjustable stand and slick styling and this is one heck of a monitor for the money. You'd have to spend dramatically more to get a tangibly better monitor. A good monitor for video editing if you're new to the art or you're working to a budget, the Asus ProArt PA279CRV is a fantastic value for all manner of productivity and content creation workflows.\nRead our full Asus ProArt PA279CRV review\nThe best video editing monitor for Mac\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Apple Studio Display was introduced as a accessible alternative to the Apple Pro Display XDR, and was designed with video, graphic design, and creative professionals in mind.\nOffering a compelling blend of affordability and quality for Apple enthusiasts, its 27-inch 5K IPS display impresses with vibrant colors and sharp imagery, although it doesn\u2019t match the MacBook Pro's brightness or feature the advanced Liquid Retina XDR and mini LED technology. The lack of HDR support is a notable omission for a monitor at this price point, unfortunately.\nDespite its shortcomings, the Apple Studio Display is priced competitively within the professional creative market, offering a balance between cost and performance for video content creators, distinguishing itself from options geared towards gaming or general office tasks.\nRead our full Apple Studio Display review\nThe best 8K monitor for video editing\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEven five years after its announcement, the model is still outstanding and astounding today. However, it continues to have a high price and little competition, perhaps because there isn\u2019t a lot of 8K content available and everyone is still producing mostly 4K video content. But if you're future-proofing workflows, this PC monitor for video editing is certainly an eye-catching option.\nWith the new breed of high-end smartphones already capable of 8K video recording, the flood of 8K content is likely to make other monitor manufacturers jump aboard the 8K monitor bandwagon.\nThe 32-inch size of this beast doesn't let it go unnoticed, even when it is turned off. From the outside, you get a pretty sturdy design and impressive construction as per usual with Dell, all wrapped up in stylish brushed aluminum. In addition to the great ergonomics -again another hallmark of Dell- it has support for height adjustment, tilt, pivot and portrait mode features.\nMost IPS screens in this line up have a brightness of around 350 cd/m2, however, this one has a brightness of 400 cd/m2. Moreover, its contrast ratio also tops the list at 1300:1. The panel's color gamut is one of the best we have seen with 100% of sRGB, 100% of Adobe RGB, and 98% of DCI-P3.\nRegarding connectivity, it includes two DisplayPort connections, a USB hub with one upstream and two downstream ports and an audio line out jack. If you're looking for an 8K monitor for video editing, look no further than this tech marvel.\nRead our full Dell UltraSharp UP3218K review\nThe best 6K video editing monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDell's U3224KB UltraSharp 6K Monitor isn't just a display; it's a multifunctional device combining a monitor, Thunderbolt hub, 4K webcam, and soundbar in one sleek package.\nIt's designed with productivity in mind, boasting a 32-inch 6K IPS Black display with 99% Display P-3 color accuracy and VESA DisplayHDR 600. The integrated 4K webcam with AI and manual tilt adjustments enhances video conferencing, while the built-in Thunderbolt 4 hub simplifies connectivity, allowing for a one-cable connection to devices.\nAn auto KVM switch enables easy multitasking between computers. Impressively, this monitor rivals Apple's Studio and Pro Display XDR in quality and features but at a more affordable price and with a wider variety of ports, making it an ideal choice for professionals seeking a high-performance, versatile workstation monitor.\nRead our full Dell U3224KB UltraSharp review\nBest video editing monitor for content creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBlending elegance and professionalism, the BenQ PD3220U proves itself a very capable and attractive 4K computer monitor for video editing. During our testing, we liked the high-quality build and its attractive design. The solid metal base, in particular, is well-constructed, allowing smooth adjustments to the viewing angle. If you\u2019re working on multiple computers, you\u2019ll appreciate the built-in KVM switch to move between machines without changing keyboard and mouse.\nThe specs, too, are impressive. The crisp 4K resolution, high pixel density, wide color gamut provided a sharp and vibrant display. HDR capability, allowing for greater contrast between light and dark in images, was a real stand-out feature. We found it added depth and dimensionality for an immersive viewing experience.\nAs with many screens at this price-point, the speakers leave something to be desired (however nice they are to have). But the real stand-out here is the 100% sRGB color gamut and 10-bit color depth, producing vibrant, accurate colors, ideal for photo and video editing projects.\nRead our full BenQ PD3220U review\nBest monitor for video editing: FAQs\nWhat are the different monitor panel types?\nIn terms of LCD display panels, nowadays there are three main types starting with TN (twisted nematic) which is the oldest and cheapest. Then we have Vertical Alignment (VA), In-Plane Switching (IPS), and OLED. Video editing is more efficient with IPS panels because of their ability to produce a wide gamut of colors. Motion-blurring is a problem with VA panels when displaying fast-paced footage, and OLED have better blacks but still have a high cost and other problems.\nWhen using a monitor for video editing, brightness, contrast, and color gamut are the most important considerations. A monitor's color gamut refers to the possible range of colors it can display. Although all LCD monitors nowadays have good contrast ratios, brightness levels, and color gamuts, the IPS LCD panels have better viewing angles and support more colors than their TN predecessors.\nYour monitor also must be calibrated properly if you want color accuracy.\nHow to choose the best monitor for video editing\nChoosing the right video editing monitor involves considering color accuracy, with at least 95% DCI-P3 gamut coverage recommended, and size, where 27 to 32 inches offers a comfortable viewing range, with ultrawide options above 34\" providing optimal space.\nThe aspect ratio is crucial, with 16:9 being standard, though ultrawide ratios like 21:9 offer additional workspace.\nResolution is key for detail, aiming for a display that exceeds your output resolution, making 4K panels a solid choice for 4K video editing. HDR support enhances image depth and realism, important for HDR content.\nConnectivity is also vital, ensuring compatibility with your computer's output types, with USB-C offering a streamlined, single-cable solution for modern laptops and peripherals, enhancing the overall editing workflow.\nHow we test the best monitors for video editing\nOur experts have rigorously evaluated a vast array of displays, including the Best 5K and 8K monitors, the best monitors for photo editing and the best business monitors. So, we know what to look out when looking for a screen for video editing. We set aside Full HD 1080P for the superior 4K UHD here, essential for current and future video editing due to the ubiquity of 4K content.\nGiven the prevalence of 4K recording in devices from the iPhone 7+ to the Samsung Galaxy S8, investing in anything less is short-sighted.\nWe recommend 27-inch monitors as the optimal entry point for serious editing, with 31\", 32\", and 34\" as excellent choices for larger screens, avoiding anything over 40\" for practicality.\nOur selection exclusively features IPS panels for their color accuracy, crucial for video editing. Notably, all our top picks, except the Dell 8K, support HDR, with some offering HDR600, indicating HDR compatibility with peak brightness up to 600 nits.\nThis curated list spans various price points, ensuring a choice for every video editing need, prioritizing resolution, display size, and HDR compatibility.\nToday's best video editing monitor deals\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nSteve is B2B Editor for Creative & Hardware at TechRadar Pro.

      "text": "Best portable monitor of 2025: Perfect picks for presentations, business travel, and remote work\nWe tested out the top portable monitors for work, play, and streaming\nAfter testing and reviewing the best portable monitors, I've hand-picked the best of the best for every use - from business travel and remote work to streaming movies and playing games.\nMy top pick overall is the Arzopa Z1RC, which delivers an impressive 2.5K resolution on a 16in display at a great price. Having tested this one out, we found picture quality was excellent and colors remained vibrant.\nSome other top recommendations here include the professional Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2, and for those on a budget, both the KYY K3 and the AOC 16T3EA offer plenty to like for the price. And while almost all are suitable for Apple laptops, I still think the best portable monitor for MacBook Pro laptops and Macs is the stunning espressoDisplay, which just looks the part in the Apple ecosystem.\nEvery model featured in this round-up has been extensively tested, and we've assessed screen size, image quality, color accuracy, and connectivity.\nUpdate: In my latest update, I've cleaned up the Also Tested section with some honorable (and not so honorable) mentions. Meanwhile, this month the team has reviewed the excellent tri-screen Aura Triple Aero Pro Max (click here for the review) and the \"portable\" UPerfect UMax 24 (click here for the review).\nThe quick list\nBest overall\nBest portable monitor overall\nHigh-resolution and a big, portable screen make this our top pick, with a reasonable price for the specs.\nBest on a budget\nBest cheap portable monitor\nA good choice for the home and home office, this KYY portable screen won't break the bank.\nBest for business\nBest portable monitor for business\nA great choice for professionals on the go, the 14in portable display is light and easy to carry, and boasts 1440p resolution.\nBest for Mac & MacBook\nBest portable monitor for Mac\nAs beautifully designed as an Apple device, this space-grey portable monitor worked seamlessly on our Mac, and looks great too.\nBest for gaming\nBest portable monitor for gaming\nIf you\u2019re more of a business or productivity power user needing to extend your MacBook\u2019s display, then this is the ideal choice.\nBest budget alternative\nBest budget alternative\nIf our cheap portable monitor pick isn't quite right, it's well-worth checking out this budget screen from AOC.\nLoad next products...\nBest big-screen\nBest big-screen portable monitor\nThis 27in monitor offers a broad canvas ideal for office use, detail-focused workflows, and collaboration.\nBest OLED\nBest OLED portable monitor\nIf you want bright, vivid colors on the small screen, the Innocn 15A1F is a great choice in a portable package.\nBest for creators\nBest portable monitor for creators\nWith an OLED panel and an extremely wide color gamut, this is a top pick for creatives who need on-the-go color accuracy.\nBest screen extender\nBest laptop screen extender\nTwo 15.6in portable displays rest either side of most laptops, giving you plenty of screen real estate for any project.\nBest small screen\nBest small portable monitor\nElecrow offers a range of small portable displays, but we especially like this 13.3in model that's highly compact.\nBest dual-screen\nBest dual-screen portable monitor\nEquipped with two 16in 2.5K panels, touch interface, and a pen, this dual-screen monitor is a good choice for creators and anyone who needs to expand their display.\nThe best portable monitor overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a cheap portable monitor: For the size and specs, this is an excellently priced device that won\u2019t break the bank.\n\u2705 You want a big screen, high-resolution portable display: There\u2019s plenty of screen real estate here if you\u2019re mirroring or extending your screen here - in 2.5K res, which is more than enough for a screen this size.\n\u274c You need a small screen for extra portability: At 16in, this device isn\u2019t the lightest and smallest display you can get.\n\u274c You travel regularly: Without a protective case, we don\u2019t feel the Z1RC could survive a particularly bumpy drive or fierce commute.\nThe Arzopa Z1RC is the best portable monitor for most people thanks to its clear 16-inch, 2.5K display, and USB-C and mini HDMI connectivity - all at a reasonable price.\nGenerally well-reviewed, Arzopa\u2019s range tends to be cheap, portable, and powerful enough. A display like the Z1RC might not have every bell and whistle, but like most of the company\u2019s line-up, it\u2019s affordable and suitable for most uses, like working, streaming, presenting, and light gaming.\nThe IPS panel on the Z1RC features 2560 x 1600 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, two USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port. Dimensions run to 356 x 240 x 9mm, weighing 763g. Color coverage is fair, and we recorded 100% sRGB, 89% AdobeRGB, 95% P3, and 69% of Rec 2020. We did find the viewing angle to be somewhat narrow at 85 degrees. Nor is it the brightest portable screen we\u2019ve tested. Despite claims of 500nits peak brightness, it\u2019s arguably closer to 400, with our own tests showing the backlight hit around 337nits with a contrast of 1060:1. We also felt a protective case is a necessity if you plan to use this portable monitor for travel.\nOverall, there may be better portable monitors out there, but not at this price. Top lternatives we like include the gaming-focused Arzopa Z1FC and the 15.6in Arzopa S1 Table.\nRead our full Arzopa Z1RC review\nThe best cheap portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a cheap portable monitor: The real stand-out feature of this display is the price, which is around $100 / \u00a3100 - and we\u2019ve seen it discounted to around $70 on Amazon, too.\n\u2705 You want a lightweight screen: We really like how light and portable this display is, even at 15.6in, weighing in at around 1.70lb / 770g.\n\u274c You\u2019re a creator: One of the weakest parts here is the color gamut, which is very low compared to other displays we\u2019ve tested. Definitely not one for accurate content creation.\n\u274c You\u2019ve got a bigger budget: For a few bucks more, there are better options out there that won\u2019t see you compromising on color reproduction and, in some cases, even boost resolutions.\nThe KYY K3 may not be the best portable monitor in the world, but for the extremely low price, it delivers everything we\u2019d expect from a cheap, lightweight display - and a few features we didn\u2019t expect. The handful of flaws we found can be pretty much overlooked considering the cost.\nDesign is nice - nothing ground-breaking, but simple and practical, and very easy to use. Power button, menu select wheel, and an audio jack can be found on the left. There\u2019s even a set of built-in speakers, although as you\u2019d expect from a budget device, audio quality is tinny. Port selection is fine. Along the right-hand side, you\u2019ll find two USB-C and a mini HDMI input, making it pretty straightforward to connect a laptop, mobile device, or games console. You\u2019ll also get a range of cable adapters for more connectivity.\nWhat we really liked is the inclusion of a full OSD menu, letting you tweak the likes of color temperature, contrast levels, and Eco modes - not every portable monitor has this, so to see it on a low-cost display is a nice touch. Speaking of color, though, the gamut here is pretty woeful. We measured 64% sRGB and 49% for both AdobeRGB and P3, which rules this out for use by creative professionals. Still, for a sub-$100 portable monitor that comes with power supply, cables, and case that doubles as a stand, and with a 1080p resolution, this little screen ticks a lot of boxes.\nRead our full KYY K3 review\nThe best portable monitor for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want excellent resolution: With a resolution of 1440p (or 2.2K), this portable screen offers a bit more than the standard 1080p you\u2019ll find on most displays of this size.\n\u2705 You want real portability: We\u2019ve long been championing 14in as the perfect size for a business laptop, and the M14t Gen 2 fits nicely in that niche, too - big enough to see, small enough to travel.\n\u274c You need true color coverage: 100% sRGB isn\u2019t bad for a portable display, but it won\u2019t suit professional photographers and designers.\n\u274c You need a budget portable display: It may be cheaper than the Gen 1 was, but the Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 is still about $400 / \u00a3400 new.\nPart of Lenovo\u2019s Think series, the M14t Gen 2 is a 14in touchscreen portable business monitor that\u2019s overall optimal for working, watching, and low-level photo and video editing.\nWe\u2019ve used plenty of ThinkPads in our time, and while the laptops\u2019 keyboard and build quality are outstanding, the screens never stood out against the likes of Apple MacBook Pro. So, how does the ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 measure up?\nThis iteration boasts 1440p resolution, 16:10 aspect ratio, 100% sRGB color gamut, and 1500:1 contrast ratio. At $400 / \u00a3400, it\u2019s around a hundred bucks cheaper than the Gen 1 was on release (as an older model, it\u2019s decidedly cheaper now). So, in every way, it addresses the issues we had with the otherwise perfectly acceptable predecessor.\nImage quality is excellent, and we had no issues editing videos and photos, or watching YouTube videos. Text was crisp, colors were accurate, vibrant, blacks were deep. Using the touchscreen and included stylus was simple and snappy - although it\u2019s not going to be your go-to drawing tablet. Nor will it meet serious gaming needs due to high input latency. If that\u2019s not an issue, the Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 is one of the best portable computer monitors you can get.\nRead our full Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 review\nThe best portable monitor for Mac & MacBook Pro\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an attractive portable display: We love the slick, professional design of the espressoDisplay, which neatly fits Apple\u2019s eye-catching aesthetic.\n\u2705 You want a portable laptop monitor to boost productivity: One of the reasons we love the espressoDisplay is the boost to productivity we found from this slim, minimalist screen.\n\u274c You need a simple travel monitor for a laptop: This portable display is, like an Apple device, a bit of a statement piece as much as it is a productivity tool.\n\u274c You need a cheap portable laptop monitor: The premium build and design of this display is reflected in the price.\nThe espressoDisplay 15 is our pick for best portable for Mac,MacBook Pro, and Mac mini devices. True, most displays here are compatible with Apple devices, but the espressoDisplay\u2019s sleek design fits well with the Mac aesthetic - and it showed outstanding performance when we hooked it up to our MacBook Pro 16in. With two USB-C inputs, though, you\u2019ll find it works well with most Windows laptops, too.\nAttached to the magnetic stand, you can smoothly switch from landscape to portrait mode quickly - an essential feature for photographers and designers. There\u2019s also a Creator screen protector, adding a matte finish to the glass screen, which we found made it easier to view in direct sunlight, and write on using the espresso stylus.\nUsing the screen for everything from work communications to review writing and photo editing, the portable display never missed a beat. It felt a natural fit for a more productive and efficient working environment. We\u2019re not saying we got obsessed with the espressoDisplay, but we did find multiple reasons during the review period to work from home, just to have an excuse to use it. We also like the option of choosing a 13- or 15-in version depending on how portable you need it to be.\nRead our full espressoDisplay 15 review\nThe best portable monitor for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to play games: With a future-proof 240Hz refresh rate, this Asus portable screen is geared towards gamers.\n\u2705 You want a large portable monitor with built-in battery: The Asus ROG Strix XG17AHPE boasts a 7,800 mAh battery built in, lasting up to four hours at 240Hz on a single charge.\n\u274c You want to watch or work: If you\u2019ll mostly be watching YouTube and Netflix, or using office apps, this monitor is probably overkill.\n\u274c You need a cheap portable monitor: As you\u2019d expect with specs like this, the portable monitor isn\u2019t as cheap as the sub-$100 displays you\u2019ll find on Amazon.\nA 17.3in full HD display with a 240Hz refresh rate gives the Asus ROG Strix XG17AHPE the edge. The best portable gaming monitor we\u2019ve tried, this device is focused, offers no compromises, suitable for the most dedicated players.\nEven with its broad screen, the device is just 0.4in thin, weighing around 1kg, with a USB-C and miniHDMI ports along the side. In our hands, the well-built ROG Strix XG17AHPE showed no signs of bend or flex. It comes packages with a case and compact tripod, which is a thoughtful touch.\nIn use, the large portable display is vivid, crisp. When we tried games like Overwatch, Valorant, and Call of Duty, colors were popping off the screen without oversaturation, remaining distinct even in darker areas of the game. And we loved the smoothness that came with a higher refresh rate, with no ghosting and blur. Audio is loud and clear, too.\nYes, it\u2019s a bit overkill if you\u2019re presenting or Netflix-ing the night away (although it\u2019s perfectly capable of doing it). Also, while current-gen consoles are only capable of 120Hz, the refresh rate here offers in-built future-proofing, and the Switch and PlayStation still felt smooth during our gameplay tests.\nRead our full Asus ROG Strix XG17AHPE review\nThe best cheap portable monitor alternative\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a standard FHD display that won\u2019t break the bank: The AOC 16T3EA is a solid all-rounder that delivers what most need from a portable monitor at a reasonable price.\n\u2705 You want a lightweight, slimline screen for on the go work: In our tests, we found the AOC 16T3EA felt particularly good for business use.\n\u274c You need high-resolution and high color coverage: It\u2019s only 1080p, has a low 250cd/m\u00b2 brightness, and scrapes by on 56% sRGB, 41% Adobe RGB, and 41% DCI-P3 - so, this is not a display for content creators.\n\u274c You need a portable monitor for gaming: With only 60Hz refresh rate, this will be fine for single-player games on the go, but won\u2019t meet demands for high-speed multiplayer gaming.\nThe AOC 16T3EA may have some minor limitations, notably the color accuracy, it\u2019s well-priced for a portable full HD display.\nWith its 15.6in 1080p IPS display and a slim, lightweight design, we found it a very effective multi-tasking companion for on-the-go professionals. We were impressed by the 14mm profile and 870g weight, even with two built-in kick-stands tucked away around the back for portrait and landscape orientation. Helping to maintain that compact form is the inclusion of a single USB-C connection. Just plug it into any compatible Windows or Mac laptop and you\u2019re away.\nAnd this may be the first deal-breaker. There are no other ports along the display. Not even an audio jack. We also noted the disappointing brightness (just 250cd/m\u00b2), while color coverage is effectively non-existent (56% sRGB, 41% Adobe RGB, and 41% DCI-P3). And the lack of anything beyond OSD controls means we can\u2019t recommend this for content creators and photographers. But for anyone looking for a smartly designed portable second-screen, there\u2019s a lot to like.\nRead our full AOC 16T3EA review\nThe best big-screen portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a big screen: At 27in, this is one of the largest portable monitors we\u2019ve reviewed, offering plenty of screen real estate for work, collaboration, or presenting.\n\u2705 You want high resolutions: Most traditional portable displays hover around the 1080p mark, which is fine for smaller screens, but this one boasts 2.5K QHD resolution.\n\u274c You want actual portability: Yes, it\u2019s slim and fairly lightweight, but this isn\u2019t a monitor you\u2019ll want to cart around with you regularly.\n\u274c You just want a standard portable monitor: With these specs, the screen is likely overpowered if all you want to do is hook up a second screen to your laptop.\nDespite its 27in QHD IPS panel, the Asus ZenScreen MB27ACF is surprisingly slim and relatively lightweight. For me, this is ideal for a single-station set-up or use across an office where you need to key into the details or collaborate with others. I wouldn\u2019t like to be carrying this on the commute everyday, especially since it doesn\u2019t come with a case or sleeve for protection.\nThe screen is clear, with a matte anti-glare covering but no touchscreen capabilities. Specs-wise, you\u2019re looking at 2.5K resolution, 1500:1 contrast ratio, 300 nits brightness (so about average), and 99% sRGB. That feels about right, but I would've loved to see a wider color gamut so creators could benefit from the large-screen portability, too. It does have built-in speakers along the bottom. They sound nice enough, although I\u2019d still recommend external speakers or headphones for almost any portable monitor.\nAround the back is a fold-out kick-stand, which I initially found a little stiff but otherwise works well (for security, I\u2019d advise using both hands on either side of the stand to pull it into position). You can effectively set this up anywhere. Better still, Asus also supplies a monitor arm and hooks for hanging the monitor in the box. There\u2019s no battery built in, so you\u2019ll need to run it off the mains. Port selection is standard - HDMI, USB-C with DP Alt Mode, and an audio jack. It also features a 70W USB-C power delivery, too. Right now, this is a solid pick for anyone who needs a large-sized portable monitor, particularly for business-use.\nRead our full Asus ZenScreen MB27ACF review\nThe best OLED portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want OLED brightness: The standout feature of this portable computer monitor is the OLED screen that really makes colors pop.\n\u2705 You want a portable screen for on-the-go color work: While not ideal for everyone, a decent color space coverage makes this a fair choice for those working with colors.\n\u274c You don\u2019t need OLED: Not everyone using a portable monitor will need this sort of screen, which adds a fair amount to the price-tag and may be overkill for many uses.\n\u274c You need exact pantones: Color coverage is fair, but it's not precise, and the lack of high resolutions may make this unsuited for professional designers.\nThe Innocn 15A1F is one of the best portable monitors around - light, compact, a well-sized 15.6in screen at 1080p, it covers most bases. It\u2019s not the only portable OLED display out there, but it\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re looking for a crisp, bright screen at a relatively affordable price.\nAlong the device you\u2019ll find two USB-C ports (one for 45W power) and a HDMI 1.4 port. This means you can easily connect it straight to a laptop or games console. However, the 60Hz refresh rate will have limited appeal to serious gamers. Using it on a Windows computer, the desktop appeared remarkably punchy, boasting inky blacks and highly saturated colours. Our only real complaint is the reflective nature of the glossy glass screen.\n400nits is the stated brightness for this panel. In our tests, it hit 406.2nits at 100% brightness setting. Impressive, but not bright enough for true HDR output. Base color coverage runs to 100% sRBG, 98.3% Adobe RGB, and 100% DCI-P3 - so, if you don\u2019t mind the limited screen size, there\u2019s potential here if you\u2019re a designer or working with color.\nRead our full Innocn 15A1F review\nThe best portable monitor for creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a creator: The real star of the show here is the color accuracy and color gamuts, which make it ideal for all types of content creator on the go.\n\u2705 You want an OLED panel: The OLED feature here make it another good pick for those who want a bright (but not too bright) panel for easy viewing even in direct sunlight.\n\u274c You want a higher resolution: While the specs are popping off almost across the board, you might expect higher than 1080p resolution - not that you need 4K with a screen this size.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a budget: The excellent performance and build quality for this device does come at a cost.\nIf you're a content creator or creative professional who needs a portable monitor while working across multiple locations, the ViewSonic VP16 OLED is a top pick. What really caught our eye during review is the wide color gamut and overall accuracy.\nThis display boasts DCI-P3, sRGB, REC.709, and DICOM color modes that impressed us during review. it's also really easy to switch between them all using the on-screen display or the buttons located at the foot of the screen. There's Pantone validation and DisplayHDR 400 certification here, too, and ViewSonic guarantee average Delta E of less than two - in our tests, we measured it at just 0.5.\nSo, what didn't we like? Our biggest issue is that it's not a 10-bit display but 8-bit plus FRC. Resolution sits at just 1080p, which may be a deal-breaker for some. However, under review, text, photos, and videos all looked sharp, so don't let that put you off. On paper, it's pretty average brightness, too, but although we measured brightness at 402cd/m2, it's difficult to imagine anyone having problems using this even in direct sunlight. And, as usual with even some of the best portable monitors, the speakers aren't great.\nBut that's not why you'd buy a display like this - it's for the excellent color accuracy. And on that score, it's difficult to find fault.\nRead our full ViewSonic VP16 OLED review\nThe best laptop screen extender\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a triple-screen set-up: With two portable screens sitting either side of your laptop screen, the Maxfree S6 is a great productivity tool.\n\u2705 You use it at one or two locations: We found this a great addition to our home office workspace, but as a dual-screen device, it\u2019s undeniably heavy and not great for travel.\n\u274c You need a budget screen extender: Laptop screen extenders are already more expensive than a standalone display, and the Maxfree S6 is at the upper end of the scale. For a budget alternative, look to a brand like Arzopa and AOC.\n\u274c Your laptop is not between 13in and 17in: The S6 fits 13-17in laptops, so if you're running a netbook or an especially large display, it won\u2019t be suitable.\nThe Maxfree S6 is a dual-portable monitor with two 15.6in screens that unfold, sitting either side of your Windows or Mac laptop. Best for business use and multi-tasking, it\u2019s really easy to set up, with a standard-issue 15.6in IPS panel featuring 1920 x 1080 resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio, and 60Hz refresh rate. A fairly low 1000:1 contrast ratio and 300cd/m\u00b2 brightness, and a very low 72% NTSC colour gamut round out this portable screen.\nWhat really sets this unit apart from other triple-monitor units is the flexibility over positioning the two screens. Each one is independent of the other, letting you place either in portrait or landscape orientation, using just one or both. Each monitor will also require its own power supply, so make sure your laptop has enough ports or you\u2019re using a USB hub.\nIdeal for use in the office or home office, given its size and weight (360.7 x 216.6 x 45mm / 2.3kg), it\u2019s certainly portable - but it\u2019s undeniably bulky, and we found using the supplied case a necessity over cramming it into a laptop bag. For a smaller, more portable option, check out our The Portable Monitor Flex 14-inch review. It's also not the cheapest laptop screen extender we\u2019ve seen out there. For low-cost alternatives, we recommend looking at models from brands like Arzopa and AOC.\nRead our full Maxfree S6 Triple Laptop Screen Extender review\nThe best small portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a tiny travel-friendly display: At just 13.3in, the CrowVi is ideal for those who want a small, lightweight portable display for travel.\n\u2705 You want a touchscreen device: Not all portable monitors we try have touchscreen, but it's a welcome addition to this small and simple unit.\n\u274c You need a bright, high-resolution screen: While we enjoyed our time with the CrowVi, it's not the brightest you can find.\n\u274c You need the thinnest portable monitor you can: It may boast a small screen, but this is certainly not the thinnest portable display we've tested.\nThe CrowVi portable monitor from Elecrow has all the bells and whistles of a modern screen while being simple and small. The glossy 13.3in FHD IPS panel is bright at 300 nits and offers an 800:1 contrast level. Being thin at less than 10mm and weighing around 350 grams, the monitor can easily be moved around. The IPS technology also provides a great viewing angle and faithful color reproduction. The supplied plastic cover doubles as a stand while protecting the screen.\nWe found the display worked right out of the box, providing superb image quality and a touch interface. The low power consumption and built-in speaker make it an essential accessory for crowded spaces like desktops. Its best feature is that it works with only one Type-C connection, providing power, display, and touch input.\nOur biggest issue using the CrowVi is its glossy screen, which can distract from serious work. The bezel isn\u2019t the smallest found on a portable display, and while using only a slide button for the menu might be economical, this renders navigating the settings time-consuming. But, perhaps, that's the trade-off for a cheap portable monitor that's on the small side compared to most. See our Read our full CrowView Note review for a larger alternative from the same makers.\nRead our full CrowVi review\nThe best dual-screen portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want two screens with higher than usual resolution: Both of these 16in screens have a resolution of 2.5K, ideal for\n\u2705 You're a creator: There are two factors that make this model stand out to me - 100% sRGB color gamut and a touchscreen with pen support.\n\u274c You need a highly portable monitor: With its dual-screen set-up and 16in screens, it's a large and heavy device.\n\u274c You need a portable monitor for gaming: While we liked a lot of the specs here, the 60Hz refresh rate limits its use for gamers.\nThe Delta Pro Touch from monitor-makers Uperfect is a pretty impressive device, all told. Here, you get two 16in 2.5K monitors, each covering 100% of the sRGB color gamut, and both supporting touch interface. There's even a stylus included in the box, which makes it one of the best portable monitors for creators, photographers, and anyone editing images.\nAfter unboxing our review unit, we gave it the once over. Design-wise, it's fairly compact, but it's not one for everyday carry - better to set it up in one location, rather than carting around multiple locations in a day (although that's absolutely a possibility). The included kickstand also felt stable and was versatile in use.\nTesting this portable monitor for over two weeks, we connected it to a range of devices, including a MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, Dell Precision and ThinkPad laptops, and even set it up to display Apple TV on one screen and a Mac on the other. Throughout this time, we had no issues with performance at all. Thanks to the built-in screen rotation tool, it also served as a good presentation unit, letting others see what you see when folded over.\nPorts selection is straightforward enough but hardly generous, with just a USB-C and mini HDMI port, but there's already two screens here, so we wouldn't\nIt's not as widely available as I'd like - you can get it shipped worldwide from the Uperfect website, of course, but beyond AliExpress, I can't see many options out there for the UK, Europe, and Australia. Still, at the time of writing it's been heavily discounted on both sites, which may swing it for you.\nRead our full Uperfect Delta Pro Touch review\nBest portable monitor: Also tested\nNot every portable monitor we test can be considered the best, but each of these deserve an honorable mention.\nWe really liked this slick and slim portable monitor for its lightweight design and high-resolution screen.

Plug one end into your device, the other end into the display, and head into your operating system's display settings for further configurations like mirroring.\nSome portable monitors also connect to devices via USB-A, mini-HDMI, micro-HDMI, and VGA. Check your manual for full details.\nAre portable monitors compatible with all devices?\nYou'll find the best portable monitors are compatible with laptops, tablets and gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch. Depending on the portable monitor model, it may be possible to hook up to display to a desktop, but if you have the space for a second full-sized monitor, this will be usually be the better option for productivity gains.\nDo portable monitors have built-in speakers?\nSome of the best portable monitor models do feature built-in speakers. However, when it comes to internal speakers, we find audio quality varies greatly. Lower-priced portable monitors often having a shallow, tinny sound to them, lacking in bass. These speakers will be fine for presentations or in a pinch, but pale in comparison to those with dedicated audio systems or external speakers.\nDo portable monitors require external power?\nIt depends on the model. Some portable monitors feature a built-in rechargeable battery, while others will draw power from the connected device.\nBoth have pros and cons. A portable monitor with a battery means you can use it for longer on the go, but it will be heavier. They're also more expensive. A display without a battery is lighter to carry, but will drain your device faster if you're not connected to the mains.\nHow to choose the best portable monitor for you\nChoosing portable monitor hinges on your use case and to what device you are connecting.\nHardware & connections\nWhen selecting the best monitors for a dual set-up, most people pair a portable monitor with a USB-C-equipped laptop. When it comes to plug-and-play simplicity, these are usually the top option, ensuring both compatibility and plenty of bandwidth for any resolution a portable monitor is likely to offer. That said, many mobile screens also support mini-HDMI, micro-HDMI, USB-A, and VGA. Just be aware that it may require software and drivers, which could present a problem depending on your device to drive the display.\nScreen size & resolution\nScreen size is an important deciding factor - big enough to complete tasks, small enough to carry with you. Most of the best portable monitors are 15.6-inch panels with a 1080p resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels - although 4K portable monitors are becoming increasingly prevalent, with better color accuracy and color space coverage for creatives. However, 10 to 13in screens are available for true portability.\nRefresh rate & response time\nMost of the portable monitors we review have a refresh rate of 60Hz - standard for most monitors, except for the best gaming monitors. if gaming if your prime concern, and where every millisecond counts, check for a screen that refreshes the on-screen image faster. Look for 120Hz or 240Hz. Response times refer to how long it takes for a pixel on your monitor to change - the quicker, the better, especially for games.\nBattery\nBattery or no battery is another critical question. You can get portable screens both with and without built-in power. Cheap portable monitors tend to come without a battery, and are lighter. However, if you\u2019re using a mobile screen away from the mains, they will drain your laptop\u2019s battery pretty fast.\nBrightness\nBrightness is a significant factor, particularly for creative work and gaming. If you plan to use your portable display outside, you want as much of that as humanly possible. Most are limited, only topping out at a little over 200 nits. Aim for the brightest, highest luminance you can get - although brighter displays will use up even more battery when powered by your laptop. We always test the luminance of a device to see how well it holds up against the manufacturer's claims.\nBudget\nThe best portable monitors range in price, from as little as $50 up to hundreds of dollars for premium displays - so it's easy to find one that does everything you need at the right price. Don't forget to check Black Friday portable monitor deals and Prime Day portable monitor deals when the seasonal shopping sales are on.\nHow we test the best portable monitors\nWe've tested a range of professional displays, including the best monitors for video editing, the best monitors for MacBook Pro, and the best monitors for photo editing. We've also reviewed the best monitors and best business monitors. So, we know what to look out for when you need a second screen to take with you.\nAll devices featured in this round-up have been tested by us. We evaluate these displays across many aspects, starting with the design and dimensions, exploring weight and overall portability. Build quality is essential for the best portable monitors, and we're looking for robust devices that are designed for travel, the commute, and multi-location set-ups.\nFor screens, we look at size, avoiding - and noting - any signs of glossiness and reflectiveness when used in bright rooms or outdoors in sunlight. We also compare each display's resolution, and whether it's capable for the use. For example, we'd expect higher resolutions for photo editing than for streaming movies or presentations at work.\nWe also check brightness and viewing angles - and we always test the manufacturer's claims of brightness. In many cases, peak luminance in a real-world setting is lower than the stated specs, and we'll note this in our review. Where available or relevant, we'll evaluate color accuracy and color coverage to identify the screens with the best image quality.\nFor more, see our guide How we test, review and rate professional and business monitors on TechRadar Pro.\nWe also tested the best monitors for graphic design - and these are the ones we recommend\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best monitor for photo editing of 2025: Expert picks for photography and Photoshop\nWe tested the best photo editing monitors for color accuracy, color gamut, and pro-level content creation\nWhen testing for the best monitor for photo editing, what I'm looking for are screens with high resolutions (4K minimum) broad sRGB and AdobeRGB color gamuts, and high color accuracy so your edits look the same on the screen and everywhere else they appear.\nFor that reason, I still rate the Dell UltraSharp U3224KB as the best photo editing monitor for professional photographers - with this 6K display, you'll immediately see how impressive it is when editing in Photoshop, Lightroom, and more, and we loved the experience of using it. See our full review below, alongside some top alternatives for all kinds of photography and image editing workflows.\nFor more essentials, my team and I have also rounded up the best photo editing PCs, the best laptops for photo editing, and the best photo editors.\nThe quick list\nBest overall\nThe Dell UltraSharp U3224KB offers an extraordinary combination of beautiful display, a beautiful webcam, quality audio, complete with Thunderbolt connectivity. In our tests, we found the 6K picture quality stunning, the port selection excellent, and the camera to be crisp.\nBest on a budget\nThe Asus ProArt PA279CRV proves professional photo editing monitors don\u2019t need to cost the earth. A 27in 4K display, the screen offers excellent color coverage and plenty of pop thanks to 400 nits of brightness.\nBest 4K\nThe BenQ PD3205U is an excellent monitor with a very strong focus on productivity and color accuracy. It has a great port offering, a programmable hotkey hockey puck dial, and a built-in KVM switch to help switch between multiple devices.\nBest for Mac\nOffering seamless integration with macOS, it matches the MacBook color profile almost perfectly, and is as close as I have seen to a first-party Apple display without actually being a first-party Apple Display, with features not even the Studio Display has.\nBest for business\nThe Dell UltraSharp U2723QE is a 27-inch 4K monitor with a focus on color accuracy and connectivity. It features a wide range of color presets (sRGB, Rec. 709, DCI-P3), making it perfect for photo editing, while the built-in connectivity hub and KVM switch add productivity benefits.\nBest portable\nIf you\u2019re working across multiple locations, the espressoDisplay portable monitor is the ideal solution. It\u2019s thin, lightweight, and robust enough to carry with you day-to-day. An impressively versatile display for photo editors.\nBest monitor for photo editing overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWith its impressive 6K resolution and sRGB 100% color coverage, the Dell UltraSharp U3224KBis arguably the best photo editing monitor for pretty much everyone.\nBeautifully designed, the display features a Thunderbolt hub, 4K webcam, and a soundbar, all built into one clean package. The only other monitor we've tested that comes close with this combination is the Apple Studio Display; in terms of image quality and size, the Dell U3224KB is more like the Apple Pro Display XDR. Both are excellent choices for photographers and creatives - but here, you're getting the best of both worlds in a single 32-inch screen (and it's cheaper with better connectivity, too)\nThat sRGB color space, though broad, may be a deal-breaker for some professional users who prefer Adobe RGB, and the 16:9 ratio has fallen out of favor in recent years. But for most these specs will be absolutely great. And with the stunning picture quality, extra-high resolution. it's got every other base covered, whatever photos you're working on.\nRead our full Dell UltraSharp U3224KB 6K monitor review\nBest budget photo editing monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThere aren't many budget photo editing monitors that boast 99% Adobe RGB and 99% DCI-P3, but the Asus ProArt PA279CRV is one of them.\nThis affordable screen delivers a near-pro level experience without breaking the bank. Better still, it looks great straight out of the box, before you even dive into the monitor's extensive calibration settings.\nThe 27-inch IPS panel features full 4K resolution for crisper images, excellent color space coverage, and a decent 400nits luminance. We really liked the features and connectivity with this screen, too, which includes includes USB-C connectivity. With its 96W power delivery and display daisy chaining, this makes for a very versatile display.\nHowever, it is a budget screen, so there are some compromises here. We did find the contrast to be relatively weak at 1,000:1, and the ProArt PA279CRV only has basic DisplayHDR 400 certification. But when it comes to picture quality, color accuracy, and plentiful connectivity, it's difficult to beat the value for money here.\nTo bring the price down even further, use one of our Asus coupon codes.\nRead our full Asus ProArt PA279CRV review\nBest 4K monitor for photo editing\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe BenQ PD3205U Monitor is an excellent choice for creatives who want a 4K panel that is perfect for photo and video editing thanks to its high color accuracy and great sRGB coverage. The integrated KVM Switch allows users to connect multiple computers and easily switch between them, all while moving any connected USB Devices with you from device to device (such as a mouse and keyboard). BenQ is notorious for not only great monitors but also their famous hockey puck control dial. This dial, by default, is helpful, but if customized, this becomes super-powered and helps with switching between color profiles, volume, KVM switching between devices, brightness levels, or any number of other settings.\nFurther, for those who rely on the accuracy of their digital product for their work, the BenQ PD3220U is a great choice because of its 99% sRGB and Rec. 709 color spaces. Though it does have a fairly dim display overall, so if you are working in a rather bright workspace, by a window with sunlight coming in and hitting the display, or something like that, you may want to consider all of that before grabbing a monitor with only 250 nits of brightness. But, if you don\u2019t mind that, this monitor is a great balance of features and price for those needing a reliable workhorse of a display.\nRead our full BenQ PD3205U review\nBest photo editing monitor for Mac\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe BenQ MA320U display has to be one of my favorite displays I have tested with my MacBook Pro. It\u2019s like an extension of my MacBook rather than something you have to add to my MacBook. The integration with DisplayPilot 2 makes it so I can control volume, brightness, and more all natively through my MacBook, without needing to go through any OSD, making this monitor feel like a native Apple Display. The color accuracy is nearly identical to the MacBook, making it a perfect reference monitor. Further, there is a native KVM switch, and, unlike the first-party Apple displays, the BenQ MA320U has not one, but two HDMI ports too, allowing for much greater usability for those trying to have a hybrid setup or for those who may want a great display but don\u2019t have a USB-C MacBook (or MacBook at all).\nOne downside is that this monitor does not have Thunderbolt 4, which means it may not be the most future-proof of all-in-one displays and docks, but it does have a beautiful display and port offerings, along with a sleek design, so it may be worth throwing on a Thunderbolt dock between your MacBook and this monitor if you need those extra ports and transfer speeds.\nRead our full BenQ MA320U review\nBest photo editing monitor for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nA wide range of color spaces - 100% Rec 709, 100% sRGB, 98% DCI-P3 - mark the 27-inch Dell U2723QE as one of the best monitors for photo editing if you want an all-in-one work hub.\nThis 4K UHD 3840 x 2160 LED screen offers true-to-life color, and while not the brightest monitor, we found the 2000:1 contrast ratio and HDR features helped to create a well-balanced, beautiful image with accurate colors when editing your photos. Those color space presets do more than just look great. They're excellent for increasing productivity. The ability to choose different presets meant we could switch from office apps to photo editing workflows quickly and easily.\nFor those spending long hours in front of the screen, we also found Low Blue Light emissions let us use the monitor without eye fatigue, even when we were parked in front of it for hours.\nOn the connectivity side, the U2723QE provides USB-C or DisplayPort ports for daisy-chaining monitors. You can also set up KVM, Picture-In-Picture, and Picture-By-Picture if you need to see or control multiple computers simultaneously. It may all be more than you need, and it doesn't come cheap, but as an all-in-one hub for any serious workspace, it excels.\nRead our full Dell UltraSharp U2723QE review\nBest portable photo editing monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're working across locations, a portable monitor is a smart choice. Lightweight, easily carried, but with the same high resolutions and color coverage you'll need photo editing on the go. We've tested loads of compact models, but the espressoDisplay really stands out for us.\nDesign-wise, it's slim, sleek, simple - a single cable and a screen about the size of an iPad. We immediately felt the high build quality when in our hands - it feels durable, built for taking with you when you're roaming the streets, taking the commute.\nThe display supports 100% sRGB color space - that may or may not be a deal-breaker, but as a portable or second monitor away from your home workspace, this should be more than enough. The highly responsive touch FHD display makes it ideal for anyone drawing or photo editing with a stylus.

Monitors for photographers and other content creators deliver greater clarity thanks to pin-sharp resolutions and picture-perfect color accuracy. So, even if your clients can't see on their standard monitors, if the image is used elsewhere - from display ads to printed assets - you can be confident that they look precisely as intended.\nDo I need a 4K monitor for photo editing?\nYou don't necessarily need the best 4K monitor for basic photo editing, but if you're a professional photographer or creative, it's the ideal resolution. A 4K photo editing monitor offers a lot more clarity over standard 1080p monitors. This gives you even more control over the finer details of each image you edit, producing outstanding results.\nFor photo editing, the best 5K and 8K monitors are even better, with even more details displayed. However, they've yet to go truly mainstream, so even if you edit images on an 8K monitor, others may not appreciate your work (until they get a similarly specced screen, at least). Opt for 4K if it's within budget.\nShould I choose sRGB or DCI-P3 or Adobe RGB?\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a graphic design or photo editing monitor, you may have come across sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color spaces. These are important, as it tells you how much of the spectrum is represented on the screen - and ideally, you\u2019ll want what you see while working to be as accurate to the finished product as possible. Effectively, it\u2019ll look the same on your screen as it does when, say, that asset is exported or sent to print.\nsRGB is the most common color space and is ideal for most photo editing, especially online or digital work.\nAdobe RGB covers 35% more of the color space than sRGB, displays better blues, and is great for printed assets.\nDCI-P3 is similar to Adobe RGB, displays better blues, primarily designed for video editing, and it's Apple's preferred color space.\nWhat's the difference between OLED and QLED?\nWhen scouting for a new monitor to complement your software, you're likely to come across OLED and QLED displays. But which one should you choose for editing photos?\nOLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) screens are best for picture quality. Contrasts are better, with deeper blacks, better contrast, and better viewing angles, while consuming less power. QLED (Quantum Light-Emitting Diode) displays are best when you're working to a budget. These screens are typically brighter, with good color display, but they lack authenticity when it comes to displaying, say, deep blacks on screen.\nExplore the topic in our guide OLED vs QLED: Which TV tech is the best?\nShould I choose a curved monitor for photo editing?\nTechRadar Pro spoke to Brett Barbour, VP at US monitor vendor, Viotek, to find out whether it makes business sense to opt for a non-flat monitor for photo editing. Here's what he told us:\nWhen you think of the types of people that use \u2013 and love \u2013 the best curved monitors, three types of people come mind: gamers, gamers and gamers. But why should gamers have all the fun? Curved monitors could bring a fair bit of ergonomic benefit for office workers too. After all, our eyes have a nice curve to them. We might as well have a monitor that comes with a nice curve to match, right? Especially if we\u2019re expected to use them at least 6-8 hours a day. Ergonomics isn\u2019t the only benefits to curved monitors for the office.\nMost of us are spending a lot of time staring at a screen, be it for work or for play. And this brings additional health risks for our eyes. Headaches. Eye strain. Eye fatigue. But research has shown that curved panels yield less eye strain and fatigue than flat panels. So they\u2019re easier on the eyes \u2013 especially helpful if you spend most of your day in front of a monitor (or expect your employees to).\nThis benefit can also be further leveraged by software integrated into the monitor. For example, ASUS has their Eye Care technology; Viotek has their \u201cViotek Protect\u201d; and Samsung features a proprietary \u201cEye Saver Mode.\u201d These all provide a range of eye-saving benefits, including reducing the amount of harmful blue light radiation from hitting your eyes \u2013 particularly helpful when you\u2019re looking at the screen for extended all day.\nYou can expect less glare and distortion with a curved monitor. Its corners are closer to you, replicating the natural curvature of the human eye. In most workspace setups, the curved monitor won\u2019t reflect light at all, effectively reducing glare from other sources of light. The only exception being if a window is directly behind you at a certain angle. This is a rarity, but it can certainly happen.\nBut that's not all; normally, how nice a monitor looks is purely a question of personal preference. You like what you like \u2013 simple as. But the reality is that a curved monitor might take up less desk real estate than its flat counterpart. It might be nominal depending on the stand that it uses, but the curved ends will definitely give you some extra space to place odds and ends on your desk, from phone charging pads, pen holder or what have you.\nHowever, it is worth looking at the potential issues they might come from. In most cases, a curved monitor still costs a bit more than its flat-screen counterpart. An LG 34WK650-W is a 34-inch flat-screen IPS monitor with 2560x1080p resolution that goes for about $396.99. Or you could grab an LG 34GL750-B 34-inch curved monitor with the same resolution and faster refresh rate for around $449.99.\nThe difference might be as little as $50-75 per monitor. Still, if you\u2019re trying to fill up an entire office, that can add up.\nBut Is It Really a Con? Well, for now, maybe. But the cost gap is closing quickly, as manufacturing costs are dropping fast and certain brands (Samsung, ASUS, Viotek, et al.) find ways to pack a lot of features in quality monitors without sending the price through the roof.\nThere's also talks about the fact that curved monitors could hinder straight-line perception. This is another possibly niche drawback with curved monitors. It certainly won\u2019t apply to every office. Professionals in engineering, drafting or drawing industries may find that their straight-line perception is slightly skewed because of the curvature of a monitor. There is software that can \u201cfix\u201d this issue, but if you\u2019re in one of these industries, you may be better off sticking with a flat screen monitor for now.\nBrett Barbour is vice president of US monitor vendor Viotek.\nHow to choose the best photo editing monitor for you\nDisplay quality is absolutely critical when choosing which photo editing monitor is best. Whether you're running the best graphic design software or the best photo editors out there, you can use virtually any screen for editing photos. However, the quality will vary, and images will likely display very differently on different devices.\nColor accuracy & color coverage\nColor accuracy is a good starting point. IPS panels have the best color accuracy, though there is significant variation from one monitor model to the next. You'll find that some of the best business monitors are similarly-specced for photo editing. Many professionals with very specific digital or print workflows will know exactly what they need in terms of gamut coverage. But if you're not sure what you need, look for at least 95% coverage of either the DCI-P3 or Adobe RGB gamuts in the specs. That isn't professional grade color coverage. But it can be achieved quite cheaply these days and it's a good starting point for photo editing for web and other entry level or semi pro workflows. True 8-bit color coverage without dithering is another good minimum requirement, though again professional grade displays will be 10-bit.\nScreen resolution\nResolution is the next major spec point. More pixels allow you to view images in greater detail and closer to their true resolution. These days, there's little need to settle for less than 4K given entry-level 4K displays are now truly affordable. Just remember that you lose pixel density as screen sizes increase if the resolution remains the same. A 4K 40-inch monitor sounds great, but it doesn't actually have the pixel density required to render really sharp images. You also have the option of larger format ultrawide panels, including 5K2K monitors, which allow for more space while multi-tasking at the same time as displaying plenty of detail for image editing.\nHDR\nYou may or may not require HDR support, but be aware that few monitors that claim HDR capabilities are truly HDR monitors. If you want full HDR fidelity, it's very, very expensive. If in doubt, don't worry about HDR support, it's probably not required and you almost certainly don't want to spend the money to achieve actual HDR display performance.\nConnectivity\nOn the connectivity side, we recommend displays with USB-C sockets supporting power delivery of at least 65W, especially if you use a laptop or MacBook. USB-C used to add significantly to the price of a monitor. But more recently, 4K displays with USB-C connectivity have become much more reasonably priced.\nHow we test the best monitor for photo editing\n\u2705 15 years of product testing\n\u2705 Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2705 Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe've tested hundreds of displays for creatives including the best portable monitors, best monitors for MacBook Pro and the best monitors for the Mac mini.\nWhen testing which monitor for photo editing is best, we begin by looking at screen size and resolution. Screen size is measured diagonally in inches, while resolution measures the number of pixels that make up the display. But a bigger monitor doesn't necessarily mean greater resolution; the 24-inch Eizo has a higher resolution than the 27-inch NEC, for example.\nInstead, a more useful measure of the 'crispness' of a display is pixel density, measured in pixels per inch (ppi). The NEC is 82ppi, the Eizo 94ppi, while Samsung and Dell weigh in at 109ppi.\nMonitors increasingly offer more than just a simple display for your computer, and we've also looked at additional features including built-in speakers, USB hubs, card readers and multiple inputs, such as HDMI, for use with a variety of devices.\nWhile true-to-life colour reproduction is very important in image editing, you may need to compromise to get all the features you want within budget. LED backlighting allows thinner displays, while IPS (or Samsung's PLS) allows for greater viewing angles.\nWe'd always recommend using a digital interface like DVI or HDMI, but it depends on what your computer has. Do you want to plug in multiple devices? Make sure your new monitor has the same input as your computer has output!\nSeveral of these displays enable you to swivel the monitor from side to side and turn the screen 90 degrees into portrait mode.\nMost monitors are now capable of Full HD resolution (1920x1080) but more and more can achieve higher resolutions - many here are capable of 2560x1440, for example.\nWith so many devices plugged into our computers these days, a USB hub really is something you'll wonder how you lived without.\nSo many monitors - including several of these - are just plain ugly.

It occupies just 320 x 140 mm of space and can be folded when not in use.\nThe idea is to deliver a dual-purpose tool for coders or business users who need a second screen. However, the relatively low resolution and aspect ratio may limit how much useful content can actually be displayed.\nThe screen can function as a touch-enabled display if set as the main monitor, but Thanko quietly notes: \u201cIf it does not work properly even after changing the settings, it is a compatibility issue.\u201d\nDespite its promise of touch interaction, there\u2019s no mention of macOS or Linux support, suggesting this device is designed solely for the Windows ecosystem. As a result, its usefulness outside that environment remains unknown.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nWhile it could make for a decent business keyboard, or a keyboard for coding, it really needs broader compatibility.\nThe keyboard uses blue switches by default and allows full customization, including switch types and keycaps. It also includes an RGB LED backlight and ships with a USB 3.2 Gen 1 cable. Users can supplement power via an additional USB Type-C port if needed.\nThat said, it\u2019s hard to determine whether the typing experience is truly premium or merely adequate with flair, as no typing latency or switch actuation specs are disclosed.\nDesigned for plug-and-play via USB 3.0, the keyboard weighs about 1.5 kg and is listed at 69,800 yen (around $445).\nIt certainly scores points for compactness and desk economy, but at nearly $450, buyers may wonder whether it\u2019s worth the cost compared to purchasing a standalone mechanical keyboard and a separate secondary display.\nYou might also like\n- Take a look at our picks for the best WFH apps around\n- Check out our recommendations for the best monitors for working from home\n- HPE flags critical StoreOnce auth bypass, users should update now\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

      "text": "Remember that little sliver of digital real estate Apple gave us above the keyboard on their MacBook Pros? The Touch Bar. It was a bold idea, a dynamic strip promising contextual controls and a glimpse into the future of input. Yet, for many of us, it often felt like a missed opportunity, a solution searching for a problem, or perhaps just too small to truly flex its potential. The concept, however, always held a certain allure, a whisper of what could be if only it were given more room to breathe.\nNow, imagine taking that very concept, blowing it up to a substantial 12.8 inches, giving it full touchscreen capabilities, and then setting it free from the confines of Apple\u2019s closed ecosystem. That\u2019s precisely what the KeyGo keyboard is attempting to do, and it\u2019s a rather inventive piece of kit that feels like the Touch Bar\u2019s ambitious, overachieving sibling. Imagine a laptop without any of the computing power, but all of the potential \u2013 the KeyGo is a portable command center, ready to turn any machine you own into a dual-screen, multi-touch productivity powerhouse.\nDesigner: KeyGo\nClick Here to Buy Now: $249 $538 (50% off). Hurry, only 23/200 left!\nThat integrated screen, a 12.8-inch beauty with a 1920\u00d7720 resolution at 60Hz, is where the magic truly happens. Some might glance at the 720p height and scoff, but that\u2019s missing the point entirely. This isn\u2019t a standard 720p display; think of it as a 1440p screen cleverly sliced in half. That means you\u2019re getting a surprisingly dense pixel count across its width, ensuring text and visuals remain crisp and clear. It\u2019s a dedicated external display, ready to give you that coveted dual-monitor setup wherever you happen to be.\nThe keyboard itself features scissor-switch keys, a choice that promises a satisfyingly tactile and responsive typing experience, akin to what you\u2019d find on a high-quality laptop. No mushy keys here; you can actually get some serious words per minute down. Adding to the flair and functionality, the keyboard also comes with RGB lighting, offering three distinct modes. This isn\u2019t just for show; customizable backlighting can be genuinely useful for working in dim environments or simply for adding a bit of personalized panache to your mobile workstation.\nConnectivity is handled by USB-C, a modern and universal standard that makes hooking up the KeyGo to virtually any device a breeze. It works seamlessly with phones, tablets, and laptops, whether you\u2019re a Windows warrior or a macOS maestro. This single-cable solution for both power and data is a godsend for minimizing clutter, especially when you\u2019re trying to set up a productive workspace on a tiny coffee shop table or a cramped airplane tray.\nThe moment you lay eyes on the KeyGo, its build quality immediately stands out. Forget flimsy plastic; this thing boasts a CNC-machined aluminum enclosure, giving it a premium feel that belies its portability. It\u2019s surprisingly thin, designed to slide effortlessly into your bag. The 95% key layout strikes a clever balance, retaining nearly all the essential keys you need for serious work and still packing a numpad for people who need those extra keys, i.e., gamers and accountants.\nThe KeyGo\u2019s hinge is another piece of design brilliance. It folds a full 180 degrees, offering unparalleled adjustability. This lets you position that auxiliary touchscreen exactly where you need it \u2013 whether you want it angled slightly above the keys for quick glances, or fully upright as a dedicated second monitor for reference materials. Imagine having your main document on your laptop screen and a Spotify playlist running on the KeyGo\u2019s display. Or a video preview running on the main display and the Final Cut or Premiere Pro timeline on the auxiliary display for effective editing and post-processing. Or better still, gaming in the main window, and Discord in the smaller side-screen. GENIUS.\nWho is this ingenious device perfect for? Digital nomads will find it indispensable, transforming any tablet or phone into a powerful, multi-screen workstation. Students can keep their research notes or lecture slides visible on the secondary screen while typing out essays. Content creators might use it for timeline scrubbing in video editors or for monitoring live streams. Even casual users who just want a better typing experience for their tablet, with the added benefit of a dedicated notification center or media control panel, will find immense value.\nThe KeyGo takes a concept that was perhaps ahead of its time or simply poorly executed in its initial iteration and re-imagines it with a focus on user utility and robust design. Forget Apple\u2019s self-proclaimed \u2018Magic Keyboard\u2019\u2026 the KeyGo is a Keyboard that truly feels like \u2018Magic\u2019! MSRP for the KeyGo starts at $538, but backers can grab their units at a 54% discount for just $249, with global shipping and a 1-year warranty.\nClick Here to Buy Now: $249 $538 (50% off).

Detail is the whole point of 4K \u2013 most of the time, you won\u2019t be able to see the pixels in a 4K display, so everything looks natural and sharp. It\u2019s great for photos, videos and gaming for this reason, but actually it\u2019s superior for just about everything \u2013 it\u2019s nicer when text looks smoother on a computer, for example.\nThe vast majority of the time, 4K refers to a specific resolution of 3840 x 2160 (which is also known as \u2018Ultra HD\u2019) \u2013 this is the resolution of all 4K TVs and 4K video streams from the likes of Netflix or YouTube. Some cameras record in what\u2019s often known as \u2018Cinema 4K\u2019, which is a resolution of 4096 x 2160. You may find that some computer monitors refer to themselves as 4K, and will have a horizontal resolution around 4,000 pixels, but have a different height to the resolutions mentioned above, such as ultra-wide monitors. The width is what makes something 4K or not.\nYou\u2019ll mostly see 4K referred to in TVs of 40 inches and above, in computer and laptop monitors, on video streaming services, and in video recording on cameras or phones.\nLatest about 4K\nI tested the Samsung S95F and LG G5 OLED TVs side-by-side: here's which one you should get\nBy James Davidson published\nIt's Samsung Vs LG in the battle of premium OLED TVs in 2025\nI love 4K Blu-ray, and these are the 6 discs I want to treat myself to on my birthday\nBy James Davidson published\n4K Blu-rays and my birthday go hand-in-hand: here's the discs I'll be hoping to add to my collection\nThe best TV, chosen by our reviewers for all budgets\nBy Al Griffin last updated\nTop OLED and QLED sets to consider, from elite TVs to wallet-friendly options \u2013 all tested by us.\nThe 13 best PS4 Pro games to play in 2025\nBy Rob Dwiar last updated\nGet the most out of Sony's enhanced console from last gen with one of the best PS4 Pro games.\nDell Pro 32 Plus business monitor review\nBy Collin Probst published\nThe Dell Pro 32 Plus packs 32 inches of beautiful 4K picture at 100Hz, decent ports, Native Mac compatibility, and a brightness that caps at 350 nits.\nThis 34-inch business monitor is curved, fast, has Ethernet, Smart KVM, and a webcam \u2014 shame there\u2019s no 5K option for creative users\nBy Wayne Williams published\nAOC's 34-inch curved WQHD panel features Ethernet, Smart KVM, a webcam, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nThe best 75-inch TVs, all tested by our big-screen experts\nBy Al Griffin last updated\nUpdated The best 75-inch TVs offer a true big-screen experience, with a size befitting the greatest films and the most nail-biting sports matches.\nThere's a huge Criterion Collection 4K Blu-ray sale happening at Amazon ahead of Prime Day \u2013 here are the 5 movies I'd pick\nBy James Davidson published\nMajor savings of the best 4k Blu-rays you can add to your collection\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more."
