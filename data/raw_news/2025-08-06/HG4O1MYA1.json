It was spearheaded by former Yeovil chairman Scott Priestnall, who said it was needed to \"help the club survive\".\n\nPriestnall sold the club to Martin Hellier shortly after the sale was completed during a period of turbulence, and at a time when they were briefly relegated to National League South.\n\nUnder the terms of the lease the club are able to buy back the stadium, and Robins said owning it had many benefits.\n\n\"There's a rent bill that wouldn't need to be paid - that's the main thing - but it gives us options to secure the long-term sustainability of the football club,\" he said.\n\n\"It's so important for fans and supporters to think you've got your own stadium.\"\n\nYeovil begin the 2025-26 National League campaign at home to Hartlepool United on Saturday, 9 August in the first match under Srinivasan's tenure.",

  "argos_summary": "Yeovil Town FC has been renting Huish Park from the South Somerset District Council since its sale over three years ago, which was aimed at helping the club survive financially. The council has approved the sale of the stadium and surrounding land, allowing the club to potentially buy it back under a 30-year lease, which would eliminate rent payments and secure the club's long-term sustainability. While the deal has received unanimous support from the council, some members express concerns about the financial risks involved for taxpayers.",
