  "title": "Why the latest inflation report is a best-case scenario for the stock market",
  "description": "For investors, the July CPI print was just right, as it raised the odds of a rate cut at the next Fed meeting while showing that inflation isn't spiraling.",
  "content": "\u2022 A July inflation report that was cooler than expected has pushed up rate-cut odds.\n\u2022 Stocks jumped on Tuesday after the report as bullish traders adjusted their outlook for monetary policy.\n\u2022 Trump criticized Fed Chair Powell after the report, urging rate cuts and hinting at a lawsuit.\n\nThe stock market rallied on the latest inflation report.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed at a record high on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq rose over 1% and the Dow spiked nearly 500 points. The benchmark S&P 500 is up almost 10% year-to-date.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood at the 4 p.m. ET closing bell on Tuesday:\n\nThe consumer price index rose 2.7% year-over-year in July, slightly below economists' expectations of 2.8%. For investors, this was just right \u2014 not too hot, not too cold.\n\nThat's mainly because it was likely low enough to allow the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September meeting, traditionally a bull catalyst for stocks.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool now shows markets seeing 92% odds the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points next month, up from about 80% on Monday. Higher odds are also being priced in for a cut in October and December following Tuesday's CPI release.\n\n\"Tuesday's CPI data was tame enough that it gives the Federal Reserve the green light to cut rates by at least 25 basis points in September and opens the possibility of a larger 50 basis point cut in September,\" said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital, on Tuesday. \"This data, coupled with the weak July employment report from earlier this month, puts the nail in the coffin for lower interest rates.\"\n\nInvestors had been waiting for more insight into how higher tariffs would affect inflation data, and the July number shows the impact has not been severe, at least for now.\n\nTo be sure, with many deadlines for tariffs set for August, the impact on inflation could be more pronounced in the coming months.\n\nBut for now, the market is cheering higher rate-cut odds for September and a lower likelihood of the economy's most dreaded scenario\u2014stagflation\u2014when inflation surges while economic activity stalls.\n\nOn the flip side, inflation was high enough to signal that consumer demand is strong enough to continue to support price growth. The July payrolls report, which saw massive downward revisions to June and May data, had fueled fears that a potential recession was underway. Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics director after the report was released.",

The Dow Jones was developed by Charles Henry Dow and originally contained just 12 American companies. It was published for the first time in May 1896 and opened at a level of 40.94 points. Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average consists of the 30 most important market-leading companies on the American stock exchange and reflects their growth. (read more)\nLike the Swiss Market Index (SMI), the Dow Jones is a price index. The shares included in it are weighted according to price; the index level represents the average of the shares included in it. Dividend payments are not considered in the index.\nThe inclusion of a company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average does not depend on defined criteria. Instead, an independent Wall Street Journal commission decides whether a share is to be included or excluded. There are no fixed times for reviewing the composition of the index, since changes are only made by the commission as and when they are needed.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is traded on Wall Street each trading day between 3:30 pm and 10:00 pm CET."

      "text": "- Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner after low jobs numbers.\n- He criticized Dr. Erika McEntarfer, appointed by Biden, for what he called inaccurate job data.\n- The US added 73,000 jobs in July, and BLS sharply revised lower the number of jobs created in May and June.\nFollowing a disappointing jobs report on Friday, President Donald Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner.\nDr. Erika McEntarfer was appointed to the BLS in January 2024 by former President Joe Biden.\n\"We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \"Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"\nOn Friday afternoon, BLS confirmed to Business Insider that McEntarfer was terminated.\nDuring the search for McEntarfer's replacement, Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as Acting Commissioner, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said on X.\nThe US economy added 73,000 jobs in July, missing the expected 106,000, and revisions showed that there were far fewer jobs created in May and June than initially reported.\nRevisions to the jobs figures are not uncommon as BLS collects additional data in the months after the initial estimates, although the Bureau noted that this month's revisions were \"larger than normal.\"\nErnie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, wrote on X that \"BLS payroll numbers 'overstated' employment by half a million in 2019 as well. Every economist who knows the 1st thing about labor data knows this has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with the challenges of real-time jobs estimation in the world's biggest economy.\" In another post, he added that \"shooting the messenger does nothing.\"\nEconomists raise alarm that BLS firing will erode public trust\nAlongside a dip in Friday's jobs numbers, unemployment ticked up to 4.2%. Labor force participation also declined, falling to 62.2% in July from 62.3%.\nTrump wrote that the Friday jobs report was a \"major mistake\" and \"The Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP.'\"\nSecretary Chavez-DeRemer wrote on X that she agrees \"wholeheartedly\" with Trump: \"Our jobs numbers must be fair, accurate, and never manipulated for political purposes.\"\nEconomists warned Friday that the president's planned firing of McEntarfer and raising suspicion about BLS data could have dire consequences.\n\"Firing the head of the BLS is five-alarm intentional harm to the integrity of US economic data and the entire statistical system,\" Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former Under Secretary for Economic Affairs at the US Department of Commerce, wrote on X.\n\"Even if nothing in BLS processes actually changes, public trust is permanently harmed when the BLS commissioner is fired after one bad jobs report,\" Executive Director of Employ America Skanda Amarnath wrote on X.\n\"I worked very closely with Commissioner Beach, the prior BLS commissioner, who was appointed by Donald Trump, and then Dr. McEntarfer to understand the numbers and be able to share them, to be able to talk about them, to use them to analyze whether the policies that we were pursuing was actually benefiting the American people,\" Julie Su, the former acting Secretary of Labor in former President Joe Biden's administration, told Business Insider. \"This is just a typical move by someone who hates real facts because they tell the truth about how much damage he's doing.\"\n\"The American people rely on a nonpartisan Bureau of Labor Statistics to help them make informed financial decisions and better understand our economic health,\" Max Stier, the president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, told Business Insider.\nStier added: \"Governments that go down this path find themselves in ugly territory very quickly.\"\n\"If policymakers and the public start to doubt the integrity of the numbers, confidence will collapse\u2014creating chaos that will reduce business investment and consumer spending,\" Heidi Shierholz, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, told BI.\n\"The totally groundless firing of Dr. Erika McEntarfer, my successor as Commissioner of Labor Statistics at BLS, sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau,\" William Beach, an economist and former Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said in a post on X.\nThe president also took aim at the Federal Reserve, which announced Wednesday it will hold rates steady for the fifth time this year. Trump said Friday that the Fed \"plays games\" and Chair Jerome Powell \"should also be put 'out to pasture.'\" The president has repeatedly spoken about firing Powell in recent months.\nThe White House and the Department of Labor referred Business Insider to Chavez-DeRemer's X post when asked for comment."

      "text": "- Investors expect the Fed to resume rate cuts next month.\n- Historically, rate cuts have led to strong S&P 500 gains, but there have been exceptions.\n- Here's what history says about how the market behaves once rate cuts start back up.\nAfter a weak few months of job growth, investors are banking on rate cuts from the Federal Reserve at their September meeting, and history shows cuts could be like rocket fuel for stocks in the months that follow.\nLPL Financial recently conducted an analysis of how stocks have performed from the first rate cut in a rate-reduction cycle until the eventual start of a new hiking cycle.\nOn average, the S&P 500 has returned 30.3% during the nine periods when rates have been on the decline since 1974. The median return during those periods was 13.3%. Returns have been positive in six of those nine cycles.\n\"Using history and prior Fed cutting cycles as a guide, some upside potential may remain for the second half of 2025,\" Jeff Buchbinder, LPL's chief equity strategist, said in the August 5 report. \"But of course, past performance does not guarantee future results, and a new tariff regime not seen since the 1930s could slow earnings growth and fuel volatility.\"\nThe largest market surges came in the lead up to the dot-com bubble, when the S&P 500 rose 161% from 1995 to 1999, the analysis showed. Other big gains included 62.8% from 1984 to 1993, and 38.2% from 2019 to 2021.\nBut rate cuts aren't always a tailwind, especially during recessionary periods where the Fed acts too late. The market fell 23.5% during the 2007-2009 rate-cutting cycle, and from 2001-2004, the S&P 500 dropped 9.6%.\nThis time around, Buchbinder said it's not a sure thing that rate cuts will be a boon for stocks, with ebullient investor sentiment having pushed up the market to new highs despite uncertainty remaining about the health of the economy. The market has also risen 12% already since the Fed's first cut of the cycle last September.\n\"The delayed effects of trade policy are likely to weigh on the economy in the second half, leading to weaker labor market demand,\" Buchbinder wrote. \"Recent market complacency toward trade policy and an economic narrative dependent upon strong economic data has caught our attention in recent weeks as a potential point of weakness.\"\nIt's also not a guarantee the Fed continues to ease policy in the months ahead. Economists at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America both see the central bank keeping rates steady for the rest of 2025 despite CME FedWatch data showing investors pricing in 93.2% odds that the Fed cuts in next month.\nGiven the apparent heightened levels of risk at the moment, Buchbinder said a conservative approach could be the best way forward in the near term. The firm likes growth stocks, large caps, and the financials and communication services sectors, he said.\n\"Bottom line, investors may be well served by bracing for occasional bouts of volatility given how much optimism is currently reflected in equity prices,\" Buchbinder said.\nThe firm's short-term asset allocation committee \"advises against increasing portfolio risk beyond benchmark targets currently and continues to monitor tariff negotiations, economic data, earnings, the bond market, and various technical indicators to identify a potentially more attractive entry point to add equities on weakness,\" he added."

      "text": "- The year-over-year inflation rate unexpectedly held steady at 2.7% in July.\n- Economists expected a tick up to 2.8%.\n- Impacts from tariffs imposed in early August could take a while to show up in inflation data.\nThe year-over-year inflation rate held at 2.7% in July, below the expected 2.8% but still elevated.\nThe consumer price index increased 0.2% over the month, matching the forecast but below June's 0.3% rise.\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.1% over the year in July, above the 3% forecast and June's 2.9%. The core rate rose as expected over the month to 0.3%, above June's 0.2% increase.\nNew tariffs on copper products and dozens of countries went into effect in early August, adding to the ones already applied during Trump's second presidency so far. On Monday, Trump extended the pause on higher China tariffs until November. It could take a while to see how the newer tariffs impact inflation.\nJed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said on X that any tariff impacts are likely to be seen in core goods prices, noting those were \"up 0.2% in July, same as June. Rising faster than in March/April/May but still at modest pace.\"\nThe shelter index, which was the biggest contributor to CPI's monthly rise, increased 0.2% again. The year-over-year rate continued to cool, increasing 3.7% from a year ago in July.\nThe food index was flat over the month after rising 0.3% the previous two months. It rose 2.9% over the year, less than the 3% rate in June.\nThe gas index dropped 9.5% over the year in July, after falling 8.3% over the year in June. It fell 2.2% over the month in July.\n\"Higher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of some goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen,\" Fed chair Jerome Powell said in a July 30 press conference after the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady for the fifth consecutive time.\nThe next scheduled Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where members will make a rate decision, is in September. That could be when the US sees the first rate cut this year, following the weaker jobs report earlier this month, which included much cooler job gains in May and June than previously reported.\nThe CME FedWatch tool, which estimates probabilities of future Fed rates based on market moves, showed a 90% likelihood of a cut in September after the new inflation report, up from the roughly 80% likelihood before the report.\n\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today's CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" said Seema Shah, the chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"There is some sign of tariff pass through to consumer prices but, at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells.\"\nConsumers haven't taken the brunt of tariffs' impacts, at least not yet. A Goldman Sachs report on Sunday said US consumers have absorbed less than a quarter of tariff costs through June but think it will jump to 67% by October, assuming newer tariffs have a similar impact to previous ones. Businesses and foreign exporters account for the remaining incidence of the tariffs.\nDiane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, told PBS News Hour that \"the tariffs are so large that they also squeeze profit margins and that means cost-cutting or layoffs.\" So far, US layoffs have remained at their low rate.\n\"What we're worried about is a sort of stagflationary kind of nature of these tariffs because they're so large and they're just unable to be completely absorbed by either firms themselves or completely passed on to consumers 100 percent,\" Swonk said."
