  "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to guarantee you move on fully, clean cut.\u201d",
  "content": "The \u201cDate Them \u2019Til You Hate Them Theory\u201d isn\u2019t about stormy splits \u2014 it\u2019s about slowly ghosting your way out of love.\n\nThe buzzy breakup strategy is racking up views on TikTok, though relationship pros say it could be downright toxic.\n\nThe trend traces back to creator Meg Neil (@themegneil), who went viral after spilling how she slipped out of a four-year relationship without crumbling.\n\n\u201cI dated him until I hated him,\u201d she declared in a TikTok video.\n\nRather than nagging, fighting or demanding change, she simply pulled the plug on her emotions. \u201cYou\u2019re going to let them disrespect you,\u201d Neil noted.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to watch them disrespect you\u2026until you no longer want to associate with them anymore.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a breakup by slow burn \u2014 starve the spark, let it rot and watch love curdle into disgust.\n\nSuddenly, Neil said, the things that once gutted her \u2014 like his shrugging indifference and annoying sounds of him breathing \u2014 became what set her free.\n\nIn the comments, fellow women piled on with their own war stories of loving a guy straight into loathing \u2014 and the brutal lessons that came with it.\n\n\u201cHate to say it but it\u2019s the only way to guarantee you move on fully, clean cut,\u201d one user wrote as another added, \u201cThis is me rn. Best way to leave, it\u2019s like you already processed it all.\u201d\n\nSomeone else chimed in, writing, \u201cfirm believer in this method,\u201d as one other replied, \u201cHate to say that this works, don\u2019t fight back just sit there and watch how embarrassing it is for him AND for you, get out of that.\u201d\n\nIn a similar TikTok video, user Amber Hutton (@ambermayhutton) said that while \u201cdate them until you hate them\u201d might seem like a \u201ccontroversial sentence,\u201d she found that, essentially, \u201cyou will not let go of \u2014 and move on from \u2014 that person\u201d until you have a reality check.\n\nShe believes that you need to \u201cget to a point yourself where you\u2019ve had enough\u201d and \u201cchoose to walk away,\u201d while realizing what you \u201cdo and do not deserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeciding to just walk away isn\u2019t always the easiest thing to do, even if it\u2019s the best thing to do long-term,\u201d she went on.\n\nBut the question remains \u2014 do you really have to get to this loathing point to end things?\n\nWhile TikTok fans hailed this playbook, Dr. Tara Suwinyattichaiporn calls it what it really is: classic neglect.\n\n\u201cSome people use this approach because they lack effective communication skills to reject someone or enforce their boundaries,\u201d she told PureWow in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cOnce you feel constant negative emotions in your relationship, it doesn\u2019t stay confined to that relationship. It bleeds into other aspects of your life and wellness,\u201d she explained.\n\nExperts agree that neglect is one of the worst moves of all. What feels like control (staying quiet instead of facing the issue head-on) is really just extending pain.\n\nAs The Post previously reported, \u201cBanksying\u201d is a similar slow-burn breakup move where you ghost your feelings until you snap and disappear \u2014 named after elusive street artist Banksy, because like his famous murals, the split usually hits out of nowhere.\n\n\u201cBanksying happens more now, especially with the proliferation of dating apps, where people have developed poor dating etiquette,\u201d Amy Chan, a relationship expert, recently told USA Today.\n\n\u201cThe person withdrawing gets the ability to process the breakup on their own terms, before they hand the memo to the other person, who ends up being in total shock.\u201d",

      "text": "Toxic \u2018Banksying\u2019 breakup trend is the cruel new dating stunt that\u2019s even meaner than ghosting\nHoping that your suddenly sour sweetheart will have a sudden change of heart? Don\u2019t Bank on it.\nIf your partner is slowly but surely becoming emotionally detached from the relationship, chances are you\u2019re being \u201cBanksyed,\u201d experts warn of the new, heartbreaking breakup tactic.\nIt\u2019s a dastardly dumping technique named after Banksy, the elusive street artist. And much like his iconic work, which tends to pop up out of nowhere, victims of the cruel uncoupling stunt typically don\u2019t see the surprise split coming.\n\u201cBanksying happens more now, especially with the proliferation of dating apps, where people have developed poor dating etiquette,\u201d Amy Chan, a breakup pro, told USA Today.\n\u201cThe person withdrawing gets the ability to process the breakup on their own terms, before they hand the memo to the other person who ends up being in total shock.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a cowardly way to part ways. But, sadly, it seems the gutless guys and gals of today prefer taking the wimpish way out of their romantic commitments.\nTech-savvy 20-somethings of Gen Z are tasking artificial intelligence with drafting \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d texts, ending things in writing rather than in-real life. And fans of the buzzy \u201ccut them off\u201d theory are leaving their unsuspecting honeys high-and-dry, arbitrarily ditching them over petty oversights.\n\u201cLast year, I was seeing someone that I really liked and I cut him off because he didn\u2019t wish me a safe flight,\u201d an uncaring \u201ccut \u2018em\u201d-practitioner bragged online.\nThen, of course, there are those grimey, ghastly ghosters, folks who abruptly discontinue all communication with an inamorata or inamorato without a trace.\nBut Chan says Banskying might be a relationship cruelty \u201cworse than\u201d ghosting.\n\u201cThe prevalence of this trend shows how conflict avoidant people have become,\u201d she explained to a TikTok audience of more than 112,000 viewers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of ability to have uncomfortable, hard conversations, so they do more damage by dragging it out.\u201d\nHer Banksyed-burned followers agreed.\n\u201cYup \u2014 shattered my itty bitty heart into a million pieces,\u201d confessed a crushed commenter.\n\u201cWow can\u2019t believe I got Banksyed,\u201d another exclaimed.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this just Quiet Quitting: Relationship Edition?,\u201d a separate spectator wrote, likening the breakup trick to the \u201cquiet quitting\u201d workplace movement, which sees disgruntled employees making under-the-radar departures from their jobs.\nEmma Hathorn, a relationship insider at Seeking.com, says Banksying \u2014 although not a totally novel concept \u2014 often leaves daters feeling stressed, confused and gaslit.\n\u201cBanksying is something that we have all experienced at one point or another,\u201d Hathorn told USA Today. \u201cPreviously, there hasn\u2019t been a way to express that subtle feeling of dread when a partner has begun to pull away, essentially icing us out.\n\u201cEmotionally manipulative, emotionally distant \u2014 there are plenty of ways that people have tried to define it.\u201d\nChan added that Banksying usually makes the unwitting partner feel \u201cleft in the dark, wondering if the relationship is actually solid or if their concerns about it are justified.\u201d\n\u201cThey might not be using their words to tell you \u2014 but their actions are,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey might lie and say everything is \u2018fine,\u2019 but you also have to exert that you\u2019re not \u2018fine\u2019 because you can pick up the cues of emotional distance.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t gaslight yourself into thinking it\u2019s OK to sweep the cold behavior under the rug just because they\u2019re saying everything is fine, but acting in a way that\u2019s completely the opposite,\u201d Chan advised.\nHathorn urged Banskying offenders to simply come clean about their fed-up feelings, rather than do their clueless darlings dirty.\n\u201cModern dating is in desperate need of blunt honesty,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing upfront, firm but polite shows that you know what you want and are unwilling to waste your time and a potential partner\u2019s time.\u201d"

Four years of ordering the same pad Thai takeout, arguing about whose turn it was to do the laundry, drifting off to the glow of yet another rewatch of The Office. With him, she felt safe\u2014tucked into the steady hum of partnership, where you can predict a sigh before it leaves the other\u2019s mouth. But under that comfort ran an uneasy current. His phone lighting up with late-night notifications. The way his gaze lingered a beat too long on other women. The casual dismissal when she\u2019d voice something vulnerable. Every tender moment seemed shadowed by a quiet disrespect, leaving her torn between the man who felt like home and the man who made her feel small.\nThe turning point came one night at a party. She watched him lean in too close to another girl, his hand brushing her arm the same way he had when they first started dating. When Mia pulled him aside later, he huffed out his usual retort: \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting again.\u201d Something about the dismissiveness\u2014the certainty that he could hurt her and get away with it\u2014hardened in her chest. She realized no amount of arguing would change the story.\nSo the next day, she decided to try something different. No more late-night confrontations, no more begging to be taken seriously. Instead, she went quiet. And at first, the silence dulled the sting of being unseen\u2014if he wasn\u2019t going to hear her, she\u2019d simply stop speaking. But as weeks passed, that numbness curdled. What once felt like self-protection turned into distance; what once felt like distance soured into contempt. Soon, it wasn\u2019t just the ignored texts or the smug deflections that hurt. It was the way his chewing grated her ears. How the sound of his breathing made her skin crawl. Even the sight of his sneakers in the hallway filling her with dread. The man she\u2019d once loved didn\u2019t just feel indifferent now. He felt unbearable.\nWhat Mia didn\u2019t know then\u2014but would later discover on TikTok\u2014was that she was living out the Date Them \u2019Til You Hate Them Theory: a breakup strategy built not on sudden endings, but on quiet detachment."

They are reportedly replacing them for free.\nIt\u2019s yet unclear how many licenses are affected. The BMV is relying on people to self-report problems so they can receive replacements.\nHowever, the TSA told Maine\u2019s Bureau of Motor Vehicles that \u201c95% of Maine travelers\u201d have a compliant document, per the secretary of state\u2019s office.\nUnfortunately, security checkpoints weren\u2019t the only places that were rejecting Maine residents\u2019 Real ID-compliant driver\u2019s licenses and IDs, which have been required to access domestic flights and certain federal facilities since May 7.\nIn a post uploaded to Reddit, a Pine Tree State resident claimed their Real ID-complaint license was declined by Herz because \u201cit would not scan.\u201d Others have reported in unverified Reddit posts that their docs had been rejected at gas stations.\nTo prevent potential ID-scanning fiascos, the TSA is encouraging travelers to bring a backup ID with them.\nAcceptable forms of identification include US passports, US passport cards, foreign passports, permanent resident cards, border crossing cards and others.\nA temporary driver\u2019s license is not acceptable, per the TSA, which notes that children under 18 are not required to provide ID while traveling within the US.\nCoincidentally, before the federal mandate, Maine had a Real ID compliance rate of just 27% \u2014 one of the lowest in the country.\nThat figure increased to 32% by July 1.\nThis comes as the TSA made a major change to the security screening process.\nThe TSA recently announced the launch of an expedited PreCheck process, in which passengers simply flash their face to a facial recognition scanner at checkpoints in lieu of having to present a boarding pass or ID with the PreCheck indicator.\nThe enhanced screening measure is already available to those flying with participating airlines: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines.\nFor now, the service is offered at just 15 airports across the US, including John F.

      "text": "iPhone users are stunned to discover strange design quirk in alarm clock app used by millions\nStop the clock!\niPhone users are reeling after a viral post on X (formerly Twitter) revealed a surprising design quirk in the Apple alarm clock \u2014 one that\u2019s been hiding in plain sight for years.\nFor anyone who\u2019s ever set an alarm on an iPhone, the process seems straightforward. The time picker \u2014 the rotating wheel of numbers \u2014 gives the impression of a spilling wheel users can scroll through endlessly as the numbers continue to loop.\nHowever, a user on X recently shattered this long-held assumption by revealing that the alarm time picker isn\u2019t truly circular at all. Instead, it\u2019s just an extremely long, linear list of times made to look like a rotating wheel.\n\u201cThe time picker on iPhone\u2019s alarm app isn\u2019t actually circular \u2014 it\u2019s just a really long list,\u201d the user posted on X, along with a video to prove it.\nIn the video, the time picker is quickly scrolled through until the end of the list is hit \u2014 which took several seconds to achieve \u2014 landing at 4:39.\nCurious users tested it out for themselves \u2014 and to their amazement, it did end.\nThe \u201crandom time\u201d cutoff has left many baffled.\n\u201cWhy is this such a disturbing discovery?\u201d someone asked. Another added, \u201cI feel so betrayed.\u201d\nMany were equally surprised by the design, noting that they\u2019d used the alarm function for years without ever realizing it wasn\u2019t an infinite scroll.\nHowever, others defended the interface, pointing out that no one really needs to scroll endlessly \u2014 the UI is designed to make time selection quick and seamless.\n\u201cThe important question here is, what were you trying to do?\u201d a person replied to the original tweet.\n\u201cHow do you even figure these things out lol,\u201d another asked.\nStill, the fact that the illusion fooled even the most seasoned iPhone users has raised eyebrows.\nApple has not commented on the revelation, but this isn\u2019t the first time the tech giant has been called out for hidden features or unexpected design quirks.\nAnother X user revealed that the Apple Calendar app also uses a long list that ends. The last date iPhone users can currently set a calendar reminder for is April 18th, 10000.\nAnd earlier this year, Apple fans were divided over a surprisingly polarizing change introduced in the latest iOS 26 Beta redesign of the Clock app icon.\nThese inconsequential but shocking discoveries have struck a chord with users, who are both amused and annoyed that such a basic function harbored such a secret."

      "text": "New \u2018delicate dumping\u2019 relationship trend is \u2018cruel\u2019 as expert advises, \u2018never settle for scraps\u2019\nA UK-based therapist says a new relationship trend called \u201cdelicate dumping\u201d is wrong and \u201ccruel\u201d \u2014 and encourages those who are ending a relationship to be clear in their actions.\nDelicate dumping involves taking a step back from a relationship without having a breakup conversation.\nIt\u2019s about employing tactics such as ghosting, replying to a partner more slowly and even ignoring the other person completely, Jodie Slee, a 39-year-old therapist in West Yorkshire, England, told news agency SWNS.\nWhile delicate dumping is perhaps simpler, it\u2019s unkind, said Slee.\n\u201cIf you want to dump someone, put your big-boy pants on and don\u2019t be a coward,\u201d she said, as the news agency noted.\nThis breakup behavior involves \u201cdisconnecting from a relationship \u2026 behaving in such a way that your partner feels the need to leave you, not the other way around,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNever settle for scraps of love and attention.\u201d\nDelicate dumping is used most by narcissists, said Slee, noting that it has a lot to do with a lack of emotional maturity.\nA North Carolina man who is married said that many men he\u2019s known have used \u201cdelicate dumping,\u201d because being direct is \u201cawkward and uncomfortable,\u201d for some.\n\u201cEspecially in the younger years, men do this and tell themselves that their girlfriend will \u2018get the message\u2019 and dump them,\u201d he told Fox News Digital.\n\u201cOnly when you are mature do you realize how important it is to end things with respect for the other person.\u201d\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t really have the emotional capacity to deal with confrontation,\u201d Slee also said.\nThe therapist believes social media has made it easier for individuals to break up with someone \u2014 noting that watching other\u2019s social media stories while ignoring their own partner\u2019s messages can be an example of delicate dumping.\nIf someone is in a relationship and believes their partner might be delicately dumping them, they should go with their intuition, said Slee.\n\u201cI would trust your gut if someone\u2019s behavior is changing, and they\u2019re withdrawing from you,\u201d she said.\nShe suggested giving a partner the opportunity to discuss the situation, welcoming an open and honest conversation, as SWNS reported.\n\u201cSometimes it can feel better to take control over situations,\u201d she added.\nSome of Slee\u2019s top tips for recognizing when you\u2019re being delicately dumped include your partner not making an effort to see you; displaying a lack of affection; not mentioning future plans; and constant posting on social media.\n\u201cNever settle for scraps of love and attention,\u201d she said."

      "text": "This new dating trend is leaving people baffled and heartbroken. It\u2019s called \u2018Banksying.\u2019\nLook out, daters: There's a new toxic relationship trend taking the romantic world by storm.\nIt's called \"Banksying,\" and it derives its name from the elusive street artist Banksy, known for art that seems to pop up out of nowhere and often comes with a cryptic twist.\nLike a baffling Banksy art piece, Banksying in a relationship involves slowly withdrawing emotionally from your partner, without telling them that's what you're doing. When the time comes to finally break up, the Banksy-er often feels better, having mentally checked out of the relationship long ago, while the other partner is left blindsided and confused.\nWhen someone uses this technique, they start to destroy the relationship before the other person sees it coming. Some of Banksy's art has famously self-destructed \u2212 like one painting that made headlines for shredding itself after selling at auction for $1.4 million.\nAmy Chan, a dating coach and the author of \"Breakup Bootcamp: The Science of Rewiring Your Heart,\" says Banskying has been happening for a while \u2212 it just has a trendy name now. The solution, she says, is to practice open and honest communication, even when doing so feels uncomfortable.\nWhat health & wellness means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's Keeping It Together newsletter\n\"Banksying happens more now, especially with the proliferation of dating apps, where people have developed poor dating etiquette,\" Chan says. \"The person withdrawing gets the ability to process the breakup on their own terms, before they hand the memo to the other person, who ends up being in total shock. It\u2019s selfish. It shows a lack of emotional maturity and a way of dealing with conflict that is rooted in avoidance.\"\nWhere did Banksying come from?\nEmma Hathorn, a relationship expert at Seeking.com, says Banksying leaves daters feeling stressed, confused and gaslit. Often the person on the receiving end can sense something is wrong, but their partner keeps assuring them everything is fine.\n\"Banksying is something that we have all experienced at one point or another,\" Hathorn says. \"Previously, there hasn\u2019t been a way to express that subtle feeling of dread when a partner has begun to pull away, essentially icing us out. Emotionally manipulative, emotionally distant \u2013 there are plenty of ways that people have tried to define it.\"\nWhat makes Banksying so painful, Chan says, is its ambiguity. At least when someone ghosts, it's clear they've abandoned the relationship. With Banksying, however, people are often left in the dark, wondering if the relationship is actually solid or if their concerns about it are justified.\n\"They might not be using their words to tell you \u2013 but their actions are,\" Chan says. \"They might lie and say everything is \u2018fine\u2019 but you also have to exert that you\u2019re not \u2018fine\u2019 because you can pick up the cues of emotional distance. Don\u2019t gaslight yourself into thinking it\u2019s OK to sweep the cold behavior under the rug just because they\u2019re saying everything is fine, but acting in a way that\u2019s completely the opposite.\"\nWhat does Banksying say about us?\nUltimately, the prevalence of Banksying further shows how the skills of dating \u2212 as well as the skills of breaking up \u2212 have degraded in recent years.\n\"It does highlight how conflict-avoidant people have become,\" Chan says. \"It seems like there\u2019s less of an ability to tolerate uncomfortable emotions and hard conversations, so instead of dealing with the relationship challenges, or feeling the guilt of a breakup, people end up causing more harm by dragging things out.\"\nThe solution? Instead of Banksying, tell the person you're dating how you really feel. It's not the easy thing to do, but it is the right thing to do.\n\"Modern dating is in desperate need of blunt honesty,\" Hathorn says. \"Being upfront, firm but polite shows that you know what you want and are unwilling to waste your time and a potential partner\u2019s time.\""
