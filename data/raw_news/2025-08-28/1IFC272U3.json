  "description": "Why organizations need to get data sovereignty right",
  "content": "From the war in Ukraine, to the Middle East, and escalating tensions in the South China Sea, the threat of conflict is forcing governments and businesses to confront an uncomfortable truth that digital systems are not immune to geopolitical pressure.\n\nAt London Tech Week recently UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that the way that war is being fought \u201chas changed profoundly,\u201d adding that technology and AI are now \u201chard wired\u201d into national defense. It was a stark reminder that IT infrastructure management must now be viewed through a security lens and that businesses need to re-evaluate data management technologies and practices to ensure they are not left out in the cold.\n\nEasier said than done. According to recent research from Civo, 83% of UK IT leaders say geopolitics threatens their ability to control data and 61% view sovereignty as a strategic priority, yet only 35% know exactly where their data resides. That\u2019s not just a compliance gap. It\u2019s a sign that infrastructure, policy and strategy are still out of sync.\n\nData sovereignty used to be a conversation for the policy teams and legal departments. Not anymore. Regulatory fragmentation, rising cyber risk, and increasingly complex data ecosystems are forcing organizations to treat sovereignty as a live operational concern. Whether it\u2019s knowing who can access your AI training data or ensuring a healthcare provider meets national residency requirements, data sovereignty now defines what businesses can and cannot do.\n\nThe EU Data Act, the UK's evolving position (the UK is no longer bound by the EU Data Act but it remains closely aligned in practice to preserve data adequacy and ensure the continued free flow of data with the EU), and the increasing stringency of critical infrastructure policies, are starting to shape what enterprise resilience should look like.\n\nAs Lord Ricketts noted in the House of Lords in October last year, \u201cthe safe and effective exchange of data underpins our trade and economic links with the EU and co-operation between our law-enforcement bodies.\u201d That trust depends on demonstrating a clear and enforceable approach to data control.\n\nFor many, public cloud services have created a false sense of flexibility. Moving fast is not the same as moving safely. Data localization, jurisdictional control, and security policy alignment are now critical to long-term strategy, not barriers to short-term scale. So where does that leave enterprise IT? Essentially, it leaves us with a choice - design for agility with control, or face disruption when the rules change.\n\nModern infrastructure needs to be sovereignty-aware\n\nSovereignty-aware infrastructure isn\u2019t about isolation. It\u2019s about knowing where your data is, who can access it, how it moves, and what policies govern it at each stage. That means visibility, auditability, and the ability to adjust without rebuilding every time a new compliance rule appears.\n\nA hybrid multicloud approach gives organizations the flexibility while keeping data governance central. It\u2019s not about locking into one cloud provider or building everything on-prem. It\u2019s about policy-driven control across environments, managing workloads through the context of data.\n\nFor example, a financial services firm may need to keep customer transaction data within UK borders, but still wants to run analytics in the cloud. With the right architecture, workloads can move, but sensitive data stays governed. That\u2019s sovereignty in practice, not theory.\n\nOf course, generative AI introduces a new layer of complexity. Training models on private data, deploying inference at the edge, or simply sharing prompts between locations adds pressure to already stretched governance models.\n\nAnd while many organizations have rushed to build or adopt AI tools, few have aligned these efforts with data residency or compliance. Sovereignty isn\u2019t just about storage anymore. It\u2019s about compute, access patterns, and understanding how third-party models interact with your data.\n\nEdge and sovereign cloud capabilities will be essential here. But they only work if infrastructure teams are given the mandate and support to build with sovereignty in mind. That means cross-functional collaboration between legal, compliance, and IT. It also means choosing platforms that support location-aware deployment and policy enforcement from day one.\n\nAccording to Nutanix\u2019s recent public sector sovereignty research, 94% of public sector organizations are already using GenAI tools, yet 92% say they could do more to secure those workloads, and 81% say their infrastructure needs improvement to support sovereignty requirements. That says everything you need to know about the challenges facing both public and private organizations. Complexity has clouded judgement and capability.\n\nAnd yes, customers want to know where their data is, of course they do. Partners also want to understand how it\u2019s being used. With regulators increasingly expecting transparency, not just tick-box compliance, sovereignty, in this context, becomes a proxy for trust.\n\nThis is particularly important in sectors like healthcare, education, and government. But it\u2019s not limited to them. Any business operating in or across regulated markets needs to demonstrate control. Not because it\u2019s a checkbox, but because it\u2019s now fundamental to continuity and reputation.\n\nSo where do you go from here?\n\nFirst, get clear on where your data is and what laws apply. That\u2019s not always simple. Next, review your infrastructure to see if it can support location-aware controls, hybrid deployment, and detailed auditing.\n\nThen, consider where GenAI and future workloads are headed. Are you prepared to scale them without breaching sovereignty requirements? Can your teams adapt quickly as policies change?\n\nFinally, treat sovereignty not as a constraint, but as a core part of your design strategy. The organizations that do this well won\u2019t just be compliant, they\u2019ll be more resilient, more transparent, and better prepared for what comes next.\n\nBecause in a world where data moves faster than policy, the ability to stay in control isn\u2019t just good governance, it\u2019s good business. And when geopolitics forces the issue, it might just be the nudge needed to get sovereignty right.\n\nWe list the best data migration tools to help manage your files.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best data migration tool of 2025\nTransfer your data securely\nThe best data migration tools help manage backing up data across hard disk (HDDs) or solid state drives (SSDs). If needed, some of these support passive periodic synchronisation - so you can leave it to do its own thing once you've set it up.\nThese tools will come in handy if you've got a new business laptop and need to transfer all of the data from your old one to the new one, or you've want to make a backup to a new external hard drive.\nData disruption is all to common nowadays, so its always a good idea to have a plan for swapping over. This list is just for data migration though, so if you need help with the best cloud backup software solutions recommendations, then we have a list for you too.\nNote that we'll only be exploring apps and services that migrate data in this list \u2013 we won't be including any of the that lack data migration functionality, nor will we be covering solutions that only clone disks to a file without actually migrating the data.\nReader offer: 20% off any Acronis True Image license\nAcronis offers all-in-one protection, combining anti-malware, antivirus, and backup solutions. It's your one-stop shop for safeguarding valuable data and fortifying your cyber defenses. Use code TECHRADAR20 for an exclusive 20% off.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nWe've also listed the best data recovery software.\nThe best data migration tools of 2025 in full:\nBest data migration tool overall\n1. Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAcronis Cyber Protect Home Office, formerly known as Acronis True Image, is a software suite that will do everything from backing up folders and files to replicating local backups in the cloud.\nWhen it comes to data migration, the software offers Active Disk Learning, a feature that creates an exact replica of a Windows or Mac system while the operating system is in use, removing the need to stop what you are doing and reboot the machine in order to migrate data.\nThis makes transferring your digital life to another disk as easy as it gets - from configuration files all the way up to an entire operating system - which we love.\nWhat we liked less is that licencing additional machines will cost extra, regardless of the price tier that you opt for. Additional security features, such as automatic backups, malware and identity theft protection, plus cloud backup, are also locked behind additional pricing tiers.\nWe've previously spotted limited time offers offering 50% off all plans, so Acronis is absolutely one to watch.\nRead our full Acronis Cyber Protect review.\nBest data migration tool for partitions\n2. Minitool Partition Wizard Free\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUsed by tens of millions of people, MiniTool Partition Wizard mainly offers partition-related support.\nMinitool Partition Wizard supports migrating data from every version of Windows starting with XP, with supported file systems including FAT 12/16/32, exFAT, NTSF and Ext2/3/4.\nUnfortunately, the oldest version of Windows that it will actually run on is 7. Even that is arguably ancient at this point, but true legacy support would be appreciated.\nFunctionality of the free version is basic. For example, a Migrate OS to SSD function, sure to optimise performance as you'll no longer be dependent on a mechanical drive, will require, at minimum, a $59 annual Pro subscription, or a $159 Pro version offering 'lifetime upgrades, data recovery, and a 5 PC licence'.\nOn the face of it, this sounds fair, and free software serving as an ad for a paid upgrade, or shareware, is nothing new.\nHowever, MiniTool partition wizard takes pricing tiers to a new level, offering, on top of the Pro version, a Pro Premium subscription, on top of Pro Platinum and Enterprise subscriptions, on top of Pro Ultimate, Server and Technician lifetime licences. Good grief.\nWhile these plans are largely constant in terms of feature sets, the rub here is the amount of licences provided, and whether free upgrades to the software are included. We highly recommend consulting Minitool's own comparison spreadsheet (!) to check which plan meets your needs.\nRead our full MiniTool Partition Wizard review.\nBest advanced data migration tool\n3. Paragon Hard Disk Manager\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nParagon Hard Disk Manager covers the full range of disk duties, including disk cloning of the entire drive, and advanced activities such as cloning by the partition, and can even resize the partition while copying it, or copy a hard drive to another with a dissimilar sector size.\nIt also features some cool, additional features, such as being able to create a virtual clone of your PC to a USB drive, that can then run portably from another PC, or creating recovery media to be able to boot a non bootable PC with the included Recovery Media Builder.\nIt may not be the best option for everyday users, but software from a respected developer that simply does it all (albeit at a fairly pricey but one-off fee of $79.95 for the Home version) sounds pretty great on our end.\nDo note, however, that for business use , you'll need another version of the software called 'Business Workstation'. Licences for it only cover one computer instead of the Home version's three, while being priced at $99.\nRead our full Paragon Hard Disk Manager review.\nBest one-click solution data migration tool\n4. EaseUS Todo PCTrans Free\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEaseUS's PCTrans Free software offers a one-click solution to automatically migrate files from one computer to another without data loss. It supports files belonging to several popular application suites, including: Microsoft Office; Photoshop; Adobe software; QuickBooks; Google Chrome; Firefox and more.\nAs always, the free version is essentially an advertisement for the 'Pro' version. The free version only allows for migration of 2GB of data and 5 programs: practically nothing in this day and age. Thankfully, however, Todo PCTrans has a fairly simple price-tier model that doesn't carve up features or licence terms.\nThere's a monthly plan ($49.95), a yearly plan ($59.95) and a lifetime purchase option ($69.95). All purchases are for one license that covers two machines, and purport to offer the same feature sets and access to live chat / email support.\nWe think that's very fair, especially compared to some of the other data migration products we've reviewed, and even those we recommend.\nWhat we like less is that EaseUS hide temporary flash deals for their software within their website. Not only is this an intrusive practice that plays on a user's fear of missing out, but it makes it hard to recommend buying the software at the given price.\nBy just sticking around on the website for a while, you can get a far better deal, which sticks in our craw a bit. For example, we spotted a 1-month plan for $39.95, or $59.95 for a lifetime purchase.\nRead our full EaseUS Todo PCTrans Professional review.\nBest data migration tool for app transfer\n5. Laplink PCmover Ultimate\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe only data migration tool recommended by Microsoft and Intel, companies that happen to have collaborated on the software, Laplink PCmover makes it easy to transfer apps, files and settings between two PCs.\nDesigned with ease of use in mind, simply install the software on both PCs, click a few buttons, and everything will transfer across in a matter of hours.\nIf you get stuck, you can connect with one of Laplink's PC migration experts, who are available 24 hours a day, for help; though that's only once you've bought a software license.\nAlternatively, you can opt to be shipped a physical copy of PCmover - very much a rarity these days - that includes a high-speed transfer cable and additional free SafeErase software.\nWhat we really loved about this software is its cost: a one off payment of around $60 / \u00a355 / AU$90: that's also a rare proposition in the era of software-as-a-service (SaaS).\nAlso consider these data migration tools\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nA free app for Android users, Samsung Smart Switch is the best data migration solution for transferring data between smartphones that are running Google's mobile OS. It's cross-platform, so it doesn't matter which Android device you own, and you have the option of transferring data wirelessly or with the use of a USB cable.\nWindows 10 Accelerator from Ivanti will prove a huge time-saver for those that deploy anywhere up to thousands of machines. The software takes a snapshot of user profiles and local files from older Windows installations to port them across to a modern ones. Everything is maintained - from personalization choices such as desktop wallpaper to applications, to folder and file structures - meaning users can continue exactly where they left off.\nZinstall will help you to transfer all of your programs, documents, music, pictures, emails and more to a new computer. Compatible with every combination of Windows version ranging from XP to Windows 10, Zinstall is designed with simplicity in mind. Once your old and new machines are connected to the internet, simply run it, choose what you want to transfer, and the application does the rest.\nAOMEI Backupper Standard makes it easy to transfer to a desktop PC or laptop, and is offered as a free version with reduced functionality. It lets you clone a smaller hard disk drive to a larger HDD for a disk upgrade, or you can clone a HDD to an SSD for better performance. Its other features include the choice of backing up entire HDDs, SSDs or specified partitions as duplications.\nWe've also listed the best data loss prevention services.\nBest data migration tools FAQs\nWhat are data migration tools?\nData migration tools are pretty self explanatory, but essentially, they help you move your information over from one device to the next.\nFrom shrinking HDDs to fit on SSDs to cloning and transferring operating systems wholesale, data migration tools can remove the need to set up an entire machine again in different ways, which anyone who has had to upgrade their work laptop will know, is a fair hassle.\nWhich data migration tool is best for you?\nThe best way to find the data migration software for you is to break them down: compare the features you absolutely need with those offered by each data migration tool.\nSome software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your data migration tool.\nHow we tested the best data migration tools\nTo test for the best data migration tools we first set up an account with the relevant software platform. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used with different files and folders, from different devices, in different situations. The aim was to push each data migration platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best online collaboration tool of 2025\nMake teamwork really work\nWe list the best online collaboration software, to make it simple and easy to ensure that teamwork really works.\nAlthough collaboration tools had already been set up for office teams, the pandemic and subsequent lock down that saw many people working remotely has lead to a resurgence in collaboration tool features. The result is that collaboration has become the new normal in the workplace.\nSince employees can no longer be expected to work from the same location, this means the ability for teams to share, use, and edit files at a distance has become essential for productivity.\nHowever, collaboration tools aren't simply limited to office software such as Microsoft docs and spreadsheets, but could be anything from using cloud document storage for managing daily tasks, to video conferencing for online meetings. Even better is that the best collaboration tools will work just as well on mobile devices as well as desktops and laptops.\nAbove all, everything should be clear, easy to understand, simply to use and reduce misunderstanding. Every employee should be empowered to be able to speak to the right person, wherever they are in the company, to address the same problem. And then solve that problem within an acceptable workflow.\nThe days of collaborative working are here, so below we list what we think are the best collaboration tools currently available.\nThe Future of Teamwork.

It\u2019s an incredibly smart platform, and you can get it on mobile and desktop devices. It allows for the sending of direct messages (DMs) and files to a single person or a group of employees, and there\u2019s the ability to organize conversations into different channels (perhaps for specific projects, one for technical support, general chat, and so forth).\nThe app also supports video calling. You can use the feature to talk to your colleagues about projects and work in-depth, without having to type everything into a DM. While this isn\u2019t a replacement for cloud storage services, you are able to drag, drop and share files with your colleagues directly within Slack. It\u2019s also compatible with services such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Box.\nTo round things off, Slack even has a free version, although unsurprisingly it has limitations (in terms of the number of messages stored, overall storage space and so forth).\nRead our full Slack review.\nBest online collaboration tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office may not be the first platform you think of when it comes to collaboration, but this now runs at the heart of the Microsoft 365 cloud-based office suite.\nThis is important because Microsoft Office remains the most used and therefore important office suite out there, and while there are competitors such as OpenOffice and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) they still haven't caught up to the same level of functionality and ease of use.\nTherefore as Microsoft Office is likely to be at the heart of many businesses, the move to Microsoft 365 offers a number of advantages, not least the ability for teams to collaborate directly on the same set of documents. This could be anything from work shifts in an Excel spreadsheet, to a presentation in PowerPoint, to client reports written in Word.\nAdded to this is that Microsoft Teams now comes bundled with a number of Microsoft 365 packages, allowing for Unified Communications integrated with the traditional office software.\nWhat makes Microsoft 365 more attractive is that as a cloud-hosted platform it can be used not just with Windows, but also Mac, Android, and iOS.\nOverall, Microsoft 365 doesn't simply offer a great office suite, but one that is also firmly designed for collaboration and sharing with teams.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nOur Microsoft discount codes can help you save on your next purchase.\nBest all-in-one online collaboration tool\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMiro is one of those online tools that aims to bridge the gap between traditional office working and the modern hybrid routine that many of us are familiar with. It is best described as a multipurpose online collaboration tool, and its list of features is pretty extensive stretching beyond the typical realms of similar software.\nThe majority of the work you\u2019ll end up doing in Miro will revolve around what it calls boards, which start off as entirely blank spaces. Setting one up from scratch can be daunting and time-consuming, which is why the company has designed templates that you can pick from the get-go.\nSome of its most commonly accessed templates include mind maps, Kanban boards, flowcharts, product roadmaps, and timelines. Many of these will serve well as project management tools, and anybody familiar with other project management software like Airtable or Trello will already be familiar with how they work.\nOverall, we think Miro is hard to beat. Its long list of features should cover all parts of a typical business process from research and design to presentation, and its collaboration abilities are second to none. Furthermore, its transparency around security and reasonable pricing make it hard for us not to recommend it.

InVision\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInVision is a collaborative tool built for designers. It provides a virtual whiteboard where multiple collaborators can share their design ideas and thoughts to come up with solutions. This whiteboard allows real-time interaction so that teams within an organization can brainstorm about work-related activities.\nThe whiteboard is called Freehand, owing its name to the fact people usually use their hands to write on whiteboards. In this case, the board is virtual, and you are free to write text while discussing with your team about a work project. You can also add images, photos, videos, etc., to provide context for your ideas.\nSometimes, you\u2019ll need templates to explain an idea to your teammates, e.g., flowcharts and interactive widgets. The good thing is that InVision provides over 200 pre-built templates that you can use for this.\nThe Freehand tool also has direct integrations with a lot of third-party software. For example, you can open a video chat by connecting to Zoom or Webex or turn your whiteboard ideas directly into tasks on Jira and Asana. If you wish, you can import your existing whiteboards from other collaborative apps, e.g., Miro.\nThis platform was built mainly for designers but is not exclusive to them. It is also suitable for product teams, human resource (HR) teams, marketing teams, etc.\nOther collaborative software to consider\nThere are many other collaboration tools worth your attention, if nothing else because of the way they apply features differently, or even add other useful features. Here we'll look at some additional online collaboration tools that could be worth exploring further:\nVisme is developed specifically for collaborative online reports, presentations, and infographics. Aside from promoting branding support and aiming to reduce design costs, analytics are provided so you can see which presentations and reports result in the most engagement, and adjust accordingly. Visme recommends itself for sales and marketing, HR and recruiting, internal communications, as well as education and in-house training. The software is specifically priced around individual, business, or education use.\nBasecamp aims to be an all-in-one collaboration and communications platform, to bring features of multiple software offerings into a single place so that it's easier to sort through information, and, of course, keep it all in one easy to manage place. Features include chat, messageboards, to-do lists and scheduling as well as automated check-in, as well as a single place to store all documents, files, and folders. Unlike other collaborative software that charges per user, Basecamp charges a single fee of $99.99 for unlimited users, which could make it especially attractive to larger organizations.\nWrike is more of a project management and scheduling tool, that makes it easy to see where everyone is in terms of completing a project. As a standalone it might seem quite limited compared to some of the others here, but its strength lies in its extensive range of integrations, which includes Google, Dropbox, Salesforce, Microsoft, Adobe, and Github. This means Wrike can work as a central platform tied to a number of others software apps, allowing you to cover a wider range of options and features than some standalone software options.\nMonday.com is a platform that allows you to plan, track, and collaborate on projects in a visually simple manner. Drag-and-drop functionality and ease of use make this a particularly good platform for project management and general workflow management among teams. It also integrates with Slack, Trello, Google Drive, Dropbox, and others, so you can use it a central focal point for teams to work together. As above, these integrations mean that monday.com can be used to achieve a wider working remit than the standalone platform itself.\nWe've also featured the best small business software.\nBest online collaboration tool FAQs\nTips for choosing a suitable online collaboration tool\n1. Consider your budget and look for something that\u2019s affordable for your enterprise. If you\u2019re a large organization with a sizeable IT budget, you can go with a more expensive platform that\u2019ll give you access to sophisticated features that you may not even need much. In contrast, if you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s wise to choose a plan that gives you just the basic collaboration features at a reasonable price.\n2. Customer support. Things can go wrong at any time, so choose a platform that offers customer support via email, live chat, or telephone. Check user reviews to see what other people are saying about your intended platform\u2019s support before making a final choice.\n3. Look for a platform with a user-friendly interface. This will make it easy for employees of your organization to collaborate instead of losing productivity trying to figure out how to use the software.\n4. Choose a platform with a strong security reputation to avoid leaks or theft of sensitive data.\n5. Pick a platform that has integrations with third-party tools for additional functionalities that you may need.\nWhich online collaboration tools is best for you?\nWhen deciding which online collaboration tool to use, first consider what actual needs you have. For example, someone simply wanting to work with a handful of people on a casual basis may find a cheaper option is the most cost-effective while providing all of the necessary tools that would be required. However, if you're planning to use online collaboration tools for professional or business purposes, especially with a large number of people and on a regular basis, then you will probably want to look to the higher-end options for the more advanced options that are included.\nHow we tested the best online collaboration tools\nTo test for the best online collaboration tools we searched for a range of popular options as well as took recommendations from people we know who use online collaboration tools regularly. We then tried each platform to see how user-friendly each was, as well as determine what range of tools and advanced options were available. Pricing also came into account when determining our best list.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "The path to European data sovereignty\nWho really controls data, and under whose law does it fall?\nBack in 2020, the European Parliament published a briefing paper which set out \u201cgrowing concern that the citizens, businesses and Member States of the European Union (EU) are gradually losing control over their data, over their capacity for innovation, and over their ability to shape and enforce legislation in the digital environment.\u201d\nAt the heart of the matter is the domination that the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google have established over the European cloud computing market. One of the effects of their success is that the region now faces significant challenges in ensuring data is subject to the laws and governance structures of the country or region in which it is collected, stored or processed.\nFor organizations based in the EU hosting their data with providers based elsewhere, this raises serious questions about who ultimately has jurisdiction over that data and whether it can be governed by foreign legal frameworks beyond their control.\nEMEA Lead at Datadobi.\nLet\u2019s also be clear - the market-leading hyperscalers offer efficiency, scale and a whole host of other compelling advantages. They are all highly innovative, trusted providers that have transformed how businesses operate and have enabled extraordinary digital progress at speed and scale.\nThousands of European organizations rely on \u2013 and will continue to rely on \u2013 these brands for good reason. At the same time, however, it\u2019s also vital that organizations understand that where they store their data, and under whose jurisdiction it falls, carries implications far beyond IT.\nWhether viewed through a political, economic, or operational lens, data sovereignty matters. In some scenarios, it can shape access rights, trigger regulatory obligations or even expose organizations to geopolitical risk.\nFor example, laws in one country could compel a cloud provider to share data stored in another, an issue that\u2019s been flagged in relation to executive powers and national security mandates at the disposal of foreign governments.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nSo, how is the landscape changing? Firstly, there are a number of promising European cloud initiatives, including regulatory developments, sovereign cloud frameworks and consortium-based models designed to create local alternatives to the all-in-one hyperscaler stack. However, these solutions are not without their challenges, with cost, fragmentation, scalability and adoption hurdles potentially standing in the way of an effective regional system.\nFor many organizations, a full switch isn\u2019t viable due to issues such as existing investment commitments, operational complexity and the simple absence of mature, like-for-like alternatives that can match the scale and capabilities of established providers.\nThe US hyperscalers are also getting in on the act. This time last year, for instance, AWS announced plans to invest \u20ac7.8 billion in the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, an initiative which the company says reinforces its \u201ccommitment to offer customers the most advanced set of sovereignty controls, privacy safeguards, and security features available in the cloud.\u201d\nHow this plays out remains to be seen, but whatever route organizations favor in the pursuit of data sovereignty, access to choice and autonomy over where their data is stored is likely to grow in importance as time passes.\nThe role of intelligent data management\nFor European organizations in this position, and there are many, the good news is that they don\u2019t need to wait for systemic changes in the cloud landscape to start regaining control. Data sovereignty can be addressed today through the implementation of modern, vendor-neutral data management technologies, which enable them to visualize their entire data landscape and apply consistent policies across disparate storage environments.\nArmed with a unified view of their data across cloud and on-premises environments, organizations can then make informed choices about what data to store, where to store it and how best to safeguard it.\nThe obvious starting point is visibility because, without knowing what data exists, where it resides and how it moves, businesses are flying blind. This is particularly significant and challenging in contemporary multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud environments, where data can be extremely fragmented, often with little consistency or oversight.\nBut by establishing a clear picture of all data assets, classifying them based on sensitivity and business value and ensuring local copies of critical data are always available, IT management can also enforce policies that align with governance and regulatory requirements.\nIn the end, this is not just a technology and geography issue; it goes much deeper to cover everything from business resilience and compliance to control and, ultimately, customer trust. Europe\u2019s digital future will depend not only on where its data lives, but on who can access it, govern it and protect it.\nAs the European Parliament data sovereignty briefing concludes, \u201cBuilding a secure pan-European data framework and adopting new standards and practices to provide trustworthy and controllable digital products and services would ensure a safer digital environment.\u201d\nWe list the best cloud storage.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Pricing usually depends on how many devices your organization operates and its custom technical infrastructure.\nYou should estimate beforehand what you expect to pay and ensure it\u2019s a price you can afford in the long term. Always read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs, e.g., extra support costs as some software vendors charge.\nCustomer support\nCustomer service is another critical aspect of any software platform.

      "text": "The rise of sovereign clouds: no data portability, no party\nSovereign clouds demand data portability for resilience\nThe rise of sovereign clouds has become inevitable as regulatory demands, and geopolitical pressures push enterprises to rethink where their data resides. Localized cloud environments are increasingly becoming essential, allowing organizations to keep their data within specific jurisdictions to meet compliance requirements, and provide risk mitigation.\nBut sovereign clouds can\u2019t succeed without data portability, which is the ability to move data seamlessly between systems and locations. Today organizations shouldn\u2019t wait to be pushed by regulations, they need to be ahead of the game.\nEnterprises need to address the reality that data migration across hybrid environments is far from straightforward. It\u2019s not just about relocating primary data, you also must keep it protected while considering associated datasets like backups and the information used in AI applications.\nWhile some may need to address the protection of Large Language Model (LLM) training data, many organizations are instead turning to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or AI agents to bring intelligence to their proprietary data without building models from scratch.\nEither way, data sovereignty is a valid approach to the pressures facing organizations today, but the focus should always be on data resilience first, no matter where it's stored.\nIt\u2019s a familiar tale - the cloud will give businesses more options and flexibility, but to take advantage of these properly, they\u2019ll need some joined up thinking.\nGlobal Field CTO, Veeam.\nToday\u2019s forecast\nRegulators around the globe are driving organizations to look at their data differently, appearing at pace in response to increasing data globalization as countries try to get a better grasp on their data. The European Union (EU) has been particularly stringent, introducing the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that stipulates data sovereignty.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nUnder it, the laws of the country where data is stored or processed are now applicable to the data, regardless of where the data was originally collected. Special attention is also being paid to the chain of custody of data in the EU with both the NIS2 and DORA regulations demanding robust risk management for data, especially when held or handled by third parties.\nAs data, including highly sensitive and classified data, is being increasingly handled by these third parties, namely cloud providers, keeping it bound under privacy laws has become a priority for both organizations and governments as their data moves across borders.\nWith this increased movement of data between countries, or even continents, global instability concerns have become unavoidable, especially for governments. Some have already adopted sovereign clouds to protect their most sensitive data from potential malevolent access. And some have taken it one step further.\nWith cloud services completely reliant on data center infrastructure, some governments have started to divest their interest in foreign cloud and IT infrastructure, reinvesting instead in their own. This way, they can avoid storing their most sensitive data with foreign providers.\nBut cloud sovereignty is not a silver bullet. For those utilizing multinational cloud providers, there might be the option to stipulate where your data is ultimately stored and what countries\u2019 laws it will be held under, but there is no guarantee that it will not change. The issue isn\u2019t just solved by relocating the primary data.\nSure, it needs to be protected, but what about all the related data? Cloud backups and Large Language Model training data sets for example, all need to be carefully considered to meet data sovereignty \u2013 or alternatively, organizations can utilize RAG or AI agents to level up their data without having to deal with reams of AI training datasets in the first place.\nFreedom of Movement\nBut to do all of this, organizations need to ensure that data portability is enshrined in their data resilience planning. After all, there\u2019s a fine line between protecting your data and inadvertently restricting it beyond the point of use. If organizations are unable to ensure data portability, then moving to a hybrid cloud environment to take advantage of both sovereign clouds and localization of data storage is a non-starter.\nThere are SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) and DRaaS (Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service) providers that can simplify the process, but it\u2019s not a task that can be completely offloaded to a third party. Organizations still need to take a hands-on approach, planning and managing it thoroughly to ensure data remains secure throughout the process. Otherwise, organizations will be unable to utilize sovereign clouds to adhere to the myriad data residency and sovereignty regulations.\nIt\u2019s not without caveats though. For those larger, multinational organizations operating across countries and continents, multiple cloud environments will be required to house multiple sovereign clouds. But this also brings increased complexity for both the monitoring and management of data across jurisdictions.\nNot only will multiple cloud environments need to be considered, but also multiple sets of data regulations across countries. And, for those organizations that do get it right, the benefit of enhanced data resilience comes with the added risk of data fragmentation.\nThere\u2019s no easy win, but what\u2019s certain is that data portability will be an essential part of any solution that organizations settle on. Whichever approach is taken, being able to move data seamlessly across platforms and clouds will be a necessity as organizations wrestle with data sovereignty. And, as regulations continue coming down the line, data portability will give organizations a head start on future compliance, allowing them to flex more easily to meet regulations, where less portable counterparts will struggle.\nTying down the cloud\nData globalization is showing no signs of slowing, with information flows now their own form of trade, even generating their own economic value. And with global instability as an ever-present factor, data sovereignty will only move higher up the priority list. But it\u2019s not a task that can just be passed onto a third-party provider.\nAlthough organizations may not fully realize it yet, data sovereignty and operational clarity are closely linked. To start securing your data, you need to know exactly where it\u2019s stored and how. Then, with this comprehensive understanding of your data landscape, you can pinpoint those operations or processes where data resilience might be lacking and tackle your data portability.\nBy reworking data resilience from the ground-up, organizations can cement security, compliance, and sovereignty into their operations, and actively manage them through risk assessments, compliance audits, and strategies that take into account multiple suppliers.\nWith this in place, organizations can start leveraging hybrid cloud environments effectively, perhaps storing the most sensitive data on-premises under precise data sovereignty regulations, while offloading less critical data to the cloud.\nBut this can only be utilized by organizations that have prioritized data portability. Rather than waiting for regulations to enforce it, organizations need to be proactive to take advantage of the flexibility, longevity, and most importantly, security of the cloud.\nWe've listed the best IT management tool.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Europe needs to decouple from Big Tech USA: Here\u2019s 5 ways it can be achieved\nEurope's IT leaders are getting twitchy over US Big Tech\nThe fallout from \u201cLiberation Day\u201d has reignited a critical conversation across Europe: how long can the EU, UK and other European nations afford to tie their digital future to American tech monopolies? For years, Europe has depended on US hyperscalers to power its infrastructure, manage its data, and now, fuel its AI ambitions. But with America\u2019s erratic leadership casting fresh doubt over the future of Europe\u2019s tech sector, businesses are being forced to confront the real risks of over-reliance.\nNew research from Civo found that 84% of UK IT leaders are concerned that geopolitical developments could threaten their ability to access and control their data. As US tech giants scramble to offer reassurances, including recent pledges from Microsoft to uphold Europe\u2019s digital resilience, the bigger question remains: can Europe afford to deepen its dependencies on the US?\nIn the midst of all this doubt, Europe has a window of opportunity to reclaim its technological sovereignty and reduce its exposure to the political and commercial whims of US. tech giants. There has never been a better time to build a more balanced, competitive, and resilient digital economy - one that hands back control to businesses.\nHere are five key actions Europe must take to make that vision a reality:\nCEO and co-founder of Civo.\n1. It\u2019s time to take sovereignty seriously\nAccording to Civo\u2019s research, 61% of UK IT leaders say that sovereignty is s strategic priority. But while European governments have talked a good game on sovereignty, action has been inconsistent. Take the UK, for example: while outside of the EU and operating under different data and competition laws, earlier this year it unveiled its AI Opportunities Action Plan.\nWithin this, Starmer\u2019s government promises to build sovereign datacenters and AI Growth Zones. Yet at the same time, the UK has courted massive investments from US. hyperscalers like Microsoft and AWS to expand their UK footprints.\nThis contradiction underlines the urgent need for clear policy guardrails. Sovereignty is about so much more than just data localization; it\u2019s about ensuring full legal, operational, and technical control over the UK\u2019s critical digital infrastructure. That means building and backing a domestic cloud and AI industry that operates under European law with shared European values.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\n2. Close the loopholes created by the US. CLOUD Act by avoiding it altogether\nThe US. CLOUD Act grants American authorities sweeping access to data held by US. hyperscalers, no matter where in the world that data is stored. This reality undermines Europe\u2019s data protection laws, including GDPR, and puts sensitive public and private sector information at risk of unwanted foreign interventions.\nEurope needs to strengthen legal frameworks that guarantee immunity from extraterritorial laws like the CLOUD Act. That means recognizing and supporting providers headquartered in Europe, fully subject to European jurisdiction, that offer complete transparency about where data is stored and who has access to it.\n3. Build a sovereign AI ecosystem\nThe rush to adopt AI has only deepened Europe\u2019s dependency on US. firms. Most AI models today are trained, deployed, and monetized by a small handful of US hyperscalers. As a result, European businesses feeding data into these models often have no visibility into how their information is used, stored, or commercialized. So it\u2019s not surprising that 68% of UK IT leaders now say they will only use AI services where they have complete certainty over data ownership.\nEurope must invest in an open, sovereign AI ecosystem. One that gives users full control over their data and AI workloads. By championing sovereign AI, Europe has an opportunity to empower organizations to develop innovative AI on their own terms, without surrendering control to black-box systems operated overseas.\n4. Reform the economics of cloud\nThe European cloud market has been stifled by opaque pricing structures, restrictive egress fees, and aggressive credit lock-ins that keep customers tied to US hyperscale platforms. This has made it difficult for new entrants and challengers to compete and for customers to switch providers without facing significant financial and technical penalties.\nEncouragingly, 60% of UK organizations say they are no longer reliant on a single cloud provider, showing that many are already moving towards multi-cloud and hybrid models to regain choice and control.\nThe public sentiment is overwhelmingly clear: Europe must establish economic policies that level the playing field. This could include mandating pricing transparency, regulating unfair egress fees, or incentivizing organizations to migrate to sovereign providers. A competitive market benefits everyone. It drives innovation, reduces costs, and gives businesses genuine choice.\n5. Build bridges, not barriers: Uniting Europe\u2019s digital strengths without shutting out the world\nUnderinvestment remains one of Europe\u2019s biggest barriers to digital progress. As Mario Draghi\u2019s landmark report on European competitiveness makes clear, the status quo is no longer sustainable. Without coordinated action, Europe risks falling behind in the race to build productive, secure, and globally competitive digital industries.\nWhile the EU and the UK have taken different regulatory paths, from evolving data governance frameworks in Brussels to post-Brexit policies in Westminster, both face the same challenges: underinvestment, regulatory misalignment, and a shortage of skilled talent are holding back sovereign cloud and AI projects across the continent.\nThe Draghi report calls for a new era of sustainable competitiveness and open strategic autonomy, one where Europe builds the foundations to compete globally while staying true to its values of fairness, resilience, and collaboration.\nDigital sovereignty must be part of this vision, but it cannot be achieved in silos. It needs harmonized regulations, shared investment in skills and infrastructure, and cross-border collaboration to scale European alternatives that are open where it counts and protected where it matters.\nBut there are signs of progress. Initiatives like EuroStack, a growing coalition of policymakers, businesses, and researchers, are working to open the European market to support local digital industries to clear the path to achieving digital sovereignty.\nSimilarly, projects like Open Euro LLM are advancing open-source, GDPR-compliant AI models that align with Europe\u2019s values, while still remaining open to international contributions and partnerships.\nSovereignty starts now\nLet\u2019s be clear: digital sovereignty does not mean closing the door on international partnerships or shutting out global innovation. As one of the world\u2019s leading economic regions, the continent of Europe will always need to collaborate with partners around the world, but that collaboration must happen on Europe\u2019s terms and not in ways that compromise control, economic, or geopolitical resilience.\nBuilding genuine digital sovereignty means strengthening Europe\u2019s digital foundations so that it can engage with the global tech ecosystem from a position of strength, not dependency. It means creating an environment where businesses have real choice, where data stays protected by local laws and values, and where European innovation isn\u2019t at the mercy of foreign policy shifts or opaque corporate interests.\nWe have a chance to rebalance the market, encourage competition, and put fairness and transparency at the heart of Europe\u2019s digital future. But that window won\u2019t stay open forever. The time for action is now.\nWe've featured the best cloud storage.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best cloud computing provider of 2025\nVirtual IT infrastructure for Digital Transformation\nWe list the best cloud computing services, to make it simple and easy to manage your computing in the cloud to help with digital transformation.\nCloud services have revolutionized computing, not least through IaaS, PaaS, and especially SaaS, which have allowed businesses to develop virtualized IT infrastructure and deliver software through the cloud, independent of a user's operating system.\nEven better still, businesses can also mix and match cloud services from different providers to ensure maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness. For larger businesses especially the economic benefits can be significant.\nBecause cloud services are run through software platforms and virtualized networks, it means that it's easy to access and analyze data for the purposes of analytics as well as for business intelligence purposes. The result is IT infrastructure management that allows for insights that would have previously been much more difficult to access.\nCloud computing services also offer the advantage of being scalable, which means not only can you access additional resources exactly as you need them, but you are also charged only for the services you use so there's no need to buy in extra hardware for additional redundancy.\nThis especially applies to when storing data, as online cloud storage can be treated as effectively limitless. Even though you might be using cloud databases for your structured data, you can also archive everything else into massive data lakes for additional processing using AI and machine learning for greater insights.\nAltogether, cloud services offer unparalleled potential for improving business performance and increasing profits, and here we'll look at the best cloud computing service provider.\nKamatera cloud computing: Start free trial with $100 credit\nKamatera\u2019s cloud computing services offer scalable infrastructure, flexible pricing, and enterprise-grade reliability. With globally distributed data centers and always-on tech support from live humans, you can deploy, manage, and scale your cloud resources without paying for unnecessary features.\nThere are endless cloud computing services out there, and choosing the best one can be an uphill battle. It\u2019s essential to select an ideal one based on your requirements. Otherwise, you might find it strenuous to build and maintain your platform.\nThere are many things to consider including cost, pricing, security, features, ease of use, etc. We tested various cloud computing vendors and selected the best ones for you. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages but, overall, are some of the best cloud platforms you can find.\nWe've featured the best business cloud storage.\nThe best cloud computing service of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest cloud computing provider for reliability\n1. Amazon Web Services\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the world\u2019s biggest cloud computing provider. It kickstarted the cloud revolution and has occupied the number one spot for a long time.\nAWS has the largest data center network of all cloud providers, so it\u2019s very reliable and offers solid performance. You can host your application in the region where your customers are closest. For instance, if you\u2019re in the U.K. and observe that most of your customers come from the U.S., you can choose a U.S.-based data center to offer faster speed.\nAWS is known for being user-friendly. It's built for quick and easy access, and you can monitor or modify your data just when you want. This cloud platform offers a lot of web application services, so you have a broad choice of features to adopt. You can choose the best server operating system depending on which programming languages power your app.\nAWS is also known for being very safe and secure. The platform has had few noteworthy security incidents since its founding in 2006.\nHowever, there are some drawbacks. A common customer complaint is that AWS\u2019s billing system is confusing, leaving users prone to making mistakes that increase their costs. Another complaint is the high costs of dedicated support from AWS experts.\nBest cloud computing provider for scalability\n2. Microsoft Azure\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAzure is a cloud computing service offered by Microsoft, the American tech giant best known for its Windows operating system. It allows you to build and run your applications on the cloud with ease.\nAzure has a large network of over 200 data centers spread across the globe. This network guarantees high availability and redundancy, with Azure offering a service level agreement (SLA) of 99.95% (roughly 4.38 hours of downtime per year).\nAzure has invested a lot of resources into security. It offers built-in controls for detecting and thwarting cyber threats; it applies artificial intelligence and machine learning to aid this process. The company has a team of over 3,500 cybersecurity experts working to safeguard its cloud network.\nScalability shouldn't be a worry when using Azure. You can start with small computing resources and increase them as your business grows. The platform uses the pay-as-you-go method, making it cost-effective as you scale.\nBut a notable drawback of using Azure is its complex user interface. You\u2019ll likely find it more difficult to navigate Azure than AWS and some other rival platforms.\nTake a look at our Microsoft discount codes for the best Microsoft offers and savings.\nBest cloud computing provider for Google\n3. Google Cloud\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Cloud is an eponymous cloud computing service offered by Google, the tech company best known for its search engine. Google got into the cloud game later than most competitors but nonetheless has built a strong customer base.\nGoogle Cloud dedicates a lot of resources to security. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to detect and counter cyber threats. Users have access to a host of cybersecurity features to keep sensitive data secure.\nThis platform is famous for its high performance. Ask many customers the best thing about choosing Google Cloud, and you\u2019ll likely hear about performance. Google has a lot of hardware and software expertise that it leveraged to design servers and server management software that works as fast as possible.\nAnother good thing you\u2019ll hear about Google Cloud is that the platform makes it easy for multiple users to collaborate within the same interface and access the same features. This platform also offers comprehensive support resources, including tutorials, how-to articles, an online community, and human support.\nThe main complaint that you\u2019ll hear about Google Cloud is that it\u2019s expensive, which is true. It costs more to use Google Cloud than rival platforms like AWS and Azure, but many people think the tradeoff for high performance is worth it.\nBest cloud computing provider for enterprises\n4. IBM Cloud\nReasons to buy\nIBM Cloud is a cloud computing service offered by the eponymous tech giant IBM. The solution offers PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS.\nAs hardware and virtual-based servers are combined into one on demand cloud-platform, you have complete control. IBM refer to their hardware servers as \u2018bare metal\u2019. These provide clients with sole access to their entire server. This reduces the \u2018noisy neighbor\u2019 effect and greatly improves performance.\nIBM Cloud is integrated and managed by a single system that can be controlled via web portal, API (Application Programming Interface) or mobile apps. IBM Cloud\u2019s Bluemix developing solution has a wide range of cloud SaaS management tools.\nIBM Cloud also offers full server customization. This means that everything that is included in the server is handpicked by you. This way you do not have to pay for features that you might never use.\nBest distributed cloud computing provider\n5. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nReasons to buy\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure offers two main service provisions available: cloud architecture, and storage data.\nCloud architecture includes data management, cloud databases, and applications, while the Oracle Data Cloud is primarily for driving big data analytics for business intelligence insights. Oracle also provides a range of SaaS platforms such as HCM, EPM, SCM, and social media tools.\nFor those who do sign up, aside from a 30-day free trial, Oracle Cloud also offers a free service tier which includes unlimited access to two autonomous databases which come with Oracle Application Express (APEX) and Oracle SQL.\nBest open source cloud computing OS\n6. CloudLinux\nReasons to buy\nCloudLinux isn't so much a cloud computing provider, but rather a cloud platform you can build across your own servers. This means that if you'd prefer to have tight control over your cloud network rather than going with third-parties, you can host it yourself. While this presents a different set of challenges, it also offers a range of benefits, especially for those companies already heavily invested in their own IT infrastructure.\nCloudLinux is a distro of specifically built for virtualized cloud operations to power shared hosting services, by allocating and limiting server resources to each tenant. Additionally, each tenant is partition from each other, in other to create a more secure environment. The result is a hosting platform that has built in redundancy, stability, and security, in order to provide a better hosting environment.\nAll cloud services require a degree of technical knowledge to work with, so for those with extensive expertise CloudLinux offers the opportunity to be far more in control of your own services and how they are configured.\nBest cloud computing provider for Europe\n7. OVHCloud\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOVHcloud is a French cloud computing provider focused on European customers. It is the largest cloud hosting provider in Europe and the third-largest globally based on physical servers.\nOVHcloud gives you access to virtual private servers or dedicated servers. You can choose the type you want and the region you want it to be in. Your choice depends on the type of online platform you're hosting, as some servers are faster than others.\nThis platform has the largest data center network in Europe, so it\u2019s an ideal choice if most of your customers are based in this region. Furthermore, OVHcloud is affordable compared to most rival platforms.\nWhen testing OVHcloud, we observed that its customer support wasn\u2019t as good as what you\u2019d get on rival platforms. You need to pay a significant sum for dedicated human support, which puts it at a disadvantage.\nBest cloud computing provider for cost-effectiveness\n8. DigitalOcean\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDigitalOcean is one of the most popular low-cost cloud providers. It doesn\u2019t offer as much sophisticated features as you\u2019d find on rival platforms like Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. It focuses more on offering simple cloud computing features for an affordable price and does its job well.\nDigitalOcean has 15 data centers worldwide, much smaller than the network of the likes of AWS and Azure. Its reliability and performance are good but not as good as what you\u2019d get on these rival platforms. The attraction of DigitalOcean is trading lower costs for fewer features and performance.\nIt's pretty easy to spin up cloud servers on DigitalOcean to host your application. The platform is easy to navigate, so you shouldn\u2019t face difficulties navigating it. You can choose different types of managed cloud databases, clusters, and APIs. You can also access complementary features such as security firewalls, load balances, and a DNS management system.\nBest cloud computing provider FAQs\nHow to choose a cloud computing provider\nCost\nCost is the number one consideration in selecting a provider. It\u2019s essential to pick something that you can afford to avoid running into trouble in the future. Cloud services are unique such that they don\u2019t usually have a straightforward pricing structure. What you\u2019ll pay depends on the features that you select. The good thing is that cloud services offer their pricing details beforehand so that you can have a good estimate of what you\u2019ll pay.\nSecurity\nYou\u2019ll be storing a lot of sensitive data on your cloud provider. Thus, it must have advanced security features to prevent data leaks or theft. Losing customer data can hamper your reputation and even bring about legal lawsuits. Similarly, losing sensitive business data can harm your competitive advantage, so your cloud platform must be secure.\nFeatures\nWhat features do the platform offer? Can you choose the type of servers you want? Can you spin up GPUs? Does it offer complementary services such as domain names and DNS management? Etc.\nEase of use\nYou need a platform that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. Otherwise, you can get frustrated or make costly mistakes by choosing features you didn\u2019t intend to choose.\nWhat are the essential features of a cloud provider?\nOn-demand self-service\nYou should be able to spin up cloud instances and use them without external help. You should be able to monitor the servers you've rented and their allotted storage capacities. External help can always be a complementary feature, but the important thing is that every good cloud provider must offer a self-serve option.\nSolid uptime\nA cloud provider should have their servers up and running as faultlessly as possible. Of course, no platform is perfect, so you may experience occasional downtimes. However, every cloud provider should offer at least 99.9% uptime. Otherwise, you may lose money because of unnecessary server issues preventing your online platform from working.\nAnalytics\nAn ideal cloud computing platform should let users analyze what features they\u2019ve used and give them a breakdown of how it affects their costs. This way, a user can easily identify which features are generating high costs and which ones aren\u2019t, and use this information to optimize their spending.\nPay-As-You-Go\nPay-as-you-go is the best pricing structure because you only pay for the computing features you use. This way, you avoid paying for unnecessary things that you may not use, and you save significant sums in the long run.\nHow we tested the best cloud computing providers\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what range of business type and size the cloud computing service would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant services, such as security perimeters and user apps. We also looks at pricing models and flexibility, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

He's been following the AI space closely for over five years, ever since the early days of GPT-2, giving him a solid perspective on how these tools have evolved. Alongside writing, he helps with editorial work to keep content updated and useful. Outside of work, you'll find him playing basketball or heading off on solo trips.\nBest AI chatbots\n1. Chat GPT\n- What is it: A fast, multimodal AI assistant from OpenAI that can understand and respond using text, images, audio, and even video.\n- Ideal for: Anyone who needs a flexible AI to help with writing, research, coding, image generation, file analysis, or even live conversations.\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT for everything from writing blog drafts to debugging code and summarizing PDFs, and honestly, it\u2019s only getting better. The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory).

Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner. Built with native integration across Google Workspace and powered by the Gemini 2.5 model, it\u2019s designed to reduce busywork and surface insights across your files and tools. From summarizing documents to organizing your day, Gemini blends into your existing routines without extra setup. Enroll for Gemini Advanced absolutely free for the first month.\n3. Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builders that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is one of the best web hosting and website builder providers. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute. Its AI builder creates a ready-to-edit layout from just one sentence, while extras like an AI writer, SEO assistant, and image generator help you fill out your content. It\u2019s fast, beginner-friendly, and comes bundled with hosting, email, and eCommerce tools. Grab a 75% discount on Hostinger\u2019s Premium Website Builder plan on a four-year term at just $2.99/mo.\n3. GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point. GoDaddy also provides 24/7 support with an AI help assistant, which makes it super easy to get answers on the fly.\nBest AI Website Builder for Small Business and E-commerce Launches\nGoDaddy\u2019s AI Website Builder is both easy to use and powerful enough.

It\u2019s especially helpful if you want to launch quickly and keep everything under one roof. You can get started with the Basic Website Building plan at just $9.99/ month (41% discount) if you opt for the yearly package.\nBest AI virtual assistants\n1. Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help. Whether you\u2019re scheduling a meeting, sending a quick message, or just asking how to screen record, Siri blends seamlessly into your routine. It\u2019s available for free on all supported Apple devices running iOS 18 and above.\n2. Google Assistant\n- What is it: Google\u2019s longtime voice-powered assistant for Android and smart devices, now transitioning to Gemini for more advanced, AI-driven help.\n- Ideal for: Android users who want voice-based assistance for everyday tasks, real-time answers, and device-wide control.\nGoogle Assistant works across phones, tablets, smart speakers, and even in-car systems, so it\u2019s always within reach when you need it.\nWhether you\u2019re in the kitchen, driving, or just relaxing on the couch, you can use it to get things done without picking up your device.\nDuring testing, I asked it to check the weather, play music on a speaker, and add smoothie ingredients to my list. Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading. It brings more intelligence, flexibility, and awareness to your phone, home, and even your car.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Everyday Google Tasks\nGoogle Assistant still helps you manage your day with hands-free commands across Android phones, smart speakers, and other connected devices. It works directly with Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and smart home tools, making it easy to check reminders, get directions, or control your lights with just your voice. It continues to run reliably on millions of devices worldwide and remains free to use on Android phones and Google smart devices through 2025.\n3. Amazon Alexa\n- What is it: Amazon\u2019s voice assistant built into Echo devices and now evolving into Alexa Plus, a more conversational AI powered by generative technology.\n- Ideal for: Smart home users and Amazon shoppers who want hands-free control, productivity features, and built-in entertainment across devices.\nAlexa has grown from being a voice-controlled speaker into a full-fledged home assistant, and with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI, Alexa remembers more, responds with more personality, and handles tasks independently across apps and services.\nOn my Echo device, Alexa handles my reminders, helps me control smart lights with voice prompts, plays music, and even gives delivery updates without a hitch. With Alexa+, it feels more like talking to someone than giving commands.\nNow, it can pick up on incomplete questions, remember preferences like dietary needs, and even follow through on multi-step tasks, like finding a plumber and booking a visit.\n\u2705 You use Alexa for your smart home devices: Alexa+ improves everything from device control to alerts and media playback.\n\u2705 You\u2019re already a Prime member: Alexa+ is free for Prime users and available across Echo devices and mobile apps.\n\u274c You need AI for work or productivity workflows: Alexa+ is still more home- and lifestyle-focused than business-oriented.\nSmart home control feels smoother now. I could move music or video across devices and get Ring alerts when a package arrived, all without picking up my phone.\nYou can upload photos, event flyers, or even study material, and Alexa+ can summarize them or turn them into To-Dos or flashcards. It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests. It remembers your preferences and acts across apps and devices without additional prompts. It\u2019s built into Echo speakers and displays, with proactive alerts, personalized routines, and smart home control that works even across rooms. It comes included for free with Amazon Prime, or is available for $19.99/month excl. Early access rolling out to Echo Show users in the U.S.\nBest AI Notes Apps\n1. Jaime\n- What is it: An AI note-taker that records and summarizes meetings without using bots.\n- Ideal for: Founders, managers, sales teams, or recruiters who need instant, structured summaries of meetings\nAI note-taking tools handle tasks like reviewing meetings, creating summaries, or managing action items. Jamie does all of this automatically, so you can stay focused on the conversation.\nI tested Jamie in both virtual and in-person meetings. The clean interface kept distractions away, with no bots, popups, or glitches interrupting the experience.\nJust one click to \u201cstart meeting,\u201d and Jamie ran in the background. In under ten minutes post-call, Jamie dropped a polished transcript with key takeaways and action items, all neatly tagged by the speaker.\n\u2705 You want accurate meeting notes without bots: Jamie records privately in the background, no pop-ins or distractions.\n\u2705 You need summaries and transcripts fast: You get the full output in 10 minutes with tasks, decisions, and speakers tagged.\n\u2705 You care about privacy and compliance: Jamie is GDPR-compliant, and your data never gets used for AI training.\n\u274c You need live transcription: On the downside, Jamie only processes recordings after meetings end.\n\u274c You rely heavily on mobile: Jamie is currently desktop-only with no mobile app.\nYou\u2019ll also find a built-in assistant. Simply hit Command+J and the AI will help you draft emails, search meeting history, or brainstorm ideas.\nOn a call with a Spanish-speaking client, Jamie handled both languages without any glitches or wrong understandings. I also added terms like \u201cSDK rollout\u201d to the custom word list, and they came through clearly in the summary. It helped keep the transcription accurate, even when the discussion got more technical.\nThere\u2019s no real-time transcription or mobile app yet, and you\u2019ll need to manually share notes or copy content into tools like Slack.\nWhile there aren\u2019t any major bugs, the exporting options are limited. Even some users on G2 have reported issues with older conversations or audio sync.\nThat said, the summaries themselves are reliable, bot-free, and feel especially useful if you value privacy or want a clean, distraction-free way to keep track of meetings.\nBest bot-free AI notes app for private, accurate meeting summaries\nJamie captures meetings quietly in the background, transcribes them with high accuracy, and highlights tasks and key takeaways, without any bots or browser extensions.

Fireflies.ai\n- What is it: An AI meeting assistant that joins calls, records conversations, and turns them into searchable transcripts and summaries.\n- Ideal for: Teams that host regular meetings and want searchable records, auto-summaries, or integrations with CRM and project tools.\nTo see if it really works, I used Fireflies on a mix of team calls and one-on-ones. It handled speaker identification surprisingly well and got the meeting structure right almost every time.\nWhen the call ended, the summary showed up in my inbox. It was neatly organized by topic with time-stamped highlights.\nFireflies automatically joins your Zoom, Meet, or Teams calls, records the conversation, and transcribes it with solid accuracy. No reminders or setup needed.\nAfter the meeting, it delivers AI-generated summaries with action items, key highlights, and organized sections like \u201cPricing\u201d or \u201cNext Steps,\u201d so you can skip the note-taking and stay focused.\n\u2705 You want detailed, time-stamped meeting recaps: Fireflies breaks down calls into labeled sections with summaries, questions, and next steps.\n\u2705 You use apps like Slack, Notion, or Salesforce: Fireflies has direct integrations with over 60 tools for easy sharing.\n\u2705 You manage a global team: With support for 100+ languages and speaker ID, it\u2019s built for multilingual meetings.\n\u274c You need complete accuracy out of the box: Some AI summaries need edits if the call includes crosstalk or poor audio.\n\u274c You\u2019re only looking for mobile or in-person note capture: The mobile app exists, but it is more limited than the desktop experience.\nThe Fireflies Chrome extension is pretty useful for those who connect on Google Meet often. It adds a live transcript sidebar during your calls, so you can follow along in real time. And you don\u2019t need to invite the bot, just join the meeting, and Fireflies will capture everything from your browser.\nFireflies\u2019 AskFred made it easy for me to find what you needed. For example, when I asked \u201cWhat did Alex say about onboarding?\u201d and it pulled the exact response from the notes. This means you don\u2019t need to scroll through the whole transcript for a simple answer.\nIf your team relies on tools like Slack, Notion, or Google Docs, Fireflies\u2019 integrations are a real plus.\nYou can send notes to a shared Slack channel or clip soundbites into Notion to follow up later. Fireflies works quietly in the background, surfaces what matters, and saves you time after every call.\nBest AI notes app for teams that need transcripts, not just summaries\nFireflies turn every call into searchable notes, summaries, and insights, which is perfect for busy teams.

Let\u2019s say you have a transcript from a writing workshop you attended. You can ask Notion to summarize something like \u201cThe importance of search intent while writing a blog.\u201d It doesn\u2019t just search keywords. It scans the entire page, or even your whole workspace, to understand what matters. Then it delivers a clear, relevant answer.\nYou can even narrow that search to a specific doc, database, or tagged goal using @mentions. It also pulls content from connected tools like Google Drive or Slack and adds citations when needed.\n\u2705 You already use Notion as your main workspace: Notion AI is built into the tools you\u2019re already using, from notes to docs to calendars.\n\u2705 You want an all-in-one AI assistant: It handles writing, editing, summarizing, translating, and even extracting data from other tools.\n\u2705 You need workspace-level search: Ask it to find updates, draft pages, or summarize anything across your workspace.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Notion at all: It only works inside Notion, so it won\u2019t help with external docs or tools unless integrated.\n\u274c You need a perfect structure every time: Some summaries or tables need edits to match your format or tone.\nThere\u2019s also an AI Chat that works like a workspace-wide command center. It runs on GPT\u20114 and Claude to help with prompts or planning. I asked for a 5K training schedule and got a full week-by-week plan with toggles.\nIf you're not sure where to begin, the Notion templates gallery is worth checking out. It comes with a bunch of pre-built layouts for everything from meeting notes and study planners to editorial calendars and startup CRMs. You can add a template, then ask AI to help you populate or personalize it instantly.\nSome features still need polishing. The study tools often require manual edits, and summaries may lose detail unless you specify it to keep the original phrasing.\nBest AI assistant for Notion users who want writing, search, and task help\nNotion brings AI tools like GPT-4 and Claude straight into your Notion docs, making it perfect for summarizing, brainstorming, writing, and workspace querying. It helps you clean up text, generate tasks, build custom dashboards, or auto-fill databases. A free trial is available in all accounts.

Whereas, Professional Voice Cloning, requires at least 30 minutes of audio to produce an identical replica of the original voice. This advanced cloning supports all available languages and accents, which makes it perfect for professional-grade applications\nNonetheless, ElevenLabs comes with a few shortcomings as well. First, the software's fancy features might be tricky for beginners. This could be a problem for new teams who want to finish their work quickly. Alongside, their pricing structure is based on usage which makes it pretty expensive for heavy usage.\nFor instance, ElevenLabs AI has 4 premium plans i.e. Starter, Creator, Independent Publisher, and Growing Business. Under this, the cheapest plan starts at $5/mo and includes basic features and a 30,000-character output capacity whereas, the most expensive plan costs $330//mo and offers 2,000,000 character output and 660 custom voice slots .

Google Translate\nGoogle Translate is one of the most used translation tools on the internet. It offers multilingual support for text, voice, and images. It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2.

In our opinion, you\u2019ll make the most out of this translator if you prefer working on Microsoft\u2019s workspace. We say this because its integration with Microsoft products and its focus on business and enterprise use cases boost your productivity and save you a good amount of time.\nMicrosoft Translator extends to over 100 languages and offers many translation options. It further provides customizable translations through its Translator API and Speech service, both part of the Azure AI Services suite.

This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.\nOverall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.\n4.

It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text.\nWe love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.\nOne of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial.\nDeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages.\nFor those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.\nWhen it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.\nBest AI music generators\n1.

  "argos_summary": "Geopolitical tensions\u2014from Ukraine to the South China Sea\u2014are forcing governments and businesses to treat data sovereignty as a core operational concern, not just a compliance checkbox. UK IT leaders report that 83% feel geopolitics threatens data control, yet only 35% know where their data resides, highlighting a gap between policy and practice. The article stresses that modern infrastructure must be sovereignty\u2011aware, using hybrid multicloud and policy\u2011driven controls to keep sensitive data within jurisdiction while still leveraging cloud analytics, especially as generative AI adds new layers of complexity. It calls for clear visibility, auditability, and cross\u2011functional collaboration to align data residency with evolving regulations such as the EU Data Act, UK data laws, and critical infrastructure policies, positioning sovereignty\u2011centric design as essential for resilience, trust, and future regulatory compliance.",
