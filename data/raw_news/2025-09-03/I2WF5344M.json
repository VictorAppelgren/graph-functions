  "title": "Concerns rise among Americans with student loans \u2013 AICPA survey",
  "description": "The results reveal that 74% of participants are concerned about managing their financial obligations.",
  "content": "A survey commissioned by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) has revealed that a significant majority of Americans with personal student loans are anxious about their repayment prospects.\n\nThe findings indicate that 74% of respondents expressed varying degrees of worry regarding their ability to manage these financial obligations.\n\nAICPA Personal Financial Planning senior manager Pamela Ladd said: \u201cStudent loans are more than a monthly payment \u2013 they are a long-term financial commitment.\n\n\u201cThe fact that three-quarters of borrowers are worried about repaying their student loans underscores the urgent need for personalised financial planning. These concerns aren\u2019t just numbers \u2013 they reflect real stress that can derail financial stability.\u201d\n\nThe survey, which was carried out online by the Harris Poll on behalf of the AICPA on 21\u201325 August 2025, included responses from 2,087 adults aged 18 and older.\n\nIt found that 22% of Americans either have personal student loans or have taken out loans for their children's education.\n\nAdditionally, more than half of those with personal or parent loans (53%) reported that these financial commitments impact their ability to save for future goals including retirement.\n\nAmong parents of children with student loans, 70% expressed concern about their child(ren)\u2019s capacity to repay them.\n\nThe data also indicated that 55% of individuals with personal or parent student loans had previously deferred their loans, which are now due for repayment.\n\nThe demographic analysis of personal student loan holders showed that 37% are aged 18\u201334, 27% are aged 35\u201344 and 25% are aged 45\u201354.\n\nIn response to these findings, the AICPA has offered guidance for managing student loan repayments.\n\nRecommendations include ensuring that loan providers have current contact information, understanding the specifics of the loan and repayment options, and developing a financial strategy to facilitate timely payments.\n\nBorrowers are also advised to consider making early and additional payments when feasible.\n\nAICPA Personal Financial Specialist Credential Committee member Laura Brown said: \u201cFamilies who are behind in retirement savings or even emergency fund savings struggle with saving for college at all, and given the high cost of education, loans are sometimes necessary to bridge the gap.\n\n\u201cImplementing an aggressive repayment strategy can help ease the stress of a high expense period of life.\u201d\n\nThe AICPA is a professional association for certified public accountants, with a membership of 397,000.",
