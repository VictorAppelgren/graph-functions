  "description": "Welcome to The Hill\u2019s Defense & NatSec newsletter{beacon} Defense &National Security Defense &National Security \u200a The Big Story Trump\u2019s strike on \u2018narco-terrorist\u2019 b\u2026",
  "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s few details about a U.S. military strike on a boat in the Caribbean Sea has fueled questions as to whether it violated maritime law or human rights conventions. President Trump, who announced on Tuesday that American forces destroyed a vessel from Venezuela allegedly carrying illegal narcotics, claimed the boat was bound for the U.S. and operated by the Tren de Aragua cartel, which the U.S. has designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Trump has shared a video appearing to show drone footage of a boat on the water exploding and then on fire, but the Pentagon has not released any specifics about the strike, including how it was carried out and how much and what kind of drugs were on board. Nor has the administration said what legal authority officials relied upon to justify the move \u2014 an unprecedented and significant escalation by the White House against Latin American drug cartels, given that narcotic runners are typically rounded up by the Coast Guard instead of being fired upon by U.S. aircraft. Experts have accused the administration of violating international law. \u201cThese extrajudicial killings are a clear violation of international law,\u201d Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement to The Hill. \u201cIf there are no consequences, we should be extremely concerned about what comes next \u2014 will this administration begin executing alleged gang members or drug dealers at home without any judicial process?\u201d On Thursday, the administration was set to provide to Congress its rationale for the strike, a legal deadline to send a report to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) detailing its reasons for the attack. The administration so far has suggested the president\u2019s authority to defend the U.S. is sufficient in justifying carrying out the strike, the same rationale used for the Pentagon\u2019s months-long bombing campaign of Houthi targets in Yemen earlier this spring. Ahead of the report, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday alluded to this rationale. \u201cPresident Trump has shown whether it\u2019s the southwest border, whether it\u2019s the Houthis in freedom of navigation, whether it\u2019s Midnight Hammer in Iran, that the precise application of American power can have incredible impacts and reshape dynamics around the world and in the region,\u201d Hegseth said on Fox and Friends, referring to the U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites in June. \u201cThis is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won\u2019t stop with just this strike. Anyone else trafficking in the waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate,\u201d he added. And Trump on Wednesday again insisted the boat was laden with drugs and that the attack on it would deter cartels from similar actions in the future. But Human rights groups say the attack has potentially violated a whole host of international standards and Washington\u2019s own regulations for maritime operations against civilian vessels in international waters. The president\u2019s war powers, as stipulated under the Constitution, are typically limited to events where groups have done violent harm to U.S. citizens and interests. But given that the administration appeared to target drug traffickers in a situation where it\u2019s not clear if the group was armed or if it had plans to physically harm Americans, experts warn the strike sets a dangerous precedent.
