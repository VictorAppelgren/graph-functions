  "content": "Christine McGuinness showed clear signs she wanted to leave the programme during the first episode of Celebs Go Dating on Monday night.\n\nThe model, 37, who announced she had quit the show in May, appeared visibly uncomfortable during the mixer when the celebs were tasked to pick someone to take to Ibiza in the hope they would get closer.\n\nBut all seemed too much for Christine as she insisted on 'taking a minute' outside with her fellow co-star Kerry Katona.\n\nShe panicked: 'I need a minute, I can go for a minute can't I? I don't want to just take someone away.\n\n'How can I go abroad with someone I've just met? This is just not normal.'\n\nWhen it was announced she would appear on the show, it was revealed that Christine would be up for dating both men and women on the show.\n\nChristine revealed it felt 'too soon' for her to date so publicly following her divorce from ex-husband Paddy McGuinness.\n\nShe had already flown to Ibiza to begin filming the series with the rest of the cast but told fans she was 'returning home to her family' after having a change of heart.\n\nRevealing the news on Instagram, she said: 'I joined Celebs Go Dating with great intentions but have realised that dating on a public platform and the attention is brings is just too soon for me.'\n\nChristine also said that she may appear in the future, adding: 'They've said the door is always open for me which I'm so grateful but for now I'm returning home to my family.'\n\nTalking on Celebs Go Dating, Christine said: 'I feel like I\u2019m a couple of steps away from being my new self and not \u2018Paddy\u2019s wife\u2019. I\u2019m coming out of the transition part.\n\n'I am single and I absolutely do love women. I\u2019d love to explore that more and I definitely see that\u2019s where I\u2019m more comfortable.'\n\nShe added: 'When I was a teenager, I dated men and women before I was married and now I\u2019m really, really just enjoying spending time with women.\n\n'For the last three years, I\u2019ve only ever dated women. I was never heterosexual, I\u2019ve never labelled myself anything other than Christine, to be honest.'\n\nChristine was married to TV presenter Paddy for 11 years before they split for good in 2022.\n\nAfter they stayed living together for the sake of their three children - twins Leo and Penelope, and daughter Felicity, who have all been diagnosed with autism - the exes finalised their divorce out of court last summer.\n\nChristine revealed how 'difficult' the break-up had been for her after the pair's marital home, a Cheshire mansion worth \u00a36.5million, was put on the market.\n\nShe said: 'I've never spoken about the reasons for our divorce, and I don't know if I ever will.\n\n'It was a difficult time. It wasn't something that, you know, I just decided to do overnight, or that we chose to do.\n\n'We tried, and, yeah, there just, unfortunately, there was no repairing it, you know?'\n\nDiscussing her appearance on the show before deciding to quit, the TV personality has admitted that she hasn't 'dated much before' so this will be a new experience for her.\n\nShe said: 'I'm really excited to be joining the agency, I'm going to have a summer of fun! Who knows what might happen? I've not really dated much before, so I feel like I'm doing a crash course!\n\n'I'm looking forward to getting to know the other celebs and I'm especially looking forward to the coaching side of things with the agents. I think that's going to be good for me.'",
