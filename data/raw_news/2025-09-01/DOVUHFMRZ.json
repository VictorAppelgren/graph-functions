  "title": "Is SMA Solar Technology AG (ETR:S92) Worth \u20ac22.7 Based On Its Intrinsic Value?",
  "description": "Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, SMA Solar Technology fair value estimate is \u20ac16.92 Current...",
  "content": "\u2022 Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, SMA Solar Technology fair value estimate is \u20ac16.92\n\u2022 Our fair value estimate is 9.0% lower than SMA Solar Technology's analyst price target of \u20ac18.60 Does the August share price for SMA Solar Technology AG (ETR:S92) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = \u20ac321m\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.5%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= \u20ac602m\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.5%)10= \u20ac266m The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is \u20ac587m. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of \u20ac22.7, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at SMA Solar Technology as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.689. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. Check out our latest analysis for SMA Solar Technology Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$325.9b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$160.60\n7D\n1.5%\n1Y\n8.6%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$70.7b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.88\n7D\n1.8%\n1Y\n26.5%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$60.0b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.98\n7D\n1.9%\n1Y\n25.1%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$54.6b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$179.71\n7D\n4.4%\n1Y\n1.5%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$53.1b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$241.82\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n30.5%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$48.1b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$76.38\n7D\n2.6%\n1Y\n-17.3%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.6b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$104.18\n7D\n3.3%\n1Y\n32.6%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.7b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.20\n7D\n0.2%\n1Y\n10.3%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.5b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$17.79\n7D\n1.2%\n1Y\n19.6%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$41.83\n7D\n2.9%\n1Y\n-5.4%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$3.2b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$27.32\n7D\n6.1%\n1Y\n-19.8%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.8b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$34.64\n7D\n6.6%\n1Y\n54.4%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.7b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$27.71\n7D\n7.2%\n1Y\n35.7%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$576.7m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.63\n7D\n2.7%\n1Y\n-14.9%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$407.5m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.35\n7D\n-0.8%\n1Y\n-34.5%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$281.8m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$23.02\n7D\n15.3%\n1Y\n-37.6%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$75.7m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.07\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n5.4%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$35.2m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.73\n7D\n-6.7%\n1Y\n-63.4%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$894.4k\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0017\n7D\n13.3%\n1Y\n-78.8%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"
