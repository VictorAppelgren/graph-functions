  "title": "Netflix\u2019s Long Story Short is a more human successor to BoJack Horseman",
  "description": "Talking animals not included.",
  "content": "A big reason that BoJack Horseman worked so well was contrast. It took place in a silly world of talking animals, and used that to explore deep human drama in relatable ways. It\u2019s part of what made its oddball jokes work so well, as they helped balance out the darker moments that explored topics like mental health and addiction. The same could be said for its spiritual offshoot Tuca & Bertie, which ramped up the wackiness \u2014 sexy plant ladies, ghost cakes \u2014 but didn\u2019t shy away from getting real.\n\nNow we have Long Story Short, which comes from much of the same creative team; it\u2019s led by BoJack creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, while Tuca showrunner (and BoJack production designer) Lisa Hanawalt is a producer. Naturally, the new show feels similar in many respects, but Long Story Short also dials back the absurdity to focus on actual humans \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t lose its heart, humor, or bite in the process.\n\nLong Story Short is centered on the Schwooper family as it grows and changes over the course of several decades. It\u2019s a seemingly typical family composed of goofball father Elliot (Paul Reiser), overbearing mother Naomi (Lisa Edelstein), and their three kids: Avi (Ben Feldman), Shira (Abbi Jacobson), and Yoshi (Max Greenfield). Over the years more people get pulled into the Schwooper orbit, including Shira\u2019s workaholic girlfriend Kendra (Nicole Byer) and Avi\u2019s eventual wife, Jen (Angelique Cabral).\n\nThe show\u2019s main twist is that it regularly shifts back and forth in time, zeroing in on key moments spanning from the 1950s to the present day. It uses this structure to explore things like grief \u2014 the Schwoopers lose a few family members over the years \u2014 the strains of the covid pandemic, raising kids, finding a direction in life, and the importance of a good hot tub.\n\nMuch of the story is set in the 2020s, but there are copious flashbacks and the occasional flash forward that help illuminate what\u2019s really going on. An episode about Shira trying to learn how to cook her mother\u2019s old knish recipe starts with the story of how her and Kendra first met \u2014 and bonded over the fact that Shira is a terrible cook. But that seemingly unrelated opening scene makes it clear why cooking the meal is so challenging, while other glimpses at Shira\u2019s childhood, and her mother\u2019s constant criticism, also make it clear why it\u2019s so important to get right.\n\nSometimes the time skips are used to devastating effect. The first episode has Avi bringing Jen home to meet his family at just about the busiest possible time \u2014 his little brother\u2019s bar mitzvah \u2014 and you\u2019re able to see the young couple bond over the stress the trip creates. The episode then ends in the present, with a brief glance at Avi\u2019s current life, which made me desperate to learn what exactly went wrong in the ensuing years. Some of these revelations only really click a few episodes later, when various pieces from various time periods finally fit together in a really emotionally satisfying way. The shifting chronology allows the show to focus on the moments that matter most, and present them in the order that feels most impactful.\n\nLike any good sitcom, it tackles moments that are relatable and, frequently, heartbreaking, but it makes things more approachable through humor. Long Story Short may not have Mr. Peanut Butter or plotlines about bugs who like to party, but it does get pretty silly. There\u2019s an entire episode about a business that sells mattresses that explode out of plastic tubes, and there are gags about the work-life balance of a hostage negotiator, a children\u2019s restaurant called BJ Banana Fingers, and a school taken over by wolves during the pandemic. Like in BoJack, the payoff for many of the best jokes happens after an extended period. My favorite involves a throwaway mention of a dad obsessed with how much sunscreen his kid wears, which then becomes a laugh-out-loud moment when you finally see why he\u2019s so paranoid.\n\nWe\u2019re living in a pretty great time for adult animation, with series like Common Side Effects and Carol and the End of the World using the format to mix humor and real-world drama in potent ways. BoJack was a big part of this current moment, and Long Story Short is a clever continuation of many of its ideas, using them to tell a very different kind of story. Long Story Short is warmer and more familiar \u2014 it\u2019s about a family, after all, instead of a depressed Hollywoo celebrity \u2014 but still isn\u2019t afraid to get dark and serious. And its ambitious, shifting structure heightens each aspect, from the laughs to the tears.",

      "text": "In Adult Swim\u2019s Common Side Effects from Joe Bennett (Scavengers Reign) and Steve Hely (American Dad!), the discovery of a strange mushroom that can heal any sickness or injury is either a miracle or a doomsday scenario, depending on who you ask. The plant is a godsend to people suffering from debilitating illnesses, but its curative properties make it an existential threat to powerful pharmaceutical companies. And while all Marshall Cuso (Dave King), the show\u2019s hero, wants to do with his fungus is help people in need, that\u2019s enough to make the American Drug Enforcement Administration label him as a menace to society.\nCommon Side Effects\u2019 creators see the US healthcare system as the show\u2019s villain\nJoe Bennett and Steve Hely know their new Adult Swim animated series has its finger on the pulse.\nCommon Side Effects\u2019 creators see the US healthcare system as the show\u2019s villain\nJoe Bennett and Steve Hely know their new Adult Swim animated series has its finger on the pulse.\nImminent danger is always right around the corner as Marshall goes on the run in hopes of finding a way to spread his mushrooms far and wide. Often, he feels like the show\u2019s only character who has a conscience and wants to do good in the world. But when I recently spoke with Bennett and Hely, they explained that even though the people around Marshall might seem terrible, the show\u2019s true villain is the (American) healthcare system they have all been forced to live within.\nMarshall knows that he can\u2019t really relax or trust anyone (aside from his pet tortoise) as he sets out looking for a place where he can cultivate his mushrooms in peace. Whenever he slows down to rest, it\u2019s never long before mysterious men with itchy trigger fingers show up ready to shoot him in cold blood. And after he makes a scene at a conference being held by Reutical Pharmaceuticals, he becomes a high-profile target DEA agents Copano (Joseph Lee Anderson) and Harrington (Martha Kelly) suspect of being connected to multiple murders.\nThough Common Side Effects leads with Marshall\u2019s altruism, Bennett and Hely also wanted to infuse him with the kind of fringe-y, antiestablishment energy that makes it easy for people like him to be seen as \u201ca little unhinged and a bit feral.\u201d\nFor the core of Marshall\u2019s character, the pair drew inspiration from controversial figures like real-world mycologist Paul Stamets and ethnobotanists Terence McKenna, Wade Davis, and Richard Evans Schultes. But like all of Common Side Effects\u2019 characters, Marshall is also meant to feel like a regular person, which is why it was important for his guilelessness to shine through.\n\u201cAnything that feels is part of a greedy agenda or selfish endeavor, Marshall is just like, \u2018fuck you; I don\u2019t want to be a part of it,\u2019\u201d Bennett said. \u201cBut his naivete is really a definitive part of who he is. He\u2019s very smart and confident, but he doesn\u2019t always quite understand what he\u2019s getting himself into.\u201d\nThe same can\u2019t be said of Marshall\u2019s old high school lab partner Frances Applewhite (Emily Pendergast), who unexpectedly reconnects with him for the first time in years early into the series. As the overworked assistant to Reutical\u2019s CEO Rick Kruger (Mike Judge), Frances can immediately see both the unbelievable potential of Marshall\u2019s discovery and the danger her friend has put himself into daring to speak up about it.\nWith Reutical facing so many lawsuits for its other drugs, Rick doesn\u2019t exactly have the time or desire to pay attention to what\u2019s going on in the lives of the people who have made him a wealthy man. But despite Rick\u2019s position of power, Bennett and Hely didn\u2019t want to frame him as an outright villain.\n\u201cEven though [Rick] works for the big company that\u2019s trying to make a profit, he\u2019s sort of trapped by the system the same way everybody else is,\u201d Hely explained. \u201cSome of the incentives driving him are also boxing him in, and they\u2019re the same kind of things that everyone has to deal with. In his case, it\u2019s all just on a much wilder scale.\u201d\nFew of Common Side Effects\u2019 characters have as much privilege (or as large of paychecks) as the head of a pharmaceutical company, but they all see themselves as people who are truly trying to make the world a better place. Bennett and Hely spoke with retired DEA agents about their work to get a better sense of how they could depict the war on drugs from within. To viewers, agents like Copano and Harrington might just seem like narcs looking to shake their fellow citizens down with impunity.\n\u201cBut from their perspective, the dealers selling drugs like fentanyl are the most evil people in the world,\u201d Hely recounted. \u201cThey see themselves as patriots who are fighting what they think is the good fight \u2014 all while being under-resourced, understaffed, and endangered.\u201d\nBennett and Hely were loath to frame any singular character chasing Marshall as a villain because, in their minds, Common Side Effects is a series about how they\u2019re all locked inside of a capitalist system that is violent and dehumanizing by design.\n\u201cWhen you have a company that\u2019s motivated by making money and increasing shareholder profit, of course it\u2019s going to lead to these cruel, twisted effects that ultimately hurt people,\u201d Hely said. \u201cAll of it is dark, strange, and paradoxical. I don\u2019t think it is any one person\u2019s fault that we live in a system like this, but it is our reality, and we wanted the show to reflect that.\u201d\nCommon Side Effects takes an interesting turn as news about Marshall starts to spread and he becomes something of a mythic folk hero. That arc was always part of Bennett and Hely\u2019s vision for the series. But the story\u2019s parallels to the way the world became fixated on Luigi Mangione after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed late last year gave Adult Swim some literal pause.\nNews about the shooting broke the very same day a press release about the series was meant to hit the internet. Adult Swim planned to hold it for almost a week, but that ended up being the same day Mangione was apprehended by authorities.\nWhen I asked Bennett and Hely about the conversations they had regarding how Common Side Effects would play in the wake of recent events, they stressed that they wanted to be sensitive to the reality of how shocking someone getting shot on the street is. But they also felt that the coincidence is a testament to their series tapping into something that a lot of people are going to understand.\n\u201cI think the event speaks to some of the ideas we\u2019re unpacking in the series about how healthcare has become a business, what happens when there\u2019s a profit motive that drives wellness,\u201d Hely said. \u201cThose are themes of the show, and I think that the timing of it all really speaks to the fact that we\u2019re touching on a rail of American life that\u2019s speaking to a lot of people.\u201d\nCommon Side Effects premieres on Adult Swim on February 2nd."

      "text": "The idea of the world ending usually channels excess: humanity running wild because, well, what does it matter anymore? And there\u2019s some of that in Carol & the End of the World, a new animated series on Netflix. But mostly it\u2019s a story about a quiet forty-something woman who uses the impending destruction of the Earth as a chance for self-reflection and discovery. While everyone else is base jumping and traveling the world, Carol slowly finds joy in the mundanity of everyday life. The show is strange yet comforting \u2014 and might just be an ideally meditative way to end the year.\nNetflix\u2019s Carol and the End of World is a heartwarming view of the end times\nIt\u2019s the end of the world as we know it, and Carol feels fine.\nIt\u2019s the end of the world as we know it, and Carol feels fine.\nCreated by Dan Guterman (Community, Rick & Morty), Carol & the End of the World is centered on Carol (Martha Kelly) who is about the most unassuming person imaginable. She\u2019s calm and quiet, rarely talks about herself (much to the frustration of her gregarious sister), and her interests include collecting ceramic mice, listening to Whitney Houston, and going to Applebee\u2019s. So when a destructive planet comes hurtling toward Earth and everyone is given just a few months to live, she doesn\u2019t quite know what to do with herself.\nThe rest of the world seems intent on living their best lives. Carol\u2019s parents become a throuple with their handsome caregiver, and there are hang gliders and nudists everywhere you look. Carol, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t change much. She stays stuck in a routine that\u2019s only mildly disrupted by the whole apocalypse thing. At one point, she lies about learning to surf just to sound more interesting. But early on in the story, she stumbles across a secret that\u2019s both alluring and mysterious: an accounting office that is somehow still running, even though money is useless and no one needs a job anymore. Naturally, she starts working there the next day.\nWhat follows is more than a pre-apocalyptic version of The Office. Carol is able to slowly discover herself and her ideal life at this cubicle farm, known solely as The Distraction. It\u2019s not even clear what they\u2019re doing all day long (it calls to mind the \u201cmysterious and important\u201d number-crunching that goes down in Severance). She makes friends, builds a sense of self-worth, and even becomes a surprisingly disruptive force for the management.\nThis premise \u2014 coupled with Kelly\u2019s deadpan delivery \u2014 has the potential to be dull. But Carol gets around this in a few ways. For one thing, it\u2019s constantly shifting tone and style. Across its 10 episodes, there\u2019s a long road trip with a father and son, a heist on a cruise ship, and a short film about surfing. One episode turns a search through the office\u2019s lost and found into a collection of beautiful short stories about each object, and another intersperses footage of a hike with bittersweet memories recorded on an old VHS tape.\nReally, what the show does is use the end of the world as an excuse to explore the stories of people going through critical moments of self-discovery. Carol is at the core of this, of course, but the series treats pretty much every character, even the small roles that seem like one-off jokes, with respect and heart. Everyone from the Somali pirates looking for a chance to finally unwind to a Russian cleaning lady who can\u2019t seem to do anything else are given full satisfying arcs with a surprising amount of depth and care. There\u2019s joy and heartbreak and everything in between. Also a lot of nudity.\nCarol does raise a lot of questions, like how the trains and electricity keep running when no one works, as well as what, exactly, The Distraction is really doing. And often it can be hard to tell what\u2019s reality and what\u2019s fantasy. But ultimately that stuff doesn\u2019t matter much. This is a collection of stories about people, how different they can be, and all of the forms that happiness can take. It just so happens to take place with a giant planet looming in the sky \u2014 and the tragic irony that even if you find it, that happiness won\u2019t last long.\nCarol & the End of the World is streaming on Netflix now."
