  "description": "Former Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown faces criticism for late tax payments and luxury PAC spending as he considers a bid for re-election after being ousted by MAGA opponent in 2024.",
  "content": "FIRST ON FOX: Former Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who has long promoted fiscal responsibility and supported tax hikes on families and small businesses, failed to pay a $50,000 tax bill on time while spending nearly $500,000 on consultants and luxury perks, including lodging at a Los Angeles hotel and New York City catering.In March 2025, after he was ousted from the Senate by a pro-MAGA candidate, current Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, last November, Brown converted his \"Friends of Sherrod Brown\" campaign fundraising account into a political action committee called Dignity of Work PAC. Following the move, a spokesperson for the Columbus-area Democrat told local Ohio media that, despite the fiscal changes, Brown was not ruling out a re-election bid.     Meanwhile, during the first half of 2025, Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show Brown's Dignity of Work PAC spent lavishly on hotels in D.C., San Francisco and on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, including one establishment where the cheapest rooms went for around $600 per night. Spending from the PAC also included thousands for catering services around the country, such as nearly $6,000 to an Ohio whiskey distillery. The PAC also spent thousands of dollars on catering in D.C. and New York City.At the same time, the Dignity of Work PAC spent hundreds-of-thousands of dollars on expenses that could be used for re-election purposes.SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE FEVERISHLY RECRUITING TOP CANDIDATES TO WIN BACK MAJORITY IN 2026 MIDTERMS According to a representative for the PAC, the $50,000 tax bill incurred during this period, which includes taxes owed to both the District of Columbia and the federal government, while late, was eventually paid in full by July \u2013 after the mid-year reporting period ended. The representative said the now-paid-for debt would be reflected in its year-end filing with the FEC.\"Sherrod Brown has spent decades advocating for the rich to pay more in taxes yet failed to pay his organization\u2019s taxes on time \u2013 all while spending lavishly at luxury hotels in major cities,\" said Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of conservative nonprofit Americans for Public Trust. \"This is the exact type of hypocrisy that everyday Americans are sick of. Ordinary taxpayers would face serious consequences for a missed tax payment, but limousine liberals like Sherrod Brown expect to skate by.\"The former Ohio senator's recent delinquency would not be the first time he has been late to pay his taxes.GOP MOCKS DEMOCRATS WITH MEMO ABOUT WILDLY UNPOPULAR \u2018PROJECT 2026\u2019 GOALS, DEMS SHOOTBACK  In 2023, NBC News reported that Brown was late on property tax payments for his Cleveland home at least seven times. Brown also reportedly improperly claimed an owner-occupancy tax credit on multiple properties, per public records.While running for re-election in 2012, Brown's Republican opponent, Josh Mandel, called the then-incumbent senator \"a serial delinquent when it comes to not paying his property taxes\" because he \"failed to pay his own taxes three separate times.\" The claim was subsequently investigated by liberal-leaning fact-checker PolitiFact and was determined to be \"true.\"\"The irony is not lost on us that Sherrod Brown, who\u2019s only ever held a taxpayer-funded job and who voted repeatedly to raise taxes on Ohio families, has all along refused to pay his own tax bill,\" Chris Gustafson, communications director for Senate Republicans' main campaign fundraising arm, the Senate Leadership Fund, told Fox News Digital. Election finance experts Fox News Digital spoke with surmised that while Brown's late payment may look bad, it does not necessarily appear to present any sort of campaign finance violation.  \"I don\u2019t necessarily see a violation of campaign finance rules although this is certainly evidence of financial mismanagement and luxury spending that, if I were a donor, would upset me,\" Hans von Spakovsky, former commissioner of the FEC, said.However, one expert did suggest that if the 527 organization's income or assets were being used for the personal benefit of insiders, it could be a legal issue.\"They can't be just lavishing, you know, a super lifestyle on somebody,\" said James Bopp Jr., a campaign finance attorney in Indiana who has sued the FEC multiple times. \"Even though the event may be something he could go to, and get reasonable reimbursement for his expenses for going there, it's not to subsidize a lavish lifestyle. And that's personal inurement. So there is a legal issue on the reasonableness of the expenses.\"Brown, who, while previously in Congress, voted against major tax-cut legislation and in favor of a Clinton-era budget that included tax increases, was reported this week as planning a run to regain his spot in the U.S. Senate after losing to Moreno by roughly four percentage points.As a senator, Brown also slammed Republicans for fiscal mismanagement and corruption.  \"This is a Republican Party that is intrinsically corrupt,\" Brown reportedly said in 2020. If selected as the Democratic Party's candidate, Brown's likely GOP opponent would be Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, who was appointed to fill Vice President JD Vance's seat after he left for the White House. A 2026 special election will decide who will serve out the remainder of Vance's term, which lasts until 2029.",

      "text": "Stand up for the facts!\nOur only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.\nI would like to contribute\nJosh Mandel ad claims Sherrod Brown failed to pay his taxes three times\nClaims and charges keep flying in the U.S. Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown and Republican Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel.\nMandel opened the final month of the campaign with a TV ad focused on Brown's tax lapses.\n\"Sherrod Brown caught not paying his taxes\" are the announcer's first words, and the same words are displayed onscreen.\nIn a news release accompanying the ad, Mandel calls Brown \"a serial delinquent when it comes to not paying his property taxes\" because he \"failed to pay his own taxes three separate times.\"\nMandel's campaign cited articles by The Plain Dealer and Associated Press as support for the claim.\nPolitiFact Ohio looked at those stories and others. We also reviewed records from the District of Columbia's Office of Tax and Revenue.\nThe stories, in February 2012, reported that Brown had paid a penalty fee and interest a week earlier, after being four months late paying property tax on his Washington, D.C., apartment.\nBrown owed $922.04 in property taxes for the last half of 2011. The taxes were due by Sept. 26, according to the District property tax office. His delinquency added another $76.96 as a late penalty and $46.18 for interest.\nBrown also was delinquent in 2006 and 2007 and paid penalties and interest, according to tax records from the District. Before he paid the bill in 2007, his apartment was placed on a District of Columbia auction list for properties with taxes in arrears.\nThe delinquencies in 2006 and 2007 resulted in Brown paying a total of $735.07 in late charges and interest. Each of those original tax bills, excluding interest and fines, was for less than $900.\nBrown was asked about the delinquency during a conference call with reporters last February. He said, \"I was late. I misplaced the bill and I paid it as soon as I found out. I paid a penalty for being late, and it won't happen again.\"\nHe said he also had misplaced the earlier missed bills.\n\"This is a small apartment,\" he said. \"I'm not in D.C. nearly every week, I'm here when the Senate's in session, I'm here three or four nights a week. I paid the penalty. And in no way, obviously, was I avoiding taxes.\"\nBrown, who won his Senate seat in 2006 after serving seven terms in the House of Representatives, bought the one-bedroom apartment in 1993. He appeared to have paid the property taxes on time for a dozen years after that.\nHis primary residence is in Avon.\nMandel was accurate in saying that Brown failed to pay his taxes three separate times. Brown was late to pay. He did pay the taxes and penalty.\nThere is no indication he was trying to evade the tax, but that wasn\u2019t part of Mandel\u2019s claim, either.\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim in the Mandel campaign ad rates True.\nOur Sources\nMandel for Senate, news release, \"Sherrod Brown Voted to Raise Taxes and Raise His Pay \u2014 But Didn\u2019t Pay His Own Taxes Three Times,\" Oct. 2, 2012\nMandel for Senate, \"Serial Delinquent,\" Oct. 2, 2012\nThe Plain Dealer via Cleveland.com, \"Sen. Sherrod Brown was delinquent on taxes for his D.C. condo,\" Feb. 15, 2012\nAssociated Press via Akron Beacon Journal, \"Ohio\u2019s U.S. Sen.

      "text": "After losing his re-election bid in 2024, three-term Ohio Democratic senator Sherrod Brown will be launching a new bid next year to return to his position, according to a report.\nBrown's plans to run for Senate were shared with local media by three Ohio labor leaders who said that Brown had confided in them directly about the plans. Other Ohio Democrats also expressed to the outlet that they had heard of Brown's plan from members of his inner circle, and the reporting follows news that Brown has been interviewing campaign managers for his upcoming bid.\nBrown was ousted in 2024 by MAGA challenger and current freshman Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno, who came out victorious with 50.2% of the vote, compared to Brown's 46.4%.\nSENATE DEMOCRATS ARE FEVERISHLY RECRUITING TOP CANDIDATES TO WIN BACK MAJORITY IN 2026 MIDTERMS\nDespite the brushing defeat, Democratic Party Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, has reportedly lobbied Brown to run for months.\nIf selected as the Democratic Party's candidate, Brown's likely GOP opponent would be Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, who was appointed to fill Vice President J.D. Vance's seat after he left for the White House. A 2026 special election will decide who will serve out the remainder of Vance's term, which lasts until 2029.\n\"Should Brown enter the race as Schumer\u2019s handpicked candidate he will be starting in the biggest hole of his political career,\" said Tyson Shepard, spokesman for Husted's campaign.\n\"He has never faced a candidate like Jon Husted. Brown\u2019s slogans will ring hollow as his coalition walks away, tired of the radical policies he\u2019s forced to support to appease his coastal bosses in California and New York.\"\nBERNIE SANDERS ADDRESSES WHETHER HE\u2019LL RUN IN 2028\nOhio, often seen as a key battleground state, has been trending towards Republicans. In 2024, President Donald Trump won the state by more than 10 percentage points.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSince Brown left his position in the senate, he founded the Dignity of Work Institute, which says it is \"dedicated to the people who make this country work, and to creating an economy and a society where Americans\u2019 work is valued.\"\nBrown, nor his representatives, could be reached for comment."

Thom Tillis.\nDemocrats view the open Senate seat in the crucial southeastern battleground state as a top pick-up opportunity next year as they try to win back control of the Senate, which the Republicans currently hold with a 53-47 majority.\n\"It\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of getting Gov. Cooper to run for the Senate in North Carolina, and already we are seeing a potential for a ripple effect,\" longtime Democratic strategist Chris Moyer told Fox News Digital.\nTHIS REPUBLICAN JUST JUMPED INTO BATTLEGROUND GEORGIA'S HIGH-PROFILE SENATE RACE\nMoyer, a veteran campaign communicator, said that Cooper recruitment is \"giving more faith to potential candidates who are questioning whether there\u2019s a chance for a Democratic majority in the Senate next year.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) Chair Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, after landing Cooper, said he \"is a formidable candidate who will flip North Carolina\u2019s Senate seat.\"\nTop Democrats now have their eyes on former Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who lost last year's re-election bid in a onetime top swing state that's become reliably red over the past decade.\nWHAT A TOP POLITICAL HANDICAPPER SAID ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS' CHANCES TO WIN BACK SENATE IN 2026\nSchumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, trekked to Ohio this summer in hopes of convincing Brown to take on Republican Sen. Jon Husted, Fox News confirmed.\nBrown, who served over three decades in the House and later the Senate, is viewed by Democrats as the only candidate who could potentially topple Husted, who was named at the beginning of this year to fill the seat left vacant when then-Sen. JD Vance stepped down to become vice president.\nDemocrats landed the candidate they were hoping for in swing state New Hampshire in the race to succeed retiring longtime Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.\nFour-term Rep. Chris Pappas' announcement in early April that he would run to succeed Shaheen has cleared the Democratic primary field, as of now, of any potential rivals for the party's Senate nomination.\nMeanwhile, a Republican primary in the state \u2013 where the GOP hasn't won a Senate race in 15 years \u2013 is heating up between former Sen. Scott Brown and state Sen. Dan Innis, with the possibility of more candidates entering the race.\nIn battleground Georgia, which President Donald Trump narrowly carried in last year's White House race, Republicans view first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff as the most vulnerable Democrat incumbent up for re-election next year.\nBut Ossoff is off to a very hot fundraising start, and a GOP primary between Reps. Mike Collins and Buddy Carter, and former college and professional football coach Derek Dooley, is starting to turn combustible.\nOf potential concern for the Democrats is Michigan, where the dynamics appear to be the opposite of Georgia, in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Gary Peters.\nFormer Rep. Mike Rogers, the 2024 GOP Senate nominee who narrowly lost last year's race, appears to have cleared the Republican, thanks in great part to Trump's endorsement and likely arm twisting by the president's political team.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have a very competitive primary on their hands. The primary race includes three well-known Democrats: Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, and former gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed, who enjoys the backing of progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\nWhile Texas has long been a reliable red state, and conservative firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz comfortably won re-election last year, Democrats are optimistic about their 2026 chances to potentially flip a red seat to blue.\nThat's because longtime GOP Sen. John Cornyn is facing a serious primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a MAGA world rockstar.\nPaxton has long been surrounded by scandals, and is now dealing with a headline-grabbing divorce with his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxtom. And Democrats believe if Paxton topples Cornyn in next March's GOP primary, he'll be toxic in the general election.\nBut Democrats could have a competitive primary in Texas as well.\nFormer Rep. Colin Allred, who lost to Cruz last November, launched a second straight campaign earlier this year.\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who came close to ousting Cruz in the state's 20218 Senate election before unsuccessfully running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination and losing the 2022 Texas gubernatorial race to GOP Gov. Greg Abbott, is taking a hard look at a 2026 Senate run.\nState Rep. James Talarico, who grabbed national attention recently for his appearance with popular podcaster Joe Rogan, and Rep. Joaquin Castro, are also mulling bids.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDemocrats also feel they may have a shot in Iowa \u2013 a onetime swing state that's become firmly red in recent election cycles \u2013 if Republican Sen. Joni Ernst decides against seeking a third term in the Senate.\nBut they'll likely have a much better chance of flipping a GOP-held seat in blue state Maine if longtime Republican incumbent Sen. Susan Collins decides against seeking re-election."

It\u2019s all about you.\"\nRNC CHAIR SAYS 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' KEY PART OF GOP'S STRATEGY TO WIN SEATS IN MIDTERM ELECTIONS\nWith those 100 days having already elapsed, the NRCC published a satirical memo titled \"Project 2026,\" in which they accused the Democrats of being out of step with the American people.\n\"Hakeem Jeffries promised a \u2018Project 2026\u2019 within 100 days of April 30th, and it\u2019s been over 100 days. Democrats know their agenda is wildly unpopular, and their focus on these issues will cause them to lose yet again,\" the NRCC said in a statement.\nIn the memo, the NRCC accuses the Democratic Party, \"as directed by \u2018Leader\u2019 Jeffries and AOC,\" of wanting to \"move swiftly and unapologetically to return to Joe Biden\u2019s America and implement the bold, transformational change our base demands.\"\nThe memo lays out eight policy proposals they accuse Democrats of wanting to advance, ranging from \"Bring Back Wasteful Government Spending and High Crime\" to \"Open Borders. Full Stop\" to \"Impeach President Trump. Again. And Again.\"\nVANCE WARNS OF 'PENALTY' FOR DEMS WHO OPPOSED THE 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL, BILL' AHEAD OF 2026 MIDTERMS\nPolicy ideas the NRCC charges Democrats with advancing range from the outlandish, such as \"institute a federal \u2018Carbon Lifestyle Tax\u2019 on Americans who dare to own trucks, SUVs, or backyard grills, to ideas that have been pushed by the likes of New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani of launching \"pilot programs for government-run grocery stores in \u2018underserved\u2019 neighborhoods.\"\nUnder economic proposals, the memo charges Democrats of wanting to \"expand bloated government programs and bankroll the Green New Deal\" and reverse the tax cuts passed under President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the memo states Democrats want to \"abolish ICE permanently,\" \"ban border wall construction and tear down existing barriers\" and \"provide taxpayer-funded healthcare, housing, and legal aid for every undocumented immigrant.\"\nThe NRCC also takes a jab at Democrats for allegedly wanting to be \"More Woke, Less Rational,\" wanting to \"mandate pronouns and DEI training in every school and workplace\" and have \"no more ads featuring Sydney Sweeney or Shane Gillis.\"\nCommenting on the memo, NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella told Fox News Digital, \"This is the America Democrats want to build.\"\nZOHRAN MAMDANI IN POSITION TO HELP SOCIALIST PARTY 'SEIZE STATE POWER,' DSA LEADER ADMITS\n\"Higher taxes, open borders, skyrocketing gas prices, no more gas cars, crime in the streets, pronouns before commonsense, and no more freedom. House Republicans are the only thing standing between you and the nightmare of 'Project 2026,\u2019\" said Marinella.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn response, Viet Shelton, a spokesperson for the DCCC, shot back, commenting, \"Big talk by the party who\u2019s betrayed the middle-class so they can suck-up to their billionaire donors.\"\n\"The Republican agenda is marked by rising costs, lost manufacturing jobs, a Big, Ugly Law that everyone hates, and a string of broken promises,\" he said, adding, \"A tidal wave of recent polling confirms their majority is rapidly slipping away.\"\n\"It\u2019s no wonder House Republicans are desperately attempting to distract from their failed leadership and refusal to get a single thing done for the American people.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Jeffries office for comment but did not immediately receive a response."

      "text": "Senior Democratic Party officials vowed Monday to \"fight tooth and nail\" to keep in place federal campaign spending limits up for Supreme Court review this fall \u2014 describing the GOP-led effort to repeal the limits as unprecedented and dangerous ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nThe Supreme Court on Monday agreed to review the case, National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission, taking up a challenge filed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and on behalf of two Senate Republican candidates, including now-Vice President JD Vance, following the 2022 elections.\nIn a statement Monday, the Democratic campaign groups vowed to fight back against what they characterized as the GOP\u2019s attempt to \"sow chaos and fundamentally upend our campaign finance system, which would return us to the pre-Watergate era of campaign finance.\"\nSUPREME COURT TO HEAR REPUBLICAN CHALLENGE THAT COULD SHAKE UP US ELECTIONS\nAt issue are federal spending limits that restrict the amount of money political parties can spend on behalf of certain candidates \u2014 and which Republicans argue run afoul of free speech protections under the First Amendment of the Constitution.\nA decision from the Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority could have major implications on campaign spending in the U.S., further eroding the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, a law Congress passed more than 50 years ago with the aim of restricting the amount of money that can be spent on behalf of candidates.\nThat law, and subsequent amendments, restricts the amount of money that political parties can funnel into certain campaigns.\nSenior Democratic Party officials described the GOP-led effort Monday as the latest effort by Republicans to claw back campaign spending limits and erode some 50 years of federal election law.\n\"Republicans know their grassroots support is drying up across the country, and they want to drown out the will of the voters,\" DCCC chair Suzan DelBene, DSCC chair Kirsten Gillibrand, and DNC chair Ken Martin said in a joint statement Monday.\nThe case is almost certain to be one of the most high-profile cases heard by the Supreme Court this fall.\nAdding to the drama is the involvement of the Trump-led Justice Department, which said in May that it planned to side with the NRSC in the case \u2014 putting the Trump administration in the somewhat unusual position of arguing against a law passed by Congress.\nJUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA\nJustice Department officials cited free speech protections as its basis for siding with the NRSC, which they said represents \"the rare case that warrants an exception to that general approach\" of backing federal laws.\"\nMeanwhile, the Democratic groups sought to go on offense with their message, describing the GOP efforts as the latest iteration of a decades-long effort to \"rewrite\" election laws in ways that benefit the party. They cited another Republican-led challenge to campaign spending limits brought more than 20 years ago, in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC.\nThat challenge was ultimately rejected by the high court, DNC officials noted.\n\"To date, those efforts have failed at every turn, ensuring a stable, predictable campaign finance structure for party committees and political candidates across the country,\" DNC officials said.\nJUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA\nMeanwhile, Republican officials praised the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to take up the case, which they described as helping the GOP ensure they are in \"the strongest possible position\" ahead of the 2026 midterms and beyond.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The government should not restrict a party committee\u2019s support for its own candidates,\" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C. who chair the NRSC and NRCC, respectively, said Monday.\n\"These coordinated expenditure limits violate the First Amendment, and we appreciate the court\u2019s decision to hear our case,\" they added."

      "text": "CLEVELAND \u2014 Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, for years claimed an owner-occupancy tax credit at two properties, public records show \u2014 a potential violation of the state\u2019s rules governing such incentives.\nBrown and his wife, journalist Connie Schultz, also were late paying the tax bill on their Cleveland house at least seven times since purchasing it in 2013, missing a payment deadline as recently as February, according to documents kept by the Cuyahoga County treasurer. At one point in 2015, the county labeled them as delinquent after they failed for months to pay a nearly $1,200 bill.\nResponding to questions from NBC News, Brown and Schultz this week paid a $390 penalty stemming from their most recent late payment. Brown also repaid Franklin County, where he owns a condo in Columbus, for occupancy credits he should not have received, his campaign manager, Rachel Petri, said Wednesday. She did not say what caused the errors.\n\u201cThey made a mistake, have taken care of it, and paid Franklin County,\u201d Petri said.\nBrown will no longer accept the owner-occupancy credit on the Columbus property, according to his campaign. Jennifer Lockrey, a spokesperson for the Franklin County auditor, confirmed that the credit has been removed. The county's treasurer, Cheryl Brooks Sullivan, confirmed that a $616 payment was made Tuesday.\nLockrey noted that sometimes such errors are attributable to paperwork done by title companies.\n\"It\u2019s not an unusual occurrence for owners of more than one property,\" Lockrey said.\nThe tax issues come to light as Brown, who chairs the Senate\u2019s Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, prepares for a tough re-election bid in 2024. And they echo stories that have dogged his past campaigns. In 2012, The Plain Dealer of Cleveland reported on tax delinquencies involving a condo Brown owned in Washington, D.C.\n\u201cI misplaced the bill and I paid it as soon as I found out,\u201d Brown said at the time, according to the newspaper. \u201cI paid a penalty for being late, and it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nBrown\u2019s acceptance of the two 2.5% tax credits \u2014 which since 2019 had saved him more than $1,000 between the two properties \u2014 could have yielded scrutiny from local tax collectors unaware that he was receiving the benefit in two counties. The senator and Schultz have claimed the credit on their Cleveland home for a decade, records show. Brown had received the credit on his downstate Columbus condo since at least 2019, according to documents available online via the Franklin County treasurer.\nState and local officials, citing Ohio law and explicit requirements for eligibility, emphasized to NBC News that owner-occupancy tax credits are intended for only one property. To claim the credit twice, a married couple would have to demonstrate that they live separately.\nA spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Taxation pointed to several excerpts from state law when asked what consequences a couple could face if a county auditor or treasurer found that they had improperly claimed the tax credit at two properties. One section states that the property owners could be required to pay back what they weren\u2019t entitled to, plus interest.\nCuyahoga County records show that Brown and Schultz are both registered to vote at the Cleveland address, which serves as their primary residence. Schultz has written about how the couple, who previously lived in an upscale suburb, wanted to be part of the city\u2019s revival. During the housing crisis of the early 2000s, their zip code led the nation in foreclosures.\nAs for their late payments, publicly available copies of property tax bills for Brown and Schultz\u2019s Cleveland home show fees for missing deadlines on their 2022, 2021, 2019, 2018, 2015 and 2014 taxes. Two penalties related to their 2014 tax bill triggered the delinquency. All of those charges have since been settled, including the $390 fee paid Tuesday, said Mary Louise Madigan, a spokesperson for Cuyahoga County. Franklin County tax records available online show no late payments or penalties for Brown\u2019s Columbus condo \u2014 purchased in 2014 \u2014 over the last four years. Schultz is not listed as an owner on the tax bill for the Columbus property.\nU.S. senators are paid $174,000 a year. Brown, 70, a former Ohio secretary of state and state lawmaker who joined the Senate in 2007, also noted $26,000 in 2021 income from Ohio\u2019s state retirement fund in his most recent personal financial disclosure form. That document also listed $133,000 to $395,000 in joint assets against $200,000 to $500,000 in two mortgages identified as liabilities. The full scope of Schultz\u2019s income was not provided, but in 2021 she earned more than $5,000 in speaking and freelance writing fees in addition to book royalties and salaries from Kent State University and USA Today.\n\u201cEvery single Ohioan is expected to pay their taxes on time,\u201d said Philip Letsou, a spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, \u201cbut Sherrod Brown apparently thinks he\u2019s too important to pay his own.\u201d\nOhio schools are heavily reliant on property tax revenue, and late payments affect their accounting. A Cleveland schools official told The Plain Dealer in 2019 that the district draws up budgets on the expectation that it will collect 88% of what it\u2019s owed in a particular year.\nBrown\u2019s re-election battle is expected to be among the most expensive and competitive in the country next year as both parties jostle for control of the Senate.\nOhio, once a closely fought battleground, has trended more Republican over Brown\u2019s time in office. He\u2019s the only Democrat who has consistently won statewide elections, but is likely to face a strong and well-funded challenge. The GOP primary to take on Brown already features wealthy candidates such as state Sen. Matt Dolan and Cleveland-area businessman Bernie Moreno. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and U.S. Rep. Warren Davidson are considering bids, as well."

Despite his history of tax delinquencies, including multiple late payments on his Cleveland home, Brown is reportedly planning a re-election bid after losing his Senate seat in 2024. The situation has drawn ire from Republican opponents, who highlight the perceived hypocrisy in Brown's financial management compared to his public stance on taxation.",
