  "description": "The moderate Democrat's support for closing the Great Highway ignited a wave of backlash from his constituents.",
  "content": "Over 50,000 voters in District 4 are set to receive ballots for the Sept. 16 special election to recall Supervisor Joel Engardio.\n\nWhy it matters: The moderate Democrat's support for closing the Great Highway ignited a wave of backlash from his constituents, a majority of whom opposed the initiative over concerns about traffic and longer commutes.\n\nHow it works: The ballot will ask voters to vote \"yes\" or \"no\" on whether to remove Engardio from office.\n\nOnce filled out , voters can return them via mail or drop them off at City Hall's elections department office. Three official ballot drop boxes will also be stationed at the Ortega Branch Library, Parkside Branch Library and City Hall.\n\nIf voters oppose the measure, Engardio will remain in office and fight to retain his seat when he's up for reelection in November 2026.\n\nIf they approve it, Mayor Daniel Lurie will appoint a replacement to serve until the June 2026 primary, which will ask voters to decide who should fill the remainder of the term.\n\nThe big picture: Engardio was put on blast after he championed Proposition K, which would convert a 2-mile stretch of the Great Highway into a park, in the lead-up to the November 2024 election.\n\nThough the measure passed with 55% of voters' approval citywide, only 36% of voters in District 4 agreed with Engardio.\n\nA recall campaign was launched shortly amid rebuke from voters in the Sunset and Richmond districts.\n\nThe Department Elections called for a special election in May after certifying the 9,911 signatures \u2014 20% of the district's registered voters \u2014  needed to put it on the ballot.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"District 4 voted against Prop K \u2014 overwhelmingly. If Joel Engardio didn't know that was going to happen \u2014 he was out of touch, not listening, not talking to us or he deliberately defied our will,\" the recall campaign's website states.\n\nSupporters include the Chinese American Democratic Club and the San Francisco Republican Party , as well as retired judges Quentin Kopp, Lillian Sing and Julie Tang, according to the San Francisco Standard .\n\nThe other side: \"Prop. K was decided by voters in the most open, transparent, and democratic process possible,\" Engardio said at a Wednesday San Francisco Democratic County Central Committee endorsement hearing for Prop. A .\n\n\"Sunset Dunes has become one of the most visited parks in San Francisco, so let's turn our focus on more pressing matters facing our city and nation.\"\n\nEngardio is backed by the San Francisco Police Officers Association, environmental advocacy group Sierra Club, San Francisco YIMBY and multiple local elected officials.",
