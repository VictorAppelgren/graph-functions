      "summary": "Indian state and federal ministers will convene for two days to decide on the largest Goods and Services Tax cuts in eight years, aiming to boost domestic consumption amid U.S. tariff pressures. The plan would lower the GST on over 400 items to a two‑rate structure of 5% and 18%, with higher rates for luxury goods, and is expected to cost about $21 billion in revenue. The cuts are intended to support sectors such as FMCG, consumer electronics, and automakers, while states face potential revenue shortfalls that may spark debate on compensation mechanisms.",
