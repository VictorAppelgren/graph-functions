  "description": "In today\u2019s polarized, online-first world, company leaders should approach rebranding not just as a creative endeavor, but as a reputational event.",
  "content": "Jim Heininger is the founder of Rebranding Experts, the only firm purposefully designed to rebrand organizations successfully.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently blasted Jaguar for its 2024 rebranding, accusing the luxury automaker of going \u201cwoke\u201d by using a provocative video to modernize its name and visual identity.\n\nBut from my point of view, Jaguar's move\u2014to shake up the industry to launch a line of EVs\u2014was rooted in the standard marketing strategy of differentiation.\n\nJaguar is just the latest brand to find itself under fire, not for poor design or business missteps, but for the mere act of changing and how it visually displays that move.\n\nWelcome to the new reality of rebranding.\n\nIn a time when every move can become a cultural flashpoint, companies undergoing a rebrand must expect detractors. Whether those detractors are loyal customers mourning the loss of the familiar, or public figures voicing outrage, rebranding backlash is usually not a question of \u201cif\u201d\u2014but \u201cwhen.\u201d The key is how well you\u2019re prepared.\n\nThe New Risk Landscape For Rebranding\n\nToday\u2019s knee-jerk, criticizing environment can be unforgiving. The moment you reveal your new name, logo or brand identity, it\u2019s subjected to instant judgment\u2014and not just by your target customers. Social media users, cable news personalities, influencers, political figures and leaders of interest groups all have various platforms to voice their disapproval. Their disapproval, in my view, is often disconnected from the strategy behind the change and is rooted in an effort to raise their own visibility.\n\nDetractors may accuse your company of:\n\nIn the case of Jaguar, I observed, many critics didn\u2019t evaluate the business rationale\u2014instead, they saw a brand modernizing and seized the opportunity to push forward their vantage points. Regardless of whether your company leans into cultural conversations, others may do it for you.\n\nThat\u2019s why rebranding today isn\u2019t just a marketing function. It\u2019s a reputational exercise that requires careful risk assessment, stakeholder management and message control.\n\nBrands That Took The Hits\n\nPlenty of companies have experienced rebranding backlash\u2014some anticipated, others not. Here are a few notable examples:\n\u2022 BP (2000): British Petroleum unveiled a new slogan, \u201cBeyond Petroleum,\u201d and adopted a green and yellow sunburst logo to reflect a greener future. From my observations during that time period, much of the public didn\u2019t buy it\u2014especially after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The disconnect between brand and behavior made BP a case study in corporate hypocrisy.\n\u2022 Twitter to X (2023): Elon Musk\u2019s abrupt rebranding of Twitter to \u201cX\u201d baffled many users and erased decades of brand equity. The transition, in my view, felt chaotic, with little context or emotional preparation for users.\n\u2022 Weight Watchers to WW (2018): The weight-loss company rebranded to focus on \u201cwellness,\u201d but the move confused people who didn\u2019t know what WW stood for.\n\nThese brands failed to communicate the value of the changes they made.\n\nHow To Prepare For Rebranding Detractors\n\nMy team and I often tell clients, \u201cRebranding is change.\u201d That includes anticipating who will resist the change\u2014and why.\n\nChange management is a requirement in successful rebranding. Here\u2019s how to devise a plan for pushback before it derails your success.\n\nTake time to map out your stakeholder universe:\n\u2022 Are there vocal online communities or legacy customers tied to the old brand?\n\u2022 Are there political groups or public figures likely to misinterpret the change?\n\u2022 Are employees or channel partners at risk of feeling alienated?\n\nA simple risk-mapping exercise during the planning phase can help you predict and prepare.\n\nMake sure your new brand is backed by a clear business case and market rationale. Be ready to articulate:\n\u2022 Why the rebrand was necessary\n\u2022 What customer needs it addresses\n\u2022 How it positions your company for future growth\n\nIf your team can\u2019t explain the \u201cwhy,\u201d your customers won\u2019t understand\u2014or empathize with\u2014your decision.\n\n3. Get Ahead Of The Narrative\n\nDon\u2019t wait for the media\u2014or your critics\u2014to define the story. Own it by:\n\u2022 Creating shareable content (such as videos, FAQs and internal talking points) to explain the shift\n\u2022 Training leaders and employees to be brand ambassadors who reinforce the change positively and consistently\n\nLogic, I\u2019ve found, rarely wins over sentiment. People can form strong emotional attachments to logos, names and traditions. Acknowledge the loss\u2014especially if your brand is a legacy one\u2014by:\n\u2022 Celebrating the past before introducing the future\n\u2022 Offering forums (in-person or online) for people to react, vent and ask questions\n\nHave messaging and communications tools ready if the rebrand becomes politicized or misrepresented. Specifically, I recommend:\n\u2022 Preparing a statement clarifying the intent of the rebrand\n\u2022 Gaining internal alignment on who speaks for the brand and how\n\u2022 Aligning allies in advance of your announcement so they can share support\n\nDon\u2019t expect the conversation to stop on launch day. Keep a pulse on:\n\nBe prepared to refine your messaging, reeducate or even adjust course if backlash threatens brand trust. Don\u2019t sit back and take an uncalled-for beating. Defend your new brand and decisions.\n\nRebranding is an act of bold leadership. But bold doesn\u2019t mean reckless. In today\u2019s polarized, online-first world, company leaders should approach rebranding not just as a creative endeavor, but as a reputational event. The more proactive you are in managing risk, the stronger and smoother your transition will be.\n\nBecause, yes, there will be critics. The key is making sure they don\u2019t control the story\u2014you do.\n\nis an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies.",

Why the ad stirred discourse\n- Former President Trump criticized Jaguar's \"woke\" 2024 ad campaign after its CEO announced his resignation.\n- The ad, titled \"Copy Nothing,\" featured models in bright, androgynous clothing and did not include any vehicles.\n- Jaguar defended the rebranding as a \"bold and imaginative reinvention\" and a \"dramatic leap forward.\"\nPresident Donald Trump wasted no time taunting the British luxury car maker Jaguar after the company announced its CEO would be stepping down following a controversial rebranding last year seen as \u201cwoke.\u201d\u201cWho wants to buy a Jaguar after looking at that disgraceful ad?\u201d the president wrote on his social media platform on Monday, Aug. 4.\nJaguar Land Rover did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCEO Adrian Mardell, who spent three decades at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and served as chief executive over the last three years, announced he will step down in November and will be succeeded by P.B. Balaji. The company announced the switch-up in a release on Thursday, July 31.\n\u201cThese three years have been a great privilege,\u201d Mardell said in a written statement. \u201cTogether with the incredible JLR workforce, we have cemented JLR\u2019s position in the automotive industry during a time of incredible change.\u201d\nWhy was the ad controversial?\nIn November 2024, the company released a head-turning ad entitled \u201cCopy Nothing.\u201d The 30-second ad did not feature a car, but instead had models dressed in bright, androgynous attire.\nSome of the slogans the company used as part of the advertisement included \u201ccreate exuberant,\u201d \u201clive vivid,\u201d \u201cdelete ordinary,\u201d and \u201cbreak moulds,\u201d using the British spelling.\nThe advertisement went viral on social media immediately, generating tens of millions of views and thousands of social media comments within 24 hours.\nSeveral Jaguar customers said they were caught off guard by the advertisement.\n\u201cThis just made me want to sell my Jaguar and I don\u2019t even own a Jaguar,\u201d tweeted conservative corporate activist Robby Starbuck at the time.\nIn a statement defending its rebranding, the company said: \u201cOur brand relaunch for Jaguar is a bold and imaginative reinvention and, as expected, it has attracted attention and debate.\n\u201cAs proud custodians at such a remarkable point in Jaguar\u2019s history, we have preserved iconic symbols while taking a dramatic leap forward. The brand reveal is only the first step in this exciting new era.\u201d\nWhat did the president say?\nTrump had his own opinions about the ad, which he shared on Monday, Aug. 4.\n\u201cJaguar did a stupid, and seriously WOKE advertisement, THAT IS A TOTAL DISASTER! The CEO just resigned in disgrace, and the company is in absolute turmoil,\u201d wrote Trump in a Truth Social post, in which he also said Actress Sydney Sweeney, who is reported to be a registered Republican, has the \u201cHOTTEST\u201d ad out there.\nThe president was referring to Sweeney\u2019s American Eagle jeans ad, which has come under fire for supporting eugenics because of its wordplay using \u201cjeans\u201d and \u201cgenes.\u201d\nIn the advertisement, dubbed \u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,\u201d the actress tells the camera, \u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.\u201d\nThen a banner with the words \u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u201d pops up. Those opposed to the ad say the company used a blonde, blue-eyed, white woman as a symbol of good genes.\nFollowing Trump\u2019s comments, American Eagle\u2019s stock jumped 23 percent.\nMichelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "It\u2019s rare for corporate brands to become so intertwined with everyday conversation that they become verbs. It\u2019s rarer still for the owner of such a brand to announce plans to intentionally destroy it.\nOn Sunday, in the middle of a quiet summer weekend, Elon Musk decreed that Twitter\u2019s product name would be changed to \u201cX,\u201d and that he is getting rid of the bird logo and all the associated words, including \u201ctweet.\u201d Musk\u2019s move wiped out anywhere between $4 billion and $20 billion in value, according to analysts and brand agencies.\nRead More: Elon Musk Rebranded Twitter as \u2018X.\u2019 Users Immediately Rejected the Change\nMore from TIME\n\u201cIt took 15-plus years to earn that much equity worldwide, so losing Twitter as a brand name is a significant financial hit,\u201d said Steve Susi, director of brand communication at Siegel & Gale.\nMusk, whose company has already declined significantly in value since he purchased it for $44 billion in October, announced the change on Saturday night. By Monday morning a new black \u201cX\u201d logo, designed by a fan over the weekend, began to appear across the site. New Chief Executive Officer Linda Yaccarino outlined the company\u2019s vision for X to become a site for audio, video, messaging, payments and banking.\nAnalysts and brand agencies call the product\u2019s renaming a mistake. Twitter is one of the most recognizable social media brands, said Todd Irwin, founder of brand agency Fazer. Bird decals adorn small businesses and websites worldwide, alongside Instagram and Facebook logos.\nTwitter\u2019s popularity has also made verbs like \u201ctweet\u201d and \u201cretweet\u201d part of modern culture, used regularly to explain how celebrities, politicians and others communicated with the public, said Joshua White, assistant professor of finance at Vanderbilt University.\nX will require the company to rebuild that cultural pull and linguistic consensus from scratch. But that may be part of the motivation, so users stop comparing Twitter post-takeover to what it was before. \u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally rare thing \u2014 in life or in business \u2014 that you get a second chance to make another big impression,\u201d Yaccarino tweeted.\nRead More: The 7 Biggest Challenges Twitter\u2019s New CEO Faces\nOther tech companies have renamed themselves in recent years. Google turned into Alphabet Inc. to allow different businesses within the company to grow without being tied to search. Facebook changed into Meta Platforms Inc. in order to emphasize the company\u2019s commitment to the metaverse. But the product names remained; we still google things by going to Google.\nThat\u2019s worth a lot. Twitter\u2019s brand value is estimated at about $4 billion, according to brand valuation consulting firm Brand Finance. The firm values the Facebook brand at $59 billion and Instagram at $47.4 billion. Vanderbilt University estimates Twitter\u2019s brand value at $15 billion to $20 billion, which is comparable to Snapchat.\nBrand valuation is difficult to determine, and there\u2019s no single approach, which is why estimates vary, said Dipanjan Chatterjee, an analyst with Forrester Research Inc. But several analysts and agencies agreed that the company\u2019s brand has already taken a significant hit since Musk\u2019s takeover. Brand Finance for example, estimates the Twitter brand lost 32% of its value since last year.\nAs the perception of Twitter\u2019s brand has changed, advertisers have fled. Advertisers were concerned about Musk\u2019s courting of controversy and embrace of tweeters who broke content rules. Advertising revenue at Twitter is down more than 50% since October, Musk has said.\n\u201cTwitter\u2019s corporate brand is already heavily intertwined with Musk\u2019s personal brand, with or without the name X, and much of Twitter\u2019s established brand equity has already been lost among users and advertisers,\u201d said Jasmine Enberg, an analyst with Insider Intelligence.\nIt\u2019s \u201ccompletely irrational from a business and brand point of view,\u201d said Allen Adamson, co-founder of the marketing and brand consulting group Metaforce. He called it an \u201cego decision\u201d on the part of Musk. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s going to go down in history as one of the fastest unwinding of a business and brand ever.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also the risk to Musk\u2019s future goals. Building banking and payments into the app will require customer trust \u2014 something that\u2019s difficult to get with a brand-new product name. \u201cI just think that customers outside of Musk\u2019s sort of core fan base would really struggle to use Twitter to exchange their money,\u201d Vanderbilt\u2019s White said.\nOne thing working in Musk\u2019s favor: \u201cThe Elon brand,\u201d said Irwin. \u201cHis personal brand might be more powerful than the Twitter brand.\u201d\nMore Must-Reads from TIME\n- Cybersecurity Experts Are Sounding the Alarm on DOGE\n- Meet the 2025 Women of the Year\n- The Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion\n- Why Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\n- Colman Domingo Leads With Radical Love\n- How to Get Better at Doing Things Alone\n- Michelle Zauner Stares Down the Darkness\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "What's gone wrong at Weight Watchers?\nFor a business that now sees itself as being all about wellness and not just shedding pounds, the company formerly known as Weight Watchers looks like it has been on a crash diet.\nIn the second half of its financial year, it dropped 600,000 subscribers.\nAnd at the beginning of its peak season - when Christmas overindulgence morphs into New Year virtuousness - membership is well below forecasts.\nThe problem, it seems, is all in the name.\nAfter 56 years of trading as Weight Watchers, the company changed its name last September to WW, which, it says, doesn't stand for anything - not Weight Watchers, not even its new tagline \"Wellness that Works\".\nWhy did Weight Watchers change its name?\nThe intention, under new chief executive Mindy Grossman, was to modernise the brand amid a cultural shift to body positivity that now emphasises health and wellness as opposed to counting calories.\nBut Ms Grossman this week admitted to analysts - when the company missed full-year forecasts and warned on profits - that using the word \"weight\" in its marketing actually carried, well, more weight.\n\"I think it needed to be more weight-loss focused, especially in the January season,\" she said.\nShe added that it needed to be made clearer that Weight Watchers is now WW.\nYanhui Zhao, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, says that the rebranding of Weight Watchers to WW was \"a risky move\" in the first place.\n\"A rebranding project may lead to losses in brand awareness and brand familiarity.\n\"These risks were even bigger for WW, considering their almost 60-year brand history in the market. Firms should be especially cautious when abandoning a long-standing brand name.\"\nHow was the new brand received?\nNot even the motivational tones of Oprah Winfrey - a board member, strategic adviser and owner of an 8% stake in WW - could lift subscriber numbers and avoid the \u00a350m dent to operating profit in the first quarter following the name change.\nDespite introducing a voice over by Ms Winfrey to its advertising explaining that Weight Watchers is now WW, the company made a \"soft start\" to the year which, its chief financial officer Nick Hotchkin says, is \"difficult to recover from\".\nCamilla Butcher, strategist at branding company Siegel+Gale, questions whether the company should have changed the brand at all.\n\"The name, if anything, for any brand is really sometimes the most important asset. That is what a brand is when it really comes down to it, it can be name, the meaning and the feelings that are associated with that name.\"\nShe adds: \"I think that we live in such a fast-moving time... and there's nothing more shifting than the diet and weight loss category.\"\nWW boss Ms Grossman says the company is operating in a \"very competitive environment\", with trends such as the high-fat, low carb \"keto\" diet becoming popular.\nBut Ms Butcher says: \"By nature, it is a whole industry of fads and things that come and go, and Weight Watchers' absolute strength was the fact that they had stood the test of time.\"\nHow did shareholders react?\nShareholders, it appears, also weren't too sold on the name change when it was announced back in September.\nIn a study looking at the effects of rebranding on share price returns by University of Nebraska's Prof Zhao, in association with Prof Roger Calantone and Prof Clay Voorhees from Michigan State University, an examination of 215 announcements showed that on average, stocks rose 2.5%.\nBut the research also found that 40% of the rebranding announcements were associated with negative shareholder reactions.\nFor WW, Prof Zhao found that its share price fell 30% in the month after it said it was changing its name.\nWas WW right to change its strategy?\nWhile the name change may have puzzled some, the reasoning behind it makes sense.\nMs Butcher says: \"I think there are very valid conversations to be had about the term 'weight' and whether that is a helpful thing to be talking about any more.\"\nAlso, the image of the company needed refreshing, says Prof Zhao: \"Their previous brand image was outdated and was not appealing to millennials, males and many other demographics.\"\nIn order to address this, WW recruited singer Robbie Williams and Instagram star DJ Khaled as \"brand ambassadors\".\nHowever, it was not the idea, but its execution that has hurt WW.\n\"I just think it happened very quickly\u2026 the timing was probably a mistake,\" Brian Nagel, senior equity analyst at Oppenheimer told CNBC. \"They did this around October, November of last year, two months before the peak season.\"\nWW's peak first quarter season brings in about 40% of its annual recruits.\nWhile its total subscribers for 2018 rose by 22% on the previous year - helped by strong first half as it introduced its new WW Freestyle programme - recruitment numbers have fallen in the first quarter.\nRevenue for the first three months of the year will now be down by 10% and operating profit will drop by $50m compared to the same period last year.\nFor the full year, sales will now be $1.4bn, down from $1.5bn in 2018, and WW will no longer meet its $2bn annual revenue target by 2020.\nHow should have Weight Watchers changed its brand?\nProf Zhao says: \"Although rebranding was necessary for them, they probably shouldn't have acted so fast to change their brand name.\n\"They should have started with a revised brand strategy and updated brand offerings, and then started to made small changes to their brand identity, such as brand logo and tagline.\n\"Corporate name change should have been their very last step of rebranding.\"\nFor its part, WW is sticking with its new name.\nMs Grossman said: \"We believe [in] the most WW and Wellness that Works for the long-term relevance and performance as a brand is the right thing to do.\nShe added: \"We are not giving up our leadership in healthy weight loss.\""

      "text": "The health and wellness industry has evolved over the last several years, embracing an approach to diet that supports healthy, balanced living over cutting calories in order to lose weight. Attempting to keep up with the movement, the Oprah Winfrey-backed company Weight Watchers made a pretty big announcement on Monday: not only are they changing their brand name to WW, but they are also overhauling their product line to focus on healthy living. For a variety of reasons, the internet is finding the weight management company\u2019s rebranding tactic totally hilarious.\n\u201cToday we become WW. We\u2019re committed to always being the best weight management program on the planet,\u201d tweeted Mindy Grossman, CEO of Weight Watchers, on Monday about the name change. \u201cNow we\u2019re putting our decades of knowledge and expertise in behavioural science to work for a greater mission: going beyond weight to wellness for everybody.\u201d\nAccording to the BBC, she clarified that WW does not stand for Weight Watchers or one of its popular slogans, \u201cWellness that works.\u201d This left the internet confused (and understandably so) to say the least. It also spawned numerous hilarious tweets.\nWhile some point out that WW is pronounced \"double you, double you,\" probably not a good representation of the diet industry, others chided that it takes twice as many syllables to say.\nSome people just found the whole thing dumbfounding overall.\nAnd then there were those who felt that dropping the word \"weight\" was unnecessarily PC.\nAnd of course, a few just felt it didn't make sense, as the point system the brand is famous for is still being used, albeit a tad differently.\n\\\\\nAt least there is one person \u2014 who happens to be one of the most influential people in the world \u2014 supporting the name change on social media. Oprah Winfrey fully endorsed the \"new WW\" in an Instagram video showing her noshing on a breakfast of eggs with mushrooms (\"no points!\") and \"her favorite,\" toast with jam."

  "argos_summary": "Jaguar\u2019s 2024 \"Copy Nothing\" ad, featuring models in bright, androgynous attire and no vehicles, sparked widespread backlash and prompted President Donald Trump to denounce the campaign as \"woke\" and criticize the company\u2019s leadership, coinciding with CEO Adrian Mardell\u2019s announced resignation. Jaguar defended the rebrand as a bold, imaginative reinvention aimed at positioning the brand for future growth, while the article contextualizes the controversy within a broader discussion of rebranding risks, citing examples such as BP\u2019s green slogan, Twitter\u2019s shift to X, and Weight Watchers\u2019 name change. It also highlights the role of specialized firms like Rebranding Experts in navigating reputational, stakeholder, and communication challenges inherent in high\u2011profile brand transformations.
