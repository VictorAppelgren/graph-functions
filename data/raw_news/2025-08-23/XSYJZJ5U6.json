  "content": "These longtime market-beaters still have plenty of fuel in the growth engine.\n\nWhen a company's shares go on a run, it's reasonable to wonder whether they are still worth investing in. That's a question we can ask about Microsoft (MSFT 0.56%) and Shopify (SHOP 3.98%), two tech leaders that have been on a tear this year. The former is up 20% since January, while the latter has climbed 27%. Is there any upside left?\n\nIn my view, the answer is a resounding yes. Not only can both companies still deliver superior returns, but they also have many of the qualities required of \"forever stocks.\" Let's dig in.\n\nMicrosoft is firing on all cylinders. The company's revenue in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2025, which ended on June 30, increased 18% year over year to $76.4 billion. On the profitability front, earnings per share rose 24% year over year, to $3.65. To no one's surprise, the company's cloud division had a lot to do with this strong performance. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew significantly faster -- 39% versus 30% the same period last year.\n\nMicrosoft is increasingly gaining on its competitor in the cloud industry, namely Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which currently holds the spot. Furthermore, the numbers indicate that there is still significant room for growth for the company. Microsoft had $368 billion in contracted revenue on its books as of the end of the period, representing a 37% increase year over year.\n\nHad Microsoft not seized the cloud opportunity when it did, choosing instead to focus on its operating system (OS) offerings, it would be a different company today. Although there is nothing wrong with its legacy OS business, it has been supplanted as Microsoft's most important growth driver by cloud computing and artificial intelligence, two industries that are expected to maintain an upward momentum for a very long time.\n\nThat tells us several things about Microsoft: It is a well-run, innovative company with attractive growth prospects. Add the company's moat, derived from its brand name and switching costs, and Microsoft looks likely to continue offering competitive returns over the next five years and beyond. Lastly, Microsoft is a terrific dividend stock: Don't let its meager 0.7% forward yield fool you.\n\nMicrosoft generates significant amounts of cash flow, has ample funds to more than cover its annual dividend payments -- as evidenced by its conservative cash payout ratio of 33.6% -- and has increased its payouts by 130.6% over the past decade. Microsoft is a no-brainer for growth and dividend stocks that investors can park in their portfolios for the long term.\n\nShopify experienced a slump after reaching its all-time high in late 2021, which lasted approximately a year. Since 2023, the company has been on fire. Several changes to its business have allowed it to get back on track. Shopify increased its prices after more than a decade of not doing so. The company also got rid of its expensive logistics business. The result: Rebounding revenue growth, expanding margin, and the occasional net profit.\n\nShopify had most of those during the second quarter. Revenue increased 31% year over year to $2.7 billion, while its net income came in at $906 million, which was much better than the $171 million reported in the year-ago period. Shopify's free cash flow jumped by 26.7% to $422 million, while free cash flow margin remained flat at 16%.\n\nShopify should experience growing demand for its services over the long term as the e-commerce market continues to expand. The company has already established itself as a leader in its niche, helping merchants build online storefronts. Shopify's platform makes it easy for merchants to get started and offers a rich suite of services ideally adapted to the demands of modern commerce, so they can focus on running their businesses.\n\nThat's why Shopify's customer count has been growing at a good clip for a while, and it has grabbed more than 12% share of the U.S. e-commerce market by gross merchandise volume. Further, it also benefits from a moat thanks to switching costs and network effects. Shopify wants to be a 100-year company. This long journey has, so far, started well, and there should be plenty of upside for investors who stay the course. Shopify looks like an excellent forever stock.",

      "text": "Artificial intelligence uses machines -- generally, computers -- to mimic human intelligence. Although there are debates about its utility, AI has become common in applications that range from the creation of generative chatbots to the selections displayed in your Netflix queue. Read on to learn more about this rapidly growing field and what it might mean for your investment portfolio.\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\nOnce a staple of science fiction -- think, Frankenstein -- artificial intelligence, or AI, is commonly used by billions of people. Although there\u2019s no set definition, it\u2019s generally agreed that artificial intelligence is the use of computers to mimic human judgment. These days, it\u2019s used by almost every industry, often in ways that are too subtle to be noticed.\nCategories\nCategories of artificial intelligence\nThere are three basic categories of artificial intelligence:\n- Narrow AI: Artificial intelligence can be built for very specific tasks, such as playing a game, keeping spam out of your inbox, helping you find a nearby restaurant with your smartphone, or even driving your car.\n- General AI: With more resemblance to human capabilities, general artificial intelligence is a more advanced form that can involve visual and language processing, contextual understanding, and the ability to adapt to a range of tasks. It\u2019s considered to be far off in the future.\n- Artificial super AI: Imagine a machine that\u2019s smarter than you -- much smarter. Artificial superintelligence is still only a theory, but advances in nascent AI are raising interesting and troubling questions for the future of humanity.\nTypes\nTypes of artificial intelligence\nThe proliferation of data and other online resources has caused an explosion in the use of artificial intelligence. But not all AI is equal. We'll look at four different types of artificial intelligence to give you an idea of how it's developed and how AI is being used.\nMachine Learning\n1. Machine learning\nThe idea behind machine learning is to use sample data to train computer programs to recognize patterns based on algorithms. Machine learning programs allow computers to do things without being programmed. The efficiency of machine learning generally depends on the algorithm.\nA relatively common use of machine learning happens if you have a Pinterest (PINS 1.99%) account. The image-sharing and social media website began using machine learning with the acquisition of Kosei in 2015; since then, it's employed machine learning to help users discover content, moderate spam, direct advertising, and target newsletters.\n2. Neural networks\nNeural networks are computer systems designed to imitate the neurons in a brain. The networks are designed to learn via processing examples, using a well-understood input and a predicted result. As the network gains experience, its output mirrors the targeted result.\nAlphabet (GOOGL 3.1%)(GOOG 2.98%), the parent company of search giant Google, for example, has been researching neural networks since 2014. Its DeepMind project seeks to use artificial intelligence to build even more powerful algorithms. The project is best known for its neural network that learned how to play 49 different Atari video games by viewing pixels and a score on a screen.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\n3. Natural language processing\nNatural language processing is often confused with simple speech recognition. It certainly includes the ability to understand speech, but it involves more than simple audio-to-text (and vice versa) translations. One of the goals of natural language processing is the design of a computer to fully understand and analyze documents.\nMicrosoft (MSFT 0.56%) has become a major player in the field since investing $13 billion in OpenAI, the startup that created ChatGPT. Its Azure is the sole cloud provider for the generative chatbot and offers sentiment analysis, text classification, and text summarization, among others.\n4. Robotics\nThe use of robots dates back hundreds of years, but machines that could assist people without actual human involvement are considerably newer. One of the first autonomous robots was installed in 1961 and used to lift hot pieces of metal from a machine. Since then, robots have become far more common. They're used in applications ranging from space exploration to vacuuming your carpet.\nRobotics has evolved beyond industrial uses and are used in a wide range of applications, including medicine. The da Vinci system created by Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 1.22%), for example, is used for a wide range of procedures, including cardiac valve, prostate, and gynecological surgeries.\nRelated investing topics\nImportance of artificial intelligence\nImportance of artificial intelligence\nObviously, artificial intelligence has enormous ramifications for almost every human endeavor that you can imagine -- including investing. Imagine a robo-advisor that automatically tracks your portfolio and maximizes its value by making immediate and personalized adjustments based on corporate earnings calls, currency fluctuations, or even weather forecasts.\nIt\u2019s a tempting vision, but one with downsides. Artificial intelligence costs money, making it (for now) the province of wealthy corporations. Even AI designers can\u2019t anticipate every potential pitfall. And, of course, there\u2019s always the end-of-the-world scenario where AI winds up deciding that humans just aren\u2019t worth the trouble (think \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or \u201cTerminator\u201d movies).\nMany questions related to AI are just now being asked; they may be decades from being answered. But it\u2019s a good idea to keep track of this megatrend, which stands to affect the world in ways that we likely can\u2019t yet imagine."

      "text": "Dividend stocks are shares of companies that make regular distributions to their shareholders, usually in the form of cash payments. Dividend stocks can be a useful source of income, but the best dividend stocks can also be an excellent way to build wealth over the long term.\nHowever, not all dividend stocks are great investments, and many investors are unsure how to start their search. With that in mind, here's a list of dividend-paying stocks you might want to consider and some of the most important things to look for in top dividend stocks.\nNine best stocks\nNine best dividend stocks\nThe Dividend Kings list is a great place to find top dividend stocks. Dividend Kings are companies that have paid and raised their base dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.\nThe Dividend Achievers\u2122 list, whose companies boast 10-plus straight years of dividend increases, is a trademarked property owned by the Nasdaq and another great list to research. Both lists include some great stocks to buy, and we have included a few from each in our list below. Here are nine top dividend stocks to consider buying now.\nCompanies 1 - 3\n1. Lowe's\nHome improvement giant Lowe's (LOW 3.16%) may not seem like a very exciting stock. And that's true -- unless you like dividend growth. The company has raised its dividend almost every year since going public in 1961 and has raised the payout by more than 300% over the trailing decade alone.\nInvestors worried about the housing downturn shouldn't fret. When the housing supply is tight, homes are harder to buy, and people tend to spend more to upgrade their existing homes. So, any cyclical weakness in its results will likely return to growth over the long term, even if short-term shifts in consumer spending cause an overall slowdown in renovations.\nWhile consumer expenditures on home improvement projects remain in flux, particularly as concerns about the economy persist, these are durable spending trends over the long run. As consumer spending appetite improves, home upgrades and other projects, from which Lowe's has historically experienced considerable growth, should see an uptick.\nAnother important factor that's good for Lowe's is that the typical U.S. home is between 31 and 60 years old, depending on the state. The next generation of DIYers will spend a lot of money at Lowe's, as will home improvement contractors. It's made professionals a priority, and sales to contractors are growing.\n2. Realty Income\nIf you're looking for a simple way to invest in high-quality real estate for income and growth, Realty Income (O -1.21%) might be the perfect stock. The company owns an array of largely e-commerce-resistant properties, earning strong cash flow from tenants on long-term leases.\nRealty Income is also a Dividend Achiever, with more than three decades of consecutive annual dividend increases every year since going public in 1994 -- and over 55 straight years of paying a dividend every month. Since its founding, Realty has declared 661 consecutive monthly dividends and has habitually increased its dividend for the last 30 consecutive years.\nThis best-of-breed real estate investment trust (REIT) has also taken steps to continue delivering on its dividend-growing ways. In early 2024, it closed the $9.3 billion acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital, which it said would immediately add 2.5% to its adjusted funds from operations (FFO).\n3. Chevron\nFor years, Chevron (CVX 1.69%) has been a big winner for investors and a solid stock to own, especially for dividend investors. It has maintained a steady track record of generating strong cash flows and growing payouts modestly every year for 38 years and counting.\nThe stock price can fluctuate with oil prices, and Chevron has been part of the volatility trend afflicting many oil stocks recently. Still, Chevron has proven a profitable investment for dividend-seekers over the long term.\nIts $53 billion deal to acquire Hess (NYSE:HES) means significantly more low-cost onshore oil in the Permian Basin and some of the cheapest offshore oil currently being produced. However, a legal challenge by competitor ExxonMobil (XOM 1.88%) delayed the deal's closing until recently.\nIn January 2025, the Federal Trade Commission approved a consent order to resolve antitrust issues concerning the deal, satisfying a key closing condition. Arbitration proceedings over the remaining interests off the coast of Guyana then concluded in May 2025. Chevron ultimately prevailed in the arbitration case and announced the completion of its acquisition of Hess in July 2025.\nThe Hess acquisition significantly strengthens Chevron's portfolio, including adding a 30% interest in the highly valuable Stabroek Block in Guyana. Chevron is now focused on integrating Hess's operations, and is aiming to achieve $1 billion in annual run-rate cost synergies by the end of 2025.\nCompanies 4 - 6\n4. Target\nFor years, Target (TGT 1.98%) was more profitable than its peers, posting some of the highest gross margins and operating margins in retail. At the same time, its focus on increasing its e-commerce business and expanding in-store offerings helped stabilize its top line while improving profitability.\nRecent years have been quite tumultuous as Target has worked through some growing pains, dealing with lower-than-expected growth compared to industry peers, slowdowns in consumer spending, and other notable headwinds. However, Target remains profitable with a robust balance of cash on hand.\nIn fiscal 2024, the company reported net earnings of $4.1 billion on net sales of $106.6 billion. At the end of the fiscal year, the company had about $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.\nThat's great news for dividend investors. With dividend growth at 55 years and counting and shares trading for attractive earnings and cash-flow multiples, dividend investors should put Target on their shopping list.\n5. Starbucks\nOver the past four decades, Starbucks (SBUX -0.27%) has established itself as the dominant global brand in coffee beverages. With more than 40,000 global stores and Starbucks-branded ready-to-drink beverages and packaged coffee in hundreds of thousands more locations, nobody sells -- or buys -- more coffee than this company.\nIn 2023, China returned to more normal public commerce, which has been a big boost for the company. China is Starbucks' second-largest market outside the U.S. and its largest international market. Starbucks has counted on that country to become its biggest and most profitable market over the next decade.\nThe company has also cemented partnerships across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East (both through franchise and licensing agreements) as it seeks to open new profitable stores and expand its international segment. However, the company has some challenges to deal with.\nCritics say Starbucks hasn't introduced many exciting new drinks recently, making the menu feel stale and unappealing to customers. Newer coffee chains are gaining popularity, and despite significant expansion in China, Starbucks faces increased competition from local coffee brands, affecting sales in that key market.\nOver the long run, though, its strong brand and power as a buyer have resulted in robust competitive advantages, including cost benefits throughout its operations and pricing power with consumers. Those economic moats and the company's strong digital presence have resulted in a cash cow business.\nWhile business results have softened more recently, this isn't the first challenge the company has faced. It could be an enticing opportunity to invest. Starbucks has increased its dividend yearly for 14 consecutive years.\nIt has also increased annual earnings per share by more than 300% over the last five years alone. Its yield of about 3% at recent prices is on the higher end of its historical range, representing an attractive price to buy company shares.\n6. Brookfield Infrastructure\nSometimes, the best stocks are the ones hidden in plain sight. That's the case with Brookfield Infrastructure (BIPC 3.83%) (BIP 2.1%), which owns water, energy, utility, transportation, and communications infrastructure projects worldwide.\nIts assets generate steady recession- and inflation-resistant cash flow, and Brookfield returns a sizable portion to shareholders. At recent Class C share prices, it claimed a dividend yield of about 4.1%, more than 5% for the limited partner units, and aims to raise the payout by 5% to 9% every year.\nCompanies 7 - 9\n7. Microsoft\nMicrosoft (MSFT 0.56%) is one of the most important software companies on the planet. Over the past decade, it has rebuilt its business to focus on recurring subscription-based revenue that keeps its customers connected and the cash flowing. The company has a solid balance sheet with more cash than debt and a very low payout ratio that leaves tons of room to increase the dividend.\nIts 20-year streak of dividend increases is easy to miss. Its yield of less than 1% at recent prices hasn't put it on many dividend investors' radars. But what it hasn't paid in yield, Microsoft has absolutely delivered, with total returns of more than 3,000% since 2009 and dividends accounting for a sizable portion of those total returns.\nLooking forward, Microsoft wants to take a commanding lead in artificial intelligence (AI). With significant investments in and a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, the company is integrating AI features across its suite of productivity and communications platforms and its Windows operating system.\n8. American Express\nFinancial services, such as consumer and business lending, are another place to find a handful of top dividend stocks, and American Express (AXP 3.57%) is one of the best. Although it's not on the list of companies that raise their dividends every year, Amex has a decades-long track record of either raising or maintaining its dividends through every economic environment.\nThe big lesson here: When other banks and lenders have cut or even eliminated their dividends, Amex has proven strong enough to keep the payouts coming for its shareholders. That's a credit to its high-quality lending standards and focus on higher-income credit customers who are less likely to default on their debts during weak economic periods.\nThe bottom line is that Amex appeals to investors who like owning a top financial services company but are also concerned about economic conditions. This is a great stock to buy during broad market downturns and a solid hold for a bull market recovery.\n9. Clearway Energy\nRenewable energy is mostly considered a place for growth investors, but it's also a wonderful opportunity for dividends. Clearway Energy (CWEN.A 1.0%)(CWEN 1.21%) is a perfect example. The company invests in, acquires, and operates renewable energy facilities, selling the power on long-term contracts -- think decades, not years -- to utility companies and large power consumers.\nThe stock witnessed extensive volatility over the last few years due to concerns that rising interest rates and perceived weakening in demand for renewables could affect its business. The market could be pricing in those concerns now, but the flip side is that its dividend yield was around 5.7% as of August 2025.\nWorries about the business are probably significantly overstated. Yes, rising rates and inflation have sent wind and solar into a downturn. These are cyclical industries that ebb and flow. Plus, Clearway's earnings come from long-term power production, and utilities continue to demand more and more clean power.\nManagement is moving forward, too, saying their long-term expectations remain unchanged. With ample opportunity ahead and plenty of access to funding, Clearway expects it can continue to grow profits and increase its payout.\nHighest dividends\nHighest dividend stocks\nWhether it's to generate the income you'll use today or the capital you can reinvest to increase your wealth, there's a good chance you're looking for a big dividend payout. If you're hoping to maximize the number of dividends you earn, here are some suggestions.\nFirst, consider dividend yield above dividend size. The dividend yield is a percentage of the share price you paid for the stock, paid in dividends annually. That's far more relevant than the dollar amount of dividends per share.\nNext, don't make owning high-dividend-yielding stocks your No. 1 priority. Focus first on business quality and a company's ability to maintain and increase the payout. Only then can you know whether a high dividend yield is sustainable.\nDividend investors should focus not on dividend size but on dividend yield.\nHow to invest\nHow to invest in dividend stocks\nThis article hits on a few things to avoid (e.g., focusing too much on a high yield that might be a trap) and the power of dividend growth stocks as some of the best winners. Here are some key things to look for when investing in dividend stocks.\n- Identify dividend stocks that meet your criteria. You may be looking for yield, a history of dividend growth, and so forth.\n- Research the history of earnings growth. Dividend growth is sustainable only if a company's earnings have also steadily grown at a similar or higher rate over time.\n- Consider valuation. While paying a modest premium for a high-quality business can sometimes be justified, overpaying can significantly weigh on long-term returns.\n- Determine position sizing. Consider how much exposure you want to a particular stock, how much income you expect it to generate, and other factors to ensure you buy an appropriate amount.\n- Focus on the long term. Dividend stocks deliver best when bought and held for many years. Having patience and letting exceptional managers run great companies while you just sit back and own them is how you get the best returns from dividend stocks.\nWhat to look for\nWhat to look for in dividend stocks\nIf you're new to dividend investing, it's smart to familiarize yourself with dividend stocks and why they can make excellent investments. Once you have a firm grasp of how dividends work, a few key concepts can help you find excellent dividend stocks for your portfolio.\n- Payout ratio: A stock's payout ratio is the amount of money the company pays per share in dividends divided by its earnings per share. In other words, this tells you the percentage of earnings a stock pays to shareholders. A reasonably low payout ratio (say, 70% or less) is a good sign that the dividend is sustainable.\n- History of increases: It's a very good sign when a company raises its dividend year after year, especially when it can continue to do so during recessions and other tough economic times.\n- Steady revenue and earnings growth: When looking for the best dividend stocks to own for the long term, prioritize stability. Erratic revenue (up one year, down the next) and fluctuating earnings can be signs of trouble.\n- Durable competitive advantages: This is perhaps the most important feature. A durable competitive advantage can take several forms, such as proprietary technology, high barriers to entry, high customer switching costs, or a powerful brand name.\n- Supportable yield: This is last on the list for a reason. A high yield is obviously preferable to a lower one, but only if the other criteria are met first. A high dividend is only as strong as the business that supports it. So, compare dividend yields after ensuring the business is healthy and the payout is stable.\nRelated investing topics\nDividend stocks are long-term investments\nEven the most rock-solid dividend stocks can experience significant volatility over short periods. There are simply too many market forces that can move them up or down over days or weeks, and many have nothing to do with the underlying business itself.\nSo, while the companies above should make great long-term dividend investments, don't worry too much about day-to-day price movements. Instead, focus on finding companies with excellent businesses, stable income streams, and (preferably) strong dividend track records. The long term will take care of itself.\nDividend stocks vs. dividend funds\nDividend stocks and dividend funds are both popular ways to generate income and potentially grow your investments. Dividend funds, such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), invest in a portfolio of multiple dividend stocks. Dividend funds offer diversification and professional oversight by investment managers who carefully select the underlying stocks. With a dividend fund, it's important to pay attention to the expense ratio to determine how much of your investment may go towards fees.\nDividend stocks provide the potential for higher returns but also higher risk. It also takes time and effort to carefully research each business so you can understand whether it is a good fit for your portfolio. Depending on your investing style, you might prefer investing in dividend funds for the instant diversification and exposure they provide to a wide range of income stocks vs. putting cash to work in individual businesses. However, both types of investments can offer advantageous returns for a long-term investor with a well-diversified portfolio.\nFAQ\nBest dividend stocks: FAQ\nWhat stocks pay the highest dividend?\nWhile chasing yield can often lead to bad outcomes, some stocks are just built to be yield machines. Two categories known for paying above-average yields are utilities and REITs, or real estate investment trusts. But just as with any other dividend stock, don't assume that the highest-yielding ones are the best. Be sure to evaluate business quality and whether a company's cash flows support a dividend.\nWhat are dividends in stocks?\nDividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders. U.S. companies typically pay dividends quarterly, though some pay less often, and a few even pay monthly.\nDividends are generally paid in cash, but some companies pay in \"scrip,\" which is dividends paid in stock. Note that this is not the same as a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, where a company (or your brokerage) automatically takes your cash dividend and purchases shares for you.\nWhat is considered a good stock dividend?\nIt can vary by sector and even particular industries within a sector, but the most important answer is \"one that can be sustained.\" This is why chasing yield is so dangerous, as a high yield that can't be maintained is no good at all.\nA useful metric for determining a dividend's safety is the dividend payout ratio, which is the percentage of a company's earnings that it pays out in dividends. The safest dividends generally have the lowest payout ratios.\nIs it a good idea to buy dividend stocks?\nWhether you're looking for income or just the best possible total returns, chances are good that many dividend stocks can be ideal ways to reach your financial goals. Just remember that yield is often less important than other factors, such as a company's ability to maintain and grow the payout for the long term.\nHow do dividends work?\nA dividend occurs when a company sends money (or stock, though very rarely) to its shareholders. When a company reaches the point that it consistently earns more than management can effectively reinvest, establishing a dividend policy and sending those excess profits back to investors is a smart move.\nDo ETFs pay dividends?\nYes, many ETFs pay dividends. Dividend ETFs hold stocks that pay dividends, and the ETF then distributes those dividends to its investors.\nDoes it matter when you buy a dividend stock?\nWhen you buy dividend stocks, it matters if you purchase them before the ex-dividend date. To receive the next dividend payment, you need to own the stock on or before the ex-dividend date."

      "text": "There are a number of different ways for businesses to generate competitive advantages, but few are as valuable as the network effect.\nNetwork effects apply not just to businesses but also to relationships and social systems. The phrase even describes the way that ideas spread.\nKeep reading to learn more about what network effects are, how they work, and how you can take advantage of them as an investor.\nWhat are they?\nWhat are network effects, exactly?\nNetwork effects describe a set of relationships with an ecosystem that make the overall ecosystem stronger.\nOne of the clearest examples of network effects is in social media; platforms grow more valuable as more users join.\nNot only does it become more valuable, but the increased numbers of people on a platform incentivize more people to use it as the network expands. When a business has network effects, it enables them to have a number of competitive advantages and can lead to higher profits.\nHow do they work?\nHow do network effects work?\nThere are a lot of different kinds of networks, but to borrow from the example above, a social media platform relies on network effects to be useful.\nFor example, a social media platform is only as valuable as the users on it. If, say, a social network had just five users, its utility would be minimal (unless the reason for it to exist was highly specific).\nMeta Platforms' (META 2.04%) Facebook, on the other hand, has roughly 3 billion users. If you want to post something that people see, Facebook has the potential to bring in a uniquely large audience.\nThe network effect also offers advantages to the businesses that successfully employ them. That's because they lock in users, especially on a platform where each user indirectly incentivizes other users to remain part of the network.\nSimilarly, network effects have the power to enable businesses to charge premium prices and block out competition because they can be difficult for more than one business to obtain in a specific sector.\nHow to invest in them\nHow to invest in network effects\nFinding businesses with network effects and investing in them can be an excellent way to achieve superior returns on the stock market.\nTo do so, you'll want to start by identifying the kinds of businesses that create network effects. Let's take a look at a few.\n- Social media: Often called social networks, social media platforms may be the most direct form of network effects since social media platforms with larger audiences tend to be more sought after by advertisers and users, who typically want the broadest reach.\n- Two-sided marketplaces: Two-sided marketplaces refer to those where there are individual buyers and sellers. This includes e-commerce sites like Amazon (AMZN 3.12%), Etsy (ETSY -0.41%), and eBay (EBAY 0.36%). Home-sharing marketplaces like Airbnb (ABNB 2.75%) and Expedia's (EXPE 4.44%) VRBO are also good examples, and transportation marketplaces like Uber (UBER 2.72%) and Lyft (LYFT 7.59%) seek to build competitive advantages through network effects.\n- Payment networks: Finally, payment networks also offer investors a good way to get exposure to network effects. Apps like PayPal (PYPL 3.43%) or Block's (NYSE:SQ) Cash App compete for users who create networks on the platform since having a critical mass of users will incentivize other users to use the app.\nOne of the best ways to invest in companies with network effects is to find ones that haven't been readily identified as such. That could be because they are still small or because they are hidden within a larger business.\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nOne example of a network effect\nOne of the most powerful network effects in business is Airbnb.\nThe home-sharing platform has millions of hosts and even more guests on its platform.\nAs the pioneer in home-sharing, the company owns the majority of the market share in the industry. It's likely to stay that way since new hosts will go to the platform where they get the most guests, and guests will go to the platform where there are the most places to stay.\nNetwork effects should enable Airbnb to maintain its market leadership in home-sharing, barring some other kind of disruption; the network itself drives Airbnb's growth, helping it save on marketing costs.\nNetwork effects will continue to play a role in the next bull market, and many of these companies that benefit from them should only get bigger as their networks grow."

      "text": "Have you ever stuck with a company's services or products simply because changing to a competitor would have been too expensive, time-consuming, or just downright annoying?\nIf so, you've directly experienced the power of switching costs. These costs can lock you into using a particular company's offerings, even if better alternatives exist.\nAlthough this might be frustrating as a consumer, it represents a significant advantage for the company and its shareholders.\nLet's dive into switching costs, why they're crucial for businesses and investors, and how you can identify if a company benefits from this competitive edge.\nOverview\nUnderstanding switching costs\nSwitching costs are one of the five key factors that determine whether a business has an economic moat.\nEconomic Moat\nSwitching costs refer to the tangible or intangible aspects of a business's products or services that effectively lock customers into its ecosystem. These costs can be monetary, such as fees for breaking a contract; effort-based, like the time and hassle involved in transferring records or learning new systems; or even psychological, stemming from brand loyalty or familiarity.\nThe presence of these costs makes customers less likely to switch to a competitor, even if alternatives are available. As a result, businesses with high switching costs tend to enjoy higher customer retention rates, providing a more stable and predictable revenue stream that is less susceptible to market fluctuations and competitive pressures. This contributes to the protective barrier -- or moat -- around the company's profits, ensuring a higher probability of long-term sustainability and success.\nWhy they matter\nWhy switching costs are important for investors\nSwitching costs are a critical element for investors to consider because they directly influence a company's ability to sustain long-term growth and profitability. A business that can retain its customers more effectively is less likely to see fluctuations in revenue, which is essential for steady growth.\nIf the businesses you're investing in are constantly losing customers who cancel their services or abandon their products, these companies will inevitably struggle to expand and maintain profitability. To leverage this understanding in your investment strategy, it's wise to incorporate the assessment of switching costs into your qualitative analysis. This can involve several approaches, such as:\n- Reading customer reviews and forums: Dive into online customer feedback and forums to gauge user satisfaction and the difficulties they face when considering switching to a competitor.\n- Experiencing the product/service: Personally using the company's products or services can give you firsthand insight into the potential hurdles or costs a customer might encounter if they choose to leave.\n- Reviewing contractual agreements: Look into the company's terms of service or cancellation policies to understand the financial implications or procedural barriers for a customer who wishes to switch providers.\n- Analyzing industry characteristics: Some industries naturally have higher switching costs due to technical requirements, regulatory hurdles, or substantial initial investments.\nBy evaluating these aspects, you can better identify companies with effective economic moats represented by high switching costs. Such companies are often more resilient to competition and market changes, making them potentially safer and more profitable investment choices in the long run.\nExample\nAn example of switching costs\nApple (AAPL 1.21%) is a prime example of a company that effectively uses switching costs to secure its market position and enhance customer loyalty. Apple's ecosystem, encompassing iPhones, iPads, iMacs, the App Store, and more, is designed for seamless integration across products. This means that once a user purchases an Apple product, they are more likely to buy additional Apple products to ensure compatibility and maintain the user experience.\nFor instance, an iPhone user will find that having an iPad or Apple Watch significantly enhances their user experience due to features like Handoff, where users can start a task on one device and pick it up on another, or Universal Clipboard, which allows for copying and pasting between devices. Additionally, the App Store's exclusive apps and services, tailored to the Apple operating system, further tether users to the brand with every program they use.\nRelated investing topics\nBrand loyalty also plays a significant role in Apple's strategy. The company has cultivated a loyal fan base, and customers often wait overnight to purchase the latest products upon their release. This loyalty isn't just about the products but the status and identity that come with being an Apple user, which can often outweigh the benefits of switching to competing products, even if they offer similar functionalities at a lower price.\nMoving away from Apple's ecosystem means losing out on the convenience and functionality specific to their products, as well as the social aspects of being part of the Apple community. The strategy means Apple not only retains customers but also ensures a continuous revenue stream from its array of devices and services, helping it retain its dominant position in the technology sector. This combination of seamless product integration and strong brand loyalty creates substantial switching costs."

      "text": "Cloud computing boomed during the 2010s, but growth in this next-gen IT industry is still in the early innings. For years, organizations around the globe have been migrating their operations to the cloud -- digital data and services stored within a remote data center and accessed via the internet. However, the rise of remote work during the pandemic accelerated the trend. Now, generative AI has kicked off the next wave of cloud expansion.\nBusiness research provider Grand View Research projects that spending on global cloud computing (including data center infrastructure and edge computing) will increase at a 21.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from an estimated $752.4 billion in 2024 to $2.4 trillion in 2030.\nCloud computing is also closely tied to other tech developments such as mobile 5G networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI). Clearly, cloud computing stocks are a top investment theme for 2025 and the decade ahead.\nCloud computing stocks for 2025\nInvesting in the best cloud computing stocks of 2025\nTo get started, the best cloud stocks to invest in are the five largest public cloud giants: Amazon (AMZN 3.12%) Web Services (AWS); Microsoft (MSFT 0.56%) Azure; Alphabet (GOOGL 3.1%) (GOOG 2.98%) Google Cloud; Oracle (ORCL 1.3%) Cloud; and IBM (IBM 0.94%) Cloud. Although these companies aren\u2019t pure plays in the cloud industry, all five provide infrastructure and services for organizations undertaking a digital transformation (a phrase that encompasses the migration to cloud-based operations). They have the most complete ecosystems of software and partnerships with third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers.\nCloud Computing\nBeyond those big five, here are seven more focused companies that provide portfolio exposure to the development of the cloud:\n| Name and ticker | Current price | Market cap |\n|---|---|---|\n| Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) | $248.06 | $237 billion |\n| Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) | $362.02 | $154 billion |\n| Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) | $196.77 | $66 billion |\n| Zoom Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) | $82.46 | $25 billion |\n| ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) | $885.83 | $184 billion |\n| The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) | $53.19 | $26 billion |\n| DigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) | $31.54 | $3 billion |\n1 - 2\n1. Salesforce\nWhen talking about cloud computing, Salesforce (CRM 0.91%) needs to be part of the conversation. The customer relationship management (CRM) specialist was a pioneer of software that used cloud technology, which started in the late 1990s. Salesforce has since branched out to other areas of enterprise software via organic growth and a steady stream of acquisitions.\nSalesforce\u2019s takeover of remote work and collaboration tool Slack put it on a collision course with Microsoft\u2019s Teams collaboration suite. Today, Salesforce offers a complete suite of software aimed at helping business teams manage data and get work done efficiently.\nDue to its success in becoming a full-blown tech platform for businesses of all types and sizes, Salesforce is also a top way to play smaller cloud upstarts. It regularly invests in or acquires stakes in smaller cloud peers -- such as when it invested in Snowflake (SNOW 1.07%) before its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020 (and sold it for a profit in 2021). It also acquired a stake in hot IPO Monday.com (MNDY 3.67%).\nSalesforce fell on hard times in 2022 and faced activist investor pressure to boost profit margins. Founder and CEO Marc Benioff and the top team have made progress, though, and hope to become the world\u2019s largest and most profitable enterprise software company within the next few years. It seems to be on the right track. Salesforce reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.21 for fiscal 2023 but booked diluted EPS of $4.20 in fiscal 2024, and management projects fiscal 2025 to be even higher: $6.15 to $6.20.\n2. Adobe\nSoftware company Adobe (ADBE 2.43%) got its start in an IT era that predates both the cloud and the internet. But it has transformed itself into a leader in cloud services by adapting its large and expanding platform to the cloud era. Adobe\u2019s core competencies in providing creativity software and document editing have made it a staple of digital transformation.\nAlthough it isn\u2019t a serial acquirer like Salesforce, Adobe has made some big moves to round out its software suite. In 2018, it acquired small firms Marketo and Magento to bolster its position as a partner for e-commerce companies. In late 2020, it purchased Workfront to add workflow and project management solutions to its arsenal.\nAs a creative software specialist, Adobe is also well suited to tackle the new generative AI era. Its work with top chip designer Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) helped it quickly release its Firefly suite of apps aimed at helping creatives increase their image and video creation, as well as expanding editing capabilities.\nPaired with the organic growth that Adobe\u2019s legacy offerings still generate, this firm is a top free cash flow generator in the cloud industry. It deserves consideration as a core portfolio holding.\n3 - 4\n3. Snowflake\nThe cloud increases a company's flexibility, often unlocks cost savings, and helps them get more done with the data they have on their operations and customers. However, with the adoption of the cloud comes an explosion of digital data and new security risk considerations. Managing that data is a complex task.\nThat's where Snowflake comes in. It hit the public markets in 2020 with incredible fanfare due to its triple-digit-percentage revenue growth. The stock has fallen since then, and revenue growth has moderated a bit, but Snowflake is now much more reasonably valued.\nSnowflake is an important business that has pioneered new ways for businesses to store, migrate, and process massive amounts of digital information. It continued to expand at a rapid pace even during the bear market of 2022 and despite fears of a recession in 2023. It also began turning a healthy profit, as measured by free cash flow. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, for example, Snowflake reported free cash flow of $496.5 million and $778.9 million, respectively. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, moreover, Snowflake reported free cash flow of $468.6 million.\nSnowflake is a young company, though, and the stock will likely be highly volatile for some time. It's all about growth for this business right now, and even small changes in management's expectations can cause some wild fluctuations in share price. Snowflake could, nevertheless, be a very promising investment for the long term.\n4. Zoom Video Communications\nFew companies have skyrocketed out of obscurity and into household name status as quickly as Zoom (ZM 12.7%). The videoconferencing service became a staple during the COVID-19 pandemic by helping family members and business teams stay in touch from afar (as it turns out, many pre-pandemic in-person meetings weren't all that necessary after all). Zoom is poised to continue as a basic necessity of corporate communications services for a long time.\nZoom is eyeing a bigger piece of the massive global telecom industry by going after large business communications accounts. Zoom Phone accounts, a service for transferring calls across different devices, has steadily grown for years. Zoom's contact center services to manage inbound calls and customer contact have also remained a key growth initiative.\nWhile Zoom struggled with many individual and small business subscribers canceling their service in the wake of the pandemic, it has succeeded in improving its financials over the past couple of years. Growing free cash flow from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024, Zoom projects free cash flow of $1.44 billion to $1.48 billion for fiscal 2025. The company is still benefiting from changes in communications, but it's no longer a growth company. Zoom's top priority now is managing modest revenue expansion while figuring out how to steadily increase earnings for shareholders.\nArtificial Intelligence\n5 - 7\n5. ServiceNow\nThere are greater complexities involved in managing big cloud computing infrastructure, but the cloud also offers the ability to continuously streamline and automate operations. That's ServiceNow's (NOW 1.01%) software specialty.\nBe it digital customer experiences, employee workflow management, or software development, ServiceNow helps about 8,400 companies around the world find chokepoints in their operations. Once these pain points are found, ServiceNow can help suggest and automate fixes.\nIn a new era of AI, ServiceNow could be a big winner, building on its recent success. After growing subscription revenue by 23% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, ServiceNow projects a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of about 19% for fiscal 2025.\nThe company is using Nvidia hardware to make automation even better and even landed Nvidia as a bigger customer using automation software that Nvidia is helping ServiceNow to create. With challenges like labor shortages persisting in the wake of the pandemic, ServiceNow is primed to keep growing.\nIn addition to steady growth, ServiceNow also recently turned profitable by all metrics. This could be a great stock holding for the next decade and beyond as the cloud infiltrates more of the world's corporate operations.\n6. The Trade Desk\nNetflix (NFLX -0.2%) made streaming TV from the cloud an everyday staple. Lots of new internet-based services have come to market in the past couple of years. This has been a boon for digital advertising technologists such as The Trade Desk (TTD 1.7%), a cloud-based offering that helps marketers automate the purchase of digital advertising (known as programmatic advertising).\nDigital ads are dominated by the likes of Google and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), but The Trade Desk\u2019s cloud-based marketing management tools have won over lots of users. It now ranks as the largest independent digital ad management software company. And its rapidly-escalating top-line growth further reflects the massive success it has achieved. From fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2023, for example, The Trade Desk has grown revenue at a massive 52% CAGR.\nDespite massive internet growth in the past decade, just over half of marketing spending takes place in a digital format. Digital ads will continue to be a fast-growing industry in the next decade -- especially in at-home entertainment as TV and movies move to an on-demand internet streaming format.\nIn the coming years, streaming services will pick up millions of new household subscribers and account for billions of additional hours spent viewing content. That creates a huge opportunity for The Trade Desk as it manages connected TV advertising activity. Still a small company in a global marketing industry approaching $1 trillion annually and growing, the sky\u2019s the limit for The Trade Desk.\n7. DigitalOcean\nDigitalOcean (NASDAQ:DOCN) is a fresh face in the cloud computing space. It completed its public offering of stock in early 2021. It\u2019s a public cloud infrastructure and software provider similar to Amazon\u2019s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. While the big three focus their attention on large enterprises, DigitalOcean aims at the massive but underserved community of small businesses and start-ups.\nThis is a lucrative niche. Most IT innovations are developed for and funded by large organizations. Yet small businesses still make up about half of the global economy\u2019s production. Most are far behind the curve in making needed digital transformation. That\u2019s where DigitalOcean comes in, providing a full range of affordable services to help small companies find their way in the new cloud era.\nBesides offering cloud infrastructure for small businesses to test and host web-based services and apps, it also offers services for the non-tech-savvy outfit. It acquired a company called Cloudways that offers website building and hosting.\nDespite its tiny size, DigitalOcean is an efficient operation. It generates healthy and growing free cash flow, and while it has generated gross profits for years, it booked positive net income for the first time in 2023, reporting diluted EPS of $0.20. Through the first three quarters of 2024, DigitalOcean has generated diluted EPS of $0.70. This could be a quality small- to mid-cap stock worth investing in for the long haul.\nInvesting in cloud ETFs\nInvesting in cloud ETFs\nFor investors not interested in attempting to pick the best cloud stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also an option. The First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY 2.62%) is the largest cloud ETF around, with about $3.9 billion in assets under management. The fund is a basket of 61 cloud infrastructure and software stocks. It has an ETF expense ratio of 0.6%, meaning it costs $6 per year for every $1,000 invested.\nA more recent arrival is the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU 3.54%). Since the fund launched in early 2019, GlobalX\u2019s cloud ETF has narrowly outperformed First Trust\u2019s offering due to its focus on just 37 stocks, most of which are software companies. The fund is smaller, with about $376 million in assets under management. It has a slightly higher annual expense ratio of 0.68%.\nRelated investing topics\nShould you invest?\nCloud computing is a long-term growth trend\nCloud computing picked up steam during the COVID-19 pandemic and has remained an enduring growth story even during the bear market. More efficient than legacy IT, it enhances technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and gaming. It gives organizations and their employees more flexibility with important functions such as remote work. The cloud is quickly becoming the basic infrastructure of the future.\nAs is the case with all high-growth stocks, though, investing in cloud companies will have bumps in the road. Investors should stay focused on the long-term potential, not just stock price performance over the course of a year or two. This long-term secular growth trend is poised to remain intact for the next decade and beyond. Cloud stocks should be a top investment priority in 2025."

      "text": "In olden times, moats were used to protect castles and other valuable strategic properties. These wide trenches would surround an important resource and were often filled with water to prevent attackers from being able to seize the target. While businesses today aren't actually building moats to protect their headquarters and factories, economic moats play a key role in protecting them against rivals.\nWhat is an economic moat?\nWhat is an economic moat?\nAn economic moat is an advantage that makes it more difficult for a business' rivals to compete. While economic moats can stem from financial differentiators such as having lower operating costs, they can also arise from less tangible sources such as brand strength or a strong corporate culture.\nWhy are they important?\nWhy are economic moats important?\nHaving an economic moat is important for a business if it hopes to retain its market share and profit margins. The success of a product or service naturally incentivizes new competition, but the existence of an economic moat can help ensure that the initial product or service remains viable.\nEven having a narrow economic moat confers meaningful competitive advantages and can prevent rivals from disrupting a business or provide a window of time in which operating conditions are significantly more favorable. If a company has a wide economic moat, it will enjoy sustainable competitive advantages that open the door for very strong sales and earnings performance over the long term.\nBusiness size\nWhy is business size important for building economic moats?\nAs a business grows in size, it will often have opportunities to leverage the benefits of economies of scale. The marginal cost of producing additional units tends to decline as more units are produced.\nWhile fixed costs remain the same, and companies may be able to get key materials and components at lower prices by buying at higher volume, the amount of revenue that can be generated goes up.

The company has spent decades running its online retail business at a loss or very slim profit margin to build up a massive warehouse and distribution network, and it has established a powerful economic moat that will make its industry-leading position very difficult to disrupt.\nWhile Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is a leading player in the e-commerce services industry and has powerful competitive strengths of its own, it ultimately gave up on its goal of challenging Amazon in order fulfillment services. After spending billions to build its own logistics network, Shopify abandoned its ambitions in the space because the costs would be too high.\nExpanding its order fulfillment capabilities would have crushed Shopify's profitability, and the e-commerce services company decided it was better to shut down the initiative and focus on its existing strengths. High entry and operating costs proved to be a powerful economic moat, and a prospective challenger to Amazon in order fulfillment had to give up its pursuits."
