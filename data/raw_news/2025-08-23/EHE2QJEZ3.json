  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None The market could be dramatically undervaluing Amazon's AI-related growth catalysts.\n\u2022 None E-commerce powerhouse Shopify is constantly launching new features and services to stay in growth mode.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Amazon \u203a\n\n2025 is zooming by, and August is rapidly drawing to a close. While the market has experienced some big swings this year in response to macroeconomic developments, geopolitical concerns, and shifting developments around the valuation outlook for artificial intelligence (AI) companies, growth stocks have generally been enjoying strong bullish momentum. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is up roughly 10% year to date as of this writing.\n\nBroad catalysts could still rattle the market in the near term, but there are also category-leading companies that look primed to deliver big wins for long-term shareholders. Two that a pair of Motley Fool contributing analysts view as top stocks to load up on before August falls off the calendar are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP).\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\n1. Amazon looks poised to be one of AI's biggest winners\n\nKeith Noonan (Amazon): While excitement surrounding artificial intelligence has powered big share price gains for many players in the space this year, Amazon stock has significantly underperformed the broader market. On the heels of recent sell-offs, the tech giant is up just 2% across 2025's trading. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index has delivered a total return of roughly 10% across that stretch.\n\nAmazon reported its second-quarter results at the end of July, delivering sales and earnings that topped Wall Street analysts' consensus targets. Despite that, its stock sank following the report. While the company's share price has regained some ground since then, general market concerns that valuations for AI stocks could be in a bubble on the verge of bursting have been putting pressure on the tech leader's valuation. So have negative indicators on the inflation and tariff fronts.\n\nWhile many AI stocks may be overvalued at the moment, I actually think that Amazon's strengths in artificial intelligence have been (and continue to be) significantly underappreciated by the broader market. Many companies with strong positions in AI have seen their valuations skyrocket over the last five years, but Amazon's share price is up by just 37% over the period. For comparison, the S&P 500 has posted a total return of 104% over the same period.\n\nThrough its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment, Amazon continues to command a leading position in the cloud data-center market that is central to the development, launch, and scaling of AI applications and models. AWS should continue to deliver healthy and heavily profitable growth over the long term, and it's likely that positive performance catalysts connected to artificial intelligence are still in the early stages of unfolding for the business.\n\nAs exciting as AI growth drivers for AWS are, it's the impact that AI will likely have on Amazon's e-commerce business that the market really seems to be missing. While online retail continues to account for the majority of the company's revenues, it accounts for a relatively small portion of the tech leader's operating profits.\n\nAmazon has built the world's largest e-commerce business and focused on continuing to expand its infrastructure and sales footprints, but the high costs of its warehouse and delivery operations have meant that, despite some gradual improvements, the segment's margins continue to be relatively low. Greater automation of those operations powered by AI and robotics has the potential to dramatically change that picture. These emerging technologies look poised to drive long-term margin improvements that could unlock huge earnings growth and deliver huge wins for shareholders.\n\n2. Shopify is more than just e-commerce\n\nJennifer Saibil (Shopify): Shopify has been impressing the market with its robust performance, but investors are buying the stock today for its future opportunities. It has demonstrated that it can maintain its dominance as a service provider as e-commerce keeps growing, and that it can pick itself up after a fall. Those are the kinds of attributes that one sees in a stock with long-term potential.\n\nIts second quarter was a blowout, with a 31% increase in revenue and a 21% increase in operating income. Free cash flow rose by 27%, and it delivered a 16% margin.\n\nAccording to data from the Census Bureau, Shopify's clients have a combined 12% share of the U.S. e-commerce market, and that's expected to increase. Greater e-commerce penetration will offer it organic growth opportunities, but there's so much more. I appreciated this statement from company President Harley Finkelstein: \"No matter how good the numbers look, there's always a new frontier in commerce,\" he said, \"and we'll continue to lead the way.\"\n\nTo start, management continues to add services across the business, and Shopify has become a total commerce platform rather than just an e-commerce platform that provides small merchants with an online presence. It offers complete payment processing services for physical stores and a unified platform for omnichannel merchants, including services like order management and data analytics. Some of its newer services include Shop Pay, a one-page checkout for merchants, and a deal with Amazon to offer a checkout option for Prime members and merchants through Shopify stores.\n\nIt's also moving upmarket, capturing market share in the medium and large business segments. Today, it calls companies like Allbirds and Crate & Barrel clients, and that's a result of its offering individual components that meet large customers' needs. This continues to be a strong growth driver; Shopify added well-known brands like Canada Goose, Miele, and Starbucks to its client roster in the second quarter.\n\nIt also has plenty of market share to capture globally, and European gross merchandise volume increased 42% year over year in the second quarter.\n\nThere's a lot to be excited about as Shopify conquers new frontiers. The company should continue to create shareholder value for many years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $649,657!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,090,993!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,057% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nJennifer Saibil has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "text": "People talk about cloud computing all the time. But what is the cloud, and what does it mean to run a computing job in that environment? Get ready to explore the power and possibilities of this digital realm.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is cloud computing?\nFirst, let me explain what the digital cloud actually is. Imagine a network of interconnected servers and data centers, all talking to one another and to your favorite digital devices over the internet. The heavy work of data processing and analysis is handled by central systems, passing the results back to the user over network connections. Many different companies and organizations own and manage various parts of this planet-spanning resource, and we'll get around to the details and distinctions later on. But you already know the essentials at this point.\nThat massive computer network is the cloud -- an online environment where data is stored, applications are hosted, and computing tasks are performed. The cloud metaphor started in handwritten network diagrams decades ago, portraying the great, big internet outside your local network. The image still holds a similar meaning, though it has been refined over the years. Now, cloud computing means moving some or all of your computing processes to central servers and so-called edge computing devices closer to the app or web browser that needs to access the cloud-based data or services.\nWhy it matters\nWhy cloud computing matters\nIn many cases, cloud computing provides more flexibility and scalability than traditional solutions such as local data servers or special apps managing all your data at your desk or on a mobile device.\nCloud computing has emerged as a game-changer in information technology. It's easy to scale your cloud-based service up from a single server to a global network. This scalability allows businesses to expand their computing resources effortlessly as their needs grow. The cloud provides a manageable infrastructure that lets users access data, applications, and services from anywhere. You're no longer tied to what your smartphone or desktop computer can run on its own limited processing power, memory space, and local storage.\nThe evolution of cloud computing has disrupted the traditional computing landscape. It has lightened the burden of expensive infrastructure investments, providing businesses with the ability to tap into vast computing power and storage capacity on demand, from anywhere.\nCompanies\nHarnessing the power of cloud computing\nWhen it comes to harnessing the power of cloud computing, you have a range of options to suit your specific needs and preferences. Different deployment models, such as public, private, and hybrid clouds, offer flexibility and scalability to meet your requirements.\nMany technology giants run public and hybrid cloud computing services. Businesses and hobbyists alike can access these mighty platforms to meet their computing needs, tapping into the robust infrastructure and data security of a tried-and-true computing service. Leading cloud computing platforms include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\nInvesting in companies that embrace cloud computing can lead to significant benefits. Cloud computing enables businesses to streamline operations, reduce costs, and leverage advanced infrastructure. Platforms like GCP, AWS, and Azure offer comprehensive solutions for diverse needs.\nEvery business case is different, but cloud computing often turns out to be a good idea. It can enhance operational efficiency and scalability, allowing companies to adapt quickly to market changes and drive innovation. As an investor, you may want to consider how your favorite companies (and their rivals) make use of cloud computing.\nLook for companies that effectively utilize the cloud to optimize their operations, improve productivity, and deliver better value to customers. You can look at their cloud strategies, including how they rely on public, private, or hybrid setups. Understanding their cloud utilization provides insights into each company's long-term potential, and their choices can give you important clues about how they think about their business operations.\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nHow Netflix built a global video-streaming service around Amazon Web Services\nOne well-known example of cloud computing's real-world impact is Netflix's early and confident adoption of Amazon Web Services. The media-streaming giant was one of the first companies to fully embrace AWS for its digital operations, and this strategic choice played a crucial role in the company's ability to roll out a global service at the proverbial drop of a hat.\nThanks to AWS's network of high-powered and geographically distributed computing and networking tools, Netflix was instantly able to handle its fast-growing user base and serve nearly every country in the world. With traditional Netflix-owned data centers, expanding operations to different regions would have been a complex and time-consuming process. But by leveraging AWS's cloud services, Netflix kickstarted its worldwide video-streaming platform at a moment's notice.\nThe partnership between Netflix and AWS has been mutually beneficial. Netflix benefits from AWS's battle-tested infrastructure and service offerings, while AWS proudly showcases Netflix as one of its largest and most prominent customers. Thanks to many years of tight-knot experience and a world-class engineering team, Netflix has automated its AWS deployment and operations in thousands of unique ways.\nNetflix using AWS is a prime example of how cloud computing can be a game-changer for businesses. It can offer top-notch services to people all around the world without investing untold billions of dollars to build in-house data centers. The cloud gives businesses more tools to unlock their true potential, especially when you want to run your business on a global scale."

      "text": "Free cash flow (FCF) is the cash that remains after a company pays to support its operations and makes any capital expenditures (purchases of physical assets such as property and equipment). Free cash flow is related to, but not the same as, net income. Net income is commonly used to measure a company's profitability, while free cash flow provides better insight into both a company's business model and the organization's financial health.\nWhat is free cash flow?\nWhat is free cash flow?\nFree cash flow is calculated using several items from a company's cash flow statement. To determine FCF, subtract \"capital expenditures\" from \"net cash from operating activities\" (sometimes listed as \"cash provided by operations\" or a similar term). The formula looks like this:\nFree cash flow = Net cash from operating activities - Capital expenditures\nIf a company (such as many high-growth technology companies) has \"capitalized software expenses\" or regularly reports \"business acquisitions\" on its cash flow statements, then these cash outlays are also subtracted from \"net cash from operating activities\" to calculate FCF.\nTo find these items in a company's quarterly or annual filing, look for the cash flow statement. This table is divided into three sections: Operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. \"Net cash from operating activities\" (or something similar) can be found under the operating activities section, while \"capital expenditures\" and other qualifying expenses are listed under investing activities.\nHow to calculate FCF\nHow to calculate FCF\nHere are two real-world FCF examples from two different companies, Chevron and Nike.\nFirst, from Chevron's statement of cash flows from its 2022 annual report.\n(Net cash provided by operating activities of $49.6 billion) - (Capital expenditures of $12 billion) = Free cash flow of $37.6 billion\nAnd from Nike's 2022 annual report filing under the consolidated statement of cash flows:\n(Cash provided by operations of $5.2 billion) - (Additions to property, plant, and equipment of $758 million) = Free cash flow of $4.4 billion.\nAs you can see, FCF is calculated for all types of companies. A company that requires heavy investment in property and equipment like Chevron can produce meaningful free cash flow. So can companies with lots of non-physical assets like branding and e-commerce sites such as Nike.\nWhatever the company does for business, FCF is a simple measure of leftover cash at the end of a stated period of time. This remaining cash is available to the company for paying off debt, paying dividends to shareholders, or funding stock repurchase programs. (Such transactions are recorded in the \"financing activities\" section of the cash flow statement).\nThe free cash flow figure can also be used in a discounted cash flow model to estimate the future value of a company.\nCash Flow\nHow FCF differs from net income and EBITDA\nHow FCF differs from net income and EBITDA\nFree cash flow is different from a company's net earnings or net loss, which are used to calculate the popular earnings per share (EPS) and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios.\nFCF excludes non-cash items like depreciation and amortization (assessed for only tax purposes to account for the values of assets paid for in the past), changes in inventory values, and stock-based employee compensation. Because FCF only encompasses cash transactions, it gives a clearer picture of just how profitable a company is.\nFCF can also reveal whether a company is manipulating its earnings -- such as via the sale of assets (a non-operating line item) or by adjusting the value of its inventory of products for sale. Or, if a company made a large purchase (like buying a new property or investing in new intangible assets) in the recent past, then free cash flow could be higher than net income -- or still positive even when a company reports a net loss.\nFCF is also different from earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Unlike FCF, EBITDA excludes both interest payments on debt and tax payments. Like FCF, EBITDA can help to reveal a company's true cash-generating potential and can be useful to compare one firm's profit potential to its peers.\nAsset\nFCF is important -- but still has limitations\nFCF is important -- but still has limitations\nFCF, as compared with net income, gives a more accurate picture of a firm's financial health and is more difficult to manipulate, but it isn't perfect. Because it measures cash remaining at the end of a stated period, it can be a much \"lumpier\" metric than net income.\nFor example, if a company purchases new property, FCF could be negative while net income remains positive. Likewise, FCF can remain positive while net income is far less or even negative. If a company receives a large one-time payment for services rendered, its FCF very likely may remain positive even if it incurs high amortization expenses (like the costs of software and other intangible assets for a cloud computing company).\nBecause of the short-term variability inherent in FCF, many investors opt to evaluate the health of a company using net income since it smooths out the peaks and valleys in profitability. However, when evaluated over long periods of time, FCF provides a better picture of a company's actual operational results. FCF is also useful for measuring a company's ability to pay down debt and fund dividend payments.\nNegative FCF reported for an extended period of time could be a red flag for investors. Negative FCF drains cash and assets from a company's balance sheet, and, when a company is low on funds, it may need to cut or eliminate its dividend or raise more cash via the sale of new debt or stock.\nRelated investing topics\nUse FCF as part of your stock selection process\nUse FCF as part of your stock selection process\nFree cash flow has its limitations, but it can also be a powerful tool. Consider it along with other metrics such as sales growth and the cash flow-to-debt ratio to fully assess whether a stock is worthy of your hard-earned money."

      "text": "In a little more than a generation, e-commerce has become one of the biggest industries in the world, showing the power of the internet and the appeal of convenience, fast delivery, and the ability to shop from the comfort of your home. While you have likely shopped online, you might not know the whole story behind e-commerce or how you can take advantage of online retail platforms to make money for yourself. Keep reading to learn more.\nWhat is e-commerce?\nWhat is e-commerce?\nE-commerce is shorthand for electronic commerce. Essentially, it\u2019s the buying and selling of goods online and the related businesses that facilitate it, such as those that provide supply chain management, fulfillment, payment processing, and software.\nE-commerce emerged shortly after the widespread adoption of the world wide web, which opened up a brand-new selling channel. Instead of having to visit a store or order from a catalog, consumers were now able to shop through the internet, and businesses had a convenient new selling channel.\nThe best-known e-commerce company in the U.S. is Amazon (AMZN 3.12%), an industry pioneer in the U.S. and much of the world.\nAmazon has set expectations among consumers, using a model built around a wide selection, fast and free delivery with its Prime loyalty program, competitive prices, and convenience.\nBrick-and-mortar retailers, like Walmart (WMT -1.18%), have imitated components of Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business model, while others have paved their own way.\nEtsy (ETSY -0.45%), for example, operates a marketplace for handmade and other unique items, which has given the company its own niche in e-commerce that attracts artisans and buyers who want items they can\u2019t find anywhere else.\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) is another example of a different kind of e-commerce company. It sells software to run e-commerce websites and businesses. Shopify has more than 1 million subscribers who use its products to run their own e-commerce businesses.\nMaking money in e-commerce\nHow do you make money in e-commerce?\nYou don\u2019t have to be Amazon to make money in e-commerce. In fact, one of the things that are appealing about the industry is that even individual sellers can start e-commerce businesses, making online retail more accessible than traditional physical retail.\nIf you want to sell online, you simply need a product. From there, you can partner with any one of a number of e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, Etsy, and Shopify, depending on your target audience and how much control you want to have over your e-commerce business.\nAmazon Bedrock\nIf you sell on Amazon, for example, your brand will be subsumed within the broader Amazon platform, making it harder to draw traffic to your website. If that\u2019s your goal, a website like Shopify would be a better fit since Shopify gives you the tools you need to sell online from your own website.\nOne way to run a successful e-commerce business is by selling a niche product that isn\u2019t widely available or that consumers are often looking for.\nAnother idea is retail arbitrage. Retail arbitrageurs find cheap goods by going to closeout sales, thrift stores, and other such discount opportunities and then selling those products online for more money. The resale market through sites like eBay (EBAY 0.36%) offers a good platform for arbitrage.\nIndividual sellers can also take advantage of features like dropshipping, which means that they don\u2019t even need to hold inventory. They can arrange for the product to be shipped directly to the customer\u2019s address once it\u2019s ordered.\nInvesting in e-commerce\nInvesting in e-commerce\nE-commerce isn\u2019t just a good business for online sellers. It\u2019s also been highly lucrative for investors as stocks like Amazon and Shopify have soared over their histories.\nMore recently, e-commerce stocks have struggled as they faced difficult comparisons with the pandemic boom, and consumer shopping habits have shifted back to stores and services like travel and restaurants. However, the online retail channel should recover since there\u2019s still a lot of market share to be gained from brick-and-mortar retailers.\nNo one knows when the next bull market will start, but based on their long-term success and discount stock prices, it\u2019s a good bet that e-commerce stocks will outperform when the stock market bounces back."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Computers excel at crunching numbers but not at tasks that many people do with ease, like language processing, visual perception, object manipulation, reasoning, planning, and learning. Artificial intelligence (AI), including its offshoots of deep learning and machine learning, uses computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as language generation and facial recognition.\nAI stocks are shares of companies that are developing or employing AI technology as part of their business. AI stocks span sectors like semiconductors, software, and even beyond tech, representing companies that are using AI in ways that set them apart from their peers.\nHow AI is used\nHow do companies use artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is created through machine learning, which involves training a system on vast amounts of data. It then uses the trained system to make inferences about data it's never seen.\nThe simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images containing those objects are provided to the system, which \"learns\" how to detect them in other images. The more objects it detects in images, the more accurate the detection system becomes.\nCompanies employ AI in two main ways. Many tech companies use it to make their existing operations more powerful through high-profile applications like robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants.\nFor instance, AI is used by Alphabet (GOOGL 3.1%) (GOOG 2.98%) subsidiary Google to filter spam in Gmail, by Amazon (AMZN 3.12%) to recommend products to customers, and by Netflix (NFLX -0.2%) to guide content creation and recommendations.\nMore recently, OpenAI's ChatGPT has shown how far generative AI -- a division of artificial intelligence capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas -- has come. It can answer questions directly, write poems, and has even passed bar and medical exams.\nIt has spawned a wave of new generative AI chatbots, including Anthropic's Claude, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta Platforms' (META 2.04%) Meta AI. The potential is enormous.\nThe next frontier for generative AI is AI agents or agentic AI. This technology allows AI to perform and complete whole tasks without being prompted. For instance, an automated customer service agent that could handle a request without needing human assistance would be agentic AI. Salesforce's (CRM 0.91%) AgentForce is one example of a new agentic AI tool.\nSome companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology requires. These are true AI stocks and include those listed and described below.\n5 top AI stocks\n5 AI stocks to buy in 2025\n| Company | AI Focus |\n|---|---|\n| Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Data center GPUs and superchips |\n| Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | Generative AI and self-driving cars |\n| Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Memory chips for data centers and generative AI tools |\n| CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) | Generative AI-focused cloud infrastructure platform |\n| Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) | AI chatbots, LLMs, and wearable devices |\n1. Nvidia\nLeading graphics processing unit (GPU) company Nvidia has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its GPUs becoming the de facto standard in data centers worldwide. Generative AI's training phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the inference phase, typically requires less.\nGPU chips, which were once used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well. Nvidia's ambitions have gone beyond GPUs, as the company now aims to build AI factories or data centers full of Nvidia components to run AI applications and programming.\nNvidia's data center business now makes up the vast majority of the company's revenue, thanks to the emergence of generative AI. Because it sells the building blocks for AI infrastructure, Nvidia became the first major company to see a significant revenue boost from AI.\nRevenue surged through 2023 and 2024, and the stock has soared as well. It's been the most valuable company in the world on several occasions and was No. 1 in July 2025. It also became the first company to reach a market cap of $4 trillion. In 2024, full-year revenue jumped 114% to $130.5 billion, driven by the surge in data center demand, and growth is expected to be strong in 2025 as well.\nNvidia's chips are popular for running demanding workloads that applications like large language models (LLMs) require. The pure-play chip stock is now selling its new Blackwell platform, which major cloud infrastructure services are deploying in 2025, and demand is outstripping supply.\nSelf-driving cars and \"physical AI\" are other areas of focus. Nvidia develops hardware and software platforms that can power driver-assistance features and fully autonomous driving, which could be a significant source of revenue if that industry takes off. Automotive revenue is only a small fraction of the company's revenue, but that could change.\nWith Tesla (TSLA 6.18%) having launched its robotaxi network in Austin, the autonomous vehicle race appears to be heating up, and that should be good news for the semiconductor sector.\nA self-driving car must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require tremendous computing power, which is exactly what Nvidia's platform delivers.\nIts professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has potential in AI. Nvidia's chipsets could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but the company is in an enviable position for now.\n2. Alphabet\nAlphabet has been preparing for the AI revolution for years, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014. It's also among the leaders in autonomous vehicles through its Waymo subsidiary, which is now ferrying passengers in its driverless cars in cities such as San Francisco and Phoenix.\nAlphabet launched Gemini -- its own AI chatbot and the latest iteration in its competition with ChatGPT -- which some see as a threat to Google Search. So far, concerns about a challenge to its search dominance seem to have been overblown, as Alphabet's ad revenue continues to grow steadily.\nThe company said that its Gemini 2.5 has been \"widely recognized as the best model in the industry.\" New features, like AI assistant and AI mode, have helped Google Search defend its market share against AI-based challenges.\nWith information at the heart of its business, it's unsurprising that the company has prioritized AI. It's rolled out AI tools for Google Cloud and Google Workspace, including a generative AI assistant that helps write emails. Even its customer acquisition strategy in the cloud is based around AI -- the company has targeted AI start-ups for its cloud infrastructure service.\nAI also plays a role in improving its search engine and YouTube, where it can pinpoint a relevant section of a video and direct users straight to it. Finally, Alphabet is ramping up spending on capital expenditures, with plans to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure and related needs in 2025.\n3. Microsoft\nMicrosoft has gotten lots of buzz lately, thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. The tech giant began investing in the tech start-up in 2019 and invested another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.\nMicrosoft has incorporated GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Copilot for Microsoft 365. Azure OpenAI has seen a particularly strong uptake, now counting more than 65% of the Fortune 500 as customers.\nCEO Satya Nadella has repeatedly said that he sees AI as the next major computing platform. The reported $13 billion investment in OpenAI is a sign of the company's conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition or get left behind, as it did with mobile.\nMore recently, Microsoft has begun diversifying away from OpenAI. It has been adding both internal and third-party models to products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure, including DeepSeek's R1.\nThe long-term implications for its relationship with OpenAI are unclear, but Microsoft seems to think it's wise to hedge its bets in the AI race. The relationship continues to evolve, but Microsoft sees the start-up's technology as critical for its AI strategy.\nMicrosoft is harnessing the power of AI in other ways, too, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs. It's also using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools. It launched Azure AI Foundry in November 2024, enabling its customers to create and manage AI apps and agents. As of April 2025, developers at more than 70,000 companies are using it.\n4. CoreWeave\nCoreWeave, which had its initial public offering (IPO) in March 2025, may be the closest thing to a pure-play AI stock on the market, and it launched the first major AI IPO. Its cloud infrastructure platform was designed specifically for AI, and it counts customers like Nvidia, OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft as part of its core customer base. Nvidia and OpenAI are both investors in the company.\nCoreWeave has grown at an incredible pace over the last three years, going from generating almost no revenue in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2024. Between 2022 and 2024, revenue grew by more than 100 times.\nCoreWeave's business is risky since Microsoft accounts for 62% of its revenue, meaning the business would suffer significantly if Microsoft were to pull back on spending with the platform. In its first-quarter 2025 report, CoreWeave said that no single company accounted for more than half of its backlog, a sign that its customer concentration is improving.\nThe company announced plans for a $6 billion data center in July. It's also acquiring Core Scientific, which will bulk up its AI infrastructure with 1.3 gigawatts (GW) in power capacity.\nIf you're looking for direct exposure to AI, CoreWeave is a good option since essentially all of its revenue is driven by demand for computing power to run generative AI programs. However, the stock is risky, as CoreWeave has a high debt burden, large capital expenditures, and is deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles basis (GAAP).\n5. Meta Platforms\nUnlike the other big tech companies on this list, Meta Platforms doesn't have a cloud computing business, but it's investing just as much in AI as peers like Alphabet. Meta AI, the company's chatbot, is available on its apps (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) and had 1 billion monthly active users as of May. Meta continues to update its Llama large language model, which is now up to Llama 4.\nIt's also allowing its advertisers to use AI creative tools for things like background and video generation and ad copy. AI is involved in ad targeting as well, and the company aims to fully automate advertising with AI by 2026.\nAdditionally, the company is incorporating AI in its hardware division, including its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which offer a built-in camera, open-ear audio, and a range of hands-free features. Its Meta Quest headsets are also connected to Meta AI, allowing users to tap into the power of AI through the devices.\nIn June, it acquired 49% of data-labeling specialist Scale AI for $14.8 billion and brought Scale CEO Alexandr Wang on to run an AI research lab at Meta. The tech giant has also made a number of smaller acquisitions in AI. Management sees AI at the core of its business and driving its transformation across areas such as advertising, experiences, and devices.\nMachine learning\nMachine learning stocks\nAll the stocks above use machine learning technologies. However, if you're looking for even more options, here are two others worth considering:\nPalantir\nPalantir (PLTR 1.6%) has been one of the top-performing AI stocks. The company provides cloud software and specializes in data fusion that helps its customers make important insights by connecting disparate pieces of information hidden in data.\nIt also launched its AI Platform (AIP) in 2023, which has helped accelerate its growth. Palantir deploys machine learning models on top of data foundations and continuously improves them to ensure they become more useful.\nTesla\nTesla is best known for its electric vehicles (EVs). CEO Elon Musk sees AI as the future of the company, and machine learning and neural networks are very much at the center of the company's autonomous vehicle and Optimus autonomous robot projects.\nTesla introduced its driverless Cybercab in October 2024, and the company hopes to begin producing the vehicles by 2026. It launched its robotaxi network in June, though with just a handful of vehicles, and Musk envisions the company expanding to other cities in the near future. Musk has said Tesla's automation technology could make it the most valuable company in the world.\nDeep learning\nDeep learning stocks\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It's the most advanced kind of AI and is crucial in technologies like self-driving cars. Deep learning is advancing in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary. It differs from machine learning in that it doesn't require human input.\nNvidia is among the companies closely associated with deep learning. Its GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.\nAlphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up, Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.\nRelated investing topics\nA growth business\nAI is a growth business\nAccording to International Data Corporation, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $235 billion in 2024 to more than $631 billion in 2028. While the AI market is already large and still growing quickly, plenty of companies can profit from AI. Although picking stocks in a growth industry comes with a lot of uncertainty, these top AI stocks are all worth considering.\nFAQ\nArtificial intelligence stocks: FAQ\nWhat is the best AI stock to buy?\nArtificial intelligence is a fast-moving technology, and AI stocks will likely be volatile as the sector evolves. AI stocks that have attracted the most attention include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but finding the best stock to buy is also a matter of price and valuation, which changes quickly.\nIs it good to buy Nvidia stock?\nNvidia has jumped into the lead among semiconductor companies in making AI chips and accelerators, and it has the competitive advantages to help it stay there. The semiconductor sector can also be highly cyclical, and pricing can change rapidly.\nAdditionally, there's the potential for unexpected surprises, such as the DeepSeek launch, which sent AI stocks like Nvidia plunging. If Nvidia can maintain its lead in AI chips, the stock should continue to be a winner, but it will likely be volatile since the AI landscape is still developing.\nWhat is the biggest AI company?\nCurrently, the biggest company that has made AI central to its business model is Nvidia, with a market cap that has soared past $4 trillion. The tech giant is at the center of the AI revolution, with components that are fueling AI applications and in high demand by major cloud infrastructure companies and others.\nIs AI good for investing?\nArtificial intelligence is likely to shake up the economy and the business world, creating opportunities in the stock market. Whether AI is good for investing will depend on the company, but there will be winners from the new technology.\nWhat company is No. 1 in AI?\nCurrently, Nvidia is broadly considered the leader in AI technology. The company has a monopoly-like market share in the data center GPU market, and its revenue has more than tripled since ChatGPT launched. Nvidia isn't guaranteed to remain the leader, though. Competition is on the way, and new technologies can change quickly.\nWill AI start-ups challenge tech giants?\nTech giants aren't feeling a significant threat from start-ups yet, but there are some signs that competition is on the rise. Alphabet stock, for example, fell when Apple said it was considering making AI search engines available on Safari, directly competing with Google.\nThe tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft also show that start-ups could begin to pose more of a threat to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, though they are unlikely to derail their growth."

      "text": "Traditionally, a point-of-sale (POS) system was just a cash register, but over the years they\u2019ve evolved with technology to include credit readers, barcode scanners, receipt printers, and app readers to allow for easy and convenient payment.\nKeep reading to learn more about point-of-sale systems, how they work, what they do, and how they can help your business.\nWhat is a point-of-sale system?\nWhat is a point-of-sale system?\nA POS (point-of-sale) system refers to any device or technology used where a sale is made. Whether it\u2019s used for a brick-and-mortar store or an online business, a POS system typically consists of a set of devices that help businesses take payments. These include credit card readers, receipt printers, and other devices such as scanners that cashiers use to ring up sales and accept payment.\nDepending on the type of business, there are different features that a point-of-sale system might use. In certain kinds of businesses, such as restaurants, you may want to have the ability to prompt the customer to tip, and mobile card readers can help business associates or a server in a restaurant ring up a customer away from the POS station, adding convenience.\nThe POS system also tracks sales, inventory, and other information so you know how your business is performing, and it can make adjustments accordingly.\nWhat can a point-of-sale system do?\nUnlike the old days when a point-of-sale system was mostly a cash register and (maybe) a credit card reader, a POS can now be fully integrated into business operations.\nFor instance, a restaurant could have a point-of-sale system that sends orders to the kitchen, schedules tables for reservations, and even tracks inventory to assist with ordering. A POS could also be used for employees to clock in and out, tracking labor expenses as well as product costs. Such systems can save a lot of the human labor that used to be necessary for tasks such as inventory management, freeing up time for more valuable work.\nBecause the POS system is digital, the information can be tracked from anywhere. For instance, a small business owner can check in on sales even when they\u2019re not in the store simply by using an app. As technology improves, automation and other POS features are likely to get even better, making it easier for owner-operators and others to run their businesses.\nHow to choose\nHow to choose a point-of-sale system\nBusiness owners and others have lots of different options today. Tech companies such as Block (NYSE:SQ), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Toast (TOST 3.0%), and LightSpeed (LSPD 4.52%) are all eager to sign you up to their services.\nFor these tech companies, point-of-sale systems have high retention rates and are good business models because they allow these companies to keep collecting money on transaction fees after you\u2019ve purchased the hardware and installed the software. Typically, they come with monthly subscription fees.\nIf you\u2019re considering buying a POS system, you\u2019ll want to check on fees for payment processing, which is generally based on a percentage of a sale plus a flat fee, and the monthly subscription fee, which can vary depending on the type of plan.\nYou\u2019ll also find that different companies specialize in different kinds of systems for different businesses. For instance, Toast is focused on the restaurant industry, and Block\u2019s Square is also popular among small restaurants and retail shops. Shopify is mostly designed for online sellers, although it can also be used in stores. Consider the different features you\u2019d like your POS system to have and choose which system best matches your needs.\nHow they can improve business\nHow a POS system can improve your business\nIf you\u2019re considering upgrading your current POS system, there are a lot of new features that can help your business and make it easier to run.\nIf you have a retail store or a storefront business, you might want to upgrade your POS system to add features such as invoicing, scheduling inventory management, and analytics to help you make better decisions about your business.\nA good point-of-sale system can also improve the customer experience by allowing for more payment methods and processing faster transactions. It can provide better security, making you less vulnerable to a data breach, and it also saves time for your employees, freeing them to work on tasks that will add value to your business.\nFor modern, customer-facing businesses, a POS system is an essential tool, and investing in one is likely to pay off in added convenience and improved data. With the next bull market around the corner, a new point-of-sale system could help capitalize on the economic recovery."
