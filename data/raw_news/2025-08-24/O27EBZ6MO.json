  "title": "Elon Musk Loses *Again* - Tesla Must Face Class Action Lawsuit over Misleading 'Full Self-Driving' Claims",
  "description": "A District Judge has ruled that Elon Musk's Tesla must face a class action lawsuit filed by California drivers who allege that Musk misled them for eight years about the self-driving capabilities of the company's EVs.",
  "content": "A District Judge has ruled that Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla must face a class action lawsuit filed by California drivers who allege that Musk misled them for eight years about the self-driving capabilities of the company\u2019s EVs.\n\nReuters reports that Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla is facing a significant legal challenge as District Judge Rita Lin has certified a class action lawsuit against the company over its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. The decision allows two groups of California drivers who purchased the FSD package to collectively sue Tesla for allegedly misleading them about the autonomous driving capabilities of their vehicles. The company had fought efforts to certify the case as a class action.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that Tesla and Musk made false claims about the company\u2019s ability to achieve high-level autonomy, citing the lack of sensors and the inability to demonstrate a long-distance autonomous drive with any of its vehicles. Judge Lin noted that thousands of people were likely exposed to Tesla\u2019s assertions about its vehicles containing hardware for full self-driving, which were made on the company\u2019s website, blog posts, newsletters, and even during a press conference by Musk himself.\n\nTesla\u2019s unique advertising strategy, which forgoes traditional mass advertising and independent dealers, played a significant role in the judge\u2019s decision. Lin stated that it was reasonable to infer that class members interested in the FSD technology would have visited Tesla\u2019s website to gather information, making the company\u2019s statements material to their purchasing decisions.\n\nThis courtroom loss for Musk comes on the heels of Tesla being found partially at fault for a lawsuit that caused the death of a woman and badly injured her boyfriend. As Breitbart News previously reported, safety expert Missy Cummings was highly critical of Musk and Tesla\u2019s claims about Autopilot and FSD in her testimony:\n\nAccording to Cummings, Tesla\u2019s owner\u2019s manual, which contains crucial warnings about the Autopilot system\u2019s functionality, is not easily accessible to drivers. She also pointed out that Tesla had been grappling with drivers ignoring computer-generated warnings prior to the crash. Cummings noted that the company had not implemented geo-fencing, a technology already in use by other car manufacturers to prevent drivers from activating driver-assistance features on roads unsuitable for such systems. When asked by Brett Schreiber, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, about Tesla\u2019s decision not to use geo-fencing in 2019, Cummings responded, \u201cI believe they were using that as a way to sell more cars.\u201d Cummings, who previously served as a senior adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), is expected to face questioning from Tesla\u2019s lawyers when she returns to the witness stand.\n\nThe certified classes include drivers who bought the FSD package from May 19, 2017, to July 31, 2024, and opted out of Tesla\u2019s arbitration agreement, as well as those who purchased the package from October 20, 2016, to May 19, 2017. However, the judge refused to certify a class of drivers who bought Tesla\u2019s Enhanced Autopilot package, as its core product qualities did not require full self-driving functionality, rendering Tesla\u2019s alleged false statements immaterial to their purchasing decisions.\n\nTesla\u2019s lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling. The company had previously argued that it was unreasonable to assume all class members had seen the challenged statements and that there was no common proof of the statements\u2019 materiality.\n\nThis class action lawsuit comes at a time when federal officials are examining the safety of Tesla\u2019s full self-driving software, which is also a crucial component of the company\u2019s proposed robotaxi service. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for Tesla\u2019s reputation and the future of its autonomous driving technology.\n\nRead more at Reuters here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.",

      "text": "A safety expert has testified that Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla failed to adequately protect against the misuse of its Autopilot system, which a lawsuit claimed caused a fatal crash in 2019.\nBloomberg reports that in a Miami court, Mary \u201cMissy\u201d Cummings, an engineering professor at George Mason University, has called into question Tesla\u2019s efforts to prevent the misuse of Elon Musk\u2019s Autopilot system. Her testimony comes as part of a federal trial over a fatal 2019 collision involving a Tesla Model S in Key Largo, Florida.\nAccording to Cummings, Tesla\u2019s owner\u2019s manual, which contains crucial warnings about the Autopilot system\u2019s functionality, is not easily accessible to drivers. She also pointed out that Tesla had been grappling with drivers ignoring computer-generated warnings prior to the crash. Cummings noted that the company had not implemented geo-fencing, a technology already in use by other car manufacturers to prevent drivers from activating driver-assistance features on roads unsuitable for such systems.\nWhen asked by Brett Schreiber, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, about Tesla\u2019s decision not to use geo-fencing in 2019, Cummings responded, \u201cI believe they were using that as a way to sell more cars.\u201d Cummings, who previously served as a senior adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), is expected to face questioning from Tesla\u2019s lawyers when she returns to the witness stand.\nThe trial, expected to last three weeks, is the first federal case to challenge Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s claims about the safety of his company\u2019s vehicles. It comes at a crucial time for Tesla as the company pushes to launch its robotaxi business and stakes its future partially on autonomous driving technology.\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of Naibel Benavides Leon, who was killed, and Dillon Angulo, who suffered serious injuries when a Tesla Model S drove through a T-intersection in Key Largo, leaving the pavement and striking their parked Chevrolet Tahoe as they stood nearby. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance system was defective and that the company failed to adequately warn users about its limitations. Tesla, however, maintains that the crash resulted from driver error, a defense the company has successfully used in two previous California trials where Autopilot was blamed for accidents.\nGeorge McGee, the driver of the Model S involved in the crash, had engaged the driver-assistance system but had dropped his mobile phone and was not watching the road while reaching for the device on the floorboard. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have repeatedly shown jurors augmented video clips from the car\u2019s cameras, demonstrating that the system identified the road\u2019s edge, paint indicating a stop sign, the parked Tahoe, and a nearby pedestrian.\nTesla argues that no technology available in 2019 could have prevented the crash and that McGee was entirely at fault for pressing the accelerator and overriding the vehicle\u2019s adaptive cruise control before veering off the road.\nWhen questioned about a letter Tesla sent to NHTSA claiming that \u201cAutopilot has the most robust set of warnings against driver misuses and abuse of any feature ever deployed in the automotive industry,\u201d Cummings told the jury, \u201cI saw no evidence that would back up this claim that they have the most robust set of warnings.\u201d\nCummings, who has faced criticism from Tesla fans and was called \u201cextremely biased against Tesla\u201d by Musk when she was appointed as a safety adviser for NHTSA in 2021, has served as an expert witness in at least two other lawsuits against Tesla related to the Autopilot system.\nThe professor stated that McGee clearly believed the car was his copilot and would stop for obstacles in the road, a sentiment shared by many Tesla drivers who feel they can rely on Autopilot to navigate while they attend to other tasks, such as retrieving a dropped phone\nRead more at Bloomberg here.\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.\nCOMMENTS\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting."

      "text": "A federal jury in Miami has found Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla partly at fault in a federal lawsuit over a 2019 Autopilot crash in Florida that left a young woman dead and her boyfriend badly hurt. The jury awarded the plaintiffs $200 million in punitive damages along with compensatory damages.\nCNBC reports that Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla has been found partly at fault in a personal injury trial over a fatal Autopilot crash that occurred in Florida in 2019. The case, being heard in the Southern District of Florida, marks the first time Tesla has been in front of a jury in federal court over allegations related to the safety of its Autopilot system.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys had asked the jury to award damages of approximately $345 million, which includes $109 million in compensatory damages and $236 million in punitive damages. Based on the jury\u2019s finding that Tesla held one-third of the blame for the accident, they award $200 million in punitive damages along with compensatory damages.\nThe lawsuit centers around a deadly crash that took place in Key Largo, Florida, involving a Tesla Model S electric sedan driven by George McGee. At the time of the incident, McGee was using Tesla\u2019s Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system.\nAccording to court testimony, McGee dropped his mobile phone while driving and attempted to retrieve it, believing that Enhanced Autopilot would brake if an obstacle was in the way. However, he accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 miles per hour, colliding with a nearby parked car and its owners, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle.\nThe crash resulted in the death of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides, who was found about 75 feet away from the point of impact. Her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, survived but suffered multiple broken bones, a traumatic brain injury, and psychological effects. The plaintiffs in the case include Benavides\u2019 surviving family members and Angulo, who are seeking compensation for medical expenses, pain and suffering, and wrongful death, as well as punitive damages.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers argued that Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems had dangerous defects that should have been known and addressed by the company. They also claimed that the use of Autopilot should have been restricted to roads where it could perform safely. Furthermore, the attorneys alleged that Musk and Tesla made false statements to customers, shareholders, and the public, exaggerating the safety benefits and capabilities of Autopilot, which encouraged drivers to overly rely on the system.\nIn response, Tesla\u2019s attorneys countered that the company had directly communicated with customers about the proper use of Autopilot and other features, and that McGee\u2019s driving was the primary cause of the collision. They emphasized that Tesla works to develop technology to save drivers\u2019 lives and that a ruling against the EV maker would send the wrong message.\nBreitbart News previously reported that a safety expert that testified at the trial was critical of Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cAutopilot\u201d and self driving technology:\nAccording to Cummings, Tesla\u2019s owner\u2019s manual, which contains crucial warnings about the Autopilot system\u2019s functionality, is not easily accessible to drivers.
