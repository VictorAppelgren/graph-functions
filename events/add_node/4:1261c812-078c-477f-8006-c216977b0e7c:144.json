      "importance": 4,
      "rationale": "The India Online Gaming Legislation 2025 is a sector‑specific policy event that will directly affect companies operating in the Indian online gaming market. While it can influence valuations and earnings within that niche, it does not have broad, immediate cross‑asset transmission or macro‑financial market impact. Therefore it falls under the policy/supporting category, warranting a level‑4 importance."
