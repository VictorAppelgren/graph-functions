  "title": "Orient Express Corinthian, World\u2019s Largest Sailing Yacht, Sets Sail In October 2026",
  "description": "The Corinthian promises Art Deco design on the high seas, calling at smaller islands and ports in the Caribbean",
  "content": "The Orient Express Corinthian, a 722-foot luxury yacht, sets sail on its inaugural Caribbean season in October 2026. You can think of it as the marriage of a private yacht and a vintage Art Deco train.\n\nWhat\u2019s the train connection? Well, the yacht is the brainchild of Orient Express, the company behind the recently launched La Dolce Vita Orient Express train, which I recently wrote about in Forbes. This is a train that has been thoughtfully designed to recall the splendor of 1960s Italian design as it takes well-heeled guests on jaunts around Italy. That same incredible attention to detail, albeit in a style that recalls the heyday of Art Deco, is also at work here.\n\nFrench yachtmaker Chantiers de l\u2019Atlantique was enlisted to build the Corinthian and its sister ship, Orient Express Olympian, with the latter expected to debut in 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s not that unusual for a luxury company that creates trains and hotels to venture into the world of luxury cruising. After all, hotel companies such as Belmond, Four Seasons, and Aman have also dipped their toes into yachts.\n\nA Ships that Recalls the Art Deo Style of the Normandie\n\nThis 54-suite sailing yacht will offer on board luxury and carefully crafted itineraries through some of the region\u2019s most beautiful destinations. Architect Maxime d\u2019Angeac, Artistic Director of Orient Express, conceived what the company describes in a press statement as \u201crefined interiors that reinterpret the golden age of rail travel with a contemporary sensibility, echoing the grandeur of legendary ocean liners such as Normandie, calling upon the finest French artisans of art and craft.\u201d\n\nThe Corinthian\u2019s 54 suites range in size from 485 square feet to an astonishing 2,476 square feet. All of them feature expansive picture windows or terraces and elevated ceilings. The ship's public areas include eight bars, a Parisian-themed cabaret, and five restaurants, the latter overseen by multi-Michelin-starred chef Yannick All\u00e9no, who is also Executive Chef of both the L\u2019Orient Express train and Orient Express Sailing Yachts.\n\nThere will be a recording studio, two swimming pools, and a marina as well.\n\nThe Corinthian will have three sails that were designed with \u2018SolidSail\u2019 technology, encompassing 16,000 square feet of rigid sails, with three masts reaching 328 feet high. The aim is for 100% propulsion based on weather conditions. As a backup, the ship\u2019s engines will have an environmentally friendly propulsion system that uses liquefied natural gas (LNG).\n\nOn October 12th, 2026, the Corinthian will sail from Lisbon on its inaugural 14-night transatlantic voyage to Barbados. The journey will have a wellness theme, and this will commence the ship\u2019s autumn and winter season. From October through March, Orient Express Corinthian will offer two to nine-night Caribbean escapes. With ports of call like Saint-Barth, Moskito Island, the Exumas, and Tobago Cays, the itineraries are mostly off-the-beaten-path stops in the Caribbean.\n\nOrient Express is part of Accor Group\u2019s collection of luxury brands and joined with LVMH in 2024. The company opened its first hotel, Orient Express La Minerva, in Rome this past April. I recently wrote about its second hotel, Orient Express Palazzo Don\u00e0 Giovannelli, which will debut in Venice in 2026, here in the pages of Forbes.\n\nGo to Orient Express Corinthian for more details.",

      "text": "For well-heeled Italophiles, the good news is that bookings have opened for Orient Express Palazzo Don\u00e0 Giovannelli in Venice, which is welcoming guests from April 2026 onward. Located in a 15th-century Venetian palazzo that reflects both Neogothic and Baroque architectural styles, the hotel has 47 guestrooms, suites, and apartments.\nOrient Express is a partnership between Accor and LVMH, the world\u2019s most prestigious luxury company (and not to be confused with Belmond, the company behind the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express and other trains and luxury hotels).\n\u201cMore than a hotel, Orient Express Palazzo Don\u00e0 Giovannelli is a transformative voyage through centuries of splendor.\u201d\nThis follows two other Orient Express and Accor debuts in 2025: the unveiling of their first hotel, Orient Express La Minerva in Rome, and the rollout of La Dolce Vita Orient Express luxury train, which I recently wrote about here in Forbes.\nOrient Express Palazzo Don\u00e0 Giovannelli is situated in Cannaregio. This island still feels like the Venice of half a century ago, a quiet place that\u2019s still the lair of residents and thankfully removed from the daily circus of San Marco.\nLocated at the confluence of two canals, the palazzo was a noble residence built in 1436 during the reign of architect Filippo Calendario, the visionary behind the Doge\u2019s Palace.\nFormerly the private residence of the Dona and Giovannelli families,who were great patrons of the arts, it was later gifted to the Duke of Urbino. The Palazzo Dona has a legacy of grandeur and celebration, not to mention gilded ballrooms and hidden passageways.\nThis extraordinary building was restored under the guidance of architect and interior designer Aline Asmar d\u2019Amman. It\u2019s a theatrical space, with period frescoes and mosaic floors. The architecture speaks to Venice as a crossroads of civilizations, blending the Neogothic and the Baroque, and the fa\u00e7ade has seven remarkable hand-carved Gothic windows.\n\u201cMore than a hotel, Orient Express Palazzo Don\u00e0 Giovannelli is a transformative voyage through centuries of splendor,\u201d Gilda Perez-Alvarado, Orient Express CEO, said in a press statement. \u201cRooted in the poetic vision of Orient Express, this Venetian property embodies a heritage in motion where every stay becomes a passage through memory, art, and emotion.\u201d\nA stay at the hotel begins with a dramatic journey. Guests arrive by private boat, arriving through a 15th-century Gothic portal on the canal, pass through a discreet doorway into Santa Fosca\u2019s secret garden, or step off the Strada Nova into the courtyard.\nThe theatrical lobby has a high wooden ceiling and is filled with light. There\u2019s a striking octagonal staircase, a 19th-century addition by Giovanni Battista Meduna, the architect behind Venice\u2019s Ca\u2019d\u2019Oro and the original La Fenice theatre. A celestial stone and glass vault crowns it.\nAt the Piano Nobile, you\u2019ll find a series of storied rooms, including the Baroque-style Vittoria Ballroom, created for the 1548 wedding of Princess Vittoria Farnese. The Library of Cultures is decorated with lapis lazuli pigments and gilded wood, while the Music Room is redolent of Venice\u2019s golden age.\nThere are 47 luxurious rooms, featuring 29 rooms and 16 suites, including six Signature Suites, and two Orient Express Apartments. The six Signature Suites are located on the Piano Nobile and the first floor. At the same time, the first-ever Orient Express Apartments are housed in an adjacent building and offer outstanding canal views.\nThe hotel\u2019s culinary offerings will include an intimate fine dining restaurant with private boat access, an all-day dining space overlooking the courtyard and lush garden \u2013 a rarity in Venice \u2013 and the iconic Wagon Bar, a nod to the golden age of rail travel.\nThere\u2019s more to come for Orient Express. They have two sailing yachts that will launch in 2026 and 2027. They also plan to bring back the original Orient Express train, which will travel across various routes in Europe.\nFor more details on the new Venice hotel, visit Orient Express Palazzo Don\u00e0 Giovannelli"

      "text": "La Dolce Vita Orient Express, the first Italian-made luxury train, rolled out of Roma Ostiense Station on April 4, 2025, on an inaugural journey that took passengers on a two-day \"Tastes of Tuscan Vineyards\" trip to the town of Montalcino.\nAs I discovered while working on my forthcoming book, National Geographic\u2019s 100 Train Journeys of a Lifetime: The World\u2019s Ultimate Rides (which will be published in October 2025), there\u2019s a growing demand for over-the-top train journeys that cater to small numbers of luxury travelers on trips through some of the world\u2019s most scenic locations, excursions that cater to slow travel, nostalgia, and an appetite for the golden days of rail travel.\nThe Journeys\nThe itineraries have been designed to create exclusive travel experiences, ranging from north to south in Italy, providing glimpses of the Alps as well as the southern coastline. The majority of the journeys will depart from Rome and can include cities such as Milan, Florence, and Venice, as well as the island of Sicily, via the world's only passenger rail ferry. Some trains will travel within Sicily, leaving from Catania and Palermo.\nTwo-night journeys include Rome, Venice, and Portofino, as well as Rome, Venice, and Siena. Themed journeys include Eternal Stones of Matera, The Truffle Route, and Rome to Sicily.\nThe itineraries have been created in tandem with Orient Express\u2019 first hotels, which will also debut in 2025: the Orient Express La Minerva in Rome and the Orient Express Palazzo Don\u00e0 Giovannelli in Venice.\nOn Board The Train\nLa Dolce Vita Orient Express has 12 carriages, with 31 cabins, including 18 suites, 12 deluxe cabins, and the signature La Dolce Vita Suite. The carriages were originally Z1 Italian model carriages, but they have been reimagined and rebuilt. The train is Italy\u2019s first private luxury rail fleet, with plans to have six such trains in the future. They all feature double beds, a sofa, armchairs, and a private bathroom. All cabins will offer room service, and the restaurant car will provide lunch, dinner, and afternoon tea. The Bar Car will feature live music, an aperitivo and antipasti buffet, after-dinner cocktails, and Italian wines. Chef Heinz Beck, based at the Rome Cavalieri, A Waldorf Astoria Hotel, holds three Michelin stars and oversees the dining program of La Dolce Vita, inspired by the regions it traverses. A new Orient Express Lounge at Roma Ostiense Station, created by artist-architect Hugo Toro, is where guests gather before the journey.\nThe 1960\u2019s Inspired Design\nThe train\u2019s design inspiration is La Dolce Vita, \u201cThe Sweet Life,\u201d a name bequeathed to an Italian attitude and lifestyle synonymous with the country\u2019s d\u00e9cor, art, and architecture of the 1960s. It was made famous by Federico Fellini\u2019s film of the same name. Dimorestudio, an architecture and design studio founded by Emiliano Salci and Britt Moran, undertook the design work, drawing inspiration from mid-century Italian design masters such as Gi\u00f2 Ponti, Nanda Vigo, Gae Aulenti, and Osvaldo Borsani. Expect playful geometric patterns and minimalist palettes.\nA La Dolce Vita Orient Express reservation includes the round-trip transfer to and from the train station, accommodation, the table d\u2019h\u00f4te, beverages (such as selected wine and spirits, mineral water, soft drinks, tea, and coffee), onboard entertainment, exclusive experiences, as well as all applicable taxes. There are optional off-board experiences for a fee. Prices do not include insurance and gratuities. Fares start at $3,828 per person per night in a deluxe cabin, based on double occupancy.\nThe Orient Express La Dolce Vita is a partnership between the French hotel group Accor and the Italian luxury hospitality group Arsenale S.P.A., with a railway partnership with Trenitalia\u2014Gruppo Ferrovie dello Stato\u2014and the Fondazione FS Italiane. Note that Orient Express is a different company from the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, which is owned by Belmond, a part of LVMH.\nDetails can be found at La Dolce Vita Orient Express."
