  "description": "President Donald Trump, 79, appeared to mistakenly refer to Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem as professional golfer Cristie Kerr on Aug. 5.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump appeared to mistakenly refer to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as professional golfer Cristie Kerr while he was thanking members of his Cabinet at a press conference on Aug. 5.\n\nThe flub occurred before the 79-year-old Trump signed an executive order to create a White House task force that will handle operations and security for the 2028 Summer Olympic Games to be held in Los Angeles. He acknowledged members of the task force, including Noem who was present at the briefing.\n\n\u201cI want to recognize several members of the task force, including our great Vice President JD Vance. JD, thank you very much. Thank you. Our equally great Attorney General Pam Bondi. Pam, thank you very much, Pam. Secretary of Homeland Security Cristie Kerr,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCristie Kerr, do you know who Cristie Kerr is?\u201d he said, as Vance and others on stage laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s a friend of mine. Great golfer.\u201d\n\n\u201cKristi Noem, she\u2019s a better golfer than you, that\u2019s the only thing,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut you\u2019re better at a lot of other things, but I want to thank you for being here, and for doing an unbelievable job.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Trump has mixed up names. When he ran for president in 2024, he confused former Republican South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, while discussing the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\nTrump is the oldest president to be sworn into office, and has often mocked former President Joe Biden, 82, over his age throughout the 2024 campaign and to this day. Questions about Biden\u2019s health have come to the forefront in recent months after several books detailed his alleged declining cognitive and physical activity.\n\nIn April, White House physician Sean Barbabella released a memo highlighting the results of Trump\u2019s annual physical examination. Barbabella wrote that Trump \u201c\u200b\u200bexhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State.\u201d",

James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committe, said a former Biden deputy chief of staff invoked her Fifth Amendment rights when asked if anyone \u201cinstructed her to lie regarding his health.\"\nWASHINGTON \u2212 A third aide who served under former President Joe Biden refused to answer questions before the Republican-led House Oversight Committee investigating Biden\u2019s mental fitness and his use of the autopen in office.\nThe committee chairman, Rep. James Comer, R-Kentucky, wrote on X that Annie Tomasini, former deputy chief of staff to Biden, invoked her Fifth Amendment rights when asked if Biden, his family, or anyone in the White House \u201cinstructed her to lie regarding his health at any time.\u201d\nComer said she also evaded questions regarding Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents.\nThe Constitution's Fifth Amendment protects citizens from being forced to testify in official proceedings. This is the third time a witness in the GOP-led investigation has invoked the Fifth Amendment.\nThe previous two were Anthony Bernal, former chief of staff to first lady Jill Biden, and Biden's White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that Ms. Tomasini and others refuse to answer basic questions about President Biden\u2019s fitness to serve,\" Comer wrote on X. \"It\u2019s apparent they would rather hide key information to protect themselves and Joe Biden than be truthful with the American people about this historic scandal.\"\nQuestions about Biden\u2019s health have come to the forefront in recent months after several books detailed his alleged declining cognitive and physical activity.\nOne such book, \u201cOriginal Sin,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Axios\u2019 Alex Thompson, includes information from White House aides and officials who said he \u201cdropped off considerably,\u201d had heavily scripted Cabinet meetings and forgot basic facts.\nTrump and other Republicans have alleged that Biden\u2019s aides used an autopen to sign off on clemency decisions without Biden\u2019s authorization.\nBut Biden defended himself in a July 13 New York Times interview.\n\"They\u2019ve lied so consistently about almost everything they\u2019re doing. The best thing they can do is try to change the focus and focus on something else,\" Biden told the Times. \"It's consistent with Trump\u2019s game plan all along.\"\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA TODAY"

      "text": "After Trump appears to confuse her with Nancy Pelosi, Nikki Haley asks: Is the former president ok?\nKEENE, N.H. - A day after Donald Trump repeatedly cited Nikki Haley when talking about former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the real Haley offered a theory as to why: maybe the GOP frontrunner is not mentally fit?\n\"When you\u2019re dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can\u2019t have someone else that we question whether they\u2019re mentally fit to do this - we can\u2019t,\" Haley, 52, told supporters in Keene, N.H., referring to the 77-year-old former president.\nHer criticism follows some seemingly rambling comments Trump made about Haley while he was at a rally in New Hampshire, where he appears to be consolidating his lead against his rivals ahead of Tuesday's highly anticipated, first-in-the nation primary. He was referring to security of the U.S. Capitol before the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\"Nikki Haley, you know they, do you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it. All of it because of lots of things like Nikki Haley is in charge of security,\" Trump told supporters at a Concord rally. \"We offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guard, whatever they want. They turned it down. They don\u2019t want to talk about that. These are very dishonest people.\u201d\nTrump's argument over Jan. 6 security was with Pelosi \u2212 and his claim that she rejected his request of deploying 10,000 National Guard troops that day has been debunked.\nIn her response, Haley noted that she wasn't even in Washington on Jan. 6.\n\"He was on a temper tantrum about me, which is fine,\" said Haley, who is fighting hard for a strong second place in a race Trump is expected to win\n\"He does that often, but he went on and talked about how I kept the police from going into the Capitol on Jan. 6, went on and repeated that I didn\u2019t do anything to secure the Capitol,\u201d Haley added.\n'He got confused'\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear. I wasn\u2019t in the Capitol on Jan. 6. I wasn\u2019t in office on January 6th. He mentioned it three times,'' Haley said. ''He got confused.\"\nBoth Trump and Haley have showed gains in new polls released Sunday. Trump increased his lead over Haley by 2 points, to 19%, according to the latest Suffolk University/NBC10 Boston/Boston Globe daily tracking poll. Trump now leads by 55% to 36%; DeSantis is polling at 6%.\nSeeking to narrow that gap with the GOP frontrunner, Haley dug in on whether Trump is mentally fit.\u201cThe concern I have is \u2014 I\u2019m not saying anything derogatory \u2014 but when you\u2019re dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can\u2019t have someone else that we question whether they\u2019re mentally fit to do this,\u201d Haley said. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d\nContributing: Associated Press"

      "text": "Trump says he will use military, if needed, to secure 2028 Los Angeles Olympics\nDonald Trump said on Aug. 5 that he might call in National Guard troops and other members of the U.S. military to assist with security efforts at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\nTrump's comments came after he signed an executive order to create a White House task force that will handle an assortment of issues surrounding the Games, which will be the first on U.S. soil since 2002. It's been less than two months since he deployed thousands of troops to the Los Angeles area to suppress protests and protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during raids.\n\"We'll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe \u2212 including using our National Guard, or military,\" Trump said. \"I will use the National Guard or military \u2212 this is going to be so safe \u2212 if we have to.\"\nThe Olympics task force, which he will chair, will coordinate security and transportation efforts across various arms of the federal government, while also working to \"streamline visa processing and credentialing for foreign athletes, coaches, officials, and media,\" according to a fact sheet distributed by the White House. Those types of coordination efforts are common ahead of the Olympics and typically spearheaded by the federal government of the host nation.\nTrump was joined at the ceremony by several other members of the task force, including Vice President J.D. Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr. Former Olympic gymnast Nastia Liukin and Paralympic swimmer Brad Snyder were also on hand for the signing.\nCasey Wasserman, the chairperson of the 2028 Los Angeles organizing committee, praised Trump's longstanding support for the Games, dating back to the bid process during Trump's first term in office. He said the organization's Games plan was \"near final\" and said the White House task force will simply help elevate those plans.\n\"In just 1,074 days \u2212 yes we're counting, sir \u2212 the eyes of the world will be on this country,\" Wasserman said. \"... These will be truly America's Games.\"\nWasserman also gifted Trump a set of original Olympic medals from the last Summer Games to be held in Los Angeles, in 1984.\nIt is unclear how closely the task force will work with state entities and officials in California, such as Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Both are Democrats and have clashed with Trump over domestic policy issues in the heavily-Democratic state, including the Trump administration's attempts to enforce immigration law. Trump criticized Bass, in particular, during his remarks to reporters after signing the executive order.\n\"LA's a little bit different place than it was when selected, but we're going to bring it back stronger than ever,\" Trump added. \"I spoke to Casey about that. He said nope, we're going to make it better than ever. It's going to be something that makes it even more important as an Olympic Games.\n\"It was an interesting conversation we had, as the fires were raging. Is that right? And I appreciated that very much.\"\nTrump also used Tuesday's executive order news conference as an opportunity to praise the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee for its recent move to prevent transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.\nWhen asked about the possible participation of transgender women at the 2028 Olympics, Trump said there \"is going to be a very strong form of (gender) testing\" for competing athletes \u2212 though that would likely be in violation of LA28's host contract with the International Olympic Committee, unless the IOC approves or implements such testing independently.\nTrump was also asked about the chance that transgender women athletes could face criminal charges. He said he would defer such matters to Bondi.\nThe creation of the Olympics task force comes about five months after Trump created a similar task force to handle issues surrounding the 2026 FIFA World Cup for men's soccer. The president appointed Andrew Giuliani, the son of his close ally Rudy Giuliani, as executive director of that group.\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @tomschad.bsky.social."
