  "description": "The Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets begin a 3-game series Monday from Citi Field in Queens, New York.",
  "content": "The Philadelphia Phillies (76-54) and New York Mets (69-61) begin a 3-game NL East series Monday. First pitch from Citi Field in Queens, New York, is set for 7:10 p.m ET. Let's analyze BetMGM Sportsbook's MLB odds around the Phillies vs. Mets odds and make our expert MLB picks and predictions for the best bets.\n\nThe Phillies secured a series win Sunday with a 3-2 victory over the Washington Nationals, cashing as -241 home favorites as the Under (10) hit. SP Ranger Sua\u0301rez (7 IP, 0 ER, 3 H, 11 K) picked up his 10th win. C Rafael Marchan provided all of Philadelphia\u2019s offense, driving in 3 runs with a double and a bases-loaded walk. The Phillies have won 6 of their last 7 games and lead the Mets by 7 games.\n\nThe Mets closed their 6-game road trip with a 3-3 mark after losing 4-3 to the Braves Sunday as -130 favorites as the Under (9.5) cashed. 3B Mark Vientos provided an early boost with a 2-run homer in the second, but RP Gregory Soto took the loss after giving up 2 runs in the eighth innings of a tied game.\n\nSanchez (11-4, 2.46 ERA) is making his 26th start. He has a 1.10 WHIP, 2.2 BB/9 and 9.7 K/9 through 157 innings.\n\u2022 Last start: No-decision, 6 1/3 IP, 2 ER, 6 H, 2 BB, 12 K in 6-4 victory against the Seattle Mariners Tuesday\n\u2022 Last start vs. Mets: Loss, 2 IP, 2 ER, 4 H, 2 BB, 2 K in 5-1 home defeat April 22\n\nSenga (7-5, 2.58 ERA) is making his 21st start. He has a 1.25 WHIP, 4.3 BB/9 and 8.5 K/9 through 104 2/3 innings.\n\u2022 Last start: Loss, 5 IP, 4 ER (5 R), 6 H, 2 BB, 4 K in 5-4 loss at the Washington Nationals Wednesday\n\u2022 Career vs. Phillies: 1-1, 1.46 ERA (12 1/3 IP, 2 ER), 0.73 WHIP, 10.9 K/9 in 2 starts; last in 2023\n\nWin your fantasy baseball league with BaseballHQ.com.

Lines last updated at 12:14 a.m. ET.\n\nThe Mets return home Monday, and it couldn\u2019t come at a better time. They\u2019ve been a completely different team at Citi Field, boasting a 41-24 home record compared to their road struggles (28-37).\n\nThe Phillies remain one of the league\u2019s top clubs, but they haven\u2019t been quite as sharp on the road, hitting 36 points lower away from home. Sa\u0301nchez is 1-2 in his last 3 road starts, allowing 8 ER in 18 2/3 innings. That sets up an opportunity for the Mets, who are 19-17 against left-handed pitching.\n\nSenga, meanwhile, has been excellent against Philadelphia in his 2 career starts against them, allowing just 1 earned run in each. With the Mets 7 games back in the NL East, but fighting to maintain position in the Wild Card race, this is a pivotal series. The Phillies may be on cruise control, but New York has plenty to play for at home.\n\nDon't play around with the run line, take the Mets to win at home Monday night.\n\nThis total feels a little too low given the pitching matchup, and the trends lean heavily toward the Over. It has cashed in 6 of the last 10 meetings between these teams and is 4-2-1 in Philadelphia\u2019s last 7 games. The Mets have also gone Over in 3 of their last 4 contests. On top of that, Sa\u0301nchez has seen the Over hit in 2 of his last 3 starts. The Over looks like the stronger play here.\n\nPlay our free daily Pick\u2019em Challenge and win!

      "text": "Sports Betting 101: What is a point spread in sports betting?\nUnderstanding the different types of betting options is crucial when you're getting a start as a first-time sports bettor.\nThe point spread: Betting the spread\nFor those new to sports betting, the point spread is the simplest, most straightforward approach to placing wagers.\nSports books set a predetermined margin of points on a game and a team must win \u2013 or not lose \u2013 by that set number. That's why you'll often hear people say the team won, but they \"didn't cover the spread\" so their bet still came up short.\nIt's not a matter of a team winning or losing like in a moneyline bet.\n- For a favorite: The favorite must win by more than the point spread.\n- For an underdog: The underdog must outright win OR lose by fewer than the point spread.\nSports books aren\u2019t in the business of predicting who will win or lose games. Their goal is setting a pregame point spread with the intention to generate an equal amount of betting action/volume on both sides of the ledger \u2013 as much total money being bet on the favorite as on the underdog.\nThe vast majority of point spread wagers are made on football and basketball because of the proliferation of points that are scored in comparison to sports like baseball and hockey, where 1-0 or 2-1 games aren\u2019t that out of the question or out of the norm. There's one every night.\nFor example, the New England Patriots are playing the New York Jets and New England is a 9\u00bd-point favorite. Bettors typically have to spend $110 or so to win $100 with sports books, known as \u201cthe house edge/advantage.\u201d With a point spread bet, simply having a team win the game isn\u2019t the key. The critical factor to betting a point spread is how much a team wins or loses by. If a wager is placed on New England \u2013 \u201claying\u201d the 9\u00bd points \u2013 the Patriots need to win the game by 10 or more points for that bet to pay off. If New England wins 28-20, those betting on the Jets plus 9\u00bd points (points added to their final total) win the bet.\nThe same general rules apply for basketball and are quite easy to follow because of the inherent simplicity of the bet. When it comes to betting sports like baseball and hockey, the standard bets are made on the \u201cmoneyline\u201d \u2013 an established number for both teams to win the game outright.\nWhat makes point spread bets attractive are the fluid nature of each game \u2013 it\u2019s a reality show that, when done right, is inexplicable. Games change on one play and momentum is a thing. But, when it comes to point spread betting, you know where you stand at every moment.\nFor those just starting out, the simplest form of gambling is betting the spread because it\u2019s the easiest to explain and understand, which explains why it is the most popular form of sports wagering.\nPlay our free daily Pick\u2019em Challenge and win!

      "text": "Betting 101: What is a moneyline bet in sports betting?\nIn the world of sports betting, a moneyline bet is simply betting on which team you expect to win. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with a margin of victory (sports betting point spread), how many points the teams combine to score (sports betting Over/Under) or anything else -- it is purely betting on which team you expect to win the game.\nYou may also see a moneyline bet listed as \u201cMoneyline\u201d or \u201cML\u201d in different spaces.\nMoneylines are represented in negative, positive and EVEN (even money bet: bet $100, win $100) values.\nNegative moneyline: -145, -220, or anything similar\nWhen you see a minus (-) sign in front of a price, it shows you that team is the favorite to win the game.\nThat number also indicates how much money you need to bet/spend in order to win $100.\nFor example, a -220 moneyline means you need to bet $220 in order to win $100 provided the team you bet on actually does win.\nHeavy favorites are known in sports betting as a \u201cchalk\u201d pick. A heavy favorite usually has a number pushing +300 or more. Here, you\u2019re wagering a lot on the favorite to win a little. Don\u2019t assume that a heavy favorite, or chalk pick, is a guaranteed winner\u2026\nPositive moneyline: +145, +220, or anything similar\nWhen you see a plus (+) sign in front of a price, it illustrates to you that team is the underdog. Higher numbers like +400, +500, +5000, etc. represent how much of an underdog the team is in the game. The higher the number the more likely the team is expected to lose in the eyes of the oddsmakers.\nThe number also indicates how much money would win in comparison to every $100 you wager.\nFor example, a +150 moneyline means you would win $150 for each $100 wager you place should that team win the game.\nMoneyline examples:\nLets use an NFL example here:\n- New England Patriots -240\n- Miami Dolphins +220\nTo bet the New England Patriots to win on the moneyline, you would need to spend $240 on the bet for a chance to win $100 if the Patriots beat the Dolphins. Your return would be $340 \u2013 the original $240 stake (bet) and the $100 bet profit.\nTo bet the Miami Dolphins to win on the moneyline, you would spend $100 on the bet for a chance to win $220 if the Dolphins, as the underdog, beat the Patriots. Your return would be $320 \u2013 the original $100 stake (bet) and the $220 profit.\nIn both situations, it doesn\u2019t matter if the team you bet on wins by one point or 100 points. You\u2019re purely betting on the team you believe will win the game. As Al Davis said, \u201cJust win, baby.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d be looking for out of your selection. It doesn\u2019t have to be pretty, it just has to happen or your original stake is lost.\nPlay our free daily Pick\u2019em Challenge and win!

      "text": "Betting 101: What is Over Under sports betting?\nWhile not as popular as betting against the point spread in sports gambling, betting the \u201cOver/Under\u201d isn\u2019t that far behind. Sometimes you may see this as O/U, Over-Under, Over Under or simply referred to as \"the Over\" or \"the Under.\"\nWhat does Over/Under mean in betting?\nSimply stated, it is the total of the points scored by both teams. While all sports employ an Over/Under betting option, by far the most money wagered on this bet is in football and basketball. Sports like baseball and hockey offer Over/Under options, but the vast majority of bets on those sports in based on the established \u201cmoneyline\u201d to pick a winner at a set price.\nUnlike a point spread bet in which you are aligning yourself with one team, you\u2019re betting on both teams \u2013 either their offenses or the defenses \u2013 when betting the Over/Under. Sports books set Over/Under scores on games based upon numerous factors.\n- In the NFL, most Over/Under scores are set in the low-to-mid 40s.\n- In college football, Over/Under scores are usually in the high-40 to low 50s \u2013 in the Big 12, the land that defense forgot, it can hit the 60s.\n- In the NBA, a typical Over/Under tends to hover in the 210 range. In college basketball, a standard Over/Under is between 140 and 155.\nThe hidden factors that come into play in determining a point spread vary by sport, but have common themes. Recent team history is a primary factor that sports books like to exploit. Sports by their nature are a reflective business based on developing trends from previous games (\u201cgetting on a roll\u201d) and, if a football team has scored 40-plus points in three straight games, the Over/Under is going to be higher because sports bettors tend to believe that trends are going to continue. It\u2019s human nature\u2026until they don\u2019t.\nIf a critical player \u2013 a quarterback in football or a dominant scorer in basketball \u2013 is out or playing injured, the Over/Under will drop.\nOther factors critical in setting the Over/Under number include weather (where applicable), an undefinable history between teams (you know Steelers-Ravens games are going to be physical bloodbaths) and injuries that may not jump out to casual fans that mean a lot sports books are all factors that go into creating and setting an Over/Under line that will draw an even number of fans to both sides of the number.\nThe key to betting the Over/Under is to look at a slate of games without knowing what the Over/Under is and set what you believe it should be based on your knowledge of those two teams. The ones that differ the most from what you think should be are the ones to place your bets on.\nOne final note that has been a mantra of those who bet the Over/Under with some consistency \u2013 every game is Under until it goes Over.\nIf you\u2019re new to sports betting, start with picking and choosing games you\u2019re convinced should go Under and get an understanding of how late-game fireworks can botch your plans.\nPlay our free daily Pick\u2019em Challenge and win!
