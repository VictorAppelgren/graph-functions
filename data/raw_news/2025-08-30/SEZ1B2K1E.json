  "title": "Britain's Got Talent's viral egg thrower is now making waves for Disney",
  "description": "The woman who egged Simon Cowell during a Britain's Got Talent final in 2013 has found success in the music industry - and fans are just discovering what she's up to.",
  "content": "People are only now discovering what a woman who pelted Simon Cowell with eggs live on Britain's Got Talent is up to these days. The viral incident saw Natalie Holt break away from the choir during an opera performance to launch eggs at the television host Cowell. The explosive moment during the 2013 Britain's Got Talent final dominated news coverage at the time. However, few are aware of what transpired afterwards for Holt, who has since enjoyed a flourishing career with some of the entertainment industry's biggest names. The viral moment continues to receive acclaim from numerous viewers more than a decade after the incident occurred, while others have celebrated Holt's achievements in different fields.\n\nIn a post shared on the r/BritishTV Reddit page, reality television enthusiasts were left questioning what had become of Holt. The Royal Academy of Music graduate captured public attention during the performance by Richard & Adam, two contestants who had reached the show's final. While she may be renowned for pelting Cowell with eggs, she has also secured employment as a composer with Disney. Most recently, she created the musical score for Disney's Marvel series, Loki. A post on the r/BritishTV page states: \"During the 2013 Britain's Got Talent final, a woman named Natalie Holt disrupted an opera performance to pelt eggs at Simon Cowell. Holt ended up the composer for Disney+'s Loki.\" The initial poster implied the egging occurred due to not progressing in the competition, though this was later refuted. Speculation has subsequently emerged regarding Holt's motivations for targeting Cowell with eggs. One viewer speculated: \"I thought she was protesting the fact that they'd been booked to mime (lip sync? but with instruments?). \"She was angry that the show had hired real expert musicians to sit there and pretend to play. So she exposed they were faking by stopping to pelt eggs and letting the music continue.\"\n\nAnother fan theorised: \"Wasn't the egg thing her being mad about the power Cowell had over the music industry especially with X Factor getting the Christmas number 1 every year.\" Regardless of the motivation behind the egg-throwing demonstration, Holt has since secured impressive credits across some of the most beloved film and television productions. Holt subsequently collaborated with acclaimed composer John Williams on Obi-Wan Kenobi and became a regular fixture throughout Knightfall's second series. Her collaboration with Williams on the Star Wars spin-off followed a 12-episode involvement with the Loki production team, where she also appeared as an accordion performer. In cinema, Holt has worked alongside Hildur Gu\u00f0nado\u0301ttir on Journey's End and served as music production assistant on Matthew Vaughn's fantasy epic, Stardust. Her contributions were scheduled to appear in the 2022 Batgirl adaptation, although the project was ultimately cancelled. Despite featuring Oscar-winning talents J. K. Simmons and Brendan Fraser, the film remains unreleased and appears unlikely to see the light of day.",
