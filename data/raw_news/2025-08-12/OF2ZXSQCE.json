  "description": "The Weiner Museum of Decorative Arts plan consists of a four-story museum and commercial space on Lake Avenue. A group of residents oppose it.",
  "content": "LAKE WORTH BEACH \u2014 More than 70 residents stood outside Lake Worth Beach City Hall before the scheduled Aug. 5 commission meeting, protesting against the Weiner Museum of Decorative Arts, a $60 million mixed-use downtown development project.\n\nProtestors, many wearing red, held signs reading \u201cStop WMODA\u201d and chanted \u201cPublic land, public vote!\u201d earning car honks from drivers along South Dixie Highway.\n\nDespite the pushback, city officials didn\u2019t change course. Four of five commissioners voted to approve this iteration of the project master plan. Commissioner Christopher McVoy, who agreed with some protestors\u2019 comments, was not present for the vote.\n\nThis is not the city\u2019s final approval for WMODA. Officials will discuss the project once more before making an official decision, though the timing is unclear.\n\nWMODA is projected to cost $60 million in total, with the city contributing an estimated $19 million.\n\nResidents are concerned the city is putting a large sum of public taxpayer dollars toward a project proposed by a private developer.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of most of it, the thing I think a lot of people disagree on is: it's too much money,\u201d said Kim Stokes, a former city commissioner and a leader of the advocacy group Lake Worth 4 All.\n\nThe project will consist of a four-story museum and commercial space on Lake Avenue featuring 15,000 pieces of glass sculptures and ceramic artwork, a cafe, bookstore, classrooms and an exhibit by Dale Chihuly, a famous artist known for his large glass-blown pieces.\n\nThe project will also include a five-story, 110-apartment complex and an attached underground residential parking garage with 117 spaces. The city agreed to build an additional three-story, 270-space parking garage on K Street and split the funding with WMODA. This second garage will cost the city $7.5 million.\n\nLake Worth Beach values WMODA\u2019s designated 1.7-acre property at about $3.3 million. However, the plan includes making some sacrifices, such as demolishing one historical building and relocating three others to Community Development Agency-approved sites.\n\n\u201cThe project obliterates all the qualities of the (Old Town) historic district,\u201d said Richard Stowe, who moved to Lake Worth Beach in 2012 and formerly served on the Tree and Landscape Board.\n\nUnited Management, doing business as Sunshine Lake Worth Development, first proposed the project at an October 2024 workshop meeting. About 40 people showed up in support, wearing pro-WMODA shirts and flashing supportive signs. Now, the tone has shifted.\n\nJust south of Lake Worth Beach, Boca Raton is also considering a similarly controversial mixed-use development plan.\n\nBoca residents formed a group called \u201cSave Boca\u201d that protested outside the City Council chamber in July, circulating a petition and filling over 80 seats.\n\nLake Worth 4 All\u2019s protest on Aug. 5 demanded the same thing of its city leaders: to put public-private issues on a ballot. During the commission meeting, protestors made an uproar over WMODA\u2019s overall cost but targeted two key elements in particular: parking and affordable housing.\n\nTo meet the city\u2019s parking requirement, WMODA\u2019s plan would eliminate roughly 65 spaces. An informational pamphlet distributed by protestors claims the project would credit 66 public downtown spaces toward its total and treat 156 bike racks as the equivalent of 24 spaces, although the city has not confirmed these figures.\n\nA group of eight residents circulated a petition against these parking plans and the introduction of paid parking downtown. One resident, Susan Guyaux, told the council they gathered 872 signatures within a 10-day period.\n\nWould affordable housing be offered in the Lake Worth Beach development?\n\nLake Worth Beach citizens are also concerned about the small amount of affordable housing WMODA plans to offer.\n\nThe apartment complex is slated to have eight \u201cAffordable Artists\u2019 Lofts\u201d reserved for households earning between roughly $85,600 and $128,500 annually. The remaining 102 units will sell at the local market rate, which sits at an average of $2,300 per month, according to data from real estate and rental listing websites such as Zillow and Apartments.com.\n\nTyler Chapman, founder of the nonprofit independent news blog The Lake Worthian, said he doesn't see any low-income benefit.\n\n\u201cWorkforce housing, I think, is a cover for just gentrifying. It's not a truly helpful thing for them to do,\u201d Chapman said in an interview. Chapman and others said the public subsidies put into workforce housing often only benefit higher-income buyers.\n\nCommissioner Mimi May acknowledged that there is a need for more low-income housing, but also noted that those who can afford the current market rate are looking for more activities downtown, making that one reason WMODA makes sense for Lake Worth Beach.\n\nLAKE WORTH BEACH NEWS: From West Palm Beach down to Lantana here are the top 22 places for waterfront dining\n\nLAKE WORTH BEACH NEWS: State officials to meet with Palm Springs about bicycle lane barriers on Lake Worth Road\n\nLAKE WORTH BEACH NEWS: Why Lake Worth Beach's Cam Smith is surging in AL Rookie of the Year race\n\nSince 2011, Vice Mayor Sarah Malega confirmed, the city has established over 1,200 affordable residences, including workforce and deed-restricted units.\n\n\u201cLake Worth Beach has more affordable and workforce housing being built than anywhere,\u201d said William Waters, the city\u2019s community sustainability director.\n\nThose who attended the protest and the city commission meeting said they wanted their voices to be heard and for their fellow residents to stay informed.\n\nChapman wrote a piece about the project and other matters ahead of the Aug. 5 meeting, and both The Lake Worthian and Lake Worth 4 All have active websites and social media pages updating the public on city decisions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of issues in the city, (including) homelessness, addiction, crime \u2026 and we really want to be able to just have those community conversations and bring more awareness and more conversations,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cPeople need to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Beach Post: Lake Worth Beach's $60 million WMODA project gets pushback",

      "text": "'Chance of a lifetime': Lake Worth Beach rolls out $60M downtown museum/apartment plan\nLAKE WORTH BEACH \u2014 Lake Worth Beach took a big step toward a plan that would have the city donate downtown property for a developer to build a $60 million mixed-use museum/apartment complex.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the chance of a lifetime. If we don\u2019t do this, we\u2019re going back to having just commercial and residential development in our downtown,\u201d said Community Development Agency member Drew Bartlett at the October 7 workshop to consider the proposal from Wiener Museum of Decorative Arts (WMODA).\nAbout 40 people, many with pro-project T-shirts and signs, attended the workshop at the Casino Building and Beach Complex.\nThe seven-member CDA voted the next day 6-1 to recommend approval. Member Daniel Morgan voted no.\nThumbs up and thumbs down came from several residents at the two-and-a-half-hour meeting.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard this before with the Gulfstream Hotel. Downtown development will bring tax revenue and bring jobs. Why haven\u2019t we met that promise?\u201d Lake Worth Beach resident David Simms said.\nGraham MacLeod countered that long-needed additional downtown parking will result.\n\u201cThe Lake Worth Playhouse, Bamboo Room and other downtown businesses lose customers due to lack of parking,\u201d said MacLeod, who also lives in Lake Worth Beach.\nThe next step is the Tuesday, Oct. 15 preliminary city commission vote. The final vote by the commission is scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 29.\nWhat are the details for the public/private partnership downtown plan?\nThe core of the plan calls for the city to donate 1.7 acres to the Wiener Museum\u2019s development company, United Management. The property, valued by the city at about $3.3 million, is at the southwest corner of Lake Avenue and South M Street.\nOther details include:\n- United Management would build a four-story museum to display WMODA\u2019s 15,000 pieces of decorative glass and ceramic artwork. A cafe, bookstore, classrooms and an exhibit by Dale Chihuly are planned.\n- United Management would build a 110-unit apartment complex to include eight affordable housing lofts for artists. A three-story parking garage would have about 280 spaces. The garage would be owned and operated by the city, and public parking would be allowed.\n- An \u201cactive alley,\u201d a pedestrian-only landscaped walkway between the museum and parking garage, would be built.\n- Four historic buildings now on the property would be moved to nearby CDA-owned property.\nSuch public/private partnerships are not new.\nA plan to give Vanderbilt University two acres of land near downtown West Palm Beach valued at about $13 million was approved last month by the West Palm Beach city commission.\nNashville-based Vanderbilt would use the land off Tamarind Avenue to help build a $500 million, 300,000-square-foot graduate school campus. Palm Beach County must agree to donate another five acres of land it owns for the plan to be finalized.\nVanderbilt officials say the graduate school will generate $7.1 billion in economic activity over the next 25 years. Thousands of jobs, from teaching to construction to food services, will be created, they say.\nLAKE WORTH BEACH NEWS: Why the new Sixth Avenue South bridge still hasn't opened, more than year after work began\nThe WMODA project will bring about $14 million in tax revenue to Lake Worth Beach in the next decade, museum officials say.\nCDA member Morgan questioned how affordable housing, parking and historical preservation are being addressed.\n\u201cThis is not a proper use of taxpayer funds,\u201d Morgan said at the CDA workshop.\nHow would the mixed-use development generate money for Lake Worth Beach?\nWMODA officials estimate about 50,000 people will visit the museum annually.\nBy comparison, Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach drew about 310,000 visitors last year. The Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens annually draws about 200,000 visitors. The Henry Morrison Flagler Museum in Palm Beach draws about 100,000 visitors annually, according to local officials.\nDrawing more visitors \u2014 and their spending \u2014 to Lake Worth Beach would be a direct result of WMODA, said resident Ricardo Hernandez.\n\u201cThe museum will elevate Lake Worth Beach and stimulate the local economy,\u201d said Hernandez, a Realtor.\nLAKE WORTH BEACH NEWS: Gulfstream Hotel finally changes hands. What's next for this historic Lake Worth Beach property?\nA non-profit, 501(c)3 organization, WMODA now stores its artwork in Hollywood, Fla. while looking for a permanent location.\nArthur Wiener, WMODA founder, wants to \u201cleave a legacy\u201d by establishing the museum.\nWiener, 80, said he had family members killed in the Nazi Holocaust and has lost family members in the Middle East conflict that started a year ago on Oct. 7.\n\u201cThis country has been very good to my family. I want this museum to become an institution in Lake Worth Beach,\u201d Wiener said Monday night.\nWhat's next for the plan?\n- Tuesday, Oct. 15, 6 p.m., Lake Worth Beach City Hall, 7 N. Dixie Highway, Lake Worth Beach: City Commission to consider preliminary approval of the WMODA agreement. The meeting is open to the public.\n- Tuesday, Oct. 29, 5 p.m., Lake Worth Beach City Hall: Lake Worth Beach City Commission to consider final approval of the WMODA agreement. The meeting is open to the public."

      "text": "State officials to meet with Palm Springs about bicycle lane barriers on Lake Worth Road\n- Vehicle crashes into Lake Worth Road's bicycle lane barriers have decreased since the addition of plastic poles.\n- Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) will meet with Palm Springs officials to discuss further safety measures.\n- FDOT maintains that drivers need to adjust to the new barriers, while local officials advocate for shorter barriers.\nPALM SPRINGS \u2014 Fewer vehicles seem to be crashing into Lake Worth Road's new bicycle lane barriers ever since plastic white poles were installed on them, but they're not enough, local officials say, so they will beseech state transportation officials in July to do more examination.\nOfficials from the Florida Department of Transportation will meet July 21 with Palm Springs officials to discuss what more can be done to further reduce the number of collisions, which have spiked since the unveiling of concrete buffers in May on the road, which runs through the village. Crashes have declined since mid-June after FDOT installed white plastic poles and reflective pavement markers on the barriers but remain higher than before the road project.\nIs installation of white poles enough?\nCrashes have become less common since then, said Flora Hernandez, co-owner of a U-Haul rental on Lake Worth Road. When the bike lane buffers were first unveiled, she saw multiple crashes daily, she said. The last time she saw a crash was the weekend of the Fourth of July, she said July 9.\nThe white poles and reflectors are meant to keep drivers alert to the curb-like bike lane barriers. But still, black marks on the poles show evidence that drivers are still bumping into the barriers, said Florida state House Rep. Debra Tendrich, D-Lake Clarke Shores, who represents the legislative district covering Palm Springs and who has been working with state and local officials to help solve this issue.\nFDOT \"is expediting this,\" Tendrich said. \"It's happening in weeks, not years like it took to put them in.\"\nWhen FDOT staff visited Lake Worth Road on June 23, they told Palm Springs officials that drivers need to get used to the new bike lane barriers, Assistant Village Manager Kimberly Glas-Castro said. That was also what they told local officials in May, Glas-Castro has said.\nFDOT is monitoring how effective its poles and reflectors are at reducing crashes, spokesman Guillermo Canedo said. Data collected by FDOT and local police are expected to be presented at the July 21 meeting. Palm Springs officials maintain that the barriers should be shorter, like the ones on Sansburys Way north of Belvedere Road, Glas-Castro said.\nFDOT in November 2022 approved the installation of bike lane barriers as part of a $14 million project on Lake Worth Road to upgrade crosswalk pedestrian signal systems, replace or add road signs, add sidewalk curb ramps where there were none to meet federal disability standards and repair pipes and water mains underground.\nThe department owns and maintains Lake Worth Road. The 1.8-mile road's new design aims to improve safety and comfort for everyone, whether they walk, bike, drive or ride any of the road's five public bus routes, the Palm Beach Transportation Planning Agency has said. That federally mandated agency helps shepherd money through federal and state governments to help pay for local road projects.\nStill, even with the barriers, poles and reflectors, bike riders rarely pedal in the lanes, opting instead for the newly widened 10- to 12-foot sidewalks.\n\u201cWe have to protect bicyclists, but we also want to protect cars,\" Tendrich said. \"We have to find a balance.\u201d\nChris Persaud covers transportation in Palm Beach County for The Palm Beach Post.

      "text": "Too Bad, So Sad: Lake Worth Beach\u2019s August 5th Agenda Sells Out Public Interest\nThis Agenda Would be Gifting Millions in Public Land, Some Waterfront, to Developers and Wealthy Property Owners \u2014 Bulldozing History to Appease the Rich. If You Object? \"Too bad, so sad.\"\nBy: Tyler W. Chapman\n\ud83e\uddf1 Downtown Alleys Given Away: Carving Up Public Space\nNew Business A (Resolution 42-2025)\nThe City is proposing to give away, \u201cabandon\u201d, two public alleys in the downtown core to accommodate the WMODA project\u2019s design. These aren\u2019t minor pathways \u2014 they\u2019re part of the historic downtown grid that connects streets and provides access:\nIn the developer\u2019s plans, one these alleys will be remade into a curated \u201cArts Alley\u201d pedestrian walkway between the new museum and garage. The other alley running north to south will be absorbed into their private property. Note that maintenance and control will shift out of public hands for both. What was once a public right-of-way will become a privately managed space for a private development.\nThere\u2019s bitter irony here: that north\u2013south alley to be vacated is the very corridor that provides access to three historic cottages on the site \u2013 buildings that the WMODA project originally promised to help preserve. In early plans, the developer agreed to pay to help facilitate the relocation of these historically significant structures, but one of those buildings suffered a fire and was lost. The latest conversations from the City Commission indicate the remaining historic buildings will now be demolished. In short, the city is literally clearing the way \u2014 both legally and physically \u2014 for private construction that will erase pieces of our historic fabric.\n\ud83c\udf0a Waterfront for the Few: Giving Away Public Land to the Rich\nNew Business G (Resolution 21-2025)\nFull walk down this beautiful public greenspace (at 2x speed) Video from: Joe Capozzi\nPerhaps the most brazen giveaway on the agenda: an approximately 350-foot-long by 40-foot-wide strip of public right-of-way on the Intracoastal waterfront \u2014 between 1302 and 1230 South Lakeside Drive \u2014 is poised to be given away, free of charge, to the wealthy homeowners on either side. This land is essentially a platted street end leading to the water, and it belongs to all of us. If this resolution passes, public access will vanish; the land will be absorbed into the millionaires\u2019 manicured lawns, becoming their private property.\nWhat does the public retain? Only a buried utility easement for pipes and wires under the ground. There will be no public pathway, no viewing area, nothing. A slice of waterfront, operating now as a small park and a kayak launch with a priceless view, will instead be fenced off for exclusive use by two property owners who already enjoy direct waterfrontage.\nCity staff, even though interim city manager Jamie Brown claims that staff has no spare time and is overburdend with tasks, reviewed this request (brought by a law firm on behalf of the homeowners who are listed on PAPA as Richard Gladstone to the South side and Thomas LaRose & Lorrie Wright LaRose on the North) and raised no major objections. Why does so much staff time, \u201cStaff from Public Works, Water Utilities, Electric Utilities, Community Sustainability and City Legal Departments\u201d go to helping give valuable land away to wealthy property owners with waterfront property? So, no talk of compensation to the taxpayers for the land value \u2014 it\u2019s simply a gratis handover; free land given to wealthy property owners? The justification? According to the backup material, the justification for this giveaway is couched in terms of this being a necessity for the \u201chealth, safety, and welfare of the neighborhood\u201d \u2014 as if a publicly owned alley is inherently a danger, and only by handing it to private interests can it be made safe (and profitable). Once it\u2019s taken from the public, it\u2019s gone forever.\n\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Benny\u2019s Gets a Free Summer on the Beach on Your Dime\nUnfinished Business C (Fifth Amendment to Lease with Benny\u2019s on the Beach)\nLake Worth Beach\u2019s generosity to insiders isn\u2019t limited to developers \u2014 it extends to favored businesses, too. The latest example: Benny\u2019s Ocean Walk, with one of the best locations in all of South Florida, is in line for a $57,000 rent holiday courtesy of the public. In this fifth lease amendment, the City is waiving two months of Benny\u2019s rent as the restaurant undertakes renovations this fall. That covers the post-Labor Day closure through late October \u2014 amounting to $57,000 in rent the city won\u2019t collect.\nCity leaders are spinning it as a fair trade for \u201ccapital improvements\u201d Benny\u2019s will make to the city-owned building, but Jamie Brown, interim city manager, made it clear that by the lease agreement the tenent, Benny\u2019s Ocean Walk, would be required to pay for such improvements if they wanted them, so they\u2019re looking to change the agreement.\nLocal businesses are crying foul at the special treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s a poor business decision for the city to waive the rent\u2026 If I have to close my business, the city is not going to pay my rent,\u201d said John Gatti, a nearby business owner according to wptv.com. In other words, why should one favored tenant get a free ride that no one else would?\nThis \u201cfree summer\u201d comes on top of an already sweetheart deal. Benny\u2019s has a long history of paying below-market rent for its prime oceanfront spot. Only as recently as 2023, after public uproar, did the Commission push the restaurant into a new lease with a series of stepped rent increases that moved it closer to market rate. Even with those hikes, Vice Mayor (at the time) McVoy noted the rates are still lower than what similar oceanfront eateries pay. And by the way \u2014 Benny\u2019s parent company? It conveniently donated $5,000 to a political committee backing the commissioners who consistently bend over backwards to accommodate the restaurant. Coincidence? Maybe. But the optics are clear: it pays to have friends at City Hall.\n\ud83d\udea8 WMODA: Millions in Public Subsidies, 8 Token Units\nPublic Hearing D (Ordinance 2025-06 \u2013 WMODA Mixed-Use Development)\nAt the heart of this agenda is the WMODA project \u2014 a luxury museum-apartment complex that blends private profit with public subsidy. The proposal calls for a massive giveaway in exchange for mere scraps:\nFree public land: 1.7 acres downtown (valued by the city at about $3.3 million 10 years ago and most certainly worth far more now) to be \u201cdonated\u201d to the developer.\nPublicly-funded parking garage: up to 5-story, 270-space garage costing taxpayers $8.5 million \u2014 the developer gets the benefit, the city foots the bill.\nExtra building rights: additional height and density via \u201cSustainable Bonus\u201d and Transfer of Development Rights (essentially exceptions to zoning rules to maximize profits and lets the developer get away with not building the full 16 \u201caffordable\u201d units that would have been required under our LDRs).\nAnd what does the public get in return? Just 8 \u201caffordable\u201d units in a 110-unit luxury tower. These units are designated as \u201cworkforce housing\u201d. However, these units only need to be considered \u201caffordable\u201d for families making nearly $100k a year or households earning up to 120% of the Area Median Income of WPB, which has a significantly higher AMI than LWB. In other words, designed for people earning a moderate income, not people struggling to find affordable housing. For context, that threshold is well above what many working-class families here actually earn.\n\ud83d\udccf Upzoning Downtown: Bulldozing for Bonus Profits\nPublic Hearings B & C (Ordinances 2025-05 and 2025-07)\nCity Hall isn\u2019t just dishing out deals on specific projects \u2014 it\u2019s rewriting the rulebook to favor more intensive development downtown. On the agenda are two zoning map changes that together upzone 16 parcels in the city\u2019s core to the highest-density category, \u201cDowntown (DT)\u201d:\nFive parcels in a city-initiated rezoning (second reading of Ordinance 2025-05) \u2013 these are north of 1st Ave South between S. J and S. K Streets.\nEleven parcels in a privately initiated rezoning (first reading of Ordinance 2025-07) \u2014 scattered along South L and M Streets just south of Lake Ave (the very area targeted by the WMODA development).\nThe effect of these changes is to allow taller buildings and more units where previously such massive projects were not allowed. It\u2019s a green light for higher-density and luxury development to sweep into blocks that were once human-scaled. And buried in the details is an ugly truth: by approving the WMODA rezoning, the city also says it\u2019s ready to authorize the demolition of at least three historic structures on those parcels. Remember those historic cottages the developer said they would save? The plan was to relocate them off-site; in reality, one burned down, and the others are now poised to meet the wrecking ball since the majority of the commission says it\u2019s not worth moving them. In favor of demolishing these historic structures, Commissioner Segrich brushed off residents\u2019 concerns with a phrase now burned into public memory: \u201cToo bad, so sad.\u201d\nHigher density in the urban core can be a worthy goal when it includes genuine affordable housing or public benefits. But here it\u2019s being done primarily to enrich a single project for a wealthy New York developer. We\u2019re watching the character of our downtown \u2013 including some of its oldest buildings \u2014 be sacrificed for a developer\u2019s convenience and profit.\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Make Your Voice Heard\nThis avalanche of giveaways and upzoning will be decided at the August 5, 2025 City Commission meeting \u2014 6:00 PM at City Hall (Tuesday evening). Public comment is open on all these items. If you care about any of them, now is the time to speak up.\nAttend in person: City Hall Commission Chamber, 7 N. Dixie Highway, Lake Worth Beach and fill out a Blue Card (reference the agenda item by letter or ordinance number \u2013 e.g. \u201cPublic Hearing D\u201d for the WMODA deal, \u201cNew Business G\u201d for the waterfront land giveaway, etc.)\nSubmit Comments Online: Use the City\u2019s online public comment portal (reference the agenda item by letter or ordinance number \u2013 e.g. \u201cPublic Hearing D\u201d for the WMODA deal, \u201cNew Business G\u201d for the waterfront land giveaway, etc.). Written comments can be submitted in advance if you can\u2019t log in live.\nThese proposals aren\u2019t final until the Commission votes. Your voice can still make a difference \u2014 or at least make them think twice. As Commissioner McVoy stated: \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush? We are being reckless.\u201d\n\ud83d\udea8 In Summary\nLake Worth Beach isn\u2019t just selling to the highest bidder \u2013 it\u2019s giving away the store. Public land, public money, public trust \u2014 all offered up like an unattended bodega with a sign that effectively says, \u201cThe rich can take what they please.\u201d\nIf we don\u2019t push back, this will be the new normal. More public land will vanish into private hands. More sweetheart deals will slip through without scrutiny. And the diverse, working-class fabric of this city will be steadily plowed under \u2014 alley by alley, acre by acre \u2013 replaced by upscale projects and private enclaves.\nThis city belongs to all of us, not just those with money and influence. It\u2019s time to say so, loud and clear. Lake Worth Beach\u2019s leaders need to remember their job is to serve the public interest \u2014 not to shrug off our concerns with \u201ctoo bad, so sad.\u201d\nToo bad, so sad? We\u2019ll see about that."

Despite the protests, city officials approved the project master plan, which includes a museum, commercial space, and apartments, with significant public funding involved. Critics argue that the project prioritizes private interests over public needs, particularly regarding affordable housing and historical preservation.",
