  "title": "Which Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is More Likely to Make You a Millionaire: Figma or Palantir?",
  "description": "One of these hot AI stocks appears to have the advantage, but its valuation could be problematic.",
  "content": "One of these hot AI stocks appears to have the advantage, but its valuation could be problematic.\n\nInvesting early in the right stocks can sometimes be highly rewarding. For example, Palantir Technologies (PLTR -2.27%) went public in September 2020 with an opening share price of $10. Today, its shares trade at around $186.\n\nMore recently, Figma (FIG 5.62%) conducted its initial public offering (IPO) on July 31, 2025, with a share price of $33. Although the stock has been volatile, it's still worth roughly $82.\n\nIt's too late to get in at the very beginning for either of these artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. But which one is more likely to make you a millionaire?\n\nOne argument for why Figma could be more likely to be a millionaire-maker than Palantir is that it's much smaller. Figma's market cap of around $40 billion is only a fraction of Palantir's market cap of roughly $440 billion. Generally speaking, smaller companies have more room to grow than larger companies do.\n\nFigma's growth is already impressive. Its revenue soared 46% year over year in its latest quarter. Customers are sticking with Figma's artificial intelligence (AI)-powered product design and development software, too, as evidenced by a sky-high net dollar retention rate of 132%.\n\nFigma's customer base includes 78% of the Forbes 2000 and 95% of the Fortune 500. We're talking about a list that features marquis companies such as Airbnb, Atlassian, DuoLingo, Microsoft, Netflix, The New York Times, and Zoom.\n\nFigma could have a massive opportunity ahead. It estimates its total addressable market is currently around $33 billion, and IDC projects that more than 1 billion new apps will be developed by 2028. Figma's 2024 sales of $749 million are a drop in the bucket, compared to this growing market.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling argument that Palantir is more likely to make investors $1 million than Figma is that it's growing faster. The company reported year-over-year revenue growth of 48% in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nHere's another biggie: Palantir has a \"Rule of 40\" score. The \"Rule of 40\" is a popular rule of thumb for evaluating software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies. Its premise is that a company's revenue growth rate plus its profit margin should be 40% or higher.\n\nPalantir's \"Rule of 40\" score is a sky-high 94%. This puts the company in a league of its own among software makers.\n\nPalantir's customer count of 485, as of June 30, 2025, is well below Figma's number of customers. However, the value of Palantir's contracts with customers is much larger. In Q2 alone, Palantir closed 157 deals of at least $1 million and 42 deals of at least $10 million.\n\nThe U.S. government remains Palantir's largest customer, and its government business continues to grow robustly. However, its commercial business is growing even faster. Palantir expects its commercial revenue to soar by at least 85% this year.\n\nCEO Alex Karp wrote to shareholders recently that the company's U.S. commercial business is \"the emerging core of Palantir and the seed of what an entire industry will become, perhaps the world's most dominant, in the years to come.\"\n\nAnd the winner is...\n\nWhen all factors are considered, I think that Palantir is more likely than Figma to make you a millionaire. Palantir's opportunity appears to be larger than Figma's, in my view.\n\nThat said, don't expect an investment of $10,000 in Palantir to grow to a cool $1 million. Much of the company's growth prospects are already baked into its share price and then some, with its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 4.89. If you're hoping to become a millionaire with a relatively small initial investment, you'll probably need to look elsewhere.",

  "summary": "The article compares Figma (Figma) or Palantir Technologies (PLTR -2.27%) to which one of these hot AI stocks appears to have the advantage but its valuation could be problematic. Palantar Technologies went public in 2020 with a share price of $10.27 and today, its shares trade at around $186. Figma's market cap of around $40 billion is only a fraction of Palantoir's size, suggesting that smaller companies have more room to grow than larger ones. The author suggests that Figma may be more likely to be a millionaire-maker due to its impressive growth and impressive customer base, which includes 78% of the Forbes 2000 and 95% of Fortune 500. However, he also noted that Palantor's customer base includes companies such as Airbnb, Atlassian, DuoLingo, Microsoft, Netflix, The New York Times, and Zoom. The winner is likely to make investors $1 million due to Palantantir's growing faster than Figma due to the company's growing potential.",

      "text": "The price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) is one of several different ways to value a stock, but it's the only metric that takes a company's earnings growth rate into account.\nMost valuation ratios such as price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, and price-to-book are based on backward-looking metrics and don't directly consider a company's growth prospects. Since growth is a key component of a stock's expected return, the inclusion of the growth rate gives the PEG an advantage over the most commonly used alternatives. However, this ratio, like all others, has its pros and cons.\nIn looking at the PEG ratio, we'll discuss how to calculate it, give an example of how it's used, and examine the best uses for the PEG ratio.\nHow to calculate\nHow to calculate the PEG ratio\nThe PEG ratio starts with the P/E ratio but takes it one step further. To get the PEG, you first divide a stock's price by its earnings per share (EPS), just as you would to get the P/E ratio. Once you have the P/E ratio, you divide that by the expected earnings-per-share growth rate over a period of time, often five years. If it's multiple years, you use the compound annual growth rate.\nThe formula looks like this:\n(P/E ratio) / Expected annual EPS growth\nThe price-to-earnings ratio of a stock can generally be found on a stock market portal like Yahoo! Finance or from your brokerage. Expected growth rates, which are generally determined by Wall Street analysts unless a company has given its own guidance, can likely be found with your brokerage. You may have to do some calculations to determine the growth rate based on the earnings forecasts available.\nFor example, if a company currently has $1 in EPS and analysts forecast $1.50 in EPS in three years, its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) would be 14.5%. To determine the CAGR, you would divide the last year's EPS by the first year's EPS and take it to the power of 1 / (the number of years between them).\nExample\nPEG ratio example\nTo see how we can use the PEG ratio in real life, let's take a look at Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), the tech giant and parent company of Facebook.\nMeta had $13.77 in earnings per share in 2021, and it closed at a price of $216.49 on March 18. That gives the stock a P/E ratio of 15.7. The chart below shows the current EPS consensus for the company's next four years.\nOver the next four years, analysts expects Meta's earnings per share to grow by 41%, or a compound annual growth rate of 9%. Since 15.7 divided by 9 is 1.74, Meta's PEG ratio is currently 1.74.\nIf you're wondering if that's a good PEG ratio, you'd want to compare to its peers. Currently, the S&P 500 has a PEG ratio of 1.56, and the communications services sector to which Meta belongs has a PEG of just 1.12. That sector may not be the best comparison, however, since it includes slow-growing companies such as Verizon (VZ 0.07%) and AT&T (T 0.16%). Alphabet (GOOGL -0.27%)(GOOG -0.3%), which may be Meta's closest peer, trades at a PEG of 2.09, making Meta look cheap by comparison.\nWhat does it tell you?\nWhat does the PEG ratio tell you?\nThe PEG ratio tells you how expensive a stock is relative to its growth rate. The price-to-earnings ratio is the most widely ratio used by investors, but the PEG has a key advantage over the PE ratio in that it adjusts the P/E for growth. Typically, higher P/E ratios signal faster growth rates, but the PEG allows investors to compare stocks with high and low P/E ratios based on their growth rates.\nThe PEG ratio also offers a simple way for investors to see how cheap a stock is relative to its growth rate. All things being equal, a lower PEG ratio is better.\nTraditionally, a PEG ratio of 1 was considered fairly valued, with less than 1 being undervalued and more than 1 being overvalued. Over the past decade, however, price-to-earnings valuations have become stretched because of the rise of the tech sector, which tends to trade at a higher valuation than mature sectors such as energy or tobacco. Because of that shift, you're unlikely to see many stocks with PEG ratios of less than 1 these days since many of the priciest stocks on the market, especially in sectors such as cloud computing, don't even have profits.\nFamous fund manager Peter Lynch helped popularize the PEG metric, arguing in his book One Up on Wall Street that 1 was a fair PEG ratio since he believed the rate of growth should approximate the price of the stock.\nA PEG ratio of less than 1, assuming the growth forecast is accurate, is a good indicator that a stock will outperform over the next few years.\nAdvantages and disadvantages\nAdvantages and disadvantages of the PEG ratio\nThere are a number of benefits to using the PEG ratio. The biggest advantage is that it factors in a company's growth rate, making it more convenient than the P/E ratio, which requires investors to do the growth comparison on their own. With the P/E, investors may choose to use a company's P/E ratio based on a future year's earnings, i.e., a forward P/E. Unlike most ratios, the PEG is also forward-looking, making it a true reflection of a stock's expected profits rather than its trailing performance.\nHowever, the PEG can be more difficult to use because growth rates aren't always available or accurate. If a company trades at a low PEG ratio, it could be because the market doesn't believe the growth forecast. Additionally, since the number of years in the PEG ratio can vary, apples-to-apples comparisons can be difficult. In the example of Meta, analysts expect earnings per share to decline this year, which means it wouldn't even have a PEG ratio if we were just using a one-year forecast. By contrast, over the next three years, the PEG ratio would be just 0.86, much lower than the current 1.74.\nIt's worth remembering that earnings forecasts are less accurate over a longer time, so next year's earnings consensus should be closer to actual earnings than the five-year forecast.\nLike other ratios valuation metrics, it's a good idea to use the PEG ratio along with other tools. Investors should also consider the balance sheet, debt burden, and cash flow, which aren't reflected in the PEG ratio or other valuation metrics that use the income statement.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line\nThe PEG ratio is a good way to value a stock while taking its growth rate into account, and investors should be familiar with how the PEG ratio formula works. However, there are drawbacks to using the metric. Like any of the popular valuation ratios, it shouldn't be used as a one-off test to decide whether to buy a stock or not. It's important to understand things like a company's competitive advantage, its addressable market, and its long-term growth prospects.\nTraditionally, a PEG of 1 was seen as the market average, but that is no longer true as stocks have gotten more expensive over the past decade with the high-priced, fast-growing tech sector coming to dominate the market. That may be one reason why the PEG ratio is used less than the P/E, even though the PEG in many ways is more useful.\nInvestors who understand the PEG ratio and deploy it in their analysis can use it to their advantage. In particular, the PEG is a good tool for comparing stocks to competitors as well as to their historical valuation."

      "text": "Computers excel at crunching numbers but not at the things that many people do with ease, like language processing, visual perception, object manipulation, reasoning, planning, and learning. Artificial intelligence (AI), including its offshoots of deep learning and machine learning, uses computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as language generation and facial recognition.\nHow do companies use AI?\nHow do companies use artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is created through machine learning, which involves training a system with a tremendous amount of data. It then uses the trained system to make inferences about new data it's never seen.\nThe simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images containing those objects are provided to the system, which \"learns\" how to detect them in other images. The more objects it detects in images, the more accurate the detection system becomes.\nCompanies employ AI in two main ways. Many tech companies use it to make their existing operations more powerful through high-profile applications like robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants. AI is used by Alphabet subsidiary (GOOGL -0.21%) (GOOG -0.3%) Google to filter spam in Gmail, by Amazon (AMZN -0.7%) to recommend products to customers, and by Netflix (NFLX 0.57%) to guide content creation and recommendations.\nMore recently, OpenAI's ChatGPT has shown how far generative AI -- a division of artificial intelligence capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas -- has come. It can answer questions directly, write poems, and has even passed bar and medical exams. It has spawned a wave of new generative AI chatbots, including Anthropic's Claude, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta AI from Meta Platforms (META -0.49%). The potential is enormous.\nThe next frontier for generative AI is AI agents or agentic AI. This is technology allows AI to perform to complete whole tasks without being prompted, such as automated customer service agents. AgentForce from Salesforce (CRM -3.51%) is one example of a new agentic AI tool.\nGenerative AI\nSome companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology requires. These are true AI stocks and include those listed and described below.\n5 AI stocks to buy in 2025\n5 AI stocks to buy in 2025\n| Company | AI Focus |\n|---|---|\n| Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Data center GPUs and superchips. |\n| Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | Generative AI and self-driving cars. |\n| Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Memory chips for data centers and generative AI tools. |\n| CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) | Generative AI-focused cloud infrastructure platform. |\n| Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) | AI chatbots, LLMs, and wearable devices. |\n1. Nvidia\nLeading graphics processing unit (GPU) company Nvidia has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its GPUs becoming the de facto standard in data centers worldwide. Generative AI's training phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the inference phase, typically requires less. GPU chips, which were once used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well. Nvidia's ambitions have gone beyond GPUs, as the company now aims to build AI factories or data centers full of Nvidia components to run AI applications and programming.\nNvidia's data center business now makes up the vast majority of the company's revenue, thanks to the emergence of generative AI. Because it sells the building blocks for AI infrastructure, Nvidia became the first major company to see a significant revenue boost from AI. Revenue surged through 2023 and 2024, and the stock has soared as well. It's become the most valuable company in the world on several occasions and was No. 1 in mid-2025. In 2024, full-year revenue jumped 114% to $130.5 billion, driven by the surge in data center demand.\nIts chips are popular for running demanding workloads that applications like large language models require. The pure-play chip stock is now selling its new Blackwell platform, which major cloud infrastructure services are deploying in 2025, and demand is outstripping supply.\nSelf-driving cars and \"physical AI\" are other areas of focus. Nvidia develops hardware and software platforms that can power driver-assistance features and fully autonomous driving, which could be a significant source of revenue if that industry takes off. Automotive revenue is only a small fraction of the company's revenue, but that could change.\nWith Tesla (TSLA 2.85%) launching its robotaxi network in Austin, the autonomous vehicle race appears to be heating up, and that should be good news for the semiconductor sector.\nA self-driving car must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require tremendous computing power, which is exactly what Nvidia's platform delivers.\nIts professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has potential in AI. Nvidia's chipsets could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but the company is in an enviable position for now.\n2. Alphabet\nAlphabet has been preparing for the AI revolution for years, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014. It's also among the leaders in autonomous vehicles through its Waymo subsidiary, which is now ferrying passengers in its driverless cars in cities including San Francisco and Phoenix.\nAlphabet launched Gemini, its own AI chatbot and the latest iteration in its competition with ChatGPT, which some see as a threat to Google Search. So far, concerns about a challenge to its search dominance seem to have been overblown as Alphabet's ad revenue continues to grow steadily. It said that its Gemini 2.5 has been \"widely recognized as the best model in the industry.\"\nWith information at the heart of its business, it's unsurprising that the company has prioritized AI. It's rolled out AI tools for Google Cloud and Google Workspace, including a generative AI assistant that helps write emails. Even its customer acquisition strategy in the cloud is based around AI -- the company has targeted AI start-ups for its cloud infrastructure service.\nAI also plays a role in improving its search engine and YouTube, where it can pinpoint a relevant section of a video and direct users straight to it.\nFinally, Alphabet is ramping up spending on capital expenditures with plans to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure and related needs in 2025.\n3. Microsoft\nMicrosoft has gotten lots of buzz lately thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. The tech giant began investing in the tech start-up in 2019 and invested another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.\nMicrosoft has incorporated GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Copilot for Microsoft 365. Azure OpenAI has seen a particularly strong uptake, now counting more than 65% of the Fortune 500 as customers.\nCEO Satya Nadella has repeatedly said that he sees AI as the next major computing platform, and the reported $13 billion investment in OpenAI is a sign of the company's conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition or get left behind as it did with mobile.\nMore recently, Microsoft has begun diversifying away from OpenAI, adding both internal and third-party models to products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure, including DeepSeek's R1. The long-term implications for its relationship with OpenAI are unclear, but Microsoft seems to think it's wise to hedge its bets in the AI race.\nMicrosoft is also harnessing the power of AI in other ways, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs. It's also using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools.\nThe company launched Azure AI Foundry in November 2024, which allows its customers to create and manage AI apps and agents. As of April 2025, developers at more than 70,000 companies are using it.\n4. CoreWeave\nCoreWeave, which had its initial public offering (IPO) in March 2025, may be the closest thing to a pure-play AI stock on the market, and it was the first major AI IPO.\nIts cloud infrastructure platform was designed specifically for AI, and it counts customers like Nvidia, OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft as part of its core customer base; Nvidia and OpenAI are both investors in the company.\nCoreWeave has grown at an incredible pace over the last three years, going from generating almost nothing in revenue in 2022 to $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024. Between 2022 and 2024, revenue grew by more than 100 times.\nCoreWeave's business is risky since Microsoft accounted for 62% of its revenue, meaning the business would suffer significantly if Microsoft pulled back on spending with the platform. In its first quarter 2025 report, CoreWeave said that no single company accounted for more than half of its backlog, a sign that its customer concentration is improving.\nIf you're looking for direct exposure to AI, CoreWeave is a good option since essentially all of its revenue is driven by the demand for computing power to run generative AI programs. However, the stock is risky since CoreWeave has a high debt burden, has large capital expenditures, and is deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles basis (GAAP).\n5. Meta Platforms\nUnlike the other big tech companies on this list, Meta Platforms doesn't have a cloud computing business, but the company is investing just as much in AI as peers like Alphabet.\nMeta AI, the company's chatbot that's available on its apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, now has 1 billion monthly active users as of May, and it continues to update its Llama large language model, which is now up to Llama 4.\nIt's also allowing its advertisers to use AI creative tools for things like background and video generation and ad copy. AI is also involved in ad targeting, and the company aims to fully automate advertising with AI by 2026.\nAdditionally, the company is incorporating AI in its hardware division, including its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which offer a built-in camera, open-ear audio, and a range of hands-free features. Its Meta Quest headsets are also connected to Meta AI, allowing users to tap into the power of AI through those headsets.\nManagement sees AI at the core of its business and driving its transformation across areas like advertising, experiences, and devices.\nMachine learning stocks\nMachine learning stocks\nAll the stocks above use machine learning technologies, but if you're looking for more options, here are two others worth considering:\n- Palantir (PLTR -2.27%): Palantir has been one of the top-performing AI stocks. The company provides cloud software and specializes in data fusion that helps its customers make important insights by connecting disparate pieces of information hidden in data. It also launched its AI Platform (AIP) in 2023, which has helped accelerate its growth. Palantir deploys machine learning models on top of data foundations and continuously improves them to ensure that they become more useful.\n- Tesla: Best known for its electric vehicles, CEO Elon Musk sees AI as the future of the company, and machine learning and neural networks are very much at the center of the company's autonomous vehicle and Optimus autonomous robot projects. Tesla introduced its driverless Cybercab in October 2024, and the company hopes to begin producing the vehicles by 2026. It launched its robotaxi network in June, though with just a handful of vehicles, and Musk envisions the company expanding to other cities in the near future. Musk has said Tesla's automation technology could make it the most valuable company in the world.\nDeep learning stocks\nDeep learning stocks\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It's the most advanced kind of AI and is crucial in technologies like self-driving cars. Deep learning is advancing in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary. It differs from machine learning in that it doesn't require human input.\nNvidia is among the companies closely associated with deep learning. Its GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.\nAlphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up, Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.\nRelated investing topics\nA growth business\nAI is a growth business\nAccording to International Data Corporation, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $235 billion in 2024 to more than $631 billion in 2028.\nWhile the AI market is already large and still growing quickly, plenty of companies can profit from AI. Although picking stocks in a growth industry comes with a lot of uncertainty, these top AI stocks are all worth considering.\nFAQ\nArtificial intelligence stocks: FAQ\nWhat is the best AI stock to buy?\nArtificial intelligence is a fast-moving technology, and AI stocks will likely be volatile as the sector evolves. AI stocks that have attracted the most attention include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but finding the best stock to buy is also a matter of price and valuation, which changes quickly.\nIs it good to buy Nvidia stock?\nNvidia has jumped into the lead among semiconductor companies in making AI chips and accelerators, and it has the competitive advantages to help it stay there. The semiconductor sector can also be highly cyclical, and pricing can change rapidly. Additionally, there's the potential for unexpected surprises like the DeepSeek launch, which sent AI stocks like Nvidia plunging. If Nvidia can maintain its lead in AI chips, the stock should continue to be a winner, but it will likely be volatile since the AI landscape is still developing.\nWhat is the biggest AI company?\nCurrently, the biggest company that has made AI central to its business model is Nvidia, with a market cap that has soared past $3 trillion. The tech giant is at the center of the AI revolution as its components are fueling AI applications and are in high demand by major cloud infrastructure companies and others.\nIs AI good for investing?\nArtificial intelligence is likely to shake up the economy and the business world, creating opportunities in the stock market. Whether AI is good for investing will depend on the company, but there will be winners from the new technology.\nWhat company is No. 1 in AI?\nCurrently, Nvidia is broadly considered the leader in AI technology. The company has a monopoly-like market share in the data center GPU market, and its revenue has more than tripled since ChatGPT launched. Nvidia isn't guaranteed to remain the leader, though. Competition is on the way, and new technologies can change quickly.\nWill AI start-ups challenge tech giants?\nTech giants aren't feeling a significant threat from start-ups yet, but there are some signs that competition is on the rise. Alphabet stock, for example, fell when Apple said it was considering making AI search engines available on Safari, directly competing with Google.\nThe tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft also show that start-ups could begin to pose more of a threat to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, though they are unlikely to derail their growth."

      "text": "Total addressable market (TAM) is a measure of business potential often mentioned in business plans and pitch decks. When used on its own, TAM's main purpose in this context is to impress prospective investors and lenders.\nEven so, total addressable market can -- or should be -- an actionable value for business decision-makers. Let's examine what TAM is and the role it plays in strategic growth plans. We'll also cover methods for calculating TAM and provide a TAM example from AI chip designer Nvidia (NVDA -0.44%).\nUnderstanding total addressable market (TAM)\nOverview\nTotal addressable market is an estimation of the revenue opportunity for a product or service. Said another way, it is the revenue that would be generated if the business owned 100% market share.\nA basic calculation for TAM is average annual spending per customer, multiplied by the number of customers across the entire target market.\nTo demonstrate the formula, consider a business that delivers a product exclusively for green-eyed people around the world. An estimated 2% of the world's 8.1 billion population has green eyes, which equates to 162 million potential customers for this product. If market data reveals that people will spend an average of $5 on this item annually, the TAM is $810 million.\nThe benefits of quantifying TAM include:\n- Leaders can evaluate the market opportunity at a high level, given the required investment.\n- Calculating TAM is the first step to projecting the company's revenue opportunity. No product or service will secure 100% market share, so TAM must be whittled down for financial projections. Important subsets of TAM are serviceable addressable market (SAM) and serviceable obtainable addressable market (SOM), which are defined below.\n- TAM analysis requires leaders to delve into the target market and know their prospective customers, which often results in better decision-making.\n- Total market opportunity estimates can motivate teams to plan and execute the company's product roadmap.\nTAM, SAM, and SOM\nTAM, SAM, and SOM\nTAM estimates the entire available market. While this is an interesting data point, it's not actionable on its own. Further analysis is needed to estimate two related values: serviceable available market or SAM and serviceable obtainable market or SOM.\nServiceable available market (SAM)\nReturning to the product for green-eyed consumers, let's assume the business will only pursue customers in the U.S. The estimated U.S. population of 336 million equates to about 6.72 million prospective green-eyed customers. At $5 each, the SAM revenue opportunity is $33.6 million.\nServiceable obtainable market (SOM)\nThe number the business needs for financial projections is one step deeper. It is the portion of SAM the business can reasonably capture, also known as the serviceable obtainable market or SOM. If the decision-makers believe the product can capture 25% of the U.S. population of green-eyed consumers, the SOM is $8.4 million or 25% of $33.6 million.\nCalculating total addressable market\nCalculating TAM\nThere are different ways to calculate total addressable market. Common methods include:\n- Top down: The top-down method begins with broad population data and narrows it down to the relevant segment.\n- Bottom up: The bottom-up approach starts with niche data that can be applied to the wider population. Statistically valid surveys are often used for this purpose. A survey can be answered by, say, 1,200 people, but the conclusions are then applied to a larger group, such as all U.S. households.\n- Value theory: Value theory focuses on how much consumers are willing to pay for the product or service. This method is useful for new products for which there are no established buying patterns. The analysis might begin with sales of similar products, adding a premium for the additional value associated with the new product.\nRelated investing topics\nTAM in the news\nTAM in the news\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) space has been the biggest TAM story in recent history. Investors and tech companies are piling money into AI development and infrastructure -- and a jaw-dropping TAM is behind that trend.\nIn 2023, Manuvir Das, head of enterprise computing at Nvidia, predicted that the total addressable market for AI would grow to $600 billion. Das also provided this breakdown:\n- $300 billion in chips and systems.\n- $150 billion in generative AI software.\n- $150 billion in omniverse enterprise software.\nBased on these numbers, investors are right to be excited about Nvidia's first-mover advantage in AI chips and systems. The chip designer currently owns an estimated 70% to 95% of the AI chip market. If that subset of AI grows to $300 billion as predicted and Nvidia keeps even a 50% market share, the associated revenue is $150 billion annually."

      "text": "If you follow the software industry, you've probably heard talk of the Rule of 40. This is a shorthand rule of thumb for assessing whether a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business is investable.\nWhat it is\nWhat does the Rule of 40 mean in SaaS?\nThe Rule of 40 refers to the sum of a company's revenue growth and its free-cash-flow margin, or a similar profitability metric, such as its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin.\nIf the number is above 40%, the company is considered healthy and worth investing in. For example, if a company has 20% revenue growth and a 20% free-cash-flow margin, someone using this metric would consider investing in the business.\nNotably, a software company can reach the Rule of 40 by having strong revenue growth and a negative free-cash-flow margin, or it can be a slower-growing company with a strong free-cash-flow margin.\nMany software companies rely on stock-based compensation to boost free-cash-flow margin or adjusted EBITDA. This makes the Rule of 40 target easier to achieve than it would be if generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) numbers were used.\nWhere it started\nWhere does the Rule of 40 come from?\nThe Rule of 40 was popularized by venture capitalists Brad Feld and Fred Wilson, who described the concept in blog posts in 2015. The pair learned about it in a board meeting from another investor, who used it to gauge software start-ups.\nAt the time, the Rule of 40 was understood to apply to start-up firms rather than publicly traded companies, which could be more easily valued by the market. But publicly traded software stocks have also adopted the Rule of 40 as shorthand for success. Achieving the Rule of 40 means that a business is delivering strong growth, strong profitability, or a good balance of both.\nThe rule caught on because it neatly sums up the balance between growth and profitability that start-ups and software stocks must navigate to be successful. Some companies with rates higher than 40 will use phrases like the Rule of 50, 60, and so forth to demonstrate the strength of their businesses.\nIts usefulness\nIs the Rule of 40 useful?\nThe Rule of 40 is a good rule of thumb for determining whether a software business is delivering a good mix of growth and profitability. However, it shouldn't be the only criterion you use to decide whether to invest in a stock.\nThe rule can be dangerous if a business focuses too much on hitting one number. For instance, free-cash-flow margins can be boosted by using excessive share-based compensation or by delaying capital expenditures so they can hit a certain number for investors. Capital expenditures tend to be minimal for software businesses, but there are other tricks they can use to inflate free cash flow in a given quarter.\nOverall, the metric is useful, but investors should consider other financial metrics, such as GAAP profitability, which can differ substantially from free cash flow.\nRelated investing topics\nAn example\nWhat's an example of the Rule of 40?\nOne company that offers a good example of the Rule of 40 is Palantir (PLTR -2.27%). Palantir is a highly valued software company focused on data fusion and analytics for government agencies and commercial businesses. It often touts the Rule of 40 in earnings reports and calls.\nAs the business has performed well with both margins and revenue growth increasing, its Rule of 40 score has climbed higher. In the first quarter of 2025, Palantir reported revenue growth of 39%, and its free-cash-flow margin improved to 42%. Management opted to use an adjusted operating margin of 44% to give it a Rule of 40 score of 83%, as CEO Alex Karp had touted in the earnings release.\nThat offers one explanation for why Palantir stock has done so well. Consider the Rule of 40 the next time you look at a software stock. While it's not the only factor that should determine whether you buy a stock, it's a good starting point for analyzing SaaS stocks."

      "text": "Shorthand for \"market capitalization,\" market cap is one way an investor can evaluate how much a company is worth. Market cap refers to the total value of a publicly traded company's shares.\nTo determine a company's market cap, simply multiply the share price by the number of shares outstanding.\nAn example of market capitalization\nAn example of market capitalization\nHere's Costco Wholesale (COST 0.79%) as an example. At recent prices, Costco shares sell for $900, with around 450 million shares outstanding. In this case, $900 times 450 million equals a $400 billion market cap.\nBut why is market cap important and how should you use it? It's one of the best measures of a publicly traded company's size, which can tell you a lot about what to expect if you buy its stock.\n- Large companies tend to have more stable and mature businesses, having proven themselves over time and weathered difficult business conditions to emerge stronger. However, the growth prospects for large companies can be limited because they've already taken advantage of their primary opportunities to grow to their current size.\n- Smaller companies often have more room to grow, but they are typically younger, with riskier business models that haven't yet proved themselves. Their odds of failure can be higher than those of larger companies, which presents added risk.\nHere's a quick breakdown of how market cap ranges are often segmented across companies of different sizes:\n| Type of Stock | Market Capitalization Range |\n|---|---|\n| Mega cap | More than $200 billion |\n| Large cap | $10 billion to $200 billion |\n| Mid cap | $2 billion to $10 billion |\n| Small cap | $300 million to $2 billion |\n| Micro cap | $50 million to $300 million |\nIn general, investors look at the market in the following three categories most often since these are the market cap categories most stocks tend to fall into.\nWhat are large-cap stocks?\nWhat are large-cap stocks?\nLarge-cap stocks have market caps of more than $10 billion. Most of the best-known companies in the world are large caps, and these are typically the companies that have established themselves as the leaders in their industries. While many deal with the ups and downs of their industry's cycles, these are often the strongest companies and have proven capable of holding off competitive threats. Large caps are often where you'll find the best dividend stocks. These large companies often generate more cash than they need for the business and return that extra capital to investors in dividend payments.\nWhat are mid-cap stocks?\nWhat are mid-cap stocks?\nMid-cap stocks have market caps between $2 and $10 billion, occupying the middle ground between large and small companies. Mid-cap companies often have made considerable progress in building up successful business models, and that gives their investors some stability and protection against the future challenges smaller companies may face. Yet even with some track record, mid caps also may face the daunting task of beating out, or even disrupting, bigger and better-funded large-cap competitors to realize their own financial promise.\nNot all mid caps are growth stocks. They may be companies that operate in a smaller niche without big growth prospects, or they may be former large caps that have declined due to changes in the competitive landscape or (as with many brick-and-mortar retailers) some industry disruption.\nWhat are small-cap stocks?\nWhat are small-cap stocks?\nSmall-cap stocks are generally defined as having market caps between $300 million and $2 billion. Sometimes companies with market caps below $300 million are in this group, although most categorize those as micro-cap stocks. They are generally growth stocks or upstarts just getting their feet under them and looking to do something big. While small-cap stocks have historically delivered above-average returns as a group, many fail to live up to expectations. Small-cap stocks are more volatile than larger caps, meaning there is more risk of losses in the short term. These stocks are generally best owned as a diversified group, and for many years, in order to reduce those risks.\nDividends Per Share\nHow to use market cap\nHow to use market cap\nMarket cap is helpful when evaluating a company's size. But don't let the market value of a company cause you to dismiss large- or even mega-cap stocks as \"too big to buy.\" The global economy is enormous, serving more than 7 billion people and with a fast-growing middle class. A $10 billion company that serves a multi-trillion-dollar market can grow substantially.\nMoreover, companies can deliver strong per-share returns without expanding their market cap fast. Share repurchases that reduce the share count reward long-term investors with a bigger piece of the company, while dividends put money directly back into your pocket. These two things combined can significantly reduce how much market cap needs to grow for investors to get above-average returns.\nRelated investing topics\nConversely, companies -- often small caps that need the cash -- may sell stock to fund growth, pay debt, or just keep the lights on. When this happens, it reduces -- dilutes -- how much of the company each share is worth. For example, if a company with 10 million shares issues and sells 1 million new shares, 10% of your former equity now belongs to the new shareholders. The key here is to consider a company's history of share buybacks and dilution.\nMost investors find that having a diversified portfolio that includes stocks of various market caps is best. It lets you tailor for the desired return and risk levels that meet your goals. If you want your portfolio to be more stable, you'll want a bigger allocation of large-cap stocks. If your primary goal is to increase your portfolio's size as much possible over many years, you'll likely want to own more small- and mid-cap stocks."

      "text": "Even novice investors have probably heard the term \"IPO\" before. IPO stands for \"initial public offering\" in the stock market. A privately held company that completes an IPO offers shares of itself to the public for the first time. The newly issued shares begin trading on a stock exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.\nWhat does it mean when a company goes public? It means that it completes an IPO (or similar process) and makes its stock available to investors. Shares of pre-IPO companies or private companies are generally owned by just a small group of company insiders and employees, as well as early investors such as venture capitalists.\nHow does an IPO work?\nHow does an IPO work?\nAny privately held company can go public through an IPO. Companies that complete IPOs are often fast-growing companies in the tech industry or another high-growth sector. However, they can also be mature companies -- such as Petco (WOOF 0.79%) and Levi Strauss (LEVI 1.05%) -- that are owned by private equity firms seeking to exit their positions. Some of the most attractive IPOs are \"unicorns,\" or tech start-ups valued at more than $1 billion in the private markets.\nWhen a company is ready to go public, it hires an investment bank (or several banks) to underwrite the IPO. Generally, a company goes public after it has a proven track record of growth and other favorable results that are attractive to investors. Banks underwrite IPOs by committing money to buy the shares being offered before they're listed on any public exchange.\nAnother role of the underwriter is to perform due diligence on the company to verify its financial information and analyze its business model and prospects. With the help of the underwriter, the company files a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which includes its prospectus. The purpose of the filing is to provide detailed information on the company's finances, business model, and growth opportunities.\nThe company often meets with institutional investors such as pension funds, foundations, and endowments to make sure the IPO has buyers. After an initial block of shares is sold, the company and its underwriters set an initial public price and a date for the stock to begin trading on a public exchange.\nOn IPO day, the company's stock becomes available to the general public, and the stock then trades among investors on the open market.\nWhy do companies pursue IPOs?\nWhy do companies pursue IPOs?\nThe primary benefit of going public is easier access to capital. The money raised from an IPO can be used for expansion, research and development, marketing, and other purposes.\nIPOs also reward equity holders in the company. Executives, employees, and others who own equity stakes can easily sell their holdings, generally after a lock-up period of six months once the stock is publicly traded. The lock-up period helps stabilize the stock price by preventing insiders from selling all their holdings immediately after the IPO.\nWhile private companies are valued based on private funding rounds, which can be burdensome and time-consuming, public companies are valued based on the market price. There's no additional work for the company to do to raise its valuation, and stock prices have the potential to appreciate much faster than private company valuations, assuming the business warrants it.\nThere are also drawbacks to going public since companies are required to adhere to SEC reporting requirements. Publicly traded companies must issue regular disclosure statements, release their financial results, and conduct quarterly earnings calls, among other requirements. Public companies have fiduciary responsibilities to their shareholders and satisfying their demands can cost management control, time, and money -- especially if an activist investor takes an interest in the stock.\nAlternatives to IPOs\nAlternatives to IPOs\nThe traditional IPO process isn't the only option for going public. Increasingly, companies are going public through direct listings. Among the stocks that have gone public through direct listings in recent years are Spotify (SPOT -2.23%), Slack (now owned by Salesforce) (CRM -3.51%), Coinbase (COIN 2.97%), Roblox (RBLX 1.77%), and Amplitude (AMPL -2.86%).\nIn a direct listing, a company simply allows the stock to begin trading on a public exchange such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. No new shares are issued. Rather, the direct listing gives insiders an opportunity to sell their shares on the open market. Going through a direct listing avoids many of the fees associated with underwriters and the need to go through a \"road show,\" or presenting the investment opportunity to institutional investors. It also eliminates the lock-up period necessary for IPOs, allowing insiders and employees to immediately sell their shares.\nA direct listing doesn't raise new capital the way an IPO does; no new shares are offered. It's also riskier in some ways than an IPO since there isn't an underwriter to help drum up demand for the stock. Direct listings tend to work best for well-known companies with an interested investor base and a clear value proposition.\nDutch auctions are also an option for companies seeking to go public without an IPO, although they are less common. Alphabet (GOOG -0.3%) (GOOGL -0.27%) is perhaps the best-known company to go public through a Dutch auction, using the technique in 2004. In a Dutch auction, potential buyers list the price they're willing to pay, and, when the company believes the price is high enough, it sells new shares at that price. Unlike a direct listing, Dutch auctions raise new capital.\nAre IPO stocks good investments?\nAlthough IPOs can be good for the issuing companies, they're not always great for individual investors. Investing in IPOs can be profitable, but it is generally much riskier than investing in blue chip stocks or mature companies. The prices of newly issued stocks often fluctuate wildly on the first trading days because it's not always easy for the stock to find its equilibrium price.\nHowever, IPO stocks can generate huge returns when they succeed. Some of today's top public companies completed their IPOs just a few years ago:\n- Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) debuted on the Nasdaq for $38 a share in 2012 and now trades at prices above $300.\n- Tesla (TSLA 2.85%) priced its 2010 IPO at a split-adjusted $3.40 per share. The stock price skyrocketed in 2020 and is now above $1,000 a share, representing a gain of roughly 30,000%.\n- E-commerce juggernaut Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has jumped more than 6,000% from its 2015 IPO price of $17 to more than $1,000.\nOf course, for every big IPO winner, there are a number of losers, most of which are quickly forgotten by the market. Lyft (LYFT 0.37%), for example, debuted in 2019 at $72, but it is down roughly 50% since then. The ridesharing company was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and visions of self-driving cars haven't been fulfilled. Earlier high-profile tech IPOs such as GoPro (GPRO -7.09%) and Fitbit also flopped, leading to billions of dollars in losses for investors.\nRelated Investing Topics\nIPO stocks can be great investments, but, historically, most underperform the market. The stock market, especially the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) -- as a large-cap benchmark index -- is generally composed of successful, profitable companies. Failing and failed companies don't continue to be listed by major indexes.\nIPO stocks, which are unproven, may not live up to their potential. Before investing in IPO stocks, take the time to vet the issuing companies carefully.\nFAQs\nWhat does IPO stand for?\nInitial public offering\nWhat does IPO mean?\nIPO refers to the time when a privately held company offers shares of itself to the public for the first time, trading on a stock exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.\nWhat does it mean when a company goes public?\nIt means that that company has made its stock available to retail investors for the first time.\nShould you invest in IPOs?\nYou should invest according to your personal risk tolerance, with the knowledge that most IPOs underperform the market."
