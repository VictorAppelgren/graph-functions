  "description": "It's part of a push by lawyers for Cesar Pina saying an indictment should be dismissed accusing the real estate influencer of bribing a city official",
  "content": "PATERSON \u2014 Did then-interim United States Attorney Alina Habba\u2019s April warning \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m looking at you, Paterson\u201d \u2014 result in a July indictment accusing a notorious real estate influencer of bribing a city official?\n\nThat\u2019s the question lawyers representing the influencer, Cesar Pina, raised in a letter filed Aug. 19 in federal court in Newark. It\u2019s part of the ongoing court battle over whether the indictment against Pina \u2014 which also included fraud and money laundering charges \u2014 should be dismissed because Habba\u2019s interim appointment had expired before the indictment was filed.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi argued in a Aug. 18 legal brief that the dispute over the status of Habba\u2019s appointment should not affect the Pina indictment.\n\n\u201cMs. Habba did not present any evidence or the indictment to the grand jury, nor did she attend those presentations to the grand jury,\u201d Bondi\u2019s brief said of the Pina case.\n\nThe brief asserted that Pina\u2019s lawyers failed to identify any other way in which Habba\u2019s role at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office affected the substance of the indictment.\n\nThe next day, Pina\u2019s lawyers submitted a letter to the court arguing that the attorney general \u201copened the door\u201d to the question of Habba\u2019s role in the criminal probe.\n\nDuring her time as interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Habba made multiple public comments in news interviews about the attention she was paying to Paterson, calling it \u201ca sanctuary city.\u201d In May, Habba filed a lawsuit against Paterson and three other New Jersey cities \u2014 Newark, Hoboken, and Jersey City \u2014 accusing them of obstructing federal immigration officials.\n\nPina\u2019s lawyers cited those actions as evidence of \u201cMs. Habba's apparent preoccupation with the City of Paterson,\u201d saying it raised questions about her role in the indictment, and discussions she may have had with her underlings.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, did they discuss the inclusion of the Paterson bribery count in the indictment?\u201d asked Pina\u2019s legal team, led by attorney Gerald Krovatin. \u201cDid Ms. Habba review the prosecution memo in this case? Consistent with her public comments, did Ms. Habba instruct her prosecutors to prioritize investigations and prosecutions involving the City of Paterson?\u201d\n\nThe federal indictment never named the Paterson official whom Pina is accused of bribing in exchange for help in getting city approvals to convert an abandoned school into housing. The project never got the approvals needed.\n\nMore: Attorneys for Bergen real estate influencer accused of fraud argue for case dismissal\n\nMore than half a dozen city officials have received subpoenas in the federal bribery probe. Paterson political insiders say the description of the city official as someone involved in real estate deals points to Councilman Alex Mendez.\n\nIn mid-July, Mendez acknowledged during a televised City Council meeting that he spoke with federal investigators, and said he has done nothing wrong.\n\n\"There's an investigation going on,\" Mendez said during the meeting. \"I answered all the questions, and I submitted all the information. And that's it, that's what happened.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: Paterson bribery case lawyers say Habba had \u2018preoccupation\u2019 with city",

      "text": "Paterson councilman breaks silence about FBI corruption probe, says he did nothing wrong\n3-minute read\n- A federal indictment said an unnamed city official accepted $50,000 in bribes from developer Cesar Pina in exchange for supporting a development project.\n- Mendez, a licensed Realtor, used a Pina-owned building as his campaign headquarters and received a political donation from Pina in the past.\n- Federal authorities issued subpoenas to at least six Paterson officials, seeking records of communication and financial dealings with Pina and his companies.\nPATERSON \u2014 Councilman Alex Mendez on July 15 broke his silence about an ongoing FBI corruption probe, acknowledging that he was questioned by investigators and asserting he has done nothing wrong.\nFor days, Mendez has been the subject of widespread speculation after the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said on July 10 that a Paterson government official \u2014 whose name has not been made public \u2014 took $50,000 in bribes from real estate influencer Cesar Pina in exchange for backing a development proposal.\nFederal authorities said the Paterson official is a licensed Realtor, a description that many political insiders saw as a clue that the alleged bribe-taker was Mendez, particularly because the councilman used a building owned by Pina as his campaign headquarters in 2024 and received a $2,600 political donation from Pina in 2020.\nStory continues below photo gallery.\nIn his comments during the July 15 City Council meeting, Mendez said he has received an outpouring of public support after his name appeared in news stories about the Pina case and noted that he was not charged in the indictment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an investigation going on,\u201d Mendez said in the televised meeting. \u201cI answered all the questions, and I submitted all the information. And that\u2019s it, that\u2019s what happened.\n\u201cI want to say thank to all those that reached out to me, because I know that I have done nothing wrong,\u201d Mendez continued. \u201cI\u2019ve been an open book in the city of Paterson. I\u2019ve been in business, and I\u2019ve been supporting my family. Since 2003, I\u2019ve been a real estate agent.\u201d\nMendez \u2014 who faces state election fraud charges in a case that has dragged on for more than five years \u2014 has not responded to repeated messages from Paterson Press about the Pina probe.\nReal estate commissions among 'stream of bribes'\nA federal indictment against Pina said the influencer retained the unnamed city official as his agent to use real estate commissions as \u201cpart of the stream of bribes.\u201d\nIn exchange, the indictment said, the official would help Pina get Paterson zoning board approval for the investor\u2019s proposal to convert a long-closed schoolhouse on Totowa Avenue into 60 housing units. But the project never got zoning approval.\nThe indictment said the unnamed city official in March 2022 deposited a check for an $18,132 commission from the sale of a Pina property.\nHelped hundreds of first-time homebuyers\nIn his speech at the council meeting, Mendez said he has \u201chelped hundreds of families to become first-time homebuyers\u201d in his real estate job. He said banks, title companies and lawyers play a role in real estate sales.\nThe councilman said his commissions get deposited as checks in payments made by title companies through his broker. Mendez said he has been transparent in handling his real estate commissions.\nThe New Jersey Real Estate Commission collects information on property transactions but does not make public the commission amounts for individual sales.\n\u201cI never used this position,\u201d Mendez said, referring to his role as a council member, \u201cto help myself. I never go around using my title, my position, to ask people for favors. I\u2019ve never done that.\u201d\nMendez said he works hard and takes pride in that.\n\u201cIf I like to travel, it\u2019s my money,\u201d the councilman said. \u201cIf I like to buy new cars, it\u2019s my money. I work day and night. I\u2019m a hustler.\u201d\nRange Rover purchased with stolen title\nIn March 2022, Mendez\u2019s purchase of an SUV landed him in the news. The councilman disclosed at that time that he bought a 2016 Range Rover that he said he later found out had a title reported stolen in Georgia.\nMendez said he bought the vehicle through an online advertisement and paid $25,000 in cash to a man he met on Avenue N in Brooklyn. Mendez said back then that some of the money he spent on the Range Rover came from a commission he earned from his real estate work.\nMendez\u2019s bitter political rival, former Councilman William McKoy, has often cited the Range Rover purchase as evidence of Mendez\u2019s murky finances. McKoy said in an interview on July 16 that it was clear to him the indictment was referring to Mendez in its description of Pina\u2019s alleged bribes.\nMcKoy said that while driving home on the evening of July 15 he passed the building connected to Pina that Mendez used as a campaign headquarters. For 14 months after the election, a long Mendez banner remained wrapped around the facade of the corner storefront.\nThe building was sold in a recent auction as part of Pina\u2019s bankruptcy. McKoy said that while driving by the building this week he noticed the new owners had workers taking down the Mendez banner.\nSix Paterson officials have gotten federal subpoenas\nAt least six city officials \u2014 whose names have not been made public by authorities \u2014 have received federal subpoenas in the FBI probe of Pina. The subpoenas order the officials to provide investigators with documentation of their communications \u2014 including emails, texts and phone logs \u2014 with Pina, his wife, and about three dozen of their real estate companies.\nThe subpoenas also cover records involving \u201cthe receipt or offer of any money, directly or indirectly,\u201d from the Pinas and their companies as well as \u201cany business dealings conducted in your professional or personal capacity with any of the individuals, entities or representatives.\u201d\nDuring his five-minute council speech, Mendez talked about \u201cpeople who are praying for me to make sure that I\u2019m OK.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m OK,\u201d the councilman said. \u201cI haven\u2019t done nothing wrong, and that\u2019s the way I walk.\u201d\nMendez said it was easy for people with hate in their hearts to make what he said were false accusations against him.\n\u201cI\u2019m at peace, I\u2019m OK and I\u2019m going to continue doing my work in my community, helping people financially through my business, helping people here in the city of Paterson, helping families, because that\u2019s what I do,\u201d the councilman said."
