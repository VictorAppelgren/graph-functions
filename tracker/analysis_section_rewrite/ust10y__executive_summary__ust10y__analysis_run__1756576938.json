      "feedback": "The draft fails the mandatory “canonical‑handle” test – mortgage‑rate claims are not tied to a listed handle (e.g., ust10y). Add a sentence that explicitly maps the 6.5–7.5 % band to the current 10‑yr Treasury yield (ust10y) with a citation (LF0UUL917). Remove or re‑frame any mention of spx, ndx, or other indices that do not feed mortgage rates; keep only Fed‑policy and DXY references if they are tied back to the 10‑yr yield channel and thus to mortgage rates. Ensure every mortgage‑rate claim (e.g., “10‑bp rise in the 10‑yr pushes rates up ~5 bp”) carries an inline citation. Tighten the narrative to 4–6 sentences: state the current band, the Fed‑balance‑sheet driver, the DXY‑yield link, the September 2025 catalyst, and the key risk factors, all with citations. This will satisfy the “≥1 canonical handle” and “catalyst window” requirements while keeping the focus strictly on mortgage rates.",
