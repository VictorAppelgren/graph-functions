  "description": "The National Hurricane Center on Sunday continued to track newly formed Tropical Storm Fernand in the open Atlantic.",
  "content": "The National Hurricane Center on Sunday continued to track newly formed Tropical Storm Fernand in the open Atlantic while also eyeing a system approaching the Caribbean that could become the next tropical depression or storm.\n\nAs of the NHC\u2019s 5 p.m. advisory, the center of Fernand was located about 295 miles east of Bermuda moving north-northeast at 13 mph with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. Tropical-storm-force winds extend out 60 miles.\n\n\u201cThis motion is expected to continue for the next day or two, followed by a turn to the northeast,\u201d forecasters said. \u201cOn the forecast track, Fernand should move well east of Bermuda and across the open waters of the subtropical North Atlantic.\u201d\n\nWhile it may strengthen in the next two days, it\u2019s not expected to threaten any land before weakening by Tuesday.\n\nFernand became the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday while the NHC is keeping track of what could be the seventh farther south in the Atlantic.\n\nAs of the NHC\u2019s 5 p.m. special tropical outlook, the tropical wave was about 200 miles east of the Windward Islands with showers and thunderstorms, but a lack of circulation.\n\n\u201cThis system could still become a tropical depression during the next day or two while it moves quickly westward at about 20 to 25 mph, passing through the Windward and Leeward Islands later today and early Monday,\u201d forecasters said.\n\nIt could become Tropical Depression Seven or if strong enough be named Tropical Storm Gabrielle.\n\nNo matter the development the Caribbean islands can expect heavy rainfall and gusty winds through Monday. It\u2019s then forecast to move into the Central Caribbean on Tuesday where conditions are less favorable for additional development.\n\n\u201cData from the Air Force reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the system located near the Windward Islands does not have a closed low-level circulation,\u201d Forecasters said. \u201cHowever, the system is still producing a large area of showers and thunderstorms and winds to near gale force, and these conditions are expected to affect the Windward and Leeward Islands tonight and Monday.\u201d\n\nThe NHC gave it a 30% chance to develop in the next two to seven days, a lower chance than earlier on Sunday.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently updated its season forecast to call for 13-18 named storms this year, of which five to nine would grow into hurricanes. Two to five of those would develop into major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher.\n\nThe height of hurricane season runs from mid-August into October while the entire six-month season runs June 1 to Nov. 30.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 With warmer than normal ocean waters, forecasters are expecting yet another unusually busy hurricane season for the Atlantic.\nThey don\u2019t think it will be as chaotic as 2024, the third-costliest season on record as it spawned killer storms Beryl, Helene and Milton.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday unveiled its outlook for the Atlantic hurricane season that begins June 1 and stretches through the end of November, with a 60% chance it will above normal, 30% chance near normal and just 10% chance it will be quieter than average.\nThe forecast calls for 13 to 19 named storms with six to 10 becoming hurricanes and three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 110 mph. A normal season has 14 named storms, seven of which strengthen to hurricanes and three power up further to major hurricanes.\nOcean warmth is not quite as high as last year\u2019s off-the-charts heat. But it\u2019s sufficient to be the top reason for the busy forecast, National Weather Service Director Ken Graham said.\n\u201cEverything is in place for an above average season,\u201d he said.\nDespite massive job cuts at NOAA from the Department of Government Efficiency, \u201cour ability to serve this country has never been better and it will be this year as well,\u201d Graham said at a news conference Thursday in Gretna, La., to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.\n\u201cThe hurricane center is fully staffed up and we\u2019re ready to go,\u201d acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm said. \u201cWe are making this a top priority for this administration.\u201d\nSince 1995, 21 of the 30 Atlantic hurricane seasons have been officially classified as above normal, with nearly half of those considered \u201chyperactive,\u201d according to NOAA. It classifies seasons based on their Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index, which takes into account the number and strength of storms and how long they last. In the last 10 years, only 2015 was below normal and 2022 was near normal.\nLast year started with a record early Category 5 hurricane in Beryl but then had a lull during the early part of peak storm season from mid-August to mid-October. But then six storms, including Helene and Milton, formed in just two weeks. With 18 named storms, 11 of those becoming hurricanes and five major hurricanes, 2024 was considered a hyperactive season in the Atlantic. And it was the third such in the last 10 years.\n\u201cWith a warming climate, forecasting above the long-term mean is always a safe bet,\u201d said Kristen Corbosiero, a University at Albany tropical meteorology professor who was not part of the NOAA research.\nHuman-caused climate change has generally made storms more intense, wetter and slower-moving so they drop more rain, Corbosiero and other experts said.\n\u201cThe main fuel source for hurricanes is warm ocean waters,\u201d Corbosiero said. \u201cWarmer ocean water, warmer atmosphere above it can hold more moisture, more fuel for storms.\u201d\nCorbosiero said there are three main factors: Water temperature, the El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a cycle of natural ocean warming and cooling, and \u201cseeds\u201d of storms coming off Africa as thunderstorms. The warmer-than-normal water pushes toward a busy season, the El Ni\u00f1o cycle is neutral and it\u2019s too early to know what\u2019s coming off Africa, she and other hurricane experts said.\nWith climate change, hurricanes are powering up from almost nothing to intense storms more quickly, giving people less notice for whopper storms, meteorologists said. Every Category 5 hurricane that hit the United States was a tropical storm or weaker just three days earlier, Graham said.\nSeveral other groups besides NOAA \u2014 private, public and academic \u2014 have already made forecasts for the upcoming season and they average out to a busy, but not hyperactive year with 16 named storms, eight of which become hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\nPhil Klotzbach, who coordinates Colorado State\u2019s pioneering forecast program, is calling for a bit more than other forecasters \u2014 17 named storms, nine hurricanes and four majors \u2014 heavily based on the warm waters and past trends. Still, it should not quite be like last year, he said.\n\u201cAt least we\u2019re not looking at a crazy hot Atlantic like we did last year at this time,\u201d Klotzbach said. \u201cWe\u2019re still pretty toasty out there. So I don\u2019t have the warm fuzzies about 2025.\u201d\nEven if it\u2019s a quiet year, Corbosiero said just one storm can change everything, recalling an ultra quiet 1992, when that one storm was the devastating Hurricane Andrew.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a hyperactive season to have devastation in the U.S. or the Caribbean or anywhere,\u201d Corbosiero said."

      "text": "Hurricane Erin forced tourists to cut their vacations short on North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks even though the monster storm is expected to stay offshore after lashing part of the Caribbean with rain and wind on Monday.\nEvacuations were ordered on some barrier islands along the Carolina coast as authorities warned the storm could churn up dangerous rip currents and swamp roads with waves of 15 feet. Tropical storm and surge watches were issued Monday for much of the Outer Banks.\nOfficials at the Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington, North Carolina, reported to the National Weather Service rescuing at least 60 swimmers from rip currents on Monday.\nTourists and residents waited for hours in a line of cars at Ocracoke Island\u2019s ferry dock \u2014 the only way to leave other than by plane.\n\u201cWe definitely thought twice,\u201d said Seth Brotherton, of Catfish, North Carolina, whose weeklong fishing trip ended after two days. \u201cBut they said \u2018mandatory\u2019 and that pretty much means, \u2018get out of here.\u2019\u201d\nForecasters are confident Erin will curl north and away from the eastern U.S., but it\u2019s still expected to whip up wild waves and tropical force winds along the coastal islands, Dave Roberts of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said.\nThe storm intensified to a Category 4 with 140 mph maximum sustained winds Monday while pelting the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the southeast Bahamas, according to the center. By Monday night, sustained winds had dropped some to 125 mph with Erin about 690 miles southwest of Bermuda and about 780 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras.\nGovernment officials in the Turks and Caicos Islands said all services were suspended on three of its islands and ordered residents there to stay home. Some ports also closed.\nOn North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks, coastal flooding was expected to begin Tuesday and continue through Thursday.\nThe evacuations that began Monday on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke came at the height of tourist season on the thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that jut into the Atlantic Ocean and are increasingly vulnerable to storm surges.\nA year ago, Hurricane Ernesto stayed hundreds of miles offshore yet still produced high surf and swells that caused coastal damage.\nThis time there are concerns that several days of heavy surf, high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway, the National Weather Service said. Some routes could be impassible for several days, authorities warned.\nThis is the first time Ocracoke has been evacuated since Hurricane Dorian struck in 2019, leaving behind the most damage in the island\u2019s recorded history.\nTommy Hutcherson, who owns the community\u2019s only grocery store, said the island has mostly bounced back. He\u2019s optimistic this storm won\u2019t be as destructive. \u201cBut you just never know. I felt the same way about Dorian and we really got smacked,\u201d he said.\nScientists have linked the rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to climate change. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and is spiking ocean temperatures, and warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.\nDaniel Pullen, a professional photographer who lives on Hatteras Island, said he\u2019s already lost three days of work shooting family portraits because of the evacuation order.\nPullen doesn\u2019t plan to evacuate, fearing he could be stuck off the island for days and even weeks if the main Highway 12 washes out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like Russian roulette,\u201d Pullen said. \u201cDo you stay and take the chance of it hitting you? Or do you leave and take the chance of getting stuck off the island for weeks at a time? I would say the majority of Hatteras Island residents can\u2019t afford to stay in a motel for a week or two weeks.\u201d\nErin, the year\u2019s first Atlantic hurricane, reached a dangerous Category 5 status Saturday with 160 mph winds before weakening. It is expected to remain a large hurricane into midweek.\n\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with a major hurricane. The intensity is fluctuating. It\u2019s a dangerous hurricane in any event,\u201d the hurricane center\u2019s Richard Pasch said.\nBermuda will experience the most severe threat Thursday evening, said Phil Rogers, director of the Bermuda Weather Service. By then, waters could swell up to 24 feet (7.3 meters).\n\u201cSurfers, swimmers and boaters must resist the temptation to go out. The waters will be very dangerous and lives will be placed at risk,\u201d acting Minister of National Security Jache Adams said.\nErin\u2019s outer edges hit parts of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands with heavy rains and tropical storm winds Sunday, knocking out power to thousands.\nTropical Storm Fernand is possible this week\nOf growing concern is a tropical wave following on the heels of Hurricane Erin.\nAs of the NHC\u2019s 8 a.m. tropical advisory, the system had disorganized showers and thunderstorms moving toward the central Atlantic.\n\u201cEnvironmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical depression could form during the latter part of the week,\u201d forecasters said. \u201cThis system should move westward to west-northwestward at about 20 mph across the central tropical Atlantic and approach the vicinity of the Leeward Islands toward the end of the week.\u201d\nThe NHC gave it a 50% chance to develop in the next seven days.\nIf it were to form into a named storm, it could become Tropical Storm Fernand.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently updated its season forecast, now calling for 13-18 named storms for the year, of which five to nine would grow into hurricanes. Two to five of those would develop into major hurricanes of Category 3 strength or higher.\nScientists have linked the rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to climate change. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and is spiking ocean temperatures, and warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.\nThe height of hurricane season runs from mid-August into October while the entire six-month season runs June 1 to Nov. 30.\nBy BEN FINLEY and JOHN SEEWER, Associated Press"
