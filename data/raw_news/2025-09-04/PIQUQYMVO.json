  "title": "DBI Investor News: If You Have Suffered Losses in Designer Brands Inc. (NYSE: DBI), You Are Encouraged to Contact The Rosen Law Firm About Your Rights - Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI)",
  "description": "NEW YORK, Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, continues to investigate potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Designer Brands Inc. (NYSE:DBI)",
  "content": "WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, continues to investigate potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Designer Brands Inc. DBI resulting from allegations that Designer Brands may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Designer Brands securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the prospective class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=40581 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nWHAT IS THIS ABOUT: On June 10, 2025, Designer Brands reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2025. Commenting on the results, Designer Brands' CEO stated that \"[w]e experienced a soft start to 2025 amid an unpredictable macro environment and deteriorating consumer sentiment.\" Further, the CEO stated that \"[g]iven the persistent instability and pressure on consumer discretionary spend, we've made the decision to withdraw our 2025 guidance for the time being.\"\n\nOn this news, Designer Brands' stock fell 18.2% on June 10, 2025.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. At the time Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.",

Announces Proposed Class Action Settlement on Behalf of Purchasers of Compass Minerals International Inc. Securities \u2013 CMP\nKANSAS CITY, Kan., Aug. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) \u2014 The Rosen Law Firm, P.A. announces that the United States District Court for the District of Kansas has approved the following announcement of a proposed class action settlement that would benefit purchasers of Compass Minerals International Inc. securities (NYSE: CMP): UNITED\nFAQ\nClass actions are lawsuits where one or more investors serve as the representative plaintiffs on behalf of a large group of investors that each purchased the same securities and suffered losses as a result of the same false statements or misconduct. Class actions allow a court to decide the claims of many investors in a single lawsuit. This promotes efficiency, economy, and extends justice to investors whose claims are not large enough to merit an individual lawsuit.\nThis is the time period during which investors purchased securities in the company that is the subject of the class action. Typically, the false statements or fraud begin on the first day of the class period and the full truth about the false statements or fraud is revealed on the last day of the class period.\nA lead plaintiff is an investor that wishes to serve as a representative plaintiff in the class action on behalf of all the other investors that purchased securities during the Class Period.\nThe Lead Plaintiff\u2019s role is to oversee the litigation with the assistance and advice of the class\u2019s attorneys. Both the Lead Plaintiff and the class\u2019s attorneys must direct the litigation for the benefit of the class foremost. Ultimately, it is the job of the Lead Plaintiff to decide what is a fair settlement amount for the Class and to approve any settlement offer.\nLead Counsel are the Class\u2019s attorneys. The Lead Plaintiff selects the Lead Counsel. Lead Counsel should have extensive experience prosecuting securities class actions if they are to effectively represent investors in a securities class action.\nIf the amount of your losses in the investment are significant to you, being a lead plaintiff allows you to be involved in the case and oversee important decisions in the litigation, particularly the amount of any settlement for investors.\nClass action lawsuits often are filed when it would be impractical or prohibitively expensive for each person who was harmed to file an individual lawsuit, and they enable small shareholders or consumers to seek recovery from large corporations possessing much greater legal and financial resources. Generally, securities class actions are filed in the Federal District Courts and allege that the defendant(s) violated the Securities Act of 1933 and/or the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The typical class action takes at least 2-3 years to litigate, although the actual time it takes to resolve a case varies, depending on the complexity of the case, the issues involved, and other factors.\nYou can complete the online certification form on our website or at your request, we will email you a form to complete and you can send it back to us.\nYou do not pay any legal fees, costs or expenses. The Court will award the Lead Counsel any legal fees, costs or expenses from the money they recover for the class. If Lead Counsel doesn\u2019t recover any money for the class, Lead Counsel doesn\u2019t get paid any legal fees, costs or expenses.\nOur Offices\nNew York\n275 Madison Avenue,\n40th Floor\nNew York, NY 10016\nT: 212.686.1060\nF: 212.202.3827\nLos Angeles\n355 South Grand Avenue, Suite 2450\nLos Angeles, CA 90071\nT: 213.785.2610\nF: 213.226.4684\nPhiladelphia Metro\n101 Greenwood Avenue,\nSuite 440\nJenkintown, PA 19046\nT: 215.600.2817\nF: 212.202.3827\nNew Jersey\nOne Gateway Center,\nSuite 2600\nNewark, NJ 07102\nT: 973.313.1887\nF: 973.833.0399\nGet a Free Consultation\nThe Rosen Law Firm is dedicated exclusively to recovering investment losses for investors in companies that have misrepresented material aspects of their business or whose officers and directors have breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders."
