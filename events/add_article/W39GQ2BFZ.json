It highlights Google's push to embed its generative AI, Gemini, into devices like the Galaxy Watch 8 and Pixel Watch, aiming to make AI a ubiquitous, on‑body assistant. While the technology promises richer context and hands‑free interactions, users report challenges in learning new voice commands and integrating AI into daily routines. The piece also contrasts the smartwatch industry's slower upgrade cycle with smartphones, suggesting that AI may ultimately drive renewed interest if it delivers tangible, intuitive benefits.",
