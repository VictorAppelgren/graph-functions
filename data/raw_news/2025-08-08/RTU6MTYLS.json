  "title": "iPhone 17 release date, rumors and everything else you need to know ahead of the Apple event expected in September",
  "description": "Here are all the iPhone 17 rumors and leaks leading up to the fall announcement.",
  "content": "Knowing the big internal changes coming to our phones with iOS 26, we're getting excited to see how Apple has revamped its newest smartphones: the iPhone 17 lineup. We still have to wait over a month to find out \u2014 assuming Apple sticks to its usual release schedule \u2014 but for now, we can speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\n\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\n\nSurprisingly, the latest rumor isn't about the actual iPhone 17 details themselves, but rather when they'll finally be showcased. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\n\nWhile the iPhone events typically take place around the second week of September, we won't know the actual date until Apple makes the official announcement.\n\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\n\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers?\n\nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 \u2014 but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\n\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\n\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\n\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\n\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\n\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\n\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick \u2014 half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\n\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.\n\nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.\n\nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 \u2014 likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\n\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\n\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson \u2014 a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information \u2014 showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups \u2014 not real, leaked iPhones \u2014 it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\n\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\n\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\n\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\n\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\n\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm.\n\nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\n\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculations and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\n\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\n\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\n\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\n\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\n\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\n\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.",

      "text": "A $599 iPhone 16e is a cruel joke\nThe cheapest iPhone should not cost $599.\nThe $599 iPhone 16e is many things, but don't you dare call it a budget phone. I hesitate to even call it \"cheap.\" As a successor to the $429 iPhone SE, it's hard not to see the 16e as a disappointment. Sure, it's $200 less than the vanilla iPhone 16 (which I argued was a great deal at launch), and the 16e also packs in the latest A18 chip with support for Apple Intelligence. But it's no longer a small phone, and it pushes Apple's cheaper iPhone option well beyond $500. That's something we'll likely never see again. (And it's potentially terrible news for future iPhone pricing, as well.)\nGiven the sheer amount of new hardware in the iPhone 16e \u2014 including a larger 6.1-inch OLED screen, Apple's first in-house \"C1\" modem and that aforementioned A18 chip \u2014 it's easy to make excuses for the price. The 16e is certainly far closer in specs to the iPhone 16 than the third-gen SE was to the iPhone 13. But I'd argue that Apple didn't exactly need an OLED screen for this model, and there are likely other ways to cut down costs. (It's even stranger Apple kept out MagSafe and fast wireless charging, which would have been cheaper to implement, and arguably more useful, than a large OLED display.)\nAnd while it's nice to have the A18 chip (albeit with one less GPU core) and full Apple Intelligence support, I agree with my colleague Igor Bonifacic that users aren't exactly clamoring for those AI features. If we had to blame one culprit for the iPhone 16e's pricing, though, it's likely Apple Intelligence. After all, Apple is still fighting to prove it isn't too far behind Microsoft, Google and OpenAI. In any other year, Apple might have been able to justify throwing an older chip in the 16e, but that's not possible when it's in the middle of an AI hype war.\nMostly, I'm just sad that Apple is once again raising the price of admission to its walled garden without much justification. There's something special \u2014 noble, even \u2014 about sub-$500 smartphones. They're a reminder of a saner era of smartphones, when prices were being driven down by phones like the Moto G. These days you're left with Android phones like the Pixel 8a (and potentially the upcoming Pixel 9a), as well as the $400 Samsung Galaxy A35 and $499 Galaxy A55.\nNow that the dream of a sub-$500 iPhone is well and truly dead, it feels like Apple is just setting the stage for future price jumps. A $600 or $650 iPhone 17e will certainly look like a deal compared to a $850 or $900 iPhone 17. And just wait for the inevitable $2,000 iPhone foldable, which could potentially be specced beyond $3,000.\nOf course, you could be a smart Apple shopper and opt for used or refurbished iPhones. I recently picked up a refurbished iPhone 14 Plus as an early Mothers' Day gift for $420, and Amazon currently has listings for iPhone 14 Pros right under $500. Those devices won't support Apple Intelligence, but I'd argue sticking to the used market is simply a more useful form of intelligence.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\niPhone 16e review: What's your acceptable compromise?\nIs it MagSafe? Is it not having a second camera or Dynamic Island?\nI\u2019ve been traveling through time this week. Reviewing the iPhone 16e feels at once like I\u2019m visiting my younger self and also forced to live in olden times, especially since I\u2019ve been using an iPhone 16 Pro for months. No matter the device you\u2019re currently using, getting the iPhone 16e necessitates embracing change. Sure, that\u2019s part and parcel of getting any new phone (and any transition in life), but when it comes to the iPhone 16e, not all change is good. And when you consider the $599 starting price, many of the omissions, ostensibly made in an effort to squeeze Apple Intelligence into the most affordable iPhone, become harder to swallow.\nIt isn\u2019t surprising that Apple had to make compromises with the iPhone 16e to offer a more affordable entry-level device; what\u2019s unexpected is the decision to not add a second camera or MagSafe. Just the fact that it insists on calling the iPhone 16e\u2019s 48-megapixel camera a \u201c2-in-1 camera system,\u201d makes it clear the company knows two sensors is something people want.\nInstead, the iPhone 16e comes with an A18 chip that powers Apple Intelligence, as well as the C1 modem, which is the first designed by the company. You\u2019ll need to be extremely meticulous when poring over the list of similarities and differences between all the currently available iPhones, since there are many tiny factors to consider. What wireless charging speed or standard of Wi-Fi would you need? Do you care about cameras?\nSure, you can compare these specs yourself, but I\u2019m here to tell you exactly what these differences mean in the real world. In my week or so with the iPhone 16e, I felt the drawbacks of the camera the most \u2014 I can live without MagSafe and the Dynamic Island. But what the iPhone 16e does offer is fast performance, a clean design, long battery life and, most crucially, cheaper access to Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\nThe iPhone 16e is the most affordable entry into Apple Intelligence and the rest of the company\u2019s ecosystem, and is a solid option for anyone who doesn\u2019t care very much about smartphone photography.\n- Solid performance\n- Long battery life\n- Clean, durable design\n- Bright, vibrant screen\n- Only one rear camera, leading to many limitations\n- Expensive compared to previous iPhone SE\n- No MagSafe\nDesign and display\nLet\u2019s be real: Apple was never going to launch another iPhone SE in 2025 with a dated design and no AI support. The iPhone 16e, like its name suggests, is visually very similar to the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup. That is, until you turn the screen on. Once you can see the bezels and the notch up top, the device has a stronger resemblance to an iPhone 14. I was only temporarily distracted by the relatively thick borders, though. Anyone coming to the iPhone 16e from an older iPhone is unlikely to be bothered by this. More importantly, the display is protected by the Ceramic Shield material that was introduced on the iPhone 12. The previous iPhone SE did not have this same protection.\nOn its back, the iPhone 16e has a plain white (or black) matte surface with a single camera at the top left corner. It was hard to differentiate between the three iPhone 16 models I carried around for testing unless I looked at their rears \u2014 that\u2019s how similar they are. In fact, their dimensions are almost identical, with less than a millimeter and 3 grams separating the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 16.\niPhone 16e | iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Pro |\n146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8 mm 5.78 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8 mm 5.81 x 2.82 x. 0.31 inches | 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25 mm 5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches |\n5.88 ounces / 167 grams | 6.00 ounces / 170 grams | 7.03 ounces / 189 grams |\nIn real life, the only thing I really noticed was the weight. All these phones fit in my pockets and purses, and for once Apple\u2019s cheapest phone doesn\u2019t immediately appear drastically out of place. The iPhone 16e even has the Action Button that debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which I\u2019ll talk more about later.\nEven the most discerning reviewer will have a hard time complaining about the iPhone 16e\u2019s 6.1-inch display. Not only does it finally feel like something you can use in 2025 thanks to its size (compared to the 4.7-inch anachronism that is the iPhone SE\u2019s screen), the fact that it\u2019s an OLED panel means it\u2019s brighter and more vibrant. All the better to watch Instagram and TikTok videos on, right?\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that the iPhone 16 gets significantly brighter. Even the iPhone 15, which costs $100 more than the 16e, hits the same numbers as the iPhone 16, though only the latter can get down to 1 nit of brightness. I'll also point out that many Android phones at this price offer faster refresh rates, which would make doomscrolling a lot smoother. The iPhone 16e is stuck at the same slow 60Hz as the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, while the Pro models get ProMotion speeds of up to 120Hz. Neither the iPhone 16 nor the 16e support Apple's Always On Display, either.\nOne final difference on the iPhone 16e is that it\u2019s the last remaining handset across Apple\u2019s lineup to have a notch on its display. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 both have the company\u2019s pill-shaped Dynamic Island, which has functional benefits as well as looking better. It lets you keep an eye on live activities, like a timer, sports event ticker, ongoing media playback and more. It\u2019s funny how dependent I\u2019ve become on this feature in the years since it was introduced. On the iPhone 16e, I was slightly confused and annoyed that I couldn\u2019t access quick controls for Spotify in the notch, for example, or that voice recordings wouldn\u2019t appear in the notch as animated waveforms.\nStill, people considering the iPhone 16e are more likely to have never encountered Dynamic Island in their daily lives, so it won\u2019t be a jarring change. It\u2019s unlikely to factor into your consideration when buying a new phone, but this experience certainly shed light on my feelings for a recent feature I\u2019d grown to take for granted.\nCamera experience and performance\nSince reviewing the iPhone 16e has felt like traveling back in time, I took it to the Met museum to photograph some ancient artifacts, with the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro as testing companions.\nFor the most part, the iPhone 16e and iPhone 16 delivered about the same level of detail, saturation and vibrancy. It was even hard to tell which of the two devices did better with my low-light shots of a beautiful chandelier suspended above a room from an 18th-century Parisian hotel. Although they have similar 48MP sensors, the iPhone 16\u2019s is larger, which makes the closeness in performance here slightly surprising.\nThe same goes for selfies, which largely looked almost identical whether I shot them on the iPhone 16 or the 16e. Though both devices pack 12MP TrueDepth cameras up front, each packs a custom sensor and lens that integrate with the software and Apple Silicon. It\u2019s unclear what exactly the differences lie, but suffice it to say that regardless, they took photos of comparable quality.\nIt\u2019d be nice if I could say the iPhone 16e delivered basically the same camera experience as the iPhone 16 for $200 less. But the lack of a second lens on the rear is limiting in a few key ways.\nFirst, there\u2019s the fact that an ultrawide camera is just more versatile. Not having one presented challenges quite quickly, like when I entered a small room in the British art hall and wanted to capture the entirety of a pair of tall display cases containing dozens of ornate plates. With the iPhone 16e, I had to back up so much that I almost had to leave the space to get the two cases to fit in the frame. On the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, switching over to the 0.5x zoom option enabled me to take the shot without moving much at all.\nYou\u2019ll also find an older version of Portrait mode on the iPhone 16e, and this is where the majority of my grievances with the camera lie. If you don\u2019t care about pictures with blurred backgrounds and a faux depth of field effect, you\u2019ll be a lot less bothered. But for those like me, it might be frustrating to learn that the iPhone 16e\u2019s Portrait mode only works when it detects a face in the scene. This harkens back to the days of the iPhone 7 Plus, when Portrait Camera was first rolled out. Even then, Apple was able to apply the effect to non-human faces and objects like plants as the dual-camera system enabled the iPhone to calculate depth and add blur based on that.\nSetting aside the annoyance I felt at not being able to use Portrait mode on food, animals or other subjects, the fact that the iPhone 16e is using data from one camera for this effect also impacts its results. This was noticeable in my portraits taken of a bust in the museum\u2019s European Sculpture Court. With the pricier phone and its two cameras, Apple delivered more accurate blur, keeping the visage, hair and neck looking crisp. On the iPhone 16e, the sculpture\u2019s neck and chest were blurry upon closer inspection.\nI ended up playing a game of \u201cWill it Portrait or Will it Not Portrait\u201d in the museum, pointing the iPhone 16e at random faces in faded tapestries, softly outlined sculptures and oh so many busts. Frequently, even when a face was clearly visible to me, the iPhone 16e wouldn\u2019t recognize that one was in frame and did not allow me to snap a Portrait.\nAgain, this is frustrating only if you take a lot of pictures in that mode. You might be able to live with a single camera if you don\u2019t mind inferior Portraits compared to higher-end iPhones. However, bear in mind that the solo sensor setup also means you won\u2019t get things like the latest generation of Photographic Styles, the company\u2019s sophisticated color and tone filters which I raved about when I first tested it for my iPhone 16 Pro review. While that\u2019s a more recent feature, it\u2019s hard to ignore that anyone coming from an iPhone 11 or later already has a dual-camera setup and will have to give up an ultrawide camera and a faceless Portrait mode.\nThe iPhone 16e is also missing camera features like Spatial, Action and Cinematic modes, which are omissions that actually matter less at this price. Though I think having Macro support would be nice, I can understand its absence since it\u2019s for more niche use cases than portraits.\nIt\u2019s also reasonable that the iPhone 16e doesn\u2019t have Camera Control, which is the dedicated side button that debuted on the rest of the iPhone 16 family last year. I\u2019ve grown to appreciate it as a quick, tactile way to launch the camera app (though I don\u2019t care as much for the touch-sensitive slider controls).\nI thought I\u2019d miss it when having to test the iPhone 16e, since I was going to be repeatedly opening its camera all day. But I managed to mostly substitute that by configuring the Action button to launch the camera. The Action button\u2019s location near the top of the right edge isn\u2019t ideal, since it\u2019s more of a reach, but it\u2019s better than having to pull out the iPhone, tap its screen and long press or swipe the camera shortcut.\nThe Action Button as a gateway to Apple Intelligence\nYou can also set the Action button to switch between audio profiles or focus modes, turn on the Flashlight or even start any app or series of actions you can customize via Apple\u2019s Shortcuts. Crucially, you can set the button to launch Visual Intelligence, as well. This represents the first time Visual Intelligence has been accessible via something other than Camera Control since its introduction with the iPhone 16 series last year. The capability is also coming to iPhone 15 Pro models via an iOS 18.4 update. At the moment, without long-pressing a physical button, you can\u2019t use your iPhone\u2019s camera to look up things around you.\nWhen I set the iPhone 16e\u2019s Action button to launch Visual Intelligence, I got basically the same experience as I did on the iPhone 16 Pro. I pointed it at nearby plants and the very fashionable and hip sneakers I had on. Though Siri (with ChatGPT\u2019s help) did not correctly identify the brand of my shoes, it did suggest some similar styles. Google\u2019s image search, which is the other of the two built-in options to get answers from your iPhone\u2019s camera, delivered slightly more helpful results for the wooden table I was looking at and where I could buy something similar.\nApple Intelligence\nVisual Intelligence is just one part of the entire Apple Intelligence package, which permeates the iPhone 16 lineup. I won\u2019t dwell too long on the individual features here, since we\u2019ve already covered them fairly extensively since the company started rolling them out last year. I will just say that I was able to fairly smoothly use Image Playground to create a background for an event I was coordinating in Apple Invites, get my haphazardly written notes proofread and summarize a Wikipedia entry on Zero Day TV series via Writing Tools. The iPhone 16e is a capable Apple Intelligence machine, if AI is your thing.\nPerformance, the Apple C1 modem and battery life\nAll of that is powered by the A18 chip sitting inside the iPhone 16e, and the fact that it\u2019s in a phone that doesn\u2019t cost $700 to start is surprising. It may have one less GPU core than the iPhone 16, but that didn\u2019t hinder my escape from the hordes of ghouls chasing me down in Vampire Survivor. That\u2019s a fairly simple game to run, computationally speaking, and I\u2019ve yet to really push the iPhone 16e with more demanding options. But if you\u2019re looking for a phone that will handle titles like Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile or League of Legends: Wild Rift without hiccups, you\u2019ll have to spend hundreds more.\nIn daily use, the iPhone 16e was smooth and zippy, and the only slowdowns I encountered were in situations that also challenged powerhouses like the iPhone 16 Pro. That included waiting for Apple Intelligence to make a Genmoji of a \u201cvideo shoot,\u201d for example, or for Image Playground to return results based on the same prompt. Sometimes Cleanup in the Photos app would not respond despite my repeated drawing on things I wanted to erase from an image, but that feels more like an Apple Intelligence issue than a slow processor. I noticed the slightest delay compared to the iPhone 16 when waiting for Night mode to complete capturing a photo in low light, with the iPhone 16e taking a second or so longer.\nWith its bigger battery and new C1 modem, the iPhone 16e is supposed to last a few hours longer than the iPhone 16 when playing video. Though I was unable to run a full-on battery test, in general the iPhone 16e had no problem lasting well longer than 24 hours. I pulled it off the charger on Sunday at about 10am and on Tuesday morning I still had 60 percent left after a day of camera testing. Granted, this is still a very new device that I\u2019ve been using as a secondary phone, so runtimes will likely drop a bit with greater use. But compared to my experience with a brand new review unit of the iPhone 16 Pro, the iPhone 16e certainly gave me far less battery anxiety.\nAs for that custom modem, it's hard to tell after just one week of use whether people will run into any significant issues or interference. But during my time with the iPhone 16e on an AT&T eSIM, I've found little problems with the network. I'm a T-Mobile user, and often lose signal when I'm at places like underground train stations or Moynihan Train Hall in Penn Station. When I couldn't send a message on my iPhone 16 Pro with T-Mobile, I was able to connect over AT&T with the iPhone 16e. This has less to do with Apple's hardware and more to do with each carrier's coverage, of course.\nThe same goes for the modem's general performance \u2014 I consistently saw the iPhone 16e (with C1) significantly outperform my iPhone 16 Pro on Speedtest and Fast.com tests, but much of that has to do with individual network speeds. It also depends on whether you're using a phone that supports ultrawideband 5G, which would see huge boosts to performance. The C1 modem doesn't support that, so if you've been relying on mmWave 5G (mostly via Verizon in the US), you'll have to sacrifice it if you buy the iPhone 16e.\nHow does the iPhone 16e compare to the iPhone 16 and the iPhone SE?\nThere are numerous other little differences between the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 16, and I\u2019ll list some of the more significant ones here. Probably the most noteworthy is that it doesn\u2019t support Apple\u2019s MagSafe, which would let it magnetically attach to stands, grips and other accessories. As someone who plops her iPhone on a MagSafe charging stand only when there is no other USB cable available, the lack of MagSafe didn\u2019t actually meaningfully impact my experience. But if you rely on such an accessory, the iPhone 16e isn\u2019t for you.\nWhile you could add MagSafe compatibility to the 16e with cases or adapters, you\u2019ll still be stuck with pokey, last-generation 7.5W wireless charging speeds (per the Qi standard). Other iPhones support faster speeds \u2014 the iPhone 15 goes up to 15W while the iPhone 16 can hit 25W.\nIf we\u2019re going to get down to the nitty gritty, I should also point out that the iPhone 16e supports Wi-Fi 6, not Wi-Fi 7 like the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16e is also lacking compatibility with the Thread smart home networking standard and while its camera does offer optical image stabilization, it\u2019s not the \u201cSensor-shift\u201d OIS that the iPhone 16 (and the iPhone 15) provide. Finally, and this is far from the last omission from the iPhone 16e, the device doesn't support ultra-wideband, meaning if you're locating your devices via Find My, you will rely on Bluetooth and won't get the more precise tracking on AirTags and phones that have UWB.\nAll this spec-sheet scrutiny is getting at is that as an investment, the iPhone 16e is likely to get outdated again sooner than the iPhone 16. Still, it\u2019s a nice upgrade from the iPhone SE (2022), thanks to the addition of USB-C charging, a sharper camera, an actual zoom option, a beefier processor, satellite communications for emergencies and a bigger, better screen. Regardless of how you (or I) feel about Apple Intelligence, there\u2019s no denying that its inclusion makes for a phone that\u2019s more modern, too. Also, Genmoji is just fun.\nConsidering how far behind the iPhone SE was compared to the iPhone 13, the fact that the iPhone 16e is so close to the rest of the iPhone 16 portfolio is impressive. I guess I would have preferred a cheaper entry-level iPhone with a few other compromises, rather than one that\u2019s so similar (in both specs and price) to the next version up.\nAnd as much as I\u2019d like to compare the iPhone 16e to its peers on the Android side of the smartphone market, I have to acknowledge that most people considering an iPhone are likely already happily stuck in the Apple walled garden. They probably don\u2019t want an Android phone, no matter how many cameras it has, how quickly its screen refreshes or how fast it can charge. When you can be a blue bubble texter, who cares about how much smoother a game plays or how rapidly Instagram posts zoom past my eyes, right? (Sarcasm, in case it wasn\u2019t obvious.) If you did want to learn more though, check out our post on how the iPhone 16e compares to the competition.\nWrap-up\nIt\u2019s easy for me to get caught up in outrage, ranting at Apple\u2019s decisions to exclude MagSafe or raise prices. But for people who don\u2019t use magnetic accessories or who finance their smartphones over a two-year period, those might be non-issues. What bothered me most as I was reviewing the iPhone 16e wasn\u2019t its slow wireless charging speed or the notch atop the display \u2014 it was ultimately the solo camera sensor. Anyone coming from the iPhone 11 and up will likely miss the ultrawide option, even if the iPhone 16e\u2019s 48MP sensor is a genuine improvement.\nWhether the iPhone 16e is a good purchase for you ultimately depends on how much those limitations bother you. If you don\u2019t care about MagSafe, taking photos or the principle that you could save hundreds of dollars on a better Android phone, the iPhone 16e makes sense.\nIn fact, for people who want to buy their first iPhone or someone who\u2019s less tech-enthusiastic, the iPhone 16e is a capable, good-looking handset. Those who, like me, can\u2019t do without a second camera, can consider the iPhone 15, which costs just $100 more. You won\u2019t get Apple Intelligence or the Action button, but I doubt many will miss those features.\nUltimately, though, unless you really can\u2019t fork over the $200 difference (which works out to a few dollars a month over two years), the iPhone 16 is a better buy for most people."

      "text": "iOS 26 public beta is available to download: Everything you need to know about the new iPhone and iPad update\nExciting changes are coming to your iPhone this fall, including a new aesthetic called Liquid Glass.\nGaining access to iOS 26 on your iPhone is getting closer, but the release is still over a month away, coming this fall. But you can start testing the new features now by downloading and installing Apple's public beta, which CEO Tim Cook recently said is (along with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we\u2019ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant \u2014 first promised at WWDC 2024 \u2014 is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. Now that iOS 26 developer beta 5 is available, we're seeing more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.\nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it \u2014 version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. (Meanwhile, iOS 18 is still getting new versions this summer, too.)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year \u2014 the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some \u2014 including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar \u2014 like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.\nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheckout our first impressions of iPadOS 26.\nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS \u2014 iPhone XR, XS and XS Max \u2014 won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September.\nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 \u2014 exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

      "text": "While the iPhone 17 Pro is not expected to launch until September, a prototype of the device has potentially been spotted in the wild. However, the mysterious device could be just about anything, so this might simply be a false alarm.\nX account @Skyfops today shared two somewhat blurry photos of the mysterious device. The post was later shared by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\n\"I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild,\" the post said.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ \u2014 Fox Pupy (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\nIn one of the photos, a person wearing reflective sunglasses can be seen holding what appears to be an iPhone inside of a thick black protective case, which might be intended to disguise the design of the iPhone 17 Pro in public. They are also holding what appears to be an iPhone 16 Pro with a sticker on the back of it, which could be hiding a data matrix code that allows Apple to track internal iPhones used by employees for development purposes.\nWhat might make the disguised device an iPhone 17 Pro? Rumors indicate that the back of the device will have a rectangular camera bump, with the LED flash, rear microphone, and LiDAR Scanner expected to be vertically aligned on the right side of the bump. And in the photo, the back of the device seems to have circular openings in the top-right corner for what could be the LED flash and LiDAR Scanner.\nGurman seems to think the photos might be the real deal. \"This looks legit,\" he said.\nAdding to the intrigue, @Skyfops alleged that \"the guy on the right was security and trying to go in front of the iPhone to hide it.\"\nThe user is located in Los Angeles, according to the account's bio.\nEven if this really was an iPhone 17 Pro prototype in the wild, these photos do not really show anything that is not already rumored. But who doesn't love an old-school 2010-era rumor in mid-summer, as we count down the days to Apple's announcement?"

And it looks like a redesigned camera block isn\u2019t the only new thing coming for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max.\nThe leak in question comes from Sonny Dixon on X, and shows off four color options for each new model. And there's one color that definitely stands out.\niPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max in bold orange\nFor the most part, the shades for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are what we'd expect \u2014 with a black, white and blue option.\nHowever, the image also shows a bright orange finish that\u2019s far louder than previous hues we\u2019ve seen in recent models like the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro.\nWe previously reported on a possible orange iPhone 17 Pro, so it looks like this leak could be legit.\niPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17\nThe next line of phones in the image is the iPhone 17 Air, which has four dummy models in black, white, gold and a light blue. The light blue option in the image appears to match the Sky Blue color available for the 2025 MacBook Air.\nAs rumored, the iPhone 17 Air pictured features only a single rear camera. At least the Galaxy S25 Edge ships with dual rear cameras.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 17 models in the image feature black, white, light blue and pink. Unfortunately, the lavender option that was heavily rumored to make an appearance is missing, which could mean it didn't make it past testing.\nA new design for the iPhone 17 Pros\nApple\u2019s new design for its next generation of phones also seems to be confirmed if these leaked dummy units are accurate. While the iPhone 17 looks pretty similar to current models, the iPhone 17 Pro and the Pro Max feature an elongated camera array, although, as Bloomberg's Mark Gurman stated, the two-tone color options are not present.\nThese leaks follow on from a recent social media post allegedly showing someone holding an iPhone 17 Pro unit in the wild. The phone in the image is in a large black case, so there\u2019s no indication of colors, but evidence is mounting that this is the design that Apple is planning on going with.\nWith that said, we won\u2019t know anything for sure until Apple officially unveils the phone, which will almost certainly happen in early September.

Auch in diesem Jahr soll die Vorstellung der neuen iPhone-Generation in der zweiten vollen Septemberwoche stattfinden. Internen Informationen aus dem Umfeld deutscher Mobilfunkanbieter zufolge f\u00e4llt die Wahl in diesem Jahr auf Dienstag, den 9. September. Damit w\u00fcrde das n\u00e4chste gro\u00dfe Apple-Event in genau 35 Tagen \u00fcber die B\u00fchne gehen.\nNur noch 35 Tage Wartezeit\nDer Ablauf folgt dem \u00fcblichen Muster: Direkt im Anschluss an die Pr\u00e4sentation startet Apple am darauffolgenden Freitag die Vorbestellphase. Eine Woche sp\u00e4ter, am 19. September, beginnt dann die Auslieferung an Kunden sowie der Verkauf in Apple Stores und bei autorisierten Partnern, zun\u00e4chst in den wichtigsten M\u00e4rkten weltweit. Also in den USA, in China, Europa und Japan.\nMit dem iPhone 17 soll in diesem Jahr nicht nur eine neue Ger\u00e4tegeneration, sondern auch ein \u00fcberarbeitetes Line-up vorgestellt werden. Ger\u00fcchten zufolge verzichtet Apple auf das bisher angebotene Plus-Modell und f\u00fchrt stattdessen ein besonders d\u00fcnnes Modell unter dem Namen iPhone 17 Air ein. Dieses soll neben dem regul\u00e4ren iPhone 17 und den beiden Pro-Varianten als viertes Modell erscheinen.\nSo hier? Das iPhone 17, das 17 Air, das 17 Pro und das 17 Pro Max\nOptisch wird eine \u00fcberarbeitete R\u00fcckseite erwartet, ebenso wie eine neu angeordnete Kameraeinheit. Technische Details sind bislang noch nicht offiziell best\u00e4tigt, erste Leaks deuten jedoch auf subtile Design\u00e4nderungen und m\u00f6gliche Verbesserungen bei Display und Kamera hin.\nBegleitet von Watch und neuen AirPods Pro\nNeben den neuen iPhones d\u00fcrften auch weitere Produktneuheiten pr\u00e4sentiert werden. Erwartet wird unter anderem die dritte Generation der AirPods Pro sowie neue Modelle der Apple Watch. In Summe d\u00fcrfte Apple das Event nutzen, um mehrere Ger\u00e4tefamilien gleichzeitig zu aktualisieren, allerdings werden wir uns auf die neue Generation des HomePods wohl noch bis zum kommenden Jahr gedulden m\u00fcssen.\nMit den HomePods nicht so schlimm. Hauptsache das iPad Pro M5 kommt noch dieses Jahr\nWarum? Reicht dir das M4 nicht?!\nWozu die Frage? Wenn er sowieso eine Neuanschaffung plant, ist es doch vollkommen richtig, dass er dann noch die paar Tage wartet, um dann auch den neuen Chip zu bekommen anstatt jetzt f\u00fcr eventuell fast das gleiche Geld den alten zu kaufen.\nNein ich brauche eines mit M8 damit der 13er schl\u00fcssel passt\n;-)\nChris1982 und wenn er ein IPad M4 hat, ist die Frage nicht berechtigt?!\nIch habe kein iPad Pro. Daher meine Hoffnung.\nSehr gut! Du wirst es lieben!\nIch liebe auch meinen M5 :)\nAlso, ich glaube nicht, dass der Balken an der Kamera so breit bleibt, ohne irgendwas. Da kommt bestimmt ein kleines Display hin, wie bei anderen Smartphones (falthandys ect.)\nJa genau, tr\u00e4um weiter\nIch vermute, der Platz wird f\u00fcr die 8-fach Zoom Mechanik ben\u00f6tigt.\nTr\u00e4um mal sch\u00f6n weiter\nIch glaub, nur das gro\u00dfe \u201ePro Max\u201c bekommt die Farbe orange.\niPhone Ultra in International Orange (so haben sie damals die Akzente an der Apple Watch Ultra genannt)\nBl\u00f6dsinn. Das ist nicht mal n Orange, sondern wird wie Kupfer aussehen. Das Ger\u00fccht gab es damals schon. Orange ist es nur weil es einer gesehen hat, die Farbe beschrieben hat und so weiter.\nDu kannst ja mal nachsehen, in welcher Farbe die Golden Gate Bridge gestrichen ist.\nIch hoffe echt auf neue HomePods. Will dieses Jahr einige Zimmer mit denen ausstatten, aber nicht n\u00e4chstes Jahr neue kaufen m\u00fcssen f\u00fcr Apple Intelligence\nDu willst dir basierend auf einem Versprechen (Apple Intelligence\u2026) neue, \u00fcberteuerte Apple Lautsprecher kaufen, solche, die sie in der Vergangenheit schon mal halbherzig hingefrickelt haben? Dann macht ja Apple alles richtig\u2026zumindest aus Sicht ihrer Aktion\u00e4re.\n+1\nKlar machen die alles richtig. Schaut ihr nicht auf die Quartalszahlen? Oder k\u00f6nnt ihr diese nicht lesen? Warum wird das immer hier festgestellt. So langsam wie ihr seid.\nHoffe auf ein neues Apple TV ist dann mein erstes.\nWarte auch schon drauf mir einen zu zulegen. M\u00f6chte aber jetzt nicht mehr in den Alten investieren, wo doch so langsam mal nen neues Modell kommen m\u00fcsste\nWas soll ein neues Modell denn mehr k\u00f6nnen?\nBessere Performance hei\u00dft l\u00e4ngere Updates und Funktionen = auf Dauer eine bessere Investition, als in g\u00fcnstigere L\u00f6sungen.\nNeuer Chip bedeutet auch bessere Spiele m\u00f6glicherweise\nIhr werdet auf Macrumors erw\u00e4hnt :-)\nGl\u00fcckwunsch zum MacRumors Shout Out!\nWir freuen uns auf das gleiche Ger\u00e4t wie letztes Jahr und das Jahr zuvor :)\nAber mit noch mehr Versprechungen! Naja zumindestens bald\u2026 in Zukunft. Vielleicht. Aber erstmal nur USA. Als Beta.\nSo sieht\u2019s aus\niPhone Spiegeln gibt\u2019s noch immer nicht in Germany \u2026 Ich glaube an die Vorstellungsm\u00e4rchen nicht mehr. Wer mehrmals in Folge nicht abliefert, verliert das Vertrauen.\nLiegt aber nicht an Apple sondern der EU.\nNa klar\u2026..\nApple sagt es liegt an der EU \u2013 dann liegt es an der EU\u2026..\nVielleicht mal mit dem Thema besch\u00e4ftigen, dann weisst Du auch das es keinesfalls an der EU liegt.\nEs liegt nicht an der EU, erst nachlesen und nicht den Lemming machen.\nWie w\u00e4r\u2019s denn mit einem Mini\nDer Markt ist auf jeden Fall da.\nDatum kann stimmen. Aber mir fehlt so ein bisschen die Quellenangabe. \u201eAus dem Umfeld Mobilfunkanbieter\u201c ist so \u00e4hnlich wie die Cousine von der Tante und deren Mutter.\nHoffentlich ne neue Applewatch Ultra die ihrem Namen gerecht wird und nicht nur ne neue Farbe\u2026.\nUnd eigentlich kann man das n\u00e4chste iPhone (abgesehen von den Farben) genauso ank\u00fcndigen, wie das Letzte.\nVielleicht schafft man es ja n\u00e4chstes Jahr alle Versprechen nachzuliefern.\nWenn ich zuf\u00e4llig zu der Zeit im Urlaub w\u00e4re, k\u00f6nnte ich dann trotzdem \u00fcber die App das iPhone zur Abholung in Deutschland vorbestellen?

Allen Anderen \u201eviel Spass beim Geldausgeben\u201c.\nstark! Schicke das am besten direkt an die Apple Distribution Mailadresse, evtl. wird dadurch nochmal alles \u00fcberdacht.\n+1\nWei\u00df jemand wof\u00fcr der optisch hervorgehobene Bereich unter den Kameras ist?\nDer ist aus Galus und geht leichter kaput als der Rest?\nDer ist aus Glas und geht leichter kaput als der Rest?\nSoll ich mir das iPhone 17 oder lieber das 16er zum g\u00fcnstigeren Preis kaufen, wenn es dann wieder m\u00f6glichst lange halten soll (>= 8 Jahre)?\nIch habe zur Zeit noch das XS und werde mir dieses Jahr wohl das Siebziger g\u00f6nnen. Dann hab ich die acht Jahre erreicht.\nWie geht das, wenn das XS im September 2018 ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde?\n@Sandro: soll tats\u00e4chlich Leute geben, die iPhones gebraucht kaufen und reichlich Geld sparen ;-)\n@khw Wenn ich mir die Preise so anschaue, scheint sich das f\u00fcrs iPhone 16 aktuell nicht zu lohnen. Und nach dem iPhone 8 m\u00f6chte ich mal wieder ein aktuelles Ger\u00e4t.\nRechne mal khw, dann kommst Du drauf\n@khw, gebraucht soll er das auch noch gekauft haben?

Nach dem Motto: ich g\u00f6nne mir das, solange ich neu Features noch versteh und ausnutzen kann (man wird ja nicht j\u00fcnger ;-) ).\nDas 16er hat mich dann aber v\u00f6llig entt\u00e4uscht und bis jetzt sehe ich bei den 17er Ger\u00fcchten auch noch nichts wirklich dolles.\nIch sehe mich schon irgendwann im Altersheim sitzen, mit meinem 15er in der wackligen Hand ;-)\nMan macht halt auch nicht mehr alles mit und ob das jetzt alles ein wirklich ben\u00f6tigtes Feature ist i dont know. Selbst bei Apple Intelligence also das kann ja auch alles ChatGPT. Ich bin immer noch beim 12 Pro.\nChat GPT kann also Notifications zusammenfassen? Lokal auf dem Ger\u00e4t? LOL\nEyh ist bisschen OT vielleicht aber gestern Leute ist meine Maus vom MacBook auf dem iPad gelandet und ich habe sie nicht mehr zur\u00fcck bekommen auf mein MacBook lol\nNaja wlan und bluetooth aus aufm iPad und dann war die Maus wieder da\nSuper Story :)"

      "text": "Apple read your mean tweets about Liquid Glass and Finder\nThe second developer betas changed the look of Liquid Glass and Finder.\nThe more things change, the more they stay the same. After unveiling some new visual elements to the next generation of its operating systems during WWDC 2025, Apple has already walked back some of the proposed design revisions. 9to5Mac noticed that the most recent developer betas included changes to the new Liquid Glass operating system appearance and to the Finder app icon.\nLiquid Glass was divisive from the start. The idea of layering transparency in the user interface appealed to some, while others felt it was needlessly fussy and hard to read, especially when using the Control Center. In the second developer beta of iOS 26, Apple has increased the darkness and blur on the background when the Control Center is active.\nThe other controversial change centered on the imagery for the Finder app in macOS Tahoe. The previous developer beta flipped the colors in the icon, putting blue on the right and white on the left. It's a reversal of decades of Mac design, which has long had a lighter shade on the right and a darker color on the left, even as other details of the face illustration have changed. And people were not pleased about it. The usual color layout has returned in the current developer beta."

      "text": "Apple to invest another $100 billion into the US to avoid tariffs\nThe company previously committed to investing $500 billion over the next five years.\nApple plans to invest an additional $100 billion in the US, the company announced on Wednesday. The investment follows President Donald's Trump's announcement yesterday that he would impose a 100 percent tariff on chip imports, with an exemption for any companies \"building in the United States.\"\nAlso relevant is the White House's previously announced plans to raise tariffs on India by an additional 25 percent (bringing the total tariff to 50 percent) for purchasing oil from Russia. Apple relies heavily on manufacturers in India to create the iPhone, so adding to its already $500 billion investment in the US is likely a way to avoid being impacted by the tariffs.\n\"Today, we're proud to increase our investments across the United States to $600 billion over four years and launch our new American Manufacturing Program,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook shared in a statement. \"This includes new and expanded work with 10 companies across America. They produce components that are used in Apple products sold all over the world, and we\u2019re grateful to the President for his support.\"\nIn February, Apple said its original $500 billion investment plan would go towards building Apple Intelligence servers in the US, and that the majority of the new jobs the funding would provide would be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development and AI and machine learning. As part of this additional investment, Apple says it's also deepening its relationship and investment in component makers working in the US, like Corning and Amkor.\nCorning produces the glass for iPhones and Apple Watches, and the company says that \"soon, every iPhone and Apple Watch sold around the world will be built with Kentucky-made cover glass.\" Apple is investing in Amkor to take advantage of the company's \"advanced chip packaging and test facility in Arizona.\" Apple says its \"leading the creation of an end-to-end silicon supply chain in the United States\" through its investments.\nIn addition, Apple said it would be working with Samsung \"to launch an innovative new technology for making chips, which has never been used before anywhere in the world.\" Those chips will reportedly be cutting-edge image sensors for iPhone cameras and be built in Texas, according to The Financial Times. Apple may be shifting at least part of its sensor purchases to Samsung from Sony due to tariffs \u2014 Samsung has chip plants in the US and Sony doesn't. Apple said that Texas Instruments, Broadcom and GlobalFoundries would expand component manufacturing in the US as well.\nIn a statement to Bloomberg before the announcement, a White House spokesperson suggested the new investment would \"help reshore the production of critical components to protect America\u2019s economic and national security.\" The Trump administration has previously called for Apple to make the iPhone in the US, something CNN reports is difficult to downright impossible.\nApple's current strategy for dealing with Trump is similar to how it handled the President during his first term. In 2019, Cook and Trump \"opened\" a Mac Pro factory in Texas. The factory had been up-and-running since 2013, but the President was pleased by the optics of making a deal. Apple's partnership with Amkor was similarly announced years ago in 2023, but is being trotted out now because it fits with Apple's \"American Manufacturing Program.\"\nApple is a trillion-dollar company that can afford to spend a few billion to avoid paying tariffs, but it also likely planned to increase its investment in the US anyway to keep up with competitors. It's entirely possible the company is just packaging its spending in a way that flatters the President.\nSteve Dent contributed to this report.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "Apple is said to be working on a 'significantly thinner' iPhone\nA more slender (and expensive) variant could be coming your way in 2025 to replace the Plus model.\nJust like it slimmed down the latest iPad Pro, Apple is said to be looking at making the iPhone more slender. To be more precise, the company is working on a \"significantly thinner\" device that may arrive as part of the iPhone 17 lineup in place of a Plus model, according to The Information.\nThis model has been described as an iPhone X-level leap forward in design language for the company, according to several sources. Apple has yet to lock down the design and it's said to be looking at various options, including an aluminum chassis. An upgraded front-facing camera could be housed alongside Face ID sensors in a smaller pill-shaped cutout, while the rear camera array could move to the center of the phone (that could reduce the possibility of accidentally covering the lenses with your fingers). The screen size is pegged somewhere in between that of the current base iPhone and the iPhone Pro Max \u2014 so between 6.12 and 6.69 inches.\nIf that's of interest to you, it's worth bearing in mind that the slimmed down iPhone may actually be more expensive than the iPhone Pro Max, which starts at $1,200. But hey, at least you'll have some time to save for it.\nThis thinner model could be set to replace the Plus in the iPhone lineup. The report suggests that there will be an iPhone 16 Plus, but that could be the end of that format, which hasn't lived up to Apple's sales expectations. This year's iPhones are said to be more about AI advancements than any major changes to the physical design, though there may be a new button on the side with touch sensitivity for improved camera control.\nEngadget has asked Apple for comment on the report. Meanwhile, there's unfortunately no indication that the company is going back to smaller screen sizes. I still miss my iPhone 5 sometimes.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

Among the latest discoveries stirring up conversation online is a safety and privacy feature for FaceTime that blurs your feed when it detects you in a state of undress. Should FaceTime detect nudity, it will display a message reading \"Audio and video are paused because you may be showing something sensitive. If you feel uncomfortable, you should end the call.\"\nOriginally discovered by X user @iDeviceHelpus, the feature is off by default and can be enabled in FaceTime settings under \"Sensitive Content Warning.\" The feature reads, \"Detect nude photos and videos before they are viewed on your device, and receive guidance to help make a safe choice. Apple does not have access to the photos or videos.\"It seems the feature is intended for child accounts, though it can currently be enabled in the beta for adults as well.\nThe Apple support page for the company's \"Communication Safety\" features reads, \"Communication Safety uses on-device machine learning to analyze photo and video attachments and determine if a photo or video appears to contain nudity. Because the photos and videos are analyzed on your child's device, Apple doesn't receive an indication that nudity was detected and doesn't get access to the photos or videos as a result.\"\nFeatures in beta come and go, as testing and feedback are partly the point of the beta system, so this may or may not see broader adoption. The public beta for iOS 26 is slated for July."

      "text": "We\u2019re only a few months away from the official launch of the iPhone 17 lineup, and multiple reports have covered what colors to expect for the new phones. Every year, Apple tries to surprise us with a few new colors for the new generation, and this year will be no different.\nMacworld has received information from independent sources about the colors of the iPhone 17 lineup that corroborate the latest rumors, so we now have a better idea of what they will look like.\nThese are the new iPhone 17 colors\nTo recap, some leakers have already reported on the potential colors for some of the models in the iPhone 17 family. For instance, a leaker known as Majin Bu said that Apple had been experimenting with purple and green versions of the iPhone 17 base model. The leaker also claims that the rumored ultra-thin \u201ciPhone 17 Air\u201d model will be available in a light shade of blue.\nMore recently, reputable leaker Sonny Dickson also revealed the possible two new colors of the 17 Pro models: dark blue and copper. Independent sources who requested anonymity told Macworld that we can indeed expect these new colors for the iPhone 17 lineup. The same source independently verified the Desert Titanium color for the iPhone 16 Pro before last year\u2019s launch.\nFoundry\nWe also obtained access to an internal document with the Pantone colors used as a reference for designing and building the new iPhones.\nWhile the colors are currently the same for both the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, Apple will provide different color options for the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air to distinguish the two models. The iPhone 17 base model is expected to be available in the following colors:\n- Black (same as iPhone 16)\n- White (same as iPhone 16)\n- Steel Gray (Pantone 18-4005-TPG)\n- Green (Pantone 2282 U)\n- Purple (Pantone 530 U)\n- Light Blue (Pantone 658 U)\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 17 Air will be available in four color options:\n- Black (same as iPhone 16)\n- White (brighter/colder than the iPhone 16)\n- Light Blue (Pantone 657 U)\n- Light Gold (Pantone 11-0604 TPG Gardenia)\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that, at least based on Pantone color references, the blue iPhone 17 Air will be slightly lighter than the base iPhone 17. Apple reportedly wants less saturated colors for the iPhone 17 Air to reinforce the lightness of the device, which is expected to weigh around 145 grams and be 5.5 mm thick.\nFoundry\nAccording to our sources, the blue of the iPhone 17 Air will resemble the Sky Blue introduced with the M4 MacBook Air. At the same time, the Gardenia model should look like a lighter version of the current Desert Titanium color option on the iPhone 16 Pro.\nSpeaking of the Pro models, Apple has prepared new colors for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max as well:\n- Black (same as iPhone 16 Pro)\n- White (same as iPhone 16 Pro)\n- Gray (similar to Natural Titanium)\n- Dark Blue (Pantone 19-4025 TPG Mood Indigo)\n- Orange (Pantone 1501243 TCX Papaya)\nThe blue iPhone 17 Pro will likely be very similar to the Blue Titanium color previously offered with the iPhone 15 Pro. The orange, on the other hand, will have a \u201cfluorescent\u201d look, according to our source, which also notes that due to materials and light in the real world, the colors on actual devices may differ slightly from their Pantone-based representations. Apple is reportedly switching from titanium to aluminum with the iPhone 17 Pro, which has clearly affected the shades Apple has chosen.\nFoundry\nApple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 at an event in September with several new features, including an A19 chip, 12GB of RAM for the Pro models, and a larger screen for the standard iPhone 17. Most notably, the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will replace the iPhone 16 Plus. There\u2019s also expected to be a new design for the rear camera, with a larger array that stretches across the back of the back."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nEvery MacBook Air now starts with 16GB of RAM at no extra cost\nApple is bringing its ultraportables in line with its M4 systems.\nNo, Apple isn't stuffing an M4 chip into the MacBook Air lineup just yet, but it is giving the ultraportables a healthy memory bump. Starting today, every M2 and M3-equipped MacBook Air will come with 16GB of RAM by default, making them better equipped for multitasking and memory-hungry Apple Intelligence features. Thankfully, Apple isn't changing its pricing: The M2 model still starts at $999, while the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air goes for $1,099 and the 15-inch variant runs for $1,299. (It's no wonder we've seen the 8GB systems drop as low as $700.)\nYou'll still have to live with a paltry 256GB of storage on all of the base MacBook Air systems, but hey, at least Apple is finally listening to our demands. We've long argued that it's worth bumping up to 16GB of RAM for most laptops. That's particularly true for Apple Silicon systems, which have memory directly built into their SoCs (system on a chip) and can't expand their RAM down the line.\nYou can thank AI as the main reason Apple and Microsoft (with Copilot+ AI PCs) are now pushing for 16GB of RAM. While Apple Intelligence requires 8GB of RAM to function, the company previously admitted it may not be enough to run the AI features in Xcode 16. As AI models grow and become more complex, their memory demands will only increase. More than ever, it pays to invest in as much RAM as you can up front.\nYou can order the refreshed MacBook Airs with 16GB of RAM online today, and they should be available in stores soon."

However, it\u2019s the smaller touches that make iOS 26 seem like a notable improvement over its predecessor.\nI\u2019ve been running the iOS 26 developer beta for the last two weeks and here's how Apple\u2019s new Liquid Glass design \u2014 and iOS 26 broadly \u2014 stacks up.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy or unstable software that could cause some of your apps to not work. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your data before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nLiquid Glass changes everything\niOS 26 looks new and modern. And for once, how Apple describes it \u2014 liquid glass \u2014 makes sense: it\u2019s a lot of layers of transparent elements overlapping and, in places, the animations are quite\u2026 liquidy. Menus and buttons will respond to your touch, with some of them coalescing around your finger and sometimes separating out into new menus.\nLiquid Glass encompasses the entire design of iOS. The home and lock screens have been redesigned once again, featuring a new skyscraping clock font that stretches out from the background of your photos, with ever-so-slight transparency. There\u2019s also a new 3D effect that infuses your photos with a bit of spatial magic, offering a touch of Vision Pro for iPhone users.\nThe experience in the first few builds of the iOS 26 beta was jarring and messy, especially with transparent icons and notifications, due to those overlapping elements making things almost illegible. Updates across subsequent releases have addressed this issue by making floating elements more opaque. There is also a toggle within the Accessibility tab in Settings to reduce transparency further, but I hope Apple offers a slider so that users can choose exactly how \u201cliquid\u201d they want their \u201cglass\u201d to be. If you own other Apple products, then you\u2019ll come to appreciate the design parity across your Mac, iPad and Apple Watch.\nOne noticeable change I'd been waiting for was the iOS search bar\u2019s relocation to the bottom of the screen. I first noticed it within Settings, but it reappears in Music, Podcasts, Photos and pretty much everywhere you might need to find specific files or menu items now. If, like me, you\u2019re an iPhone Pro or Plus user, you may have struggled to reach those search bars when they were at the top of the screen. It\u2019s a welcome improvement.\nVisual Intelligence\nWith iOS 26 on iPhones powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence, the company is bringing Visual Intelligence over to your screenshots. (Previously it was limited to Camera.) Once you\u2019ve grabbed a shot by pressing the power and volume up buttons, you\u2019ll get a preview of your image, surrounded by suggested actions that Apple Intelligence deduced would be relevant based on the contents of your screenshot.\nManaging Editor Cherlynn Low did a deep dive on what Visual Intelligence is capable of. From a screenshot, you can transfer information to other apps without having to switch or select them manually. This means I can easily screenshot tickets and emails, for example, to add to my calendar. Apple Intelligence can also identify types of plants, food and cars, even. If there are multiple people or objects in your screenshot, you can highlight what you want to focus on by circling it. There aren\u2019t many third-party app options at this point, but that\u2019s often the case with a beta build. These are features that Android users have had courtesy of Gemini for a year or two, but at least now we get something similar on iPhones.\nOne quick tip: Make sure to tap the markup button (the little pencil tip icon) to see Visual Intelligence in your screenshots. I initially thought my beta build was missing the feature, but it was just hidden behind the markup menu.\nMore broadly, Apple Intelligence continues to work well, but doesn't stand out in any particular way. We\u2019re still waiting for Siri to receive its promised upgrades. Still, iOS 26 appears to have improved the performance of many features that use the iPhone\u2019s onboard machine learning models. Since the first developer build, voice memos and voice notes are not only much faster, but also more accurate, especially with accents that the system previously struggled with.\nApple Intelligence\u2019s Writing tools \u2014 which I mainly use for summarizing meetings, conference calls and even lengthy PDFs \u2014 doesn't choke with more substantial reading. On iOS 18, it would struggle with voice notes longer than 10 minutes, trying to detangle or structure the contents of a meeting. I haven\u2019t had that issue with iOS 26 so far.\nGenmoji and Image Playground both offer up different results through the update. Image Playground can now generate pictures using ChatGPT. I\u2019ll be honest, I hadn\u2019t used the app since I tested it on iOS 18, but the upgrades mean it has more utility when I might want to generate AI artwork, which can occasionally reach photorealistic levels.\nOne useful addition is ChatGPT\u2019s \u201cany style\u201d option, meaning you can try to specify the style you have in mind, which can skirt a little closer to contentious mimicry \u2014 especially if you want, say, a frivolous image of you splashing in a puddle, Studio Ghibli style.\nApple also tweaked Genmoji to add deeper customization options, but these AI-generated avatars don\u2019t look like me? I liked the original Genmoji that launched last year, which had the almost-nostalgic style of 2010 emoji, but still somehow channeled the auras of me, my friends and family. This new batch are more detailed and elaborate, sure, but they don\u2019t look right. Also, they make me look bald. And contrary to my detractors, I am not bald. Yet. This feels like a direct attack, Apple.\nYou might feel differently, however. For example, Cherlynn said that the first version of Genmoji did not resemble her, frequently presenting her as someone with much darker skin or of a different ethnicity, regardless of the source picture she submitted.\nStill, the ability to change a Genmoji\u2019s expression, as well as add and remove glasses and facial hair through the new appearance customization options, is an improvement.\nA Camera app redesign for everyone\nApple has revisited the camera app, returning to basics by stripping away most of the previously offered modes and settings \u2014 at least initially \u2014 to display only video and photo modes.\nYou can swipe up from the bottom to see additional options, like flash, the timer, exposure, styles and more. You can also tap on the new six-dot icon in the upper right of the interface for the same options, though that requires a bit more of a reach. These behave in line with the new Liquid Glass design and you\u2019ll see the Photo pill expand into the settings menu when you press either area. Long-pressing on icons lets you go deeper into shooting modes, adjusting frame rates and even recording resolutions.\nWhat I like here is that it benefits casual smartphone photographers while keeping all the settings that more advanced users demand. None of the updates here are earth-shattering, though. I hope Apple takes a good look at what Adobe\u2019s Project Indigo camera app is doing \u2014 there are a lot of good ideas there.\nOne extra improvement if you use AirPods: Pressing and holding the stem of your AirPod (if it has an H2 chip) can now start video recording.\nApple Music tries to DJ\nAlongside the Liquid Glass design touches, the big addition to Apple Music this year is AutoMix. Like a (much) more advanced version of the crossfade feature found on most music streaming apps, in iOS 26, Music tries to mix between tracks, slowing or speeding up tempos, gently fading in drums or bass loops before the next song kicks in. Twenty percent of the time, it doesn\u2019t work well \u2014 or Apple Music doesn\u2019t even try. But the new ability to pin playlists and albums is useful, especially for recommendations from other folks that you never got around to listening to.\nMessages get a little more fun\nApple is making Messages more fun. One of the ways it\u2019s doing so is by enabling custom backgrounds in chats, much like in WhatsApp. I immediately set out to find the most embarrassing photo of my colleague (and frenemy) Cherlynn Low and make it our chat background. I know she\u2019s also running iOS 26 in beta, so she will see it. [Ed. note: Way to give me a reason to ignore your messages, Mat!]\nApple\u2019s Live translation now works across Messages, voice calls and FaceTime. Setting things up can be a little complicated \u2014 you\u2019ll first need to download various language files to use the feature. There\u2019s also some inconsistency in the languages supported across the board. For instance, Mandarin and Japanese are supported in Messages, but not on FaceTime yet. In chats, if your system language is set to English or Spanish, then you\u2019ll only be able to translate into English or Spanish. For those polyglots out there, if you want to translate incoming Japanese texts into German, you\u2019ll need to set your device's language to German.\nWhile I didn\u2019t get to flex my Japanese abilities on voice calls and FaceTime, iOS 26 was more than capable of keeping up with some rudimentary German and Spanish. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d rely on it for serious business translation or holiday bookings, but I think it could be a very useful tool for basics.\nThere\u2019s also the ability to filter spam messages to their own little folder (purgatory). Spam texts remain a nightmare, so I appreciate any potential weapons in the fight. Sadly, it hasn\u2019t quite manage to deal with the TikTok marketing agencies and phone network customer services that continue to barrage my Messages. Still, hopefully Apple will continue to improve its detection algorithms.\nOne more tool in the battle against spam: You can mute notifications for Messages from unknown numbers, although time-sensitive alerts from delivery services and rideshare apps will still reach you.\nNew apps are hit-or-miss\nNot everything in the beta lands, however. I\u2019ve already touched on how Liquid Glass was initially a semi-transparent mess. The Games App, too, seems like an unnecessary addition. Because it\u2019s a blend of the Games tab of the App Store and a silo of your preinstalled games, I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s adding. It\u2019s not any easier to navigate, nor does it introduce me to games I want to buy.\nCherlynn did want to highlight that for a casual gamer like herself, it\u2019s intriguing to see if the Games app might start to recommend more mind-numbing puzzles or farming simulations. She was also intrigued by the idea of a more social gaming experience on iOS, issuing challenges to her friends. Still, because the phone she has been testing the beta on doesn\u2019t have access to all her contacts or her gaming history, the recommendations and features are fairly limited at the moment.\nGames is one of two new apps that will automatically join your home screen. (Fortunately, they can be uninstalled). The other is Preview, which should be a familiar addition to any Mac user. It offers an easy way to view sent or downloaded files, like menus, ticket QR codes and more. During the developer beta, the app pulled in a handful of my documents that previously lived in the Files app. Navigation across both those apps is identical, although Preview is limited to files you can actually open, of course.\nAirPods, upgraded\nThis is more iPhone-adjacent, but iOS 26 includes several quality-of-life improvements for some of Apple\u2019s headphones. First up: notifications when your AirPods are fully charged, finally! The Apple Watch got this kind of notification back in iOS 14, so it\u2019s great to see Apple\u2019s headphones catch up.\nApple is also promising \u201cstudio-quality sound recording\u201d from the AirPods, augmenting recordings with computational audio improvements. There\u2019s a noticable bump in audio quality. It appears that AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 will record files at a sample rate of 48 kHz, which is double the rate used in the past. The sample rate bump happened last year, but it is dependent on what the app you're using. Is it \u201cstudio quality\u201d? I don\u2019t think so, but it\u2019s an improvement. While recordings sound slightly better in quiet locations, the bigger change is in loud environments. The algorithm doesn't appear to be degrading audio quality as much while trying to reduce background noise.\niOS 26 also adds sleep detection to the buds. If the AirPods detect minimal movement, they\u2019ll switch off automatically, which could be helpful for the next time I\u2019m flying long-haul.\nWrap-up\nIn iOS 26, Apple has prioritized design changes and systemwide consistency over AI-centric software and features. While Liquid Glass is a big change to how your iPhone looks, Apple has drawn from user feedback to finesse the design into feeling less jarring and gelling better when the home screen, Control Center and Notification drop-downs overlap with each other.\nThere are numerous quality of life improvements, including Messages and Visual Intelligence, in particular. If anything, the AI elephant in the room is the lack of any substantial updates on Siri. After the company talked up advanced Siri interactions over a year ago, I\u2019m still waiting for its assistant to catch up with the likes of Google."

      "text": "The iPhone 17 Pro could start with 256GB of storage as part of a $50 price increase across the lineup this year, a Weibo leaker has suggested.\nIn a new post, the leaker known as \"Instant Digital\" reiterated rumors that the iPhone 17 lineup will be announced on Tuesday, September 9 with a $50 price hike across the board, and pondered whether the increase could come hand-in-hand with a storage bump.\nToday, the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, and 16 Pro start with 128GB of storage, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max starts with 256GB of storage. The four models are priced starting at $799, $899, $999, and $1,199, respectively.\nIn July, Jefferies said that Apple will implement a $50 price increase across the iPhone 17 lineup to offset rising component costs and China tariffs. This means the iPhone 17, 17 Air, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max will likely be priced at $849, $949, $1,049, and $1,249, if the company's positioning and pricing trends continue.\nIt's possible that Apple could increase the iPhone 17 Pro's base storage to 256GB, bringing it in line with the Pro Max, to help justify its $50 price increase. That would represent an effective price cut of $50 over today's iPhone 16 Pro with 256GB of storage and help to simplify the lineup.\nLikewise, The Wall Street Journal reported in May that Apple was considering raising prices for its upcoming iPhone 17 models. The company reportedly aims to pair the potential price hikes with new features and design changes to justify the increased cost to consumers, rather than attributing them to tariffs."

      "text": "Nikon joins other camera manufacturers in raising prices due to tariffs\nThe increase may only affect lenses and accessories and not cameras, for now.\nNikon has announced that it will increase prices on its photography products in the US due to tariffs, joining other camera manufacturers including Canon, Blackmagic Design and Leica in doing so. It hasn't yet shared which products will be affected, but several outlets have received word from dealers that the changes will mostly affect lenses and accessories manufactured in China.\n\"Due to the recent tariffs, a necessary price adjustment for products will take effect on June 23, 2025,\" the company wrote last week. \"We will be carefully monitoring any tariff developments and may adjust pricing as necessary to reflect the evolving market conditions. We wish to thank our customers for their understanding and know that we are taking every possible step to minimize the impact on our community.\"\nThe development comes from Trump's recent tariffs affecting electronic goods, with Nikon noting that the increase could cut its operating profit by around $68 million. Canon, the worldwide leader in camera sales, said in its earnings report last month that it would raise prices soon. Fujifilm recently paused US preorders for several models including the X-M5 and X100 VI.\nOther electronics companies, including Acer and DJI, also recently announced US-only price hikes. In its latest earnings report, Sony said it expects to seller fewer PS5s and expects a $700 million tariff-related revenue hit.\nThese increases could just be the beginning. Nikon builds its products in multiple countries affected by US tariffs, including China, Thailand and its home country, Japan. Unless those nations can negotiate new tariff terms before the end of Trump's 90-day pause, they could be subject to drastically higher rates by July \u2014 which would in turn prices for Nikon and many other camera manufacturers."

It hasn't listed the products and their new prices yet, but it said that it's evaluating any changes it might need to its promotional strategies and that it has flexibility to move production between Vietnam and Malaysia as needed. To note, the Trump administration had imposed a 20 percent tariff on imports from Vietnam and a 19 percent tariff on imports from Malaysia. Sonos also said that it will invest on diversifying its geographic footprint and expanding its presence in markets that represent only a small share of its revenue today to drive growth.\nThe company took steps to diversify its supply chain last year, which led to its manufacturing facilities in the two aforementioned countries. It now only relies on Chinese plans for products bound to the US for a limited number of accessories, such as speaker stands. Still, for the third quarter of 2025, tariffs reduced Sonos' gross margin for the third quarter by $2.1 million and its cash flow by $3.5 million. In the fourth quarter of the year, which covers the holiday shopping season, Sonos expects tariffs to reduce its gross margin by $5 million and to remove between $8 to $10 billion from its cash flow.\nOverall, Sonos posted a revenue of $344.8 million in the third quarter, which is almost $100 million larger than its revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. It's not a secret that 2024 was a tough year for the company. It rolled out a major update that broke its app, which led to the delay of product releases as it worked to fix the issue. Former Sonos CEO Patrick Spence even stepped down in the beginning of 2025 and was replaced by ex-Snap executive Tom Conrad."

Here\u2019s everything you need to know about setting up the iOS 18 (along with iPadOS 18 and watchOS 11) beta.\nFirst, remember that, as its \u201cbeta\u201d name implies, this is pre-release software that will likely reveal itself as such in ways that frustrate and annoy you. Some third-party apps may be broken (banking apps especially), and plenty of Apple\u2019s features may be inconsistent or buggy until the company irons out the kinks in future updates.\nWe don\u2019t recommend installing it on any device you use as your main one\u2014or at least not if you aren\u2019t willing to accept some risks and compromises.\niOS 18 supported devices\nYou\u2019ll need a recent iPhone to try the public beta.

But considering this year\u2019s software covers models stretching as far back as 2018, you\u2019d need a pretty dated phone not to have the option.\nHow to install the iOS 18 public beta\nInstalling the beta is much easier than it used to be. First, if you\u2019ve never installed an iOS public beta before, you\u2019ll need to visit the Apple Beta Software Program website and enroll your Apple account.\nAfter that, navigate to Settings > General > Software Update on your iPhone. Choose the option for \u201ciOS 18 public beta.\u201d Then, return to the Software Update screen, and you should see the option to install the beta software.\niPadOS 18 supported devices\nHere are the supported models for the iPadOS 18 beta:\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (M2)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later)\niPad (7th generation and later)\niPad mini (5th generation and later)\nHow to install the iPadOS 18 public beta\nIf you haven\u2019t already signed up for it above, you\u2019ll need to visit the Apple Beta Software Program website and enroll your Apple account.

And if you downgrade its paired iPhone to iOS 17, your Apple Watch won\u2019t work correctly with your phone until it\u2019s back on iOS 18. (However, you can leave your Apple Watch on watchOS 10 when your phone is on iOS 18. That route is much less risky.)\nIn other words, don\u2019t update to watchOS 11 unless you\u2019re sure you\u2019re comfortable with the risk of being out of a working Apple Watch for months. Even then, think twice.\nwatchOS 11 supported devices\nYou\u2019ll need one of the following models to run the watchOS 11 beta:\nApple Watch SE (2nd generation)\nApple Watch Series 6\nApple Watch Series 7\nApple Watch Series 8\nApple Watch Series 9\nApple Watch Ultra\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nHow to install the watchOS 11 public beta\nIf you\u2019re comfortable with the risks for your Apple Watch and want to install the watchOS 11 beta, you\u2019ll first need to have already updated your paired iPhone to the iOS 18 beta (see above).\nAfter that, make sure your Apple Watch is paired to your iOS 18-running phone and open the Watch app on your iPhone.

      "text": "iPhone 17 Air Said to Feature Titanium Frame \u2014 Unlike iPhone 17 Pro\nThe rumored iPhone 17 Air will have a titanium frame, according to Apple analyst Jeff Pu.\nIn an investor note with equity research firm GF Securities this week, Pu also said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will have aluminum frames, so the iPhone 17 Air will apparently be the only new model to use titanium.\nIt is unclear why the iPhone 17 Air would have a titanium frame, as aluminum is lighter than titanium, which would be fitting for the device's rumored ultra-thin and lightweight design. Titanium is generally stronger than aluminum, however, so perhaps the material is necessary to ensure that the iPhone 17 Air's thin chassis is durable.\nLast year, another Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air's frame would use both titanium and aluminum, so there could be a mix of both materials. Apple surely has its reasons, and it may discuss them during its iPhone 17 event in September.\nSince the iPhone X in 2017, all of Apple's highest-end iPhone models have featured either stainless steel or titanium frames, so the return to an aluminum frame for the iPhone 17 Pro models this year would be a notable change.\nHere is what Pu expects:\n- iPhone 17: Aluminum frame\n- iPhone 17 Air: Titanium frame\n- iPhone 17 Pro: Aluminum frame\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: Aluminum frame\nHere are the materials used for the iPhone 16 series:\n- iPhone 16: Aluminum frame\n- iPhone 16 Plus: Aluminum frame\n- iPhone 16 Pro: Titanium frame\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max: Titanium frame\nPopular Stories\nThe calendar has turned to August, and that means the iPhone 17 series is just one month away.

      "text": "Apple reportedly wants to split up the iPhone\u2019s release schedule\nGet ready for new iPhone reveals twice a year.\nInstead of deciding between four new models of iPhones every fall, you may have to choose among three in both the spring and the fall. A new report from The Information claims that Apple will change the release cycle for its smartphones, starting with the iPhone 18 in 2026. According to The Information, three unnamed supply chain sources detailed that the more expensive models will launch first, meaning the Pro models will keep the fall release window and the standard model iPhones will get pushed to the following spring.\nIt\u2019s a notable departure from the typical all-at-once release schedule, but it could indicate that Apple wants to make room for other models, like the long-rumored foldable iPhone. If the report is accurate, Apple would release the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max and potentially the foldable iPhone in fall 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 base model, the iPhone 18 Slim and the iPhone 18e in spring 2027.\nIf you\u2019ve been paying close attention to Apple\u2019s releases, this change may not be much of a surprise. While the company has been releasing its annual batch of new iPhones in September or October since the iPhone 5, Apple started breaking from the schedule with the introduction of the iPhone SE models, which were usually released in March or April. More recently, Apple introduced the iPhone 16e in February to replace the SE range. As for the iPhone 17, we\u2019re still expecting Apple\u2019s regularly programmed schedule with four new devices to be revealed this September."

      "text": "iPhone 17 Models May See $50 Price Hike, Says Jefferies\nApple is expected to implement a $50 price increase across its iPhone 17 lineup when the new models launch in September as a way to offset rising component costs and China tariffs, according to a new investor note by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee.\nThe price hike is expected across all iPhone 17 models, including the regular iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air (replacing the Plus model), iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. Current iPhone models range from the base iPhone 16 starting at $799 to the iPhone 16 Pro Max at $1,199.\nThe analyst's prediction came as it gave AAPL stock a Hold rating, citing strong iPhone sales in the second quarter of 2025. U.S. telecommunications companies reported a 22% year-on-year equipment growth, their highest in six quarters, according to the analyst's note.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in May that Apple was considering raising prices for its upcoming iPhone 17 models. The company reportedly aims to pair the potential price hikes with new features and design changes to justify the increased cost to consumers, rather than attributing them to U.S. tariffs on goods from China.\nNote: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Political News forum.

      "text": "The iPhone 17 Air internal battery pack is just 2.49mm thick and appears to be about half as thin as the iPhone 17 Pro battery, based on new information and images coming out of Korea.\nPosted by the account name \"yeux1122\" on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, an image allegedly shows the iPhone 17 Air battery next to the iPhone 17 Pro battery for comparison. The same account was first to claim that the Air's battery capacity is 2,800 mAh. A Chinese leaker has since said it will be below the 3,000 mAh mark.\nWe do not yet have any rumors indicating the battery capacity of the iPhone 17 Pro, only for the iPhone 17 Pro Max \u2013 which is said to be at or above 5,000 mAh.\nSome of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models were the last with battery capacities at or below the 3,000 mAh mark. However, mAh values can only be directly compared when the batteries have the same voltage, with Wh a preferred unit of measurement. iPhone batteries typically do have the same voltage, allowing for mAh comparisons.\nIn May, the same Naver blog account claimed that the 6.6-inch iPhone 17 Air has a weight of approximately 145 grams \u2013 similar to an iPhone SE 2 or iPhone 13 mini, which are 148 grams and 141 grams, respectively. The all-new ultra-thin device itself is believed to be around 5.5mm thick, making it the thinnest ever iPhone.\nApple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in March that device will have a \"high-density\" battery. More recently, a report out of Asia has suggested that the iPhone 17 Air could become the first Apple smartphone to adopt advanced battery technology, with Apple supplier TDK preparing to ship its new generation of silicon-anode batteries by the end of June.\nHaving said that, reports have been mixed regarding the iPhone 17 Air's potential battery performance. The Information's Wayne Ma claimed the device will have \"worse\" battery life compared to previous iPhone models.\nIn internal testing, Apple apparently determined that the percentage of users who will be able to use the iPhone 17 Air for a full day without needing to recharge the device throughout the day will be between 60% and 70%, according to the report. For other iPhone models, the report said that metric is apparently between 80% and 90%.\nTo mitigate this problem, the report said that Apple is planning to release a battery case as an optional accessory for the iPhone 17 Air.\nOn the other hand, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has offered a more optimistic outlook, stating that battery life would be \"on par with current iPhones\" thanks to hardware and software optimizations.\nThe 5.5mm-thin device is also rumored to incorporate Apple's power-efficient C1 modem and lack an Ultra Wide camera, which could potentially provide more internal space for a larger battery. We'll know for sure when the device replaces the \"Plus\" model in Apple's iPhone 17 lineup, which is expected to launch around mid-September, per Apple's typical fall release schedule."

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nHere's a list of all compatible iPhones that can download the Apple iOS 26 beta update today\nVerify that your iPhone can run the latest and greatest operating system.\nApple's iOS 26 is coming this fall, giving your iPhone's operating system a big upgrade. My favorite is the visual update, called Liquid Glass \u2014 it's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista. We spent two weeks test-driving it \u2014 you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 5 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 \u2014 a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones will support iOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OS and more, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall \u2014 though there are iPhone 17 rumors \u2014 we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September.\niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.\nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend."

      "text": "iOS 26 public beta is available to download: Everything you need to know about the new iPhone and iPad update\nExciting changes are coming to your iPhone this fall, including a new aesthetic called Liquid Glass.\nGaining access to iOS 26 on your iPhone is getting closer, but the release is still over a month away, coming this fall. But you can start testing the new features now by downloading and installing Apple's public beta, which CEO Tim Cook recently said is (along with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we\u2019ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant \u2014 first promised at WWDC 2024 \u2014 is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. Now that iOS 26 developer beta 5 is available, we're seeing more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.\nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it \u2014 version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. (Meanwhile, iOS 18 is still getting new versions this summer, too.)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year \u2014 the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some \u2014 including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar \u2014 like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.\nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheckout our first impressions of iPadOS 26.\nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS \u2014 iPhone XR, XS and XS Max \u2014 won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September.\nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 \u2014 exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.
