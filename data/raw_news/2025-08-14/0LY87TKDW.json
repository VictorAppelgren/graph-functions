  "content": "Another update fail and emergency fix has just been confirmed for Windows 11, as August\u2019s critical security install appears to pack a nasty surprise for some PC users.\n\nMicrosoft has just admitted its latest Windows security update \u201cmight fail to install.\u201d Windows Latest warns this is \u201cturning out to be a headache\u201d for users. A day after the website \u201cflagged critical issues, Microsoft has finally acknowledged our report.\u201d\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s updated doc clearly points out that it messed up again,\u201d Windows Latest says, \u201cbut it also wants us to believe that only enterprises are affected.\u201d That\u2019s because \u201chome users are unlikely to experience this issue, as Windows Server Update Services is designed for use across business and enterprise environments.\u201d\n\nThe error code you need to look for is 0x80240069 which affects the Windows 11 24H2 August 2025 Update. \u201cMicrosoft says it has rolled out an emergency update, and it\u2019ll be pulled automatically via Windows Update, but if you\u2019re an admin, you can download \u2018KB5063878 250814_00551 Known Issue Rollback\u2019 policy and manually patch.\u201d\n\nThere have been a procession of update fails and emergency fixes (1,2) in recent months, coming at an awkward time for Windows 11 given the ESU debacle affecting the hundreds of millions thus far refusing to upgrade. This month we have seen an awkward reversal in the Windows 10 versus Windows 11 stakes, confirming the problem.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has also identified the root cause behind error code 0x80240069,\u201d Windows Latest says, \u201cwhich also affected thousands of customers in April 2025. It\u2019s unclear how the issue slipped into the August 2025 Patch Tuesday update, but Microsoft is testing another patch, and it will be fixed in a future Windows update.\u201d\n\nAs for this latest install fail and emergency fix. Microsoft says \u201cwe are working to include the resolution in a future Windows update,\u201d and \u201cwill provide more information when it becomes available.\u201d",

      "text": "Microsoft has now issued its free update offer to millions more Windows 10 users. After this mandatory update to KB5063709, you should see the option to \u201cEnroll in Extended Support Updates,\u201d which will run until October 2026.\nPer Windows Latest, \u201cthere\u2019s a new Enroll Now link inside the Windows Update page.\u201d You still have several options to extend security support, including paying $30 which could cover as many as 10 PCs on a single account. Most users will opt for the free update offer though, linking the ESU to their Microsoft account and OneDrive.\nMicrosoft confirmed this was coming back in July, blogging that \u201cindividuals will begin to see an enrollment wizard through notifications and in Settings, making it simple to select the best option for you and enroll in ESU directly from your personal Windows 10 PC.\u201d As Windows Latest confirms, \u201cmore users should see the toggle\u201d after this update.\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t seeing the option to extend updates earlier,\u201d the website explains, \u201cyou should try looking again after today\u2019s update.\u201d It hasn\u2019t all been smooth sailing for the well-publicized ESU enrollment wizard. Some users reported \u201cimmediately crashes\u201d when it\u2019s clicked. This was a central Microsoft issue that is now fixed.\nIt\u2019s not all good news \u2014 at least not for Microsoft. Because \u201call activated licenses of Windows 10 are eligible for ESU,\u201d the accelerating progress that was being made pushing Windows 10 holdouts to switch has shifted into a sharp reverse.\nA month ago we heralded Windows 11\u2019s achievement in finally overtaking Windows 10 after years of frustration. It did seem that the flip would continue all the way through to the 250 million or so PCs ineligible for the upgrade. But that\u2019s not to be.\nAs I warned might happen, this free ESU u-turn has triggered a reversal in Windows 11\u2019s recent fortunes, at least according to Statcounter\u2019s indicative data. And while it\u2019s still marginally head of its retiring sibling, Windows 11 is moving in the wrong direction. A free ESU is laudable, but it should have been limited to PCs that cannot upgrade.\nRight now, it seems we may just have delayed a cliff edge, meaning we all get to go again next summer with the upgrade nags and cybersecurity warnings. We will know more over the coming weeks, but Windows 10 could be about to reclaim its crown."

      "text": "It\u2019s an easy lure. Attackers use \u201csocial media and other messaging platforms,\u201d to pose as lawyers, offering to help anyone who has lost crypto to scams recover their funds. These fake lawyers claim to have case files from the FBI and other agencies. Victims are then defrauded again, with more money lost to these malicious recovery schemes.\nThe bureau first warned about this scam in 2023 and then again in 2024. Now there\u2019s a third public advisory, which \u201cprovides additional red flag indicators and due diligence measures to help victims who have been in contact with fictitious law firms.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, these frauds target vulnerable citizens, \u201cparticularly the elderly,\u201d and \u201cexploit victims\u2019 emotional state and financial need to recover funds.\u201d Some of the attacks impersonate legitimate law firms adding to their credibility.\nSpecific red flags to watch for include stating affiliation or official partnership with government or regulatory agencies. \u201cThere are no law firms which are officially authorized partners of U.S. Government agencies,\u201d the FBI confirms.\nThese frauds may also list \u201cfictitious government or regulatory entities,\u201d albeit much of the documentation and references they use are real.\nMore pointedly, scammers need to be paid and will \u201crequest payment in cryptocurrency or prepaid gift cards\u201d or ask victims to open new overseas bank accounts for the recovered funds. They will \u201csay that payment of bank fees is required to verify identity and ownership to withdraw funds\u201d or \u201csend payment to a third-party entity (i.e., xyz trading company) for the supposed purposes of maintaining secrecy and safety.\u201d\nSet out here in black and white, it\u2019s easy to see these scams for what they are. But for more vulnerable investors or for those emotionally affected by the original thefts, it\u2019s all too easy to jump at the chance of any form of recovery.\nThe FBI suggests a \"Zero Trust\" model, which means trust no one and assume everything is a scam until proven otherwise. \u201cEvery request should be verified.\u201d There is other advice to confirm law licenses and to keep records of contacts. But you should never respond to unsolicited posts such as this, which means never getting that far.\n\u201cBe wary of advertisements for cryptocurrency recovery services,\u201d the FBI says. And \u201cif an unknown individual contacts you and claims to be able to recover stolen crypto, do not release any financial or personal identifying information and do not send money.\u201d\nWith billions of dollars lost to online crypto hacks and scams, there are plenty of victims to target. The fact there have now been three FBI warnings on this highlights the risks."

We recommend you install the latest update for your device as it contains important improvements and issue resolutions, including this one.\nNote: This disclosure was mistakenly updated to Resolved status on July 8. The issue was resolved on July 22. We apologize for any inconvenience or confusion.\nAffected platforms:\n- Client: Windows 11, version 24H2\n- Server: None\nIssues occur when using Microsoft Changjie Input Method\n| Status | Originating update | History |\n|---|---|---|\n| Resolved KB5062660 | OS Build 26100.4652 KB5062553 2025-07-08 | Resolved: 2025-07-22, 10:00 PT Opened: 2025-07-11, 08:52 PT |\nFollowing installation of the July 2025 Windows security updates (KB5062553), there might be issues when using the Microsoft Changjie IME (input method editor) for Traditional Chinese.\nThis issue only affects devices where Traditional Chinese is a preferred or common language or input method, and specifically where Changjie IME is used. Reported symptoms include:\n- inability to form or select words after typing the full composition (associate phrase window)\n- spacebar or blank key not responding\n- incorrect or distorted word outputs\n- the conversion candidate window fails to display properly\nMicrosoft Changjie is an IME that is included in Windows and available in currently supported versions.\nResolution: This issue is resolved in the July 2025 Windows non-security update (KB5062660) and later updates. We recommend you install the latest update for your device as it contains important improvements and issue resolutions, including this one.\nIf you have installed Windows updates released before before July 2025, you can use the following workaround. Windows IME supports a compatibility setting that allows using the previous version of an IME instead. Employing this option should help resolve this issue.\nTo revert to old version of the Microsoft Changjie IME, follow these steps:\n- Open the Language & region setting. This can be accomplished by opening the Settings app, selecting Time & Language, then Language & Regions. You can also open the start menu and type \"language\" and select the top result.\n- If Traditional Chinese is used on this device, the Chinese (Traditional) option will appear near the top. Select the three dots next to Chinese (Traditional) to open a menu and select Language Options.\n- Under Keyboards, select the three dots next to Microsoft Changjie and select Keyboard Options from the menu.\n- Under Compatibility, set the \"Use previous version of Microsoft Changjie\" option to On. Then select OK.\nAffected platforms:\n- Client: Windows 11, version 24H2; Windows 11, version 23H2; Windows 11, version 22H2; Windows 10, version 22H2; Windows 10, version 1809; Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2016; Windows 10, version 1607\n- Server: Windows Server 2025; Windows Server 2022; Windows Server, version 1809; Windows Server 2016\nJune 2025\nParental consent may not show for some browser versions with web filtering on\n| Status | Originating update | History |\n|---|---|---|\n| Mitigated | N/A | Last updated: 2025-07-24, 16:24 PT Opened: 2025-06-24, 16:25 PT |\nCertain laws require Microsoft to protect children from harmful and illegal content on the internet. Microsoft is committed to creating tools for parents and guardians to help them in guiding their children\u2019s digital experiences and protect them from harmful and illegal online content.\nOne of the available tools is web filtering, which lets a parent or guardian filter websites. Currently, Microsoft Edge is the only supported browser that provides this functionality within Microsoft Family Safety, allowing Edge to be used by default on the child\u2019s device after web filtering is enabled. Once web filtering is enabled, a parent or guardian needs to approve other unsupported browsers (any browser other than Edge) before they can be used. This helps parents understand that different settings apply to other browsers when it comes to blocking inappropriate websites and filtering search results for their children.\nThe blocking behavior continues to work for unsupported browsers, however, when unsupported browsers update to a new version, the latest version of the browser cannot be blocked until we add it to the block list. Microsoft is currently adding the latest versions of unsupported browsers, to the block list. As a result, some browsers may temporarily appear unblocked during this update process. We're actively working to ensure all latest versions of browsers are blocked, reinforcing our commitment to parents and guardians.\nAs Microsoft continues to update the block list, we\u2019ve received reports of a new issue affecting Google Chrome and some browsers. When children try to open these browsers, they shut down unexpectedly. However, the standard workflow is to prompt a parental approval message stating, \u201cYou\u2019ll need to ask to use this app\u201d. Once the approval is consented, the browser operates as intended. This issue is only observed when the Activity reporting feature is turned off.\nWorkaround: The browser shutdown issue can be temporarily mitigated by turning on Activity reporting under Windows settings in Family Safety. Parents will then be able to receive approval requests as expected.\nResolution:\n- Temporary access to unsupported browsers: As of June 25, 2025, Microsoft included the latest versions of unsupported browsers into the Family Safety\u2019s feature, and they are now blocked as intended. However, new versions of unsupported browsers released after this date might temporarily appear unblocked. This temporary gap will be resolved in the future, and this documentation will be updated to inform you when the full resolution is available.\n- Missing parental consent prompt: Fixed in the July non-security preview update (KB5062660), released July 22, 2025. The fix is gradually rolling out and will be automatically enabled on devices with KB5062660 installed or later updates.\nAffected platforms:\n- Client: Windows 11, version 24H2; Windows 11, version 23H2; Windows 11, version 22H2; Windows 10, version 22H2\n- Server: None\nMay 2025\nAVD applications using App attach feature might fail to start\n| Status | Originating update | History |\n|---|---|---|\n| Resolved KB5060829 | N/A | Resolved: 2025-06-26, 14:00 PT Opened: 2025-05-02, 13:28 PT |\nAfter upgrading to Windows 11, version 24H2, Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) users might face issues with applications using the App attach feature. While attempting to start App attach applications, users might encounter an error message that displays the error message \u2018Element not found\u2019. App attach is a feature that allows users to add applications to user sessions without installing them directly on the virtual machine.\nThis issue is expected to occur when App attach applications are packaged in CIMFS (Composite Image File System) format.

Devices running version 24H2 with the affected Intel SST driver might receive an error with a blue screen. The affected driver is named Intel\u00ae Smart Sound Technology (Intel\u00ae SST) Audio Controller. It is listed under System Devices in Device Manager and is found with the file name 'IntcAudioBus.sys'. If this file is version 10.29.0.5152 or 10.30.0.5152, this issue can occur.\nOnly devices with both an Intel 11th Gen Core processors and an Intel SST driver version of 10.29.0.5152 or 10.30.0.5152 are affected by this issue.\nTo safeguard your update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on Windows devices which have Intel SST driver versions 10.29.0.5152 or 10.30.0.5152.

      "text": "Windows 11 August 2025 Update (KB5063878) started rolling out on August 12, and I headlined it as one of the rare updates that promise a performance boost, but it\u2019s turning out to be a headache for some users. Nearly a day after Windows Latest flagged critical issues (0x80240069) with Windows 11 KB5063878, Microsoft has finally acknowledged our report.\nWhenever a new cumulative update is released, we deploy it across all our PCs and reach out to system administrators to understand how a patch is doing across their organisations, and we also applied this methodology to Windows 11 KB5063878.\nIn our tests, Windows Latest found that KB5063878 fails to install due to 0x80240069 when you use WSUS/SCCM (Enterprise deployment tools).\nTurns out we were right again with our reporting. Today, Microsoft updated its support document to admit installation errors hitting Windows 11 August 2025 Update. As first spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft\u2019s updated doc clearly points out that it messed up again, but it also wants us to believe that only enterprises are affected.\n\u201cHome users are unlikely to experience this issue, as WSUS is designed for use across business and enterprise environments,\u201d Microsoft noted.\nIf you\u2019re affected, you\u2019ll see an error code 0x80240069 when trying to download and install Windows 11 24H2 August 2025 Update.\nMicrosoft says it has rolled out an emergency update, and it\u2019ll be pulled automatically via Windows Update, but if you\u2019re an admin, you can download \u201cKB5063878 250814_00551 Known Issue Rollback\u201d policy and manually patch the issue.\nMicrosoft suggests using Update Catalog if the update is failing through Windows Update or WSUS/SCCM and other places. Update Catalogue works most of the time, but if you also run into issues when using the .msu files, I personally recommend downloading the Media Creation Tool from the Microsoft website.\nRun the tool, select Upgrade this PC now, and keep personal files/apps option checked. Once done, the Windows install will be refreshed, and Windows Update will work correctly again.\nMicrosoft has also identified the root cause behind error code 0x80240069, which also affected thousands of customers in April 2025. It\u2019s unclear how the issue slipped into the August 2025 Patch Tuesday update, but Microsoft is testing another patch, and it will be fixed in a future Windows update.\nMicrosoft will share more details soon, but install errors are not the only issue we\u2019ve with the August patch.\nFor example, Windows Latest previously spotted that Event Viewer flags multiple errors related to CertificateServicesClient-CertEnrol. As you can see in the above screenshot, I\u2019ve two errors with the same title:\n- Error 8/14/2025 1:25:39 PM CertificateServicesClient-CertEnroll 57 None\n- Error 8/14/2025 1:25:39 PM CertificateServicesClient-CertEnroll 57 None\nWhen I double-tap the error message, it says \u201cMicrosoft Pluton Cryptographic Provider\u201d provider was not loaded because initialisation failed.\u201d It also adds that a feature was \u201cNot implemented 0x8000400,\u201d and it makes sense.\nMicrosoft is apparently testing a new security feature, but it\u2019s not turned on, and when it\u2019s not active, we run into these Event Viewer errors.\nMicrosoft told us that we can safely ignore these Event Viewer errors after installing the Windows 11 August 2025 Update."

      "text": "The world is no less confusing for Microsoft\u2019s 700 million Windows 10 users than it was before its emergency u-turn. Yes, support has been extended for a year, pushing the cliff edge from October 2025 to October 2026, but there are plenty of catches.\nSome of these relate to updates for software running on Windows 10 after this year\u2019s October 14 deadline. And some relate to the costs in snagging the \u201cfree\u201d 12-month security update extension. But the main catch is the heightened security risks.\nMicrosoft has emphasized the risks in remaining on Windows 10 with the same vigor as the benefits in moving to Windows 11. As all users must know by now, the reason there\u2019s such a furor about this upgrade is the TPM security hurdle PCs must meet to be eligible.\nThis rules out hundreds of millions of PCs, despite occasional suggestions that some of those machines may be upgraded anyway. For most users the upgrade still means buying a new PC, ideally \u2014 Microsoft says \u2014 a new Copilot+ PC steeped in AI.\nAs I have pointed out, Microsoft u-turned on Windows 10\u2019s hard red line at just the wrong time, just as Windows 11 caught and has since overtaken Windows 10 for the first time. It would \u2014 in my view \u2014 have been better to limit its free extension to just the users that can\u2019t update current PCs and need more time to buy something new.\nThe risk is that the accelerating progress slows or reverses, simply delaying rather than resolving the problem. And the early signs suggest this may indeed be the case.\nThe early data from Statcounter this month suggests Windows 11 is already seeing some of its gains against Windows 10 start to reverse. While this data is just illustrative, it makes sense given the removal of October\u2019s red line.\nThis means 45% of all Windows users are now on the soon-to-be-retired version of the OS and at risk. Had the accelerating upgrades to Windows 11 for eligible PCs continued unabated, that 45% at risk number may have been halved. That\u2019s hundreds of millions of users that would have been more secure, as Microsoft makes very clear.\nWhichever of Microsoft\u2019s options you pick \u2014 including the free Windows 11 upgrade if available, don\u2019t run out of time. At a minimum take the 12-month security extension. Make sure that come October 14 you\u2019re not off support."

Affected users have been hit with BitLocker Recovery screens and even dreaded Blue Screens of Death after downloading and trying to install the latest critical update.\n\u201cWindows 10 might repeatedly display the BitLocker recovery screen at startup,\u201d the company warned, confirming an out of bounds update via Microsoft\u2019s Update Catalog.\nThe issue affects users \u201con devices with Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) enabled on 10th generation or later Intel vPro processors.\u201d Those who have not yet deployed May\u2019s update should install the out of bounds update instead.\nFor those who have tried to install the update and are now stuck, Microsoft says:\n- \u201cTo start Windows, temporarily disable Intel VT for Direct I/O (also known as VTD or VTX) and Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) in your BIOS / UEFI settings. This step will require entering your BitLocker recovery key.\n- Install update KB5061768 via the Microsoft Update Catalog.\n- After restarting Windows, return to your BIOS / UEFI settings and re-enable Intel VT for Direct I/O (also known as VTD or VTX) and TXT. (This step will require entering your BitLocker recovery key.)\u201d\nWindows Latest was first to flag the issue, reporting that \u201cthe KB5058379 install starts, but ends up at \u2018Enter the recovery key to get going again (Keyboard layout: US)\u2019 screen, and there\u2019s a text field to add the recovery key. In some cases, there\u2019s a BSOD as well.\u201d\nMicrosoft has again warned Windows users that its support team \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the ability to retrieve, provide, or recreate a lost BitLocker recovery key,\u201d but can use this link to find your BitLocker recovery key.\u201d This issue and fix primarily applies to enterprise users, as \u201cconsumer devices typically do not use Intel vPro processors and are less likely to be impacted by this issue.\u201d\nWindows Latest has now issued some helpful guidance for users \u201cstuck on the blue screen with automatic recovery failing.\u201d Once the emergency update is installed, they will \u201cno longer run into BitLocker or Blue Screen of Death errors.\u201d But they need to get there first. \u201cWe recommend manually turning off Intel TXT from BIOS, and then installing the out-of-band update.\u201d\nTo do this, the website explains:\n- \u201cBoot into BIOS by pressing ESC or other keys after powering on. Other keys include F2, F10/F12.\n- Once you\u2019re in BIOS, look for the Security tab and head to the Virtualization menu.\n- Then, under Intel TXT, turn off the toggle. It may be called Trusted Execution or OS Kernel DMA Support as well.\n- Exit BIOS after saving changes.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Neowin\u2019s article from last month on \u201chow to pause Patch Tuesday updates in Windows 11 and 10\u201d is now unsurprisingly running hot. \u201cYou can extend the pause period for up to five weeks [and] Windows will not receive any updates. That includes monthly quality updates, feature updates, driver updates, firmware updates, and more.\u201d\nMay is proving an interesting month for the Windows-maker, with the wider release of its controversial Recall photographic memory for Copilot+ owners and the continuing drive to push 700 million Windows 10 users to upgrade ahead of October\u2019s deadline."
