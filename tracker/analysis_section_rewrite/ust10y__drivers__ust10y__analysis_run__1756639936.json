      "feedback": "Add the missing citations for the Fed‑rate‑hike reversal, risk‑of‑flattening spread, watch‑signals, and confidence statements (e.g., use (LF0UUL917) for fed_policy, (7XH2DKEKV) for risk‑off, (Z7O1DCHS7) for curve steepening, (B1KYJ1GPU) for the DXY forecast). Condense the two sentences on the 200‑bp dip and the base‑case into one to avoid redundancy. Explicitly link the Fed cut to the term premium via the fed_policy driver and make the causal chain (Fed cut → lower term premium → higher DXY) crystal‑clear. Keep all magnitude ranges in bp or % and confirm the 3‑6‑month horizon. Remove any mention of other assets (none present). Ensure the watch‑list lists exact dates (Sept 25 Fed meeting, early‑Aug CPI, Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP, 2‑yr/10‑yr curve movement) with citations. Tighten the prose to a single concise paragraph, preserving the causal logic and catalyst window.",
