      "feedback": "Strong scaffolding and credible cross‑topic links are evident, but to reach world‑class quality you should tighten causality, align with SECTION FOCUS, add explicit scenarios, quantify anchors, and fix sourcing/coherence gaps; concrete actions follow. First, sharpen the causal chain: lay out a formal flow from Tariffs → input costs → inflation/real‑rates → equity multiples → capex reallocation to U.S. fabs/AI infra, then include a secondary feedback loop via oil risk premia and FX that can amplify or dampen discount rates. Second, tighten SECTION FOCUS: deliver one integrated macro/policy/flows/valuation synthesis and accompany it with a concise watch-list of 5 decisive signals (semiconductor capex cadence prints; inflation prints; tariff posture shifts; Jackson Hole/central‑bank guidance; oil‑price surprises) with explicit how each would reweight regime probabilities. Third, specify a rigorous scenario structure: for Regimes A/B/C provide numeric thresholds for inflation (e.g., YoY CPI/core CPI), wage growth, and growth prints; spell out base, upside, and downside variants plus unambiguous invalidation triggers. Fourth, ground in first principles: connect long‑run behavior to inflation persistence, wage dynamics, and capex normalization using a simple PV‑of‑cash‑flows framework with sensitivity to discount rates and to semiconductor/data‑center capex trajectories. Fifth, quantify anchors and ensure numeric consistency: pull exact values from NL5YYTLF2, T1QE6JPIX, J99EM2TPZ, SGB2PAZGK, and 22PL3Q360, replacing qualitative statements with ranges (e.g., Brent mid‑60s, WTI low‑60s; 2025 supply +2.5 mbpd; 2026 +1.9), and ensure Ford metrics (EV losses ~$1.3B; adj. EBIT ~4.3%; ROIC ~10.1%; revenue CAGR ~2.5% 2014–2024) are aligned; attach each figure to the correct ID. Sixth, enforce citation discipline and reconcile conflicts: cite claims next to them, flag any divergent source views, and include a brief resolution note. Seventh, fix drafting gaps and nomenclature (complete truncated lines like ACMR/22PL3Q360 references; harmonize names such as IntelOrbis Graph); condense prose to fit length constraints without losing the causal map. Together these edits will yield a coherent, testable cross‑topic map with a clear watch‑list of decisive signals and a defensible, source‑driven numeric backbone.",
