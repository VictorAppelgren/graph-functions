Now it will premiere on Disney Plus on September 27, with the rest of the show's three episodes premiering weekly after that. That means the show will wrap up a week before Halloween, giving you an opportunity to binge all four spooky episodes on the big night.\n\nMarvel Zombies originated in comics 20 years ago in 2005, spawning a whole series of sequels and spin-offs, including an .\n\nThe streaming series was first announced back in 2021 as a spin-off itself, rising out of the events of one of the most popular and impactful episodes of the alt-reality animated series which depicted a universe overrun by bloodthirsty undead versions of popular Marvel characters.\n\nThe Marvel Zombies streaming series was written by Zeb Wells of Robot Chicken and the Amazing Spider-Man comic fame, along with What If\u2026? executive producer Byran Andrews, and features the voices of MCU actors including Awkwafina, David Harbour, Simu Liu, Elizabeth Olsen, Randall Park, Florence Pugh, Hailee Steinfeld, Dominique Thorne, Iman Vellani, and Todd Williams.\n\nWhile we wait for Marvel Zombies to premiere on September 27, check out our list of all the that are in the works.",

      "text": "Marvel Zombies returns with a new R-rated Red Band comic: \"This is a love letter to the Marvel U while also having the Marvel U eat itself\"\nInterview | Writers Ethan S. Parker and Griffin Sheridan discuss their new Marvel Zombies: Red Band series\nMarvel Zombies is now 20 years old, and to celebrate the milestone, Marvel Comics will publish a new R-rated Marvel Zombies: Red Band comic. Written by Ethan S. Parker and Griffin Sheridan with art by Jan Bazaldua, the new Marvel Zombies comic promises to be a blood-and-guts \"love letter\" to the Marvel Universe.\nNewsarama spoke with Parker and Sheridan ahead of the September release of Marvel Zombies: Red Band #1, digging into the ways that the new comic will continue the classic Marvel Zombies tradition while also breaking new ground thanks to the R-rated nature of the new comic.\nAlong the way, we've also got some pages from Marvel Zombies: Red Band #1, as well as the newly released cover for Marvel Zombies #3, which teases Thanos, the Mad Titan.\n\"The undead history of the Marvel Universe continues on as Thanos takes on the quest for the Infinity Stones!\" reads the official solicitation text for Marvel Zombies #3. \"The Mad Titan of our universe once killed half of all life. What will he do in a universe where the dead don\u2019t die?!\"\nRead on for the pages, and for everything you need to know about the new Marvel Zombies comic.\nNewsarama: Marvel Zombies has been around for 20 years now, with its own comic legacy. How does Marvel Zombies: Red Band lean into the mythos that has been established while also breaking new ground?\nEthan S. Parker: That was part of the pressure of taking this book on, was the incredible lineup of talent that has been involved in the past. To walk anywhere that Robert Kirkman has walked before is terrifying. While still trying to capture the balance of fun and nastiness of those previous takes, it helped differentiate the book that we established that this is a whole alternate Marvel Universe that was knocked off-course just as all the super heroes were still in the middle of their origin stories. That sort of means there are no rules, so we can really forge our own path.\nGriffin Sheridan: Amidst all the expected blood-and-guts, we are also focused on making sure there is a really solid emotional throughline to the struggles of the surviving heroes, which has certainly been an element of past Marvel Zombies stories, but we feel it certainly takes more precedent in this one.\nSpeaking of the Red Band branding, what does that let you do with this story that you otherwise couldn't? How far are you pushing those boundaries?\nParker: We've been truly let off the leash. It's absolutely surreal to write into a script that the Hulk smashes someone into a bloody pulp and eats their eyeballs, and then Marvel actually publishes it! They want us to make this as big and crazy and loud as we possibly can, so we've crammed in every nasty idea we had. Plus, there are curse words! This ain't your daddy's Marvel U.\nSheridan: It's truly wild. Ethan and I hail from the horror space, so we feel right at home on this truly grotesque title, especially with the freedom allotted to us by the Red Band banner. Really, it's a curse that Marvel editorial has placed on us, to have to conjure up all these nightmare scenarios, in which some of our most beloved heroes get ripped apart limb by limb. It's upsetting, but fun, which is also the feeling we want you to have while reading the book, so I guess it's all working out!\nWhat do you think makes the combination of Marvel heroes and zombies work so well?\nParker: For so many of us, these characters are the epitome of comfort food. They're bright and colorful and hopeful, and they represent doing your best to reach a brighter tomorrow. So mashing those characters together with a concept as grim as a zombie apocalypse works like peanut butter and jelly. You get the color, adventure, and fun, but you also get a harrowing survival story. Best of both worlds.\nSheridan: There is something very existential about it. Our morbid fascination with death even has to be pasted onto this (relatively) innocent realm of fantasy. What is it like for a place so magical to become so infested with decay and destruction? There was an inherent curiosity to the scenario in our minds already, then Kirkman, Phillips, and company turned it into this even more twisted and hilariously evil thing that we just can't look away from now.\nYou're working with Jan Bazaldua on Marvel Zombies. What makes her the perfect collaborator for this story?\nParker: What an absolute dream. We have been huge fans of Jan's since her work with Brian Michael Bendis on the Miles Morales: Spider-Man run, where she captured so many thrilling moments alongside so many intensely personal and emotional scenes. She can do it all, and as it turns out, that includes rendering some truly stomach-churning gore sequences. What an honor.\nSheridan: Marvel Zombies is a very singular type of story that requires a very singular type of art to accompany it, to capture the unique blending of adventure and gore. Jan delivers on that stuff in spades, while also totally bringing it on all the character work Ethan and I are sprinkling throughout.\nWhat can readers expect from Marvel Zombies?\nParker: You can expect a violent, crazy zombie romp, obviously, but you can also expect a Marvel Universe story written by two guys who have such a deep love in our hearts for every character we feature in those pages. This is our first chance to write Spider-Man, our first chance to write so many of these characters, so while yes, we are blowing everything up, we're also trying to honor this world that we love more than anything. We hope you'll join us.\nSheridan: It's funny to say this is a love letter to the Marvel U while also having the Marvel U eat itself, but that is the case! We want to deliver a compelling character piece, as we always hope to do, but drenched in viscera, seeping with blood, and packed with the off-kilter voices of the Marvel Zombies that fans have come to love.\nMarvel Zombies #1 goes on sale September 17.

      "text": "Upcoming Marvel movies and shows: Every new MCU release and more we know about\nHere are all the new Marvel movies and shows coming your way in 2025 and beyond\nIt's a good time to be a Marvel fan, not only is the MCU having a great year in terms of content, but there's still a boatload of upcoming Marvel movies and TV shows to look forward to. Marvel Phase 6 is now in full swing, with its first movie, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, now on the big screen, and new animated TV shows, Eyes of Wakanda, on Disney Plus \u2013 which has got us very excited for Black Panther 3.\nStill to come this year, we have What If...? spin-off Marvel Zombies, and comic book legend Wonder Man's small-screen debut. But the fun dosent stop in 2025, as next year, Spider-Man 4, which has just started filming in Scotland, will swing into cinemas, as well as Avengers: Doomsday. And that's only just scratching the surface.\nThe MCU slate may look a little too stacked to keep up with, but don't worry, as that's where we come in. Below, we've rounded up all the upcoming Marvel movies and shows, so you can save yourself a Thanos-sized task and get up to speed at a glance. If you're looking for a rundown on already released Marvel projects, check out our guide to the Marvel timeline, or how to watch the Marvel movies in order.\nMarvel Phase 6\nMarvel Phase 6: Every upcoming Marvel movie and show\nDid You think Phase 5 was the end of it? No way! Marvel has revealed multiple entries in Phase 6, as well as details the release dates of eight mystery projects. We've got all the confirmed dates here:\n- October 3, 2025: Marvel Zombies\n- December 2025: Wonder Man\n- July 24, 2026: Spider-Man 4\n- December 18, 2026: Avengers: Doomsday\n- December 17, 2027: Avengers: Secret Wars\n- February 18, 2028: Untitled movie\n- May 5, 2028: Untitled movie\n- November 10, 2028: Untitled movie\nMarvel Zombies\nMarvel Zombies release date: October 2025\nA What If...? spin-off, Marvel Zombies focuses on the undead creatures that inhabit the MCU. It's been confirmed that Ghost, Abomination, Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, Okoye, Captain America, Kate Bishop, Yelena, Shang Chi, Ms. Marvel, and Jimmy Woo will all appear in the series while a half-dead Ikaris from Eternals will also show up. The show will also have a TV-MA rating, making this slightly more mature than What If...?. We got our first proper look at it in the Marvel TV trailer.\nWonder Man\nWonder Man release date: December 2025\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nDestin Daniel Cretton has a lot on his plate. As well as planning a Shang-Chi sequel, and a Spider-Man movie, the director executive produces the Wonder Man series too. Rather than write the series, however, Cretton will hand the reins to Andrew Guest, a writer and producer known for comedies Community and Brooklyn 99. We also know that Ben Kingsley will return as Trevor Slattery in the series. As for who is playing Wonder Man, it's none other than Aquaman star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. Wonder Man has a rich comic-book history: the character made his debut as a supervillain against the Avengers. After being defeated by Earth's Mightiest Heroes, he was revived multiple times and even joined the Avengers for a while.\nDaredevil: Born Again Season 2\nDaredevil: Born Again Season 2 release date: March 2026\nThe good news is that out of all the Marvel shows we are waiting details on, Daredevil: Born Again season 2 is the most developed by far. Filming for the series began in March 2025 and looks to be aiming for a 2026 release. Marvel TV head Brad Winderbaum also recently told Screen Rant that season 2 will come out \"next year\". So, yeah, it seems like Daredevil fans are in for an annual kind of deal going forward. We are still waiting on a firm release date, though, and it's unclear if we'll see our hero feature in any Marvel Phase 6 movies. We'll keep you posted as we wait for more details. But for now, at least we can rest easy knowing that the Disney Plus series hasn't been cancelled and will be back soon.\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day release date: July 31, 2026\nAfter rumblings that it was happening, and that the script was in a good place, it's now been confirmed when Spider-Man will be swinging back onto our screens with Spider-Man 4, officially titled Spider-Man: Brand New Day. Tom Holland's friendly neighborhood superhero will be returning in July 2026, and Shang-Chi director Destin Daniel Cretton is officially on board to direct. It's not yet clear who else, aside from Holland, is down to return, but he'll be joined by Stranger Things star Sadie Sink in an undisclosed role. Holland announced that production has started on the fourth installment, and filming will start in summer 2025. But, with Zendaya still not attached to the project, fans seem to think that we may have seen the last of MJ, and Peter Parker may have a new love interest in number 4. Could Gwen Stacey or Marvel comic character Black Cat be up next?\nAvengers: Doomsday\nAvengers: Doomsday release date: December 18, 2026\nAvengers 5, now titled Avengers: Doomsday, is set to be directed by the Russo brothers and will see Robert Downey Jr\u2019s return to the MCU. However, he isn\u2019t Tony Stark this time around. No, instead, Downey Jr will be playing Doctor Doom. Originally, Avengers 5 was titled Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, and it would've been directed by Shang-Chi's Destin Daniel Cretton. Jonathan Majors would have starred as the titular, multiverse-conquering villain. However, Majors was dropped by Marvel Studios on December 18, 2023.\nThat means that Kang is being put on the back burner, and Doctor Doom will take his place as the big bad of the MCU going forward. Joe Russo gave us a scoop on the upcoming return, too, telling us that they have an idea to rival Endgame and Infinity War. Interesting... In terms of cast, we know that Anthony Mackie will be back as Captain America, along with a massive list of other Marvel stars, including Sebastian Stan, Patrick Stewart, Letitia Wright, and many, many more.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nAvengers: Secret Wars release date: December 17, 2027\nThe big one. Avengers: Secret Wars comes loaded with expectations. There have been two major comic book stories titled Secret Wars, the first of which saw heroes and villains transported to the planet Battleworld by the Beyonder to fight each other. The second, which launched in 2015, saw two universes collide \u2013 the main Marvel universe and the Ultimate universe \u2013 as an incursion threatened to wipe them both out, with Doctor Doom playing a major role.\nConsidering Doctor Strange 2 introduced incursions, and this is the Multiverse Saga, the second seems to be the inspiration for the movie. The film was originally set for release a few months after Avengers 5, but both have been delayed since. They're now set to release a year apart in December 2026 and 2027.\nTBC Marvel movies and shows\nOther Marvel movies and shows not in Phases\nNow comes the fun part \u2013 speculating over what's to come next. While there's been no official confirmation that these projects will form parts of Phases 5 or 6 or any Phase, industry reports and various insiders claim these upcoming Marvel movies and shows are on the way, we just don't know when.\nAlso to note: although Eternals, Doctor Strange 2, and Thor: Love and Thunder, all end with cards saying their heroes will return, we've not included individual upcoming superhero movies below as there has been no confirmation that sequels are happening (though you can read more on a potential Thor 5 if you wish).\nThere is also a mystery movie added to the 2028 schedule, for December 15. We've left that off the list below for now, since we have no details at all on what it might be \u2013 though everyone is convinced it's either X-Men, Blade, or even a Secret Wars Part 2...\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man season 2\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man season 2 release date: TBC\nBefore the first season even hit our screens, this Marvel show was already renewed for not only season 2, but a third instalment as well. Clearly, Disney Plus had a lot of faith that it would be a hit. And production is already well underway on Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man season 2, with Marvel Studios Head of Streaming, Television, and Animation, Brad Winderbaum, telling The Movie Podcast early in 2025 that all the scripts were complete and half of the work on the animatics was done too.\nSo, whilst no release date has been officially revealed, with this significant process, we anticipate that it will swing onto the streaming service in early 2026, following in the footsteps of the first season, which hit the small screen in January 2025. Here at GamesRadar+, we loved season one, awarding it a shiny four stars in our Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man review, so consider us already seated.\nArmor Wars\nArmor Wars release date: TBC\nAfter the Don Cheadle-led project was absent from San Diego Comic-Con, many speculated that the series had been scrapped by Marvel. The project was officially re-announced at D23, with Cheadle in attendance, and is set to pick up following the events of Secret Invasion.\nOriginally a Disney Plus series, but now a movie, the film will see Cheadle's War Machine dealing with \"what happens when Tony Stark's tech falls into the wrong hands.\" The latest update was not promising either, suggesting it's not happening any time soon.\nBlack Panther 3\nBlack Panther release date: TBC\nWell, it's happening. After much fan speculation and swirling rumors, it looks like the third installment of Black Panther is on the way. Although not much has been revealed about the upcoming movie at the moment, we do know that Denzel Washington will star, and director Ryan Coogler is thinking up a part for him.\nThis marks a beautiful full-circle moment as Washington actually quietly funded a summer of acting lessons for the late Chadwick Boseman when he was starting out. Keep your eyes peeled for more Black Panther 3 news.\nBlade\nBlade release date: TBC\nBlade has been a long time coming and was initially meant to be a Marvel Phase 5 title before it was pushed back to Marvel Phase 6 and then later taken off the schedule completely. It's not looking too good for the project now, either \u2013 Delroy Lindo, who was previously attached to star, implied that he was no longer attached and said the movie had \"gone off the rails.\"\nKevin Feige announced that Mahershala Ali would play the role back in 2019, with the actor having a minor voice role in the Eternals post-credits. Unfortunately, director Bassim Tariq stepped down from helming the movie shortly before filming was set to begin. A new script was reportedly being written by Michael Starrbury. True Detective's Nic Pizzolatto then joined as a writer, and horror queen Mia Goth has joined the cast, too. Sadly, the future still seems uncertain for Blade, as no new release date has been announced yet. Stay tuned for more details.\nShang-Chi 2\nShang-Chi 2 release date: TBC\nConsidering the success of Shang-Chi, and the post-credits sting that teased the character's return, a sequel seemed inevitable. Reports signaled that Destin Daniel Cretton had signed a multi-year deal with Marvel to develop projects including a sequel to Shang-Chi.\nWhether Cretton will direct the follow-up remains to be seen. What is definite, though, is that Shang-Chi 2 is coming, and will probably be part of Phase 6. And don't be too shocked to see a Ten Rings series at some stage, either.\nWakanda spin-off\nWakanda release date: TBC\nReports previously signaled that Ryan Coogler, who has signed an overall deal with Marvel, is developing a new Disney Plus series that will tell stories from Wakanda. That's what has been confirmed. Separate reports also indicated that an Okoye spin-off starring Danai Gurira, telling the origins of the Dora Milaje leader, was in development.\n\"Because of the amount of time and attention that went into [Black Panther: Wakanda Forever], and frankly the Ironheart show, that is probably not as far along as people want it to be,\" Black Panther 2 producer Nate Moore told Collider of the Wakanda spin-off. \"But there are certainly great ideas that we're still talking to Ryan about. So, we'll see how far we can get with it.\" In February 2025, it was confirmed that the Okoye spin-off is no longer happening.\nNova\nNova release date: TBC\nNova has been one of the most-requested heroes for some time, and a new project looks set to bring him into the MCU. Moon Knight scribe Sabir Pirzada is on board to write the project, though it remains unclear whether this will be a movie or a Disney Plus series. In the comics, Nova's origin story revolves around a planet that we have seen before in live-action: Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019s Xandar, which was almost destroyed by the villain Ronan.\nNova \u2013 real name Richard Rider \u2013 was a member of the Xandar Corps and is bestowed the power of Nova Prime. He must come to terms with his newfound powers. There's no casting or director just yet, but don't be surprised to see Nova as part of Phase 6.\nStar-Lord movie or TV show\nStar-Lord movie/show release date: TBC\nWhile the third Guardians of the Galaxy movie marks the end of the trilogy, it seems one character may still be coming back. In the Guardians of the Galaxy 3 post-credits scene, a title card appeared saying that Chris Pratt's Legendary Star-Lord will return. Speaking to GamesRadar+, Pratt shared that it would have to be a very special project for him to return to the role without James Gunn.\n\"It would be strange to continue Peter\u2019s story without James,\" Pratt told us. \"He's done such a masterful job in the first three films. We really found the voice of Peter Quill together and without him, obviously, I would never have had this opportunity.\"\nVision\nVision release date: 2026\nFive years after 'White' Vision flew off to deal with an existential crisis after having his memories restored in WandaVision, Paul Bettany will return as the character in a Disney Plus show helmed by Star Trek: Picard's Terry Matalas. The good news is that the writers' room for the upcoming Marvel show opened in May 2024, so at least we know that development is happening here. Casting has been slowly coming through as well, with an unexpected Iron Man star joining.\nX-Men movie\nX-Men release date: TBC\nLittle is known at this early stage about the upcoming X-Men movie. In fact, it could be several years off - but work has begun on the project. Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes writer Michael Lesslie is in discussions to pen the script, per Deadline.\nThere's been no casting yet, but we can expect a completely fresh cast of mutants. Several teases have already been sprinkled throughout the MCU (Ms. Marvel's mutant origins, a Wolverine Easter egg in She-Hulk, and Logan's return in Deadpool), enough to suggest that mutants could easily fold into the cinematic universe without too much of an issue. After the release of Captain America: Brave New World, producer Nate Moore said plans were ongoing but \"fluid\".\nThose are all the upcoming Marvel movies and shows we know about.

That's a shame, as it's a hugely entertaining film, one which we said \"brings to mind the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, although this is still its own beast\" in our own Thunderbolts* review.\nPerhaps some fans have been waiting to watch the movie from the comfort of their own home? If so, then we have some good news for you.

And when you're done here, be sure to check out our guides to the Marvel movies to watch before Thunderbolts* and our complete guide on how to watch the Marvel movies in order.\nThe final film in Marvel's Phase 5 of the MCU opened in cinemas worldwide on May 2. It was then made available as a digital download on July 1, and for sale on Blu-ray and DVD on July 29 in the US.\nWe originally predicted, based on Disney's usual release pattern trends that the film would finally land on Disney Plus mid-August. We were off by a couple of days: it's now been confirmed that Thunderbolts* will be on Disney Plus on Wednesday, August 27. We weren't too far out, then!\nSo, if you've been waiting to find out just what that asterisk in the title really means \u2013 and you've somehow managed to stay unspoiled till this point \u2013 now's your chance to finally find out...\nFor more, check out all the latest on Marvel Phase 6.

      "text": "As Black Panther spin-off Eyes of Wakanda gets an earlier release date, its showrunner lays out an ambitious mission statement: \"My goal was to do the thing that a movie has trouble doing\"\nEyes of Wakanda hits Disney Plus on August 1\nBlack Panther spin-off series Eyes of Wakanda is now releasing a few weeks earlier on Disney Plus.\nAs revealed by Entertainment Weekly, the animated four-part show is dropping on August 1 instead of its prior landing spot of August 27.\nWith Fantastic Four: First Steps in cinemas, this is one of the more under-the-radar MCU entries in 2025 \u2013 but no less intriguing.\nThe miniseries follows a group of Wakandas known as the Hatut Zaraze, a specialist team designed to take on dangerous missions, and their major, death-defying moments through history.\nEyes of Wakanda isn't just giving us a closer look at Wakanda's finest, however. For showrunner and director Todd Harris, it's a chance to dive deeper into the mythology and culture behind one of Marvel's richest locales, building on the legacy of Ryan Coogler's pair of Black Panther movies.\n\"My goal for the whole show was to do the thing that a movie has trouble doing, which is making the world bigger,\" Harris told Entertainment Weekly. \"It is a nation with multiple zip codes. It was mostly just expanding the backdrop of the world that Ryan was able to establish, with just a little bit more time and a few more opportunities at the watering hole. These things have been around for this long, really spreading out the mythology of Wakanda.\"\nEyes of Wakanda hits Disney Plus on August 1, with Marvel Zombies and Wonder Man to follow later this year.

      "text": "This morning, Disney is starting the day off with some good news for MCU fans, or bad news if you prefer your superheroes not turned into flesh-eaters. Marvel Zombies is moving up a full week from October 3 to September 24, meaning the creepy new animated miniseries will now premiere on Disney+ ahead of the spooky season. From there, all four episodes of the What If...? spin-off will air weekly, delivering all the zombie carnage before Halloween. It's still set to be the second-to-last project from Marvel this year, followed by the Yahya Abdul-Mateen II-led series Wonder Man coming in December.\nMarvel Zombies was first announced back in 2021 as a continuation of the What If...? Season 1 episode, \"What If... Zombies?!\" Exact details about the plot have been kept under wraps, but it is known that it'll not only return to that same world where the classic Avengers mainstays have all been zombified, but introduce new survivors based on the MCU and inspired by the Marvel Zombies comic that started it all by The Walking Dead's Robert Kirkman and Sean Phillips. The episode left the world in a bleak spot, with Thanos arriving on Earth like in Avengers: Infinity War, only transformed into one of the living dead with an almost complete Infinity Gauntlet and looming over what was humanity's last bastion, Wakanda. Spider-Man (Hudson Thames), T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), and the head of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) were en route there to use the Mind Stone to potentially cure the infected populace, but how that plays out remains to be seen.\nWhat little has been shown about the series has teased plenty of infected action, with the likes of Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) and Blade Knight, a version of Moon Knight and Blade, fighting off the undead together, and a now-infected Okoye leading the zombified army. As seen back at D23 in 2024, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) will also have a big role to play, alongside Katy (Awkwafina), Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), and the Ten Rings. After terrifying viewers in the episode, the infected Wanda Maximoff will be back to haunt the survivors as well, with Elizabeth Olsen making her return for the voice. With a TV-MA rating, this will not be a Marvel show for the whole family, packed with plenty of gore to go around for its zombified heroes.\nWho Is Behind the Creation of 'Marvel Zombies'?\nFor the miniseries, Brad Andrews, who directed the original What If...? episode, serves as showrunner and executive producer. Emmy-winner and Deadpool & Wolverine co-writer Zeb Wells, meanwhile, created Marvel Zombies. The idea for a full-on horror show came from on high after Marvel's television chief, Brad Winderbaum, and president Kevin Feige both pushed for more stories from the apocalypse after seeing \"What If... Zombies?!\" With four episodes of run-time and a mature rating, they had all the runway for something bigger, badder, and bloodier with a much darker tone than expected of Marvel and Disney.\nMarvel Zombies arrives on Disney+ on September 24. Stay tuned here at Collider for more on the creepy new MCU series very soon.\nMarvel Zombies\n- Release Date\n- October 3, 2025\n- Network\n- Disney+\n- Showrunner\n- Kevin Feige\n- Directors\n- Bryan Andrews\n- Writers\n- Robert Kirkman\nCast\n-\nAlexei Shostakov / Red Guardian (voice)\n-\nShang-Chi (voice)\n-\nZombie Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch (voice)\n-\nJimmy Woo (voice)\n- Franchise(s)\n- Marvel Cinematic Universe"
