  "description": "At a San Mateo County Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday, the legal team representing embattled Sheriff Christina Corpus made another attempt to halt the upcoming hearing proceedings aimed at her removal.",
  "content": "At a San Mateo County Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday, the legal team representing embattled Sheriff Christina Corpus made another attempt to halt the upcoming hearing proceedings aimed at her removal.\n\nCorpus is facing potential removal from her elected position after voters in March overwhelmingly approved Measure A, a charter amendment granting the supervisors temporary power to remove the sheriff on grounds of misconduct.\n\nMeasure A was the board's way of removing Corpus, who remained defiant against calls to resign after the release of a scathing, 400-page investigation by retired judge LaDoris Cordell alleging that Corpus had an inappropriate relationship with her chief of staff and fostered a culture of intimidation and retaliation in the Sheriff's Office.\n\nAs part of the removal proceedings, a Measure A hearing is set to begin Monday and last 10 days.\n\nIn addition, a separate trial is scheduled for September after the county civil grand jury accused Corpus of having a conflict of interest in the hiring of her chief of staff, Victor Aenlle, with whom she has a close relationship. The civil grand jury also alleged that Corpus retaliated against three of her staff members.\n\nAt Tuesday's board meeting, at least four of Corpus' attorneys showed up in a last-ditch attempt to halt next week's hearing. They requested that the supervisors pause the Measure A hearing and instead hold the civil grand jury trial first.\n\nAttorney Tom Perez, who served as the former U.S. secretary of labor during former President Barack Obama's administration and as a senior adviser to former President Joe Biden, spoke for more than 10 minutes during public comment.\n\nPerez recently joined Corpus' team of lawyers, and originally requested one hour to speak to the board at Tuesday's regular meeting, according to a letter he sent to board president David Canepa and County Attorney John Nibbelin. The board denied that request.\n\n\"I sent a letter last week, and I'm here to make a specific request,\" Perez said to the board at Tuesday's meeting. \"The request is that the civil grand jury proceeding, which would give the community a voice in this matter, proceed first, and the reason for that is so that the community can weigh in.\"\n\nPerez spent the next 10 minutes of his speech defending Corpus against accusations made in the Cordell report and trying to highlight her accomplishments and track record as sheriff.\n\nHe mentioned Corpus' response to the 2023 Half Moon Bay shootings, and the reduction in violent crimes and property crimes seen in 2024 during Corpus' tenure. He attempted to discount allegations that Corpus and Aenlle had an intimate relationship, and also discussed the challenges she faced as the first woman of color to be elected sheriff in the county.\n\n\"We are here to defend her vigorously, and we will bring the truth forward,\" Perez said. \"We will prove the negatives.\"\n\nNone of the board members responded directly to Perez's request during the meeting.\n\nA statement from county spokesperson Effie Milionis Verducci said San Mateo County fully intends to move forward with the Measure A hearing next week.\n\n\"The county remains committed to defending the integrity of the lawful Measure A process and we look forward to the hearing taking place, beginning August 18,\" she wrote.\n\nIt was Corpus' latest attempt to stop the removal proceedings, having filed multiple requests to halt the Measure A process through temporary restraining orders.\n\n\"The Sheriff has now asked three different judges to stop the removal process and all three have refused, allowing the process to move forward,\" Milionis Verducci said.\n\nMonday's hearing will be open to the public after Corpus reversed her initial request to keep it closed.\n\n\"Let the public see the facts,\" Corpus said in a statement announcing her decision in late July. \"Let them hear the truth. Let justice pierce the veil of corruption and bring light where darkness has reigned for far too long.\"\n\nTuesday's meeting also included an agenda item in which the board heard a presentation recommending the establishment of a full-time inspector general to oversee the Sheriff's Office with subpoena power.\n\nKalimah Salahuddin, the chair of the county's Independent Civilian Advisory Commission on the Sheriff's Office, gave the presentation explaining the benefits of having an inspector general. The ICAC is comprised of nine appointed members who offer recommendations to the board for encouraging transparency and accountability in the Sheriff's Office.\n\nAn inspector general, Salahuddin said at the meeting, would have \"the ability to hold impartial investigations into allegations of misconduct, both internally and externally, to be able to review internal investigations for fairness and then support ICAC when issues are brought to our commission.\"\n\nFor some members of the public, the addition of a full-time inspector general to oversee the Sheriff's Office has come at an important time given the current upheaval the department is facing surrounding Corpus.\n\n\"Over the past year, we have witnessed the complete unraveling of the Sheriff's Office,\" said deacon Lauren Patton McCombs during public comment. She is a member of the Coalition for a Safer San Mateo County, a group of community organizations that support civilian oversight of the Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"The time to act is now. I encourage you to follow the recommendation of ICAC and hire a permanent inspector general to prevent any future problems developing within the Sheriff's Office. Don't wait until a new interim sheriff is appointed.\"\n\nThe board did not take a vote on whether to hire an inspector general during Tuesday's meeting.",

The sheriff did not speak, but through her attorneys denied the accusations against her.\nLast month, the county's civil grand jury accused Corpus of one count of conflict of interest over the hiring of Victor Aenlle, whom she allegedly had a close personal relationship with.\nThe grand jury also accused the sheriff of three counts of retaliation following the termination of Assistant Sheriff Ryan Monaghan, the transfer of Capt. Brian Phillip and the arrest of Deputy Carlos Tapia, president of the Deputy Sheriff's Association.\nThomas Mazzucco, Corpus' attorney, had previously said the civil grand jury's accusations were \"related to politically motivated complaints by the upper echelons and union leadership\" at the sheriff's office.\nCorpus has been facing months of scrutiny and calls to resign following the release of an independent report by retired judge LaDoris Cordell into allegations of abuse of power at the sheriff's office.\nThe report prompted the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors to call for a special election in March to temporarily amend the charter to remove a sheriff from office for cause. Eighty-four percent of voters approved the amendment, which is also known as Measure A.\nLast month, the board initiated the process to remove Corpus from office, a process that is expected to take several months.\nIf found guilty of the grand jury's accusations, Corpus faces removal along with potential penalties that could permanently bar her from seeking an elected position in the state.\nCorpus' next court appearance is scheduled for July 21."

      "text": "Independent investigation calls on San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus to resign\nThe San Mateo County Board of Supervisors Tuesday called on Sheriff Christina Corpus to resign based on recommendations of an independent investigation into allegations of abuse of power in her department.\nAccording to a release issued by the board, the investigative report by retired California Superior Court Judge LaDoris Cordell revealed additional charges of intimidation, retaliation, the use of racial and homophobic slurs and conflicts of interest.\nCorpus and her Chief of Staff Victor Aenlle are also accused of having a personal relationship.\nThe report concluded with a recommendation that \"Sheriff Corpus step down and that Victor Aenlle's employment by the sheriff's office be terminated immediately. Nothing short of new leadership can save this organization.\"\nSupervisors Noelia Corzo and Ray Mueller on Tuesday held a press conference to highlight the public release of Cordell's report.\n\"Judge Cordell's independent investigation contains findings that are unprecedented in the history of San Mateo County Government,\" said Mueller. \"The sheriff and her chief of staff's reprehensible conduct demands full transparency and immediate action.\"\nTuesday evening, the sheriff spoke to reporters about the independent investigation into her office and denied the charges.\n\"Like many of you, I am shocked by the outright slander of by two members of the board this afternoon. No one will call me a racist or a homophobe. These are people who have a vendetta against me,\" Corpus said. \"I am disgusted at how low these people will go.\"\nShe went on to defend herself regarding the charges, claiming that anyone who knows her knows she would never use racist terms and was \"not capable of that.\"\n\"Racism is disgusting and vile. As a woman of color, this disturbs me deeply,\" she said.\nSheriff Corpus said that the attacks against her were happening because she represents change and accountability.\nEarlier Tuesday, Sheriff Corpus held her first press conference to announce the arrest of San Mateo County Deputy Sheriff's Association President Carlos Tapia.\n\"No one is above the law. We are committed to accountability at every level. While these actions are difficult, they are necessary to uphold the integrity and trust of our office, and our community,\" said Sheriff's Corpus.\nWhile the sheriff's announcement did not go into any details about the arrest, the Mercury News reported that Tapia turned himself in on charges of felony grand theft.\nTapia spoke following the sheriff's presser on his arrest.\n\"I will continue to faithfully represent the interest of our union members and I will look forward to the district attorney's review of this investigation,\" he said. \"And I'm confident I will be vindicated.\"\nTapia was released on a bond and has been placed on administrative leave, the Sheriff's Office said. His case will be forwarded to the county District Attorney's Office for review.\nOn Tuesday, the union along with the San Mateo County Organization of Sheriff's Sergeants condemned Tapia's arrest, saying it has \"all the earmarks of whistleblower retaliation\" in the wake of Cordell's report.\nThe San Mateo County Board of Supervisors also addressed Tapia's arrest, saying, \"It is highly irregular in San Mateo County for the Sheriff's Office to undertake a criminal investigation and arrest a member of their own department.\"\nThe ongoing dispute between the sheriff and the two unions first surfaced in September when San Mateo County Deputy Sheriff's Association aired their grievances against Sheriff Corpus and Chief of Staff Aenlle.\nThe DSA and the Office of Sheriff's Sergeants both accused Aenlle of creating a toxic work environment and interfering with protected union activities. The deputies' union also filed unfair labor practice complaints with the California Public Employment Relations Board.\nThe PERB complaints allege the Sheriff's Office changed its minimum staffing level policy without union input and refused to meet about an expiring overtime policy.\nA week later, Sheriff Corpus and the county Board of Supervisors released separate statements about the spat.\nIn her statement, Corpus struck a defiant tone and said she refused to consider removing her chief of staff, Victor Aenlle, over what she called \"political games.\"\nThe San Mateo County Board of Supervisors also announced a special board meeting will be held Wednesday afternoon at 4 p.m. to consider the potential next steps to resolve the issues with the sheriff's department."

      "text": "San Mateo supervisors closer to ousting Sheriff Christina Corpus after election certified\nA San Mateo County measure giving the Board of Supervisors temporary authority to remove the sheriff was certified Thursday and voters overwhelmingly supported it by 84 percent.\nNow it's up to the supervisors to make their next move.\nMeasure A was voted on in a March 4 special election. The charter amendment was spurred by an investigation into alleged misconduct of San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus, who has resisted calls to resign from supervisors, two deputy sheriff unions, and elected city, state and federal officials.\nThe San Mateo County Board of Supervisors resorted to holding a special election after Corpus refused to step down following a scathing 400-page report about her office was released last November.\nThe author of the investigative report into Corpus, retired Judge LaDoris Cordell, suggested that the sheriff resign, but did not explicitly point out any criminality.\nIn her report, Cordell interviewed about 40 current and former employees at the sheriff's office and concluded, \"Lies, secrecy, intimidation, retaliation, conflicts of interest, and abuses of authority are all the hallmarks of the Corpus administration. Corpus should step down.\"\nThe San Mateo County Deputy Sheriff's Association and Organization of Sheriff Sergeants on Thursday sent out a joint statement praising the outcome of the special election.\n\"While the initiative was in many ways unprecedented, it is our firm belief that, in this case, decisive action was necessary,\" reads the statement. \"Today's certified vote means that Sheriff Corpus' reign of unscrupulous mismanagement will soon come to an end.\"\nAs for Corpus, she has been steadfast in her promise to stay put. She has said the attacks on her are politically motivated because she is a female sheriff up against a group of officers who are part of a \"good ol' boys club.\"\nCorpus has filed a $10 million lawsuit against the county alleging discrimination and harassment.\nUnder the amendment to the county charter established by Measure A, removal of Corpus would now require a four-fifths majority vote by the board of supervisors and Corpus will have an opportunity to defend her case. The board's authority to remove her will expire at the end of 2028.\nThe board is set to meet on Tuesday, though the agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted.\nAn attempt to reach Corpus was not immediately returned.\nCorpus was elected in 2022 and became the county's first Latina sheriff."
