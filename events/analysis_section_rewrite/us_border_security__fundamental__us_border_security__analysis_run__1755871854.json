      "feedback": "The analysis draft presents a solid overview of the current political landscape regarding immigration policy, but it lacks depth in articulating the causal chain and market transmission mechanisms. To elevate the analysis to world-class quality, consider the following actionable edits: \n\n1. **Depth and Clarity of Reasoning**: Expand on the causal relationships between immigration policy changes and their broader economic implications, such as labor market effects or impacts on public services. Clearly articulate how these policies influence voter behavior and party dynamics.\n\n2. **First-Principles Grounding**: Integrate first-principles analysis by discussing the economic fundamentals driving immigration policy, such as labor supply and demand, fiscal impacts, and public sentiment. This will provide a more robust foundation for your arguments.\n\n3. **Specificity of Catalysts**: Identify specific catalysts or triggers that could invalidate the current immigration policies or shift public opinion, such as economic downturns, humanitarian crises, or significant legal rulings.\n\n4. **Quantification and Use of Numbers**: Incorporate more quantitative data and specific ranges where applicable, such as projected voter turnout changes or economic impacts of immigration policies, to support your claims and avoid generic statements.\n\n5. **Citation Density and Coverage**: Ensure that all critical sources are cited correctly and that conflicting information is reconciled. This will enhance the credibility of your analysis and provide a comprehensive view of the topic.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the analysis will not only align better with the section focus but also provide a more nuanced and compelling narrative that resonates with readers.",
