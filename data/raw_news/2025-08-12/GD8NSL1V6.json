Generate Key Takeaways\n\nProtests and memorials have erupted worldwide, and calls for accountability are growing after five Al Jazeera staff were assassinated in an Israeli strike on Gaza.\n\nLate on Sunday, an Israeli attack hit a media tent outside the main gate of al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, killing Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif, 28, along with colleagues Mohammed Qreiqeh, 33, Ibrahim Zaher, 25, Mohammed Noufal, 29, and Moamen Aliwa, 23.\n\nTwo other Palestinians were also killed, bringing the total death toll from the strike to seven.\n\nGaza\u2019s Government Media Office says at least 238 journalists have been killed since Israel\u2019s war on Gaza began in late 2023.\n\nThe latest killings have prompted outrage around the world. In Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Palestinians filled the streets, waving flags and carrying photographs of the slain reporters.\n\nHundreds rallied in Tunisia, demanding accountability for the attacks. Protests took place in Northern Ireland\u2019s capital, Belfast and Republic of Ireland\u2019s capital, Dublin, while vigils were held in Berlin, Germany and the Netherlands. Earlier demonstrations took place in Washington, DC, as well as London, Oslo and Stockholm.\n\nIn the US capital, Washington, DC, protesters gathered outside a building housing NBC, Fox News, ITN and The Guardian.\n\nDemonstrators were \u201cbanging pots and pans, making as much noise as possible\u201d to disrupt live broadcasts happening inside, said Al Jazeera\u2019s Shihab Rattansi, reporting from the scene.\n\n\u201cThe demonstrators say their coverage of the genocide in Gaza has given Israel room to kill so many Palestinians and, notably, so many journalists,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTheir message is: You are no longer the gatekeepers. We know what\u2019s happening in Gaza. We know about the genocide despite your best efforts,\u201d he added.\n\nRattansi said candles were lit for each journalist killed in Gaza, with particular attention given to al-Sharif.\n\nHazami Barmada, one of the organisers of the Washington, DC protest, told Al Jazeera the media organisations had helped to create \u201cpublic consent for the murder of these journalists \u2026 by making excuses for the Israeli government to target and kill them\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cAfter their death, [the media organisations] continue to justify the illegal death, shooting, bombing and murdering journalists, which is a crime against humanity and a war crime.\u201d\n\nPress freedom group PEN America said the killing of the five journalists in Gaza \u201craises grave concerns\u201d and \u201ccould amount to a war crime\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis attack not only wiped out an entire team of journalists \u2013 at a time when there are fewer and fewer voices able to report from Gaza \u2013 but also took six more Palestinian lives in an onslaught that has already claimed thousands of lives,\u201d said Liesl Gerntholtz, managing director of its PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Center.\n\n\u201cThe fact that [Anas] al-Sharif\u2019s family, friends, and colleagues must now defend him from unsupported accusations rather than being able to mourn him and honour his legacy as a journalist adds to the disgraceful nature of this crime,\u201d Gerntholtz added.\n\nPEN America noted that al-Sharif was previously part of a Reuters team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2024.\n\nElsewhere, an Australian journalists\u2019 union released a statement condemning the \u201ctargeted killing of the five Palestinian media workers and the killing of nearly 200 others\u201d.\n\nThe Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA), the largest organisation representing journalists in Australia, said al-Sharif\u2019s \u201creports brought to the world the reality of the horrors being inflicted by the Israeli Government on the civilians in Gaza\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe targeting of journalists is a blatant attack on press freedom, and it is also a war crime. It must stop,\u201d MEAA said, also calling for Israel\u2019s ban preventing international journalists from reporting from Gaza to be lifted.\n\nSeparately, the United Nations condemned the killings, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres calling for an \u201cindependent and impartial investigation\u201d, his spokesperson said.\n\nThe killings come as Israel\u2019s Security Cabinet has approved Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plan to expand military operations and occupy Gaza City.\n\nIn November 2024, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.",
