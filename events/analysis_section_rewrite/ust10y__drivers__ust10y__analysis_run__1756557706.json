      "feedback": "The draft is largely on‑target for the DXY but drifts in a few places (e.g., the mortgage‑rate paragraph, the “steady 200‑bp decline” phrasing) and could be tightened into a single, evidence‑driven view.  Re‑frame the narrative as a concise, data‑anchored forecast: start with the canonical handle **dxy** and state the direction (‑200 bp by 31 Aug 2025) and magnitude range (‑150 bp to ‑250 bp) with the 89 % probability of a September Fed cut and the 57 bp steepening of the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread as the primary drivers (IDs Z7O1DCHS7, 7XH2DKEKV).  Explicitly link the mortgage‑rate discussion to the DXY by noting that a 25‑bp Fed cut would compress the 30‑yr spread to 6.45–6.50 % (ID LF0UUL917), thereby easing dollar carry and supporting the fall.  Replace the “steady 200‑bp decline” sentence with a conditional statement: “If the Fed cuts in September, DXY will fall 150–250 bp; a 25‑bp cut would push it to 95.8, while a 50‑bp cut would bring it to 95.3.”  Add a short‑term upside clause tied to the August 30 PCE and August 31 NFP: “PCE > 3 % or payrolls > expected will lift DXY 50–100 bp (ID 7XH2DKEKV).”  List risks: Fed policy reversal, higher inflation, stronger employment, persistent term‑premium flattening; each would truncate the decline.  Conclude with a watch‑list: (1) Fed September policy meeting (2) 2‑yr/10‑yr spread release (3) August 30 PCE (4) August 31 NFP.  Ensure every sentence contains a causal link back to **dxy** and an inline citation; remove any extraneous mention of mortgage rates unless explicitly tied to the dollar.  This will satisfy the truth‑over‑verbosity rule, provide clear magnitude ranges, catalysts, and invalidations, and keep the analysis tightly focused on the DXY.",
