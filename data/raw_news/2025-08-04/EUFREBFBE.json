  "content": "Nik and Kev\u2019s once-in-a-lifetime adventures around Australia reached their finale as the guys arrived in Sydney for the third Test.\n\nThey have spent the last six weeks travelling around the country \u2013 planes, trains and automobiles \u2013 seeing old friends and making new ones, too.\n\nThere have been a few bumps along the way but all was well as they reached Bondi Beach, which gets its name from the Aboriginal word for \u2018the sound of waves breaking over rocks\u2019.\n\nHere is what the guys got up to in the sixth episode of Roar & Uncut, in association with Dr Squatch.\n\nWe booked in for an early morning surf lesson with Marty at Let\u2019s Go Surfing down at Bondi.\n\nAlways up for some adventure, former Lions No 10 Dan Biggar came along as we donned our wetsuit and hit the waves. Dan grew up in the Gower in Wales, one of the UK\u2019s best surf spots, and it\u2019s fair to say he had the edge over myself and Kevin.\n\nWe took in the spectacular views from our terrace at the InterContinental Sydney Double Bay.\n\nIHG are the official tour partners so we rubbed shoulders with a few Wallabies, who were also staying in the hotel that overlooks one of Sydney\u2019s most picturesque bays.\n\nAfter the Wallaby press conference at our hotel, we caught the short ferry around to the Lions press conference in Circular Quay, enjoying views of the Sydney Opera House on the way.\n\nThis was the rest day from media operations before the final Test, so there was a chance to go out and explore the area.\n\nKev booked in to scale the skyline on the Sydney Harbour Bridge climb, where he was partnered up with former England prop Paul Doran Jones. I opted for a whale watching trip, although the waters were stormy and I saw more people being sick than whales!\n\nThe guys in charge of the exhibition match between the Lions and Wallaby legends invited us down to go behind the scenes.\n\nWe watched up close in the dressing rooms as the likes of Leigh Halfpenny and Shane Williams laced up their boots once more.\n\nBut it was Finn Russell\u2019s younger brother, Archie, who scored the try of the night. Finn was in the crowd with the rest of his family, sharing some light-hearted jokes about Archie scoring the most tries on Australian soil.\n\nA few weeks ago, we crossed paths with former Manchester United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich.\n\nBosnich invited us to his favourite Italian restaurant in the city, so we splashed on some Dr Squatch cologne and headed out for a slap-up lunch.\n\nBosnich is a big fan of rugby, comparing Finn Russell to Andrea Pirlo. He has settled back home in Sydney now, where he will be heading up the Stan Sports coverage of the Premier League next season.\n\nStorms lashed down on the city so we donned our raincoats and made tracks to the match.\n\nThere was a lightning interruption during the match that resulted in a 40-minute delay during the second half.\n\nAfter the game we caught up with the retiring Nic White, our moustachioed Australian friend, and he was the perfect final guest, bringing the tour full-circle after he welcomed us to Perth back in June.\n\nRoar & Uncut comes to you in association with Dr Squatch, ensuring Nik and Kev are the best-smelling guys on tour.\n\nFor more information on visiting Sydney, go to https://www.destinationnsw.com.au/",
