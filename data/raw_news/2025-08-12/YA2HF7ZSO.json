  "description": "School officials reportedly contacted child services 13 times over two years before Rebekah Baptiste\u2019s death.",
  "content": "Recently released police documents have shed new light on the final weeks of 10-year-old Rebekah Baptiste\u2019s life, revealing disturbing allegations of escalating abuse and multiple attempts to flee her living situation.\n\nThe 36-page report from the Navajo County Sheriff\u2019s Office outlines interviews with her father, Richard Baptiste, and his girlfriend, Anicia Woods, following the discovery of the unresponsive child on July 27.\n\nRebekah was later pronounced dead three days later at Phoenix Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nBoth adults are now facing charges of first-degree murder.\n\nDetectives say the family had been living off-grid in a rural campsite near Concho, Arizona, in a yurt without electricity or running water since relocating from Phoenix earlier in July.\n\nThe family slept on thin mattresses on the yurt floor and hauled water in plastic jugs from a Concho convenience store 15 miles away.\n\nWoods initially claimed a neighbor found Rebekah unresponsive after she had run away. However, law enforcement noted this was not the first time the child had attempted to escape.\n\nRecords indicate Rebekah had previously jumped out of a window in Phoenix and made several other escape attempts after the move to Concho, the final one occurring on the day she was taken to the hospital.\n\nDespite Rebekah\u2019s visible deterioration, including being too weak to drink from a straw, Woods, who claimed she had a background in nursing, told authorities she believed the child \u201cwould be fine\u201d and chose not to seek immediate medical help.\n\nWhen questioned, both Woods and Baptiste initially denied knowledge of what caused the child\u2019s condition, suggesting she may have been injured in a fall.\n\nHowever, medical professionals found extensive signs of physical abuse, including a brain hemorrhage, burn marks, missing toenails and hair, and numerous cuts and bruises.\n\nWhen shown \u201chorrendous photos\u201d of his daughter\u2019s injuries, Baptiste \u201clacked in expressing any emotion,\u201d one detective wrote in the probable\u2011cause affidavit.\n\n\u201cAfter seeing these photos, I knew there would be no way a father would not notice the extensive injuries on his daughter, it would be impossible in my mind, for a father not to see these huge marks and bruises on his child,\u201d the comment read.\n\nAccording to police, Baptiste later confessed to striking his daughter with a belt as punishment for running away, but denied causing the head injuries. Authorities also discovered bloody clothing in the tent the family shared, which had been changed before emergency services were contacted.\n\nFox News Digital reviewed the three 911 calls made by Woods on July 27. In the calls, Woods referred to Rebekah as her daughter and claimed she was providing rescue breaths, though her tone lacked urgency.\n\nIn one call, she told the dispatcher they were driving toward Holbrook, believing there was an EMS station there. The dispatcher instructed her to pull over, so medics could reach them.\n\nWhen asked if CPR was being administered, Woods said she was breathing into Rebekah\u2019s mouth but had not begun chest compressions. The dispatcher asked her to place the child on firm ground, but Woods hesitated, noting she was unsure about laying her on the rocks.\n\nEmergency crews arrived shortly afterward, but Rebekah did not survive her injuries.\n\nBoth Woods and Baptiste are now facing murder and child abuse charges related not only to Rebekah\u2019s death, but also to the alleged mistreatment of her two younger siblings.\n\nDuring interviews with investigators, Woods stated that a possible punishment for her might be \u201csome jail time,\u201d while Baptiste expressed remorse, saying he did not deserve to be a father.\n\nProsecutors have alleged that Rebekah suffered ongoing physical and sexual abuse.\n\nConcerns about the family\u2019s wellbeing had been raised multiple times by staff at Empower College Prep, where the children were enrolled, 12News reported.\n\nSchool officials reportedly contacted Arizona\u2019s Department of Child Safety (DCS) 13 times over the past two years, including one report from a school resource officer who visited the family\u2019s home following Rebekah\u2019s unexplained absence.\n\nDCS has since launched a review into whether the agency failed to adequately protect the child.\n\n\u201cAnytime a child in our community is harmed, it deeply affects us all, especially when we know the family,\u201d a statement from DCS to Fox News Digital read. \u201cOur dedicated staff work tirelessly to ensure the safety of all children, but tragically, those who intend to harm children can sometimes evade even the most robust systems designed to protect them.\u201d\n\nThe department added that it will \u201ccontinue to be transparent and release information related to this case\u201d as well as their involvement with the family as they are legally permitted to do so.\n\nGov. Katie Hobbs has also acknowledged the growing public concern and pledged to fully investigate the case.\n\n\u201cFirst, let me say this is obviously a very tragic situation, and we are certainly looking into what happened,\u201d Hobbs previously told 12News. \u201cThe information we had at the agency prior to this case and what led up to her death, we\u2019re certainly going to be investigating, and if there was something that we did not do right, we will do everything we can to correct that. That is our job. It is our responsibility to ensure Arizonans are safe and we\u2019ll fix what went wrong. If that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Hobbs\u2019 office and Empower College Prep for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.",

      "text": "The national headquarters of the Israeli-American Council (IAC) in Los Angeles was targeted with antisemitic vandalism over the weekend, prompting a hate crime investigation by local law enforcement.\nThe disturbing graffiti was found outside the Shepher Community Center in Woodland Hills, which houses the IAC\u2019s L.A. regional offices and serves as a hub for local Israeli-American and American Jewish communities.\nVandals spray-painted swastikas, SS symbols, and the word \"burn\" on the sidewalk in front of the building. A cardboard snowman near the entrance was also defaced with a swastika.\nNearby, along an entrance to Highway 101, a separate barrier was tagged with an expletive-laced anti-Israel message referencing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, along with additional swastikas scattered throughout the area.\nFBI INVESTIGATING 'HORRIFIC ANTISEMITIC ATTACK' ON AMERICAN WHO SERVED IN ISRAELI ARMY\nThe IAC said it is working with the LAPD\u2019s Topanga Division as part of the ongoing investigation.\nAccording to the organization, security video from the scene captured an image of a possible suspect, which has been turned over to authorities.\nIn a statement, IAC CEO Elan S. Carr, former U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, condemned the act in strong terms.\n\"We are appalled by this vile act of antisemitism at the doorstep of our own community and offices,\" Carr said.\nAOC CAMPAIGN OFFICE VANDALIZED WITH ANTI-ISRAEL MESSAGE AFTER VOTE ON REPUBLICAN AMENDMENT\nAuthorities have not yet identified a suspect, but the incident comes amid what advocacy groups say is a nationwide surge in antisemitic vandalism and harassment.\n\"Around the world and across our country, we have seen an alarming and historic rise in antisemitism,\" Carr said. \"We are working tirelessly to fight it and to ensure that history does not repeat itself.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCarr vowed that this incident would not scare them or keep them silent in standing up against hate crimes.\n\"This incident will not intimidate or deter us \u2013 on the contrary, it fuels our determination to stand even stronger against antisemitism and to protect and strengthen our community for generations to come,\" he said.\nStepheny Price is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.

According to video captured by attendees and a statement from the event\u2019s organizers, the Apollo 13 ride suffered a brief power failure around 1 a.m.\nEyewitness video circulated on TikTok showing riders suspended high above the ground, unable to move for roughly 20 minutes.\nOne TikTok user who filmed the scene called it \"mad,\" while another joked about the wind potentially shifting the ride mid-suspension.\nAMUSEMENT PARK RIDE SNAPS AT SAUDI ARABIA PARK, WITH 23 REPORTED INJURED\nAnother user who claimed to be on the ride said \"it was just freezing cold.\"\nThe Apollo 13 ride, which travels to festivals and fairs across the UK, is named after NASA\u2019s ill-fated 1970 space mission, when an oxygen tank in the spacecraft\u2019s Service Module exploded.\nThe attraction features a rotating arm and seats up to eight people, four on each end, swinging riders as high as 180 feet into the air. During the malfunction, up to four people were reportedly stuck in an inverted position.\nDespite the dramatic visuals, organizers insist that safety protocols worked exactly as intended.\n\"As a safety precaution, the ride automatically halted with people on board,\" a Boardmasters spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"The ride operator immediately responded and safely assisted all guests from the ride within 20 minutes.\"\nCALIFORNIA STUNTMAN CRASHES TO THE GROUND AS HUMAN CANNONBALL ACT GOES HORRIBLY WRONG, VIDEO SHOWS\n\"At no point were guests in any danger,\" the statement continued. \"The ride has since undergone a full safety check and resumed normal operation.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Apollo 13 ride launched in 2024, and its operators regularly post updates and behind-the-scenes maintenance work on its official Facebook page. A post from April outlined the rigorous checks performed before each event, including gear inspections, lighting fixes and greasing of pivot points.\nThe four-day festival is set to conclude on Sunday, August 10.\nStepheny Price is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.

      "text": "Editor\u2019s note: The following story contains graphic descriptions.\nRecently released police documents have shed new light on the final weeks of 10-year-old Rebekah Baptiste\u2019s life, revealing disturbing allegations of escalating abuse and multiple attempts to flee her living situation.\nThe 36-page report from the Navajo County Sheriff\u2019s Office outlines interviews with her father, Richard Baptiste, and his girlfriend, Anicia Woods, following the discovery of the unresponsive child on July 27.\nRebekah was later pronounced dead three days later at Phoenix Children\u2019s Hospital. Both adults are now facing charges of first-degree murder.\nDetectives say the family had been living off-grid in a rural campsite near Concho, Arizona, in a yurt without electricity or running water since relocating from Phoenix earlier in July. The family slept on thin mattresses on the yurt floor and hauled water in plastic jugs from a Concho convenience store 15 miles away.\nWoods initially claimed a neighbor found Rebekah unresponsive after she had run away. However, law enforcement noted this was not the first time the child had attempted to escape.\nRecords indicate Rebekah had previously jumped out of a window in Phoenix and made several other escape attempts after the move to Concho, the final one occurring on the day she was taken to the hospital.\nDespite Rebekah\u2019s visible deterioration, including being too weak to drink from a straw, Woods, who claimed she had a background in nursing, told authorities she believed the child \"would be fine\" and chose not to seek immediate medical help.\nWhen questioned, both Woods and Baptiste initially denied knowledge of what caused the child\u2019s condition, suggesting she may have been injured in a fall.\nHIKER DISAPPEARS FROM \u2018EDGE OF THE WORLD\u2019 CAMPGROUND ON TRIP WITH FATHER\nHowever, medical professionals found extensive signs of physical abuse, including a brain hemorrhage, burn marks, missing toenails and hair, and numerous cuts and bruises.\nWhen shown \"horrendous photos\" of his daughter\u2019s injuries, Baptiste \"lacked in expressing any emotion,\" one detective wrote in the probable\u2011cause affidavit.\n\"After seeing these photos, I knew there would be no way a father would not notice the extensive injuries on his daughter, it would be impossible in my mind, for a father not to see these huge marks and bruises on his child,\" the comment read.\nAccording to police, Baptiste later confessed to striking his daughter with a belt as punishment for running away, but denied causing the head injuries. Authorities also discovered bloody clothing in the tent the family shared, which had been changed before emergency services were contacted.\nFox News Digital reviewed the three 911 calls made by Woods on July 27. In the calls, Woods referred to Rebekah as her daughter and claimed she was providing rescue breaths, though her tone lacked urgency.\nIn one call, she told the dispatcher they were driving toward Holbrook, believing there was an EMS station there. The dispatcher instructed her to pull over, so medics could reach them.\nWhen asked if CPR was being administered, Woods said she was breathing into Rebekah\u2019s mouth but had not begun chest compressions. The dispatcher asked her to place the child on firm ground, but Woods hesitated, noting she was unsure about laying her on the rocks.\nEmergency crews arrived shortly afterward, but Rebekah did not survive her injuries.\nBoth Woods and Baptiste are now facing murder and child abuse charges related not only to Rebekah\u2019s death, but also to the alleged mistreatment of her two younger siblings.\nDuring interviews with investigators, Woods stated that a possible punishment for her might be \"some jail time,\" while Baptiste expressed remorse, saying he did not deserve to be a father.\nProsecutors have alleged that Rebekah suffered ongoing physical and sexual abuse.\nConcerns about the family\u2019s wellbeing had been raised multiple times by staff at Empower College Prep, where the children were enrolled, 12News reported.\nSchool officials reportedly contacted Arizona\u2019s Department of Child Safety (DCS) 13 times over the past two years, including one report from a school resource officer who visited the family\u2019s home following Rebekah\u2019s unexplained absence.\nDCS has since launched a review into whether the agency failed to adequately protect the child.\n\"Anytime a child in our community is harmed, it deeply affects us all, especially when we know the family,\" a statement from DCS to Fox News Digital read. \"Our dedicated staff work tirelessly to ensure the safety of all children, but tragically, those who intend to harm children can sometimes evade even the most robust systems designed to protect them.\"\nThe department added that it will \"continue to be transparent and release information related to this case\" as well as their involvement with the family as they are legally permitted to do so.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nGov. Katie Hobbs has also acknowledged the growing public concern and pledged to fully investigate the case.\n\"First, let me say this is obviously a very tragic situation, and we are certainly looking into what happened,\" Hobbs previously told 12News. \"The information we had at the agency prior to this case and what led up to her death, we're certainly going to be investigating, and if there was something that we did not do right, we will do everything we can to correct that. That is our job. It is our responsibility to ensure Arizonans are safe and we'll fix what went wrong. If that's the case.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Hobbs' office and Empower College Prep for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.\nStepheny Price is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.

      "text": "The South Carolina Attorney General's Office has officially submitted its response to Alex Murdaugh\u2019s appeal challenging his convictions for the murders of his wife and son.\nIn a 182-page brief filed before the Aug. 8 deadline, Attorney General Alan Wilson\u2019s office dismantles Murdaugh\u2019s December appeal, which claims that Colleton County Clerk of Court Becky Hill swayed jurors to boost sales of her forthcoming book.\nThe filing is the State\u2019s first full rebuttal to Murdaugh\u2019s bid for a new trial.\nIn the filing, obtained by Greenville News, prosecutors argued that the jury found Murdaugh guilty based on the \"overwhelming\" evidence, not because of Hill\u2019s brief and \"foolish\" comments about his testimony.\nNEW TEXT MESSAGES FUEL ALEX MURDAUGH'S PUSH FOR NEW TRIAL\nProsecutors also said Murdaugh forfeited the right to challenge the financial crimes evidence by not appealing the trial court\u2019s decision to admit it.\nWilson\u2019s team had initially requested more time to reply, citing the complexity and size of the case, including a 6,000-page trial transcript and significant evidence that needed review.\nDick Harpootlian, a Columbia attorney and former state senator who led Murdaugh\u2019s defense, previously told Fox News Digital that Hill\u2019s conduct compromised the trial. According to Harpootlian, Hill's actions potentially cost Murdaugh a fair verdict.\n\"If she had left the jury alone, clearly the worst we would have done was a mistrial,\" Harpootlian said, adding that two jurors would have voted differently if not for Hill\u2019s influence.\nThe defense also disputed that the jury should not have heard evidence related to Murdaugh\u2019s financial misconduct.\nALEX MURDAUGH TRIAL: EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON POSSIBILITY OF AN OVERTURNED MURDER CONVICTION\nThe disgraced attorney was convicted in March 2023 of the murders of his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul, who were fatally shot on June 7, 2021, at the family\u2019s hunting property in Colleton County. He was also found guilty of two weapons charges related to the killings.\nMurdaugh\u2019s team has 30 days to answer the attorney general\u2019s brief. Once both sides finish, the state Supreme Court will set oral arguments, likely later this fall, with a decision expected next spring.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMurdaugh, 56, who continues to maintain his innocence, is serving two consecutive life terms in state prison.\nFox News Digital reached out to Wilson's office, but did not receive a response.\nFox News Digital's Sarah Rumpf-Whitten and Peter D'Abrsosca contributed to this report.\nStepheny Price is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.
