  "description": "President Donald Trump took partial credit for first lady Melania Trump's recent legal actions after her feud with Hunter Biden escalated on Thursday, Aug. 14. Melania threatened to sue Biden for $1 billion after he repeated a disputed claim about her and Jeffrey Epstein, but Biden shrugged it off",
  "content": "President Donald Trump took partial credit for first lady Melania Trump 's recent legal actions after her feud with Hunter Biden escalated on Thursday, Aug. 14.\n\nIn a conversation with Fox News' Brian Kilmeade , the president was asked about Melania's decision to threaten Biden with a $1 billion lawsuit after he repeated disputed claims that Jeffrey Epstein was the person who initially introduced the first couple.\n\n\"Was that the right thing to do?\" Kilmeade, 61, asked Donald, 79, during Thursday's broadcast of , emphasizing the large dollar amount.\n\nThe president responded by claiming that he was the one who encouraged Melania, 55, to \"go forward with it,\" citing how he's \"done pretty well\" with his own recent lawsuits .\n\n\"I told her, \u2018Let\u2019s go ahead and do it,' \" Donald said, adding, \"I let her use my lawyers.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Aug. 12, Fox News broke the news that a lawyer for Melania had sent a letter to Biden demanding a full retraction of an interview he did with Andrew Callaghan that was posted to YouTube a week earlier. In the interview, Biden repeats a biographer's allegation that Epstein introduced Melania to her future husband, which conflicts with how the Trumps said they first met.\n\nMelania previously wrote in her self-titled memoir, which was released in October 2024, that she met Donald at the Kit Kat Klub in New York City in 1998 while he was on a date with another woman.\n\n\"These false, disparaging, defamatory, and inflammatory statements are extremely salacious and have been widely disseminated throughout various digital mediums,\" Trump attorney Alejandro Brito wrote in the letter, which was obtained by Fox, about Biden's Epstein comments.\n\n\"Indeed, the video has since been re-published by various media outlets, journalists, and political commentators with millions of social media followers that have disseminated the false and defamatory statements therein to tens of millions of people worldwide,\" Brito continued.\n\nMelania and Brito demanded that Biden, 55, \"immediately retract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements made about Mrs. Trump.\" If he failed to comply, the letter continued, the first lady planned to sue the former first son for $1 billion in order to overcome \"overwhelming financial and reputational harm.\"\n\nMelania's letter gave Biden until Aug. 7 to comply with their demands for not just a retraction of the video, but an apology. Rather than apologize, Biden went back on Callaghan's show on Thursday morning \u2014 days after the first lady's deadline \u2014 and said, \"F--- that. That's not gonna happen.\"\n\n\"I don't think that these threats of a lawsuit add up to anything other than a distraction because it's not about who introduced whom to whom,\" Biden told Callaghan. \"I don't know how that, in any way, rises to the level of defamation to begin with.\"\n\n\"I also think they're bullies,\" Biden added of the Trumps and their legal team, \"and they think that a billion dollars is going to scare me. The fact of the matter is that... if they want to sit down for a deposition and clarify the nature of the relationship between Jeffrey Epstein, if the president and the first lady want to do that, and all of the known associates around them at the time that they met, I'm more than happy to provide them the platform to be able to do it.\"\n\nMelania and Brito did proactively call out Trump biographer Michael Wolff as the source of Biden's claim in their letter, referring to the author as a \"serial fabulist... whose lies were published by The Daily Beast.\"\n\nLast month, the Daily Beast published a story titled \"Melania Trump \u2018very involved\u2019 in Epstein Scandal: Author,\" which cited Wolff in making claims similar to Biden's. After being threatened with legal repercussions, the outlet deleted the story in its entirety .\n\nPolitical analyst James Carville also recently issued an apology to the first lady after making similar claims on his podcast last week and promptly hearing from Melania's lawyers.\n\n Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer. \n\nPEOPLE has reached out to lawyers for both Melania and Biden for further comment, and asked Callaghan whether he plans to take down the Biden interview that prompted the legal threat.\n\nThe first lady's spokesperson, Nick Clemens, shared a statement with PEOPLE that read: \"First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s attorneys are actively ensuring immediate retractions and apologies by those who spread malicious, defamatory falsehoods. The true account of how the First Lady met President Trump is in her best-selling book, Melania .\"\n\nSpeaking to Kilmeade on Thursday, the president said, \"Jeffrey Epstein had nothing to do with Melania, and introducing ... I mean I can tell you how it was, and it was another person actually. I did meet through another person, but it wasn\u2019t Jeffrey Epstein.\"",

She has been an entertainment and political journalist for more than a decade, previously working for Entertainment Tonight, VICE and Al Jazeera America. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on July 8, 2025 05:16PM EDT 18 Comments NEED TO KNOW Donald Trump snapped at a reporter for asking a question about Jeffrey Epstein on Tuesday, July 8\"Are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable,\" the president saidThe question came just a day after the FBI and DOJ released a joint memo claiming the long-rumored Epstein \"client list\" never existed President Donald Trump seemed shocked by a reporter's questions about Jeffrey Epstein just one day after the release of an FBI memo that reignited major discourse about the late billionaire. Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi took questions during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, July 8, the day after the FBI and Department of Justice released a joint memo saying their investigation into Epstein's alleged crimes and subsequent death was complete. The memo also stated the investigation found that Epstein's long-rumored \"client list\" did not exist. When one reporter asked a multi-part question about Epstein and the memo, Bondi began to answer, before an incredulous Trump asked to interrupt the attorney general to offer his own reply. \u201cAre you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?\" the president asked, according to ABC News. \"This guy\u2019s been talked about for years ... are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable.\" Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein. MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images; Neil Rasmus/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images Trump then asked Bondi if she wanted to \"waste the time\" addressing the reporter's question about the alleged sex trafficker as he continued, \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re asking a question on Epstein at a time like this, where we\u2019re having some of the greatest success and also tragedy, with what happened in Texas. It just seems like a desecration.\" When he turned his attention back to Bondi, she told the reporter, \u201cIn February, I did an interview on Fox, and it\u2019s been getting a lot of attention because I said \u2014 I was asked a question about the client list, and my response was, \u2018It\u2019s sitting on my desk to be reviewed.\u2019 \" However, Bondi clarified that at the time, she simply meant that she had a file on Epstein on her desk, not an actual client list. As for the tens of thousands of images and videos that the memo references being seized in relation to the Epstein case, Bondi said those \"turned out to be child porn downloaded by that disgusting Jeffrey Epstein,\" adding that they are \u201cnever going to be released.\u201d Jeffery Epstein was arrested on July 6, 2019. Just over a month later, he died in prison. Kypros/Getty In February, Bondi did follow through with a promise to release Epstein's flight logs, in which Trump's name appeared a total of seven times. Three of those dates had \"JE\" (Jeff Epstein) listed on the same flights as Trump. The appearance of a person\u2019s name on the flight logs, however, is not necessarily an indication of wrongdoing; most of the individuals listed were presumably on Epstein\u2019s plane for legitimate business, political or social reasons.

Elon Musk Calls It 'the Final Straw' Elon Musk Deletes His Explosive Donald Trump Claim Tied to Jeffrey Epstein amid Their Public Feud Public interest in Trump's history with Epstein dates back to the alleged trafficker's arrest, but there was a resurgence following Elon Musk's departure from the White House on May 30. The former head of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency immediately started burning bridges following the end of his government contract, with public criticism of the president and his policies. In a scathing rant on X (which has since been deleted), Musk criticized the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein records. \"Time to drop the really big bomb,\" Musk posted in June. \"@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.\" Musk later removed the post and walked back his remarks, saying some of his comments \"went too far.\" Donald Trump and Elon Musk speak in the Oval Office on March 14, 2025.

      "text": "The Daily Beast has pulled an article detailing allegations by journalist Michael Wolff that Melania Trump was introduced to her husband Donald Trump via a modeling agent connected to Jeffrey Epstein, after a challenge from the first lady\u2019s lawyers.\n\"Editor\u2019s Note. After this story was published, The Beast received a letter from First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s attorney challenging the headline and framing of the article. After reviewing the matter, the Beast has taken down the article and apologizes for any confusion or misunderstanding,\" The Daily Beast posted in place of the article. The url for the article appears to have been amended to remove the original headline and now reads: thedailybeast.com/epstein-this-story-has-been-removed.\nWolff initially made the scandalous allegations in an interview with Daily Beast chief content officer Joanna Coles for The Daily Beast Podcast, Saturday. The two were discussing Trump\u2019s alleged connections with the disgraced New York financier. The two were friends for many years, but ultimately had a falling out. The president claimed Tuesday that Epstein had been stealing staff from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan prison while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking of minors charges. Wolff claimed Melania was \"very involved in this Epstein relationship.\"\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN THROWN OUT OF MAR-A-LAGO FOR HIRING THE HELP: TRUMP\n\"[Melania] was very involved in this Epstein relationship. There is this model thing, and she\u2019s introduced by a model agent, both of whom Trump and Epstein are involved with. She\u2019s introduced to Trump that way, Epstein knows her well,\" Wolff alleged.\nPresident Trump has been dogged by demands by his MAGA base to release the so-called \"Epstein files\" after a series of missteps by his Attorney General, Pam Bondi. Bondi had distributed binders labeled \"Epstein Files: Phase One\" to a handful of conservative influencers in February. The binders failed to include any heretofore unknown details surrounding the case \u2013 which has been a magnet for unfounded conspiracy theories alleging that Epstein was an intelligence agent sexually blackmailing America\u2019s most powerful figures whose death wasn\u2019t actually a suicide \u2013 which caused an outcry among the president\u2019s most online supporters.\nBondi subsequently made comments that some interpreted to mean an Epstein client list was \"sitting\" on her desk, though she later clarified in June that she was referring to the Epstein file, not a \"client list.\" The DOJ ultimately released a two-page memo that denied a \"client list\" existed and claimed there was no \"credible evidence\" Epstein had blackmailed other individuals via his sex trafficking activities. The DOJ memo failed to quell the furor in Trump\u2019s base for greater transparency in the Epstein case, prompting Trump\u2019s ire.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nTrump has disavowed his supporters who remain fixated on the Epstein scandal, labeling them \"weaklings\" who are buying into a \"hoax\" orchestrated by the Democrats.\n\"Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this \u2018bullshit,\u2019 hook, line, and sinker, they haven\u2019t learned their lesson, and probably never will, even after being conned by the Lunatic Left for 8 long years,\" Trump wrote on TruthSocial.\nWolff\u2019s credibility in the journalism industry has faced scrutiny. In 2018, the journalist told Bill Maher he had evidence that President Trump was having an affair and claimed that a clue to his mistress\u2019 identity could be found at the end of his White House tell-all \"Fire and Fury.\" Readers identified passages that seemed to implicate then-UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. Haley called the insinuation \"disgusting\" and \"highly offensive.\"\nIn a subsequent interview on \"Morning Joe,\" Wolff denied that he ever insinuated Haley was having an affair with Trump, but then said he \"found it puzzling that she would deny something she was not accused of,\" prompting co-host Mika Brzezinski to accuse him of \"having fun\u2026 slurring a woman\" and end the interview abruptly. Multiple figures in Trump\u2019s orbit also denied having made quotes attributed to them in \"Fire and Fury.\"\n\"The scenes in his columns aren\u2019t recreated so much as created \u2014 springing from Wolff\u2019s imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events,\" Michell Cottle wrote of Wolff\u2019s reporting style in a profile in the New Republic.\nMichael Wolff told Fox News Digital that he had nothing to do with the article.\nThe Daily Beast and the White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

Everything to Know About the Classified Documents Related to Jeffrey Epstein's Criminal History While much of the Epstein files remain sealed, several high-profile people have been named in some of the released documents By Jordana Comiter Jordana Comiter Jordana Comiter is an Associate Editor on the Evergreen team at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2024. Her work has previously appeared in Women\u2019s Health Magazine, PopSugar, VeryWell Mind, Business Insider and The Chicago Reader. People Editorial Guidelines Published on July 30, 2025 04:13PM EDT Leave a Comment Jeffrey Epstein. Credit : AP/Shutterstock NEED TO KNOW Jeffrey Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on accusations that he sexually abused girls as young as 14 years oldOne month later, the registered sex offender died by suicide while awaiting trialOver five years after his death, the public continues to push for the release of the documents related to the sex offender's criminal cases, otherwise known as the Epstein files The public desire for the Epstein files to be released remains as strong as ever. Between 2008 and 2019, dozens of women stepped forward accusing Jeffrey Epstein of sexual abuse. His crimes reached a turning point in July 2019 when he was arrested and charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors. But one month later, the disgraced financier and registered sex offender died by suicide while awaiting trial on federal conspiracy and sex trafficking charges. Though his case was dismissed three weeks after his suicide, questions surrounding Epstein\u2019s criminal history \u2014 and what surfaced during years of investigations \u2014 continue to grow as the public pushes for the Epstein files to be released. In mid-July, members of the U.S. House Rules Committee voted down an amendment that would have allowed members of Congress to vote on whether or not the files should be released to the public, per The Guardian. The following day, President Donald Trump, who during his 2024 campaign vowed to consider releasing the documents, posted on Truth Social that the files are a \"hoax\" perpetrated by the Democratic Party. \u201cTheir new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'b-------,' hook, line, and sinker,\u201d Trump wrote, criticizing those who have called for him to release more evidence related to Epstein's sex-trafficking cases. The president was linked to Epstein for several years, but has claimed their friendship ended before Epstein's 2006 indictment for soliciting prostitution. From who has been named in the documents to what's been released, here's everything to know about the Epstein files. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein rose to prominence as a financier who surrounded himself with high-profile celebrities, public figures and socialites before his criminal activity came to light. His legal troubles date back to 2008, when he pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting a person under 18 for prostitution. Although PEOPLE confirmed he was sentenced to 13 months in jail, his plea deal allowed him to serve much of the time in work release at his office. In the aftermath, Epstein was required to register as a sex offender. Fast forward to July 2019, new accusations surfaced that led to Epstein's arrest for allegedly sex-trafficking girls as young as 14 years old. According to a federal indictment unsealed at the time, he \u201csexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes.\u201d The disgraced financier was charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors, for which he pleaded not guilty, and would have faced a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison if convicted. However, one month later, he died by suicide in a New York City jail. What are the Epstein files? US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman announces charges against Jeffery Epstein on July 8, 2019, in New York City. Stephanie Keith/Getty Epstein's two criminal investigations \u2014 which occurred nearly a decade apart \u2014 amassed a large amount of documents, ranging from interviews with victims and witnesses to items confiscated from raids of his various properties. In addition to his cases, there was a separate investigation into his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to traffic girls for sex and is currently serving a 20-year sentence. Related Stories Where Is Ghislaine Maxwell Now? What to Know About the Epstein Accomplice\u2019s Life in Prison (and Attempts to Be Freed) Who Is Prince Andrew? What to Know About the Disgraced Royal \u2014 And Where He Stands in the Royal Family Now Per the Wall Street Journal, the federal government has a \"truckload\" of documents \u2014 now known as \"the Epstein files\" \u2014 that are from or about Epstein and his criminal cases. What has been released in the Epstein files? Though the files haven't been released in their entirety, some information has been unsealed in recent years. In February 2025, the Department of Justice and the FBI released what was described as the \"first phrase of the declassified Epstein files.\" The day before they were released, Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News they consisted of \"a lot of flight logs, a lot of names, a lot of information,\" adding that \"it's pretty sick what that man did, along with his co-defendant.\" The first materials released included flight logs, an evidence list, redacted pages from a contact book and redacted pages of a masseuse list, though someone being listed in the flight logs was not an indication of wrongdoing, as many of them were presumably on Epstein's plane for business, political or social reasons. PEOPLE reviewed the flight logs and found that Trump's name was listed a total of seven times. Additionally, per an itemized list from the Department of Justice, the documents include photos, cameras, computers, hard drives and more, including one CD labeled \"girl pics nude book 4.\" Who has been named in the Epstein files? Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Joe Schildhorn/Patrick McMullan via Getty The files don't solely contain allegations related to Epstein, as many high-profile people who were allegedly in his inner circle have been named in the documents. In January 2024, court filings were unsealed that showed Prince Andrew \u2014 one of Epstein's former friends \u2014 had been named. Per the court documents, a woman who said she was one of Epstein's victims alleged in a 2016 deposition that Andrew had groped her breast at Epstein's N.Y.C. home in 2001. In the aftermath, Andrew denied any wrongdoing, and Buckingham Palace had no comment at the time. Virginia Giuffre \u2014 who died by suicide in April 2025 \u2014 also alleged that she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions when she was 17 years old. Lawyers for Prince Andrew released a statement in 2022 following a settlement with Giuffre, saying, \"Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others.\" Meanwhile, former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz was also named in the documents. A motion filed on behalf of Jane Doe #3 claimed that Epstein forced the minor to \"have sexual relationships\" with Dershowitz, who was a \"close friend of Epstein's and a well-known criminal defense attorney.\" The motion further claimed that Dershowitz was an \"eye-witness to the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators,\" on top of playing \"a significant role\" during later negotiations on Epstein's behalf. Dershowitz released a statement to PEOPLE at the time, saying, \"The documents prove my innocence. The woman who initially accused me subsequently stated that she may have misidentified me and she withdrew her law suit against me. I hope that all the documents are released as i have always urged.\" Jane Doe #3's motion also mentions Jean Luc Brunel, a French model agent in Epstein's \"inner circle of friends\" who died in prison in February 2022. Per the documents, Brunel would allegedly \"bring young girls (ranging to ages young as twelve) to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends, especially Epstein.\" In addition to Andrew and Dershowitz, magician David Copperfield, French celebrity hairstylist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fekkai and music icon Michael Jackson were among the names mentioned in the unsealed court documents, though they were not accused of misconduct. Bill Clinton was also briefly mentioned in the files, as one court document showed an alleged victim of Epstein claimed that the late financier once told her the former president \"likes them young, referring to girls.\" In response, Angel Ure\u00f1a, the former president's spokesperson at the time, posted on X that Clinton \"knows nothing\" about Epstein's \"terrible crimes.\" Ure\u00f1a also told PEOPLE that although he is mentioned in the documents, he has not been accused of wrongdoing. More recently, in July 2025, reports surfaced that Trump was allegedly told by the Department of Justice that he appeared in the Epstein files \"multiple times,\" according to the Wall Street Journal. Per the outlet, Trump was given the information during a May meeting with Bondi and her deputy. When asked about the matter, Trump denied having been told by his attorney general that his name was in the files. In response to his answer contradicting what the Wall Street Journal had reported, White House communications director Steven Cheung told the outlet, \u201cThis is another fake news story, just like the previous story by The Wall Street Journal.\" Why haven't the Epstein files been released in their entirety? In July 2025, the Justice Department issued a memo stating it would not publicly release additional documents related to the Epstein case. The memo also said investigators found no evidence that Epstein maintained a client list or blackmailed his associates. However, the news came on the heels of Bondi telling Fox News in February that Epstein's reputed client list was \"sitting on my desk,\" awaiting review.

Though the Fox & Friends host, 60, has been a longtime supporter of the president, he recently vocalized his disagreement with Trump's approach to peace negotiations in Eastern Europe, which have seemingly distanced the United States from Ukraine and appeared to favor Russia. In a post to X on March 3, the Fox News anchor urged his followers not to forget Russia's aggressive role in the conflict. \"Can we all remember [Vladimir Putin] is the bad guy,\" Kilmeade wrote, tagging the Kremlin. \"They invaded \u2014 they kidnap kids.\" \"Whatever happens \u2014 Ukraine can not lose,\" he continued. \"Eastern Europe will be next.\" Donald Trump Caught on Hot Mic Telling Fox News Host to Praise His First Cabinet Meeting: 'Say We Did a Good Job' Kilmeade's comments come days after a tense White House meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The 93-year-old journalist, who had an iconic run on the CBS Evening News and frequently appeared on 60 Minutes, spoke out on Wednesday, July 2, following the news that Paramount had agreed to pay several million dollars to settle a lawsuit with the president. Trump sued CBS News and accused them of deceptively editing former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign trail appearance on 60 Minutes, according to reporting by Reuters. After months of back and forth, Paramount agreed on Wednesday to pay $16 million to Trump's future presidential library. The lawsuit initially sought $10 billion in damages, and brought grave concerns about the precedent Paramount would set for all media companies if it ultimately gave into Trump's demands. Notably, a representative for Paramount told Reuters in a statement that \"the settlement does not include a statement of apology or regret.\" Dan Rather anchors his last 'CBS Evening News' broadcast on March 9, 2005.

  "argos_summary": "Melania Trump is threatening to sue Hunter Biden for $1 billion over comments he made in a recent interview, where he claimed that Jeffrey Epstein introduced her to Donald Trump. Melania's attorney sent a cease-and-desist letter demanding a retraction and apology from Biden, who responded defiantly, stating he would not comply.
