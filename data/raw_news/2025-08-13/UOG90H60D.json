  "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nTo effectively tackle a variety of real-world tasks, robots should be able to reliably grasp objects of different shapes, textures and sizes, without dropping them in undesired locations. Conventional approaches to enhancing the ability of robots to grasp objects work by tightening the grip of a robotic hand to prevent objects from slipping.\n\nResearchers at the University of Lincoln, Toshiba Europe's Cambridge Research Laboratory, the University of Surrey, Arizona State University and KAIST recently introduced alternative computational strategies for preventing the slip of objects grasped by a robotic hand, which works by modulating the trajectories that a robotic hand follows while performing manipulative movements. Their approach, consisting of a robotic controller and a new bio-inspired predictive trajectory modulation strategy, was presented in a paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence.\n\n\"The inspiration for this paper came from a very human experience,\" Amir Ghalamzan, senior author of the paper, told Tech Xplore.\n\n\"When you carry a fragile or slippery object and feel it beginning to slip, you don't just squeeze harder. Instead, you subtly adjust your movements\u2014slowing down, tilting, or repositioning your hand\u2014to keep hold of it. Robots, however, have historically just relied on increasing grip force to prevent slipping, which doesn't always work and can even damage delicate objects. We aimed to investigate whether we could train robots to behave more like humans in these scenarios.\"\n\nThe main objective of the recent study by Ghalamzan and his colleagues was to develop a controller that can predict when an object might slip from a robot's grasp and adjust its movements accordingly to prevent it from slipping, similarly to how humans might adjust their movements when handling objects. The controller they developed relies on a bio-inspired trajectory modulation strategy that complements conventional techniques to modulate the force of a robot's grip, enabling more dexterous manipulation strategies.\n\n\"Our approach mimics how humans use internal models to interact with the world,\" explained Ghalamzan. \"Just as the human brain continuously predicts the outcomes of our actions\u2014like whether a glass might slip if we move too fast\u2014we built a data-driven internal model, or 'world model,' that allows a robot to predict the future tactile sensations it will experience. These predictions are then used to detect slip instances and adjust movements in such a way that no slip instance will occur.\"\n\nThe team's controller allows robots to slow down, change direction and adapt to the position and orientation of their hands in real-time, instead of simply squeezing harder on objects to prevent them from slipping. This alternative strategy for securing objects by altering a robot's movements could help to reduce the risk that fragile objects will break when a robot is handling them. The trajectory modulation approach also works in instances where the force of a robot's grip cannot be altered, enabling more fluid and smarter interactions with a broad range of objects.\n\n\"Our study presents two key breakthroughs,\" said Ghalamzan. \"The first is a motion-based slip controller that is the first of its kind. This strategy complements grip-force-based control and is especially valuable when increasing grip force isn't feasible\u2014such as with fragile objects, wet or slippery surfaces, or hardware that doesn't support dynamic grip control.\n\n\"The second is a predictive controller powered by a learned tactile forward model (i.e., world model), which enables robots to forecast slip based on their planned actions.\"\n\nThe newly developed controller was used to plan the motions of a robotic gripper and tested in dynamic, unstructured environments. Notably, it was found to significantly improve the stability of a robot's grasp in some cases, outperforming conventional controllers that work by solely adapting the force of a robot's grip.\n\n\"Embedding such a model into a predictive control loop has traditionally been too computationally demanding,\" said Ghalamzan. \"Our study shows that it's not only feasible, but also effective.\"\n\nThe recent work by this team of researchers could contribute to the advancement of robotic systems, enabling them to safely handle various physical and potentially also social interactions utilizing a world model. This might allow robots, for instance, to handle different objects in a wide range of real-world settings, including household environments, manufacturing sites and health care facilities.\n\n\"We are actively working to make our predictive controller faster and more efficient, so it can be deployed in even more demanding real-time settings,\" added Ghalamzan. \"This includes exploring different architectural and algorithmic techniques to reduce computational overhead.\"\n\nAs part of their next studies, the researchers are also expanding their system to support more advanced and complex object manipulation tasks, including the handling of deformable objects or items that need to be manipulated with two hands. Eventually, they also plan to combine their approach with computer vision algorithms, which would allow their approach to plan trajectories for robots based on both tactile and visual information.\n\n\"Another important direction is improving the verifiability and explainability of these learned models,\" added Ghalamzan. \"As we move toward more intelligent and autonomous systems, it's critical that humans can understand and trust how robots make decisions. Our long-term vision is to develop predictive controllers that are not only effective but also transparent and safe for deployment in the real world.\"",

      "text": "Abstract\nEnsuring a stable grasp during robotic manipulation is essential for dexterous and reliable performance. Traditionally, slip control has relied on grip force modulation. Here we show that trajectory modulation provides an effective alternative for slip prevention in certain robotic manipulation tasks. We develop and compare a slip control policy based on trajectory modulation with a conventional grip-force-based approach. Our results demonstrate that trajectory modulation can significantly outperform grip force control in specific scenarios, highlighting its potential as a robust slip control strategy. Furthermore, we show that, similar to humans, incorporating a data-driven action-conditioned forward model within a model predictive control framework is key to optimizing trajectory modulation for slip prevention. These findings introduce a predictive control framework leveraging trajectory adaptation, offering a new perspective on slip mitigation. This approach enhances grasp stability in dynamic and unstructured environments, improving the adaptability of robotic systems across various applications.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nMain\nSlippage of objects (we call it \u2018slip\u2019) during robotic manipulation tasks can result in instability and task failure1,2. Robotic systems are still far behind human-level dexterity in handling slip3. Improving slip controllers can be attributed to enhancing tactile sensors4,5,6 for reliable slip detection7,8,9 and intelligent control strategies for slip prevention10. In this study, we focus on the latter and present a bioinspired11 approach for slip control. Current slip controllers primarily rely on increasing grip force in response to detected slip events10. However, it is still unclear whether grip force modulation is the only means of slip control. Inspired by the inherent dynamics of slip events indicating rapid adjustments in motion trajectories can stabilize the physical interaction12,13 and findings in ref. 11 showing humans deploy hand acceleration adaptation besides grip force modulation for slip prevention, we explore the effectiveness of trajectory modulation as an alternative control policy in robotic pick-and-place tasks where grip force control is not always possible or effective. The code can be found at https://github.com/imanlab/bgf, and our dataset and other information are available at https://proactive-control.github.io/.\nGrip force control in robotics (based on detected14,15,16,17,18,19 or predicted10 slip instances) is inspired by neurophysiological studies on humans\u2019 control policies (for example, refs. 20,21,22). These studies have shown that humans optimally adjust the grip force to be slightly larger than the required amount for preventing object slip. However, grip force control may not be effective or possible in many robotic scenarios, for example, when the maximum grip force is already applied23 or when handling delicate objects24. Moreover, many robotic architectures do not permit real-time grip force control, for example, the Franka Emika arm25. Hence, our hypothesis involves a robot controller using hand trajectory modulation that can be as effective in preventing object slip as a controller using grip force modulation.\nWe introduce a predictive trajectory modulation approach for slip control, which dynamically adjusts planned motions in real time to prevent anticipated slippage during robotic manipulation tasks, with supplementary insights from human studies11. Although our results show that reactive trajectory modulation reduces slip instances, it is suggested that humans\u2019 dexterity is owed to a predictive control system relying on internal forward models26,27. Forward models (Fig. 1) are thought to enable the prediction of sensory consequences of motor actions and allow bypassing unavoidable delays due to latency associated with sensorimotor loops27,28,29,30, whereas the motor cortex defines optimal actions to achieve the task goal31. Hence, our next hypothesis is to test whether a predictive controller can yield better performance in slip control. Learning a forward model in physical robot interaction with the high-dimensional state space32,33 is challenging and has limited the robotic systems to benefit from predictive controllers in cases such as slip prevention.\nWe, therefore, proposed a six-dimensional proactive control for trajectory modulation to avoid slip, relying on a learned tactile forward model that predicts slip instances within a prediction horizon.\nA predictive controller adjusts the reference trajectory based on a predicted slip signal to minimize the likelihood of future slips. This extends our previous one-dimensional controller34 to a six-dimensional velocity controller and leverages our state-of-the-art action-conditioned tactile prediction (ACTP) model35 for slip prediction. Proactive control closes the control loop with the predicted system states and outperforms current reactive grip force controllers by achieving a smaller likelihood of slip control failure. Proactive slip control also benefits from a slip classification on the ACTP prediction signals, making it superior to that of a simple long short-term memory (LSTM)-based classification34, contributing to the improved performance of the proactive controller.\nWe conducted a series of experiments using the Franka Emika arm to demonstrate the effectiveness of reference trajectory modulation. We implemented and tested both reactive and proactive controls. Our experiments include a variety of objects, trajectory classes and robotic manipulation tasks, in which slip may cause task failures. Our results show that trajectory modulation is effective in controlling slip where grip force control is not either possible or sufficiently effective in robotic manipulation. We evaluated the generalization capabilities of proactive control for trajectory modulation. We observed the controller generalizes well to unseen object classes, robot trajectories and motion start/end poses.\nOur contribution is manifold: we propose a robotic slip control approach that utilizes reference trajectory modulation. Inspired by the proactive control strategy used by humans36,11, we introduce a proactive control framework that uses a forward model to predict slip incidents and ensure task success in physically interactive scenarios. The proposed approach offers a substantial improvement over current slip control methods.\nResults\nWe aimed to explore the role of trajectory modulation in slip control. Our predictive control strategy uses a forward model, in contrast to the reactive grip force control that is commonly used in robotics, to predict the consequence of its action and select future trajectory points, yielding no slip during manipulative movements. Our findings in our previous study11 indicate that humans rely on trajectory modulation, when grip force control is insufficient, for slip control. This insight motivated the development of our proactive control policy that modulates trajectories to prevent slip. Ref. 11 demonstrates that participants use hand acceleration modulation as a strategy to minimize task completion time and prevent slip occurrences. Building on this insight, we have developed a slip control approach for robotic manipulation. This innovative method involves optimizing the robot\u2019s predetermined trajectory through the application of its tactile forward model, directly addressing our second hypothesis and representing a notable advancement in the field of robotic slip control.\nTrajectory modulation for object slip control\nHypothesis\nA robot controller using reference trajectory modulation can be effective in slip control: we attached a pair of uSkin37 tactile sensors to Franka Emika robotic arm\u2019s fingers for closing the loop for trajectory modulation. Our proactive controller involves lifting an object from a top grasp pose by a parallel gripper and moving it to the target pose by modulating a given reference trajectory. Object slip is predicted in real time within a specified prediction window using a tactile forward model. The trajectory optimization pipeline (Fig. 2) then leverages these predicted slip values to learn how to dynamically adjust the Cartesian reference trajectory, thereby minimizing the likelihood of future slip events. If the tactile forward model does not predict a positive slip event during the trial, the predefined reference trajectory will be executed without modification. Figure 3 shows the robot Cartesian-space acceleration for a linear movement from (0.4, \u20130.3, 0.3) to (0.1, 0.25, 0.3) in the robot base frame (Table 1). This result obtained with the Domino object, which is a sample object from our test objects set (see the list of ten objects used for training and three objects used for testing the tactile forward model, namely, the train object set and test object set; Table 2). The object\u2019s in-hand pose is measured using a wrist-mounted Intel RealSense camera and a visual marker attached to the object. The threshold for switching the contact state from stick to rotational slip was chosen as 6\u00b0. The small deformation of the tactile sensor taxels allowed <6\u00b0 object rotation without slip.\nWe show the results of trajectory modulation for three reference velocity trajectories (Fig. 3): trapezoid (panel a), cubic (panel c) and quintic (panel e), and the object rotation achieved by the proactive controller in panels b, d and f, respectively. For each test case, we repeated each task execution five times. Variations are due to the nonlinear nature of the slip, variability in initial contact and stochastic nature of the forward model used in our proactive controller. The onset of the predicted slip is shown with a green-shaded band in Fig. 3a,c,e. This shows that the proactive controller effectively controls slips regardless of the onset time and nature. Figure 3b,d,f shows the object rotation (blue line) without the proactive controller where the reference trajectory is executed without modulation.\nThe data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the object rotations obtained by proactive control are significantly smaller than those obtained with the open-loop controller and remain within the set slip boundaries. These achievements can be attributed to the deviations of the generated trajectories from the reference trajectory. Proactive control can effectively minimize slip incidents by modulating the robot\u2019s trajectory despite a constant grip force applied, which is within a safety margin for forming a stable grasp and lifting the object. These are in agreement with the human slip control strategy presented in ref. 11.\nThe rows showing the mean value for DRT (Table 2) explain that the deviation from the reference trajectory remains comparatively close between the train and test objects, illustrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach in generalizing to unseen objects during training. Nonetheless, the ROV has an 8% increase for the test objects compared with the train set objects, showing that a reach object set (representing a variety of object classes) can enhance the performance.\nWe also tested the proactive control in three classes of manipulative movements, each with a varying number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) and quantitatively compared its results with a baseline slip control model, that is, a reactive grip force control with an MHZ2 SMC gripper. For each motion class, we fix a few DOFs in Cartesian space and generate a reference trajectory for the remaining DOFs to set the robot\u2019s velocity. This allows us to examine the relationship between specific movements and slip instances. We focus on test movements relevant to common pick-and-place tasks, including linear motions in a horizontal plane (TM-1), motions in a horizontal plane with wrist rotation (TM-2) and lifting motions in a vertical plane by moving an object up and down (TM-3).\nAs a baseline, we use a reactive (grip force) control, which is the common approach in the literature, using the MHZ2 SMC gripper to modulate the grip force in real time. By attaching uSkin sensors to the fingers, we created a setup that is comparable with one with the default Franka Emika gripper, which cannot be controlled in real time. The grip force slip control method is a reactive control system that tightens the grip whenever a positive slip signal is detected. We repeated each test case ten times and report the mean and standard deviation for each performance metric. Table 1 presents the average performance of reactive control for test objects set on various reference trajectories and classes of motion. Both RTS and MOR values in Table 1 indicate that the trapezoid reference trajectory is the most challenging for controlling the slip in all three classes of test motions. This is due to the jerk in the phase of switching from linear to constant velocity and vice versa. Although the quintic reference has the lowest RTS in all test motions, the cubic reference has the smallest MOR in TM-2. This table shows that the average MOR for reactive grip force control is 11.51\u00b0, which is 5.51\u00b0 larger than the slip threshold. We conduct the same test cases for our proposed proactive controller and present the results in Table 1. On the basis of RTS and MOR values, similar to reactive control, the trapezoid reference trajectory is the most challenging for proactive control for slip avoidance. However, proactive control showed notable improvement for both metrics in each test motion with all reference trajectories compared with reactive control. Although the quintic reference has the lowest RTS and MOR in TM-1 and TM-3, in TM-2, the cubic reference has the best RTS and MOR values. The mean value for MOR for proactive control is 6.48\u00b0, which has 82% improvement with respect to reactive control. The mean RTS value for proactive control is also 780% smaller than the mean RTS for reactive control. We also present three other metrics specific to proactive control for its optimization performance evaluation. ET shows the execution time in seconds. Table 1 shows that the deviation from the quintic reference is the largest for all classes of test motions. ROV values agree with RTS and are indicative of the convergence of the optimization loop. ET is close for all three classes of test motions.\nThese results elucidate our hypothesis, proving that slip control with robot trajectory modulation can be significantly more effective than the common grip force slip controllers in certain scenarios. Furthermore, the use of the tactile forward model for trajectory modulation increases the slip controllers\u2019 reaction time, resulting in better performance than the reactive grip force modulation for slip control.\nSlip control generalization to novel trajectory start and end poses\nWe examined the impact of the robot movements within the robot\u2019s workspace on the model\u2019s performance by testing the model to pick the objects and place them with start and end points unseen during training. The coordinates are as follows: the original (x, y, z)start = (0.4, \u20130.3, 0.3) and (x, y, z)goal = (0.1, 0.25, 0.3), and new points (x, y, z)start = (0.3, 0.4, 0.3) and(x, y, z)goal = (0.15, \u20130.2, 0.3) in the robot base frame, respectively. This helps us understand how much the variance in the task-space start and end poses could affect the model\u2019s performance. Table 3 presents the mean performance of the controllers with ten repetitions for the three test objects with new start and goal points. A comparison of the results in Table 1 and Table 3 illustrates that the controller is robust to changes in the motion zones in the task space and it can effectively adapt to different start and end points within the robot\u2019s workspace.\nHypothesis\nProactive slip control can outperform reactive slip control with trajectory modulation: we show the advantages of proactive trajectory modulation compared with reactive trajectory modulation in a pick-and-place task. Although the former utilizes the tactile forward model consisting of ACTP and slip classification model for slip prediction, the latter uses only a slip classification model to detect slip at the current time. We use TM-1 and Domino as the comparison task motion and object (Table 1), respectively. In the ten trials of the test, the proactive trajectory modulation significantly reduced the object\u2019s in-hand rotation (35% reduction in MOR) and the number of slip instances (63% reduction in RTS) compared with the reactive trajectory modulation. The proactive approach starts the trajectory modulation before a real slip incident occurs, whereas the reactive method starts the modulation of the reference trajectory after observing a slip instance. This helped the proactive approach result in better slip control performance. This observation addresses our third hypothesis, which states that proactive trajectory modulation is more effective in slip control than reactive trajectory modulation.\nDiscussion\nOur research investigated the slip control mechanisms during manipulation, revealing that trajectory modulation, not just grip force, is crucial in slip control, especially during long-range movements. This is in line with findings in human slip control11. We proposed an approach that uses predictive controllers, to enhance robot interaction with complex environments. Traditional reactive control methods are limited by their reliance on the observed states, whereas our proactive controller uses predicted slip states to control object slip during object transport tasks. Our method demonstrated substantial improvements in slip control without requiring increased grip force, outperforming traditional grip force control methods. It proved effective across various trajectories, objects and motions, making it versatile and adaptable.\nProactive control offers broader benefits to robotics by enhancing the robots\u2019 ability to operate in unstructured environments, potentially revolutionizing robotic deployment. However, future work should address limitations such as the controller\u2019s neglect of prediction errors, reliance on offline training, limited object set and computational complexity. Furthermore, extending our approach beyond tasks with predefined reference trajectories would further improve its applicability.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we have tested two hypotheses for designing a controller for robot physical interaction in the context of slip control. First, these results were instrumental in proposing our trajectory modulation slip control approach, which offers a promising solution to cope with complex interactive tasks and dynamics. Second, by integrating an action-conditioned forward model into a predictive control architecture to modulate the reference trajectory, our approach allows robots to use the predicted slip events and adjust their trajectory in real time to avoid those cases in contrast to reactive control policies that activate after the slip occurrence. Our results show a substantial reduction in the likelihood of task failure and an increase in the robot\u2019s success rate compared with traditional reactive control policies. Using the data-driven forward model improved the slip state estimation and slip controller performance. We believe that our approach has notable potential in a variety of industrial and service robotic applications, and our work opens up new opportunities to bring robots into our daily life. We hope that our findings will inspire future research in this area and further advance the field of robotics.\nMethods\nHere we delve into the implementation of proactive trajectory modulation as a means of slip control, which addresses our first hypothesis. We present the methodology and experimental setup used to examine the effectiveness of trajectory modulation in preventing slip incidents during robotic manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of incorporating a forward model in proactive control, an approach aimed at slip avoidance, as per our second research hypothesis. We outline the key aspects of proactive control, its implementation and the experimental framework used to evaluate its performance in slip prevention.\nExperimental setup\nTraditional parallel jaw grippers are still widely used in many robotic manipulation tasks, such as bin picking 38. Usually, a motion planning module generates a reference trajectory for the robot by minimizing, for example, time or jerk before motion execution. Then, the robot executes them in an open-loop manner with respect to task failure/success due to a slip in real time. This limits the robot\u2019s success, and solutions in the literature suggest increased grip force on the fly, which may not be feasible in many cases39,40,41. We address this issue using our data-driven predictive control concept, referred to as proactive control.\nFirst, we collected a dataset of open-loop trajectory executions in which the robot manipulates an object included in our train objects set shown in Supplementary Table 2. We equipped the fingers of a Franka Emika robotic arm with a pair of 4 \u00d7 4 uSkin tactile sensors and performed moving tasks with multiple objects. The uSkin tactile sensor has 16 sensing points (taxels) that measure triaxial forces, including shear x, shear y and normal z (Fig. 1). To create various types of reference trajectory, we used two main motion strategies during data collection: (1) kinaesthetic robot motions, where a human user performed moving tasks with qualitative fast and slow motions; (2) automatic robot motions, where trapezoidal reference trajectories with various acceleration/deceleration values were sent as a reference Cartesian velocity. A D435i camera manufactured by Intel RealSense mounted on the robot\u2019s wrist measures the pose of an ArUco marker attached to the top of the object. The pose data are then post-processed to create binary slip labels based on the object\u2019s in-hand displacement.\nACTP\nIn this work, tactile data are referred to as frames, representing single time-step readings of the respective sensing modality. Given (1) a set of context frames f0:c\u22121 = {f0\u2026fc\u22121}, which are the previously observed frames with a context sequence length of c, and (2) a prediction horizon of length H \u2013 c (that is, the number of future frames to predict); here we assume equal context and prediction window size, that is, H = 2c, where \\({i}_{c}\\in \\{0,\\ldots ,c-1\\}\\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}^{c}\\), \\({i}_{p}\\in \\{c,\\ldots ,H-1\\}\\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}^{c}\\) and \\(i\\in \\{0,\\ldots ,c-1\\}\\cup \\{c,\\ldots ,H-1\\}\\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}^{H}\\) (Fig. 3b shows details of the samples in the context and prediction horizons). Although here we show the formulation for one time step f(t), generalization for training for the entire trajectory, that is, t = 0:T, is straightforward. A tactile prediction model can be defined as f (we use *i:i+n = {*i, *i+1\u2026*i+n}; Fig. 3b) to denote variables representing the set of frames and \\(\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}\\) to denote the corresponding predicted values:\nwhere \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:H-1}\\) represents a set of predicted frames \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{i}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{48}\\) (tactile images). The goal is to optimize equation (2), for each time step in the prediction horizon counted by ip:\nwhere \\({\\mathcal{D}}\\) denotes the loss function in the tactile reading space or pixel space, such as \\({{\\mathcal{L}}}_{1}\\) or \\({{\\mathcal{L}}}_{2}\\), measuring the difference between the predicted and observed frames.\nIn a physical robot interaction, we aim to develop a cause\u2013effect understanding of the robot\u2019s actions. Thus, we condition the prediction model on the past context frames f0:c\u22121, the past robot trajectory x0:c\u22121 and planned robot actions ac\u22121:H\u22122 to output future frames \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:H-1}\\) (which are known in our physical robot interaction datasets but unknown during the inference time). Here \\({{\\bf{x}}}_{{i}_{c}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{6}\\) represents the robot trajectory at past steps, and \\({{\\bf{a}}}_{{i}_{p}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{6}\\) represents the planned future robot actions at time t. The model assumes a known and nearly constant sampling frequency (typically around 10 Hz with less than 10% variance), and we work with discrete values. The prediction model can be expressed as\nwhere f denotes tactile frames. In model predictive control, which commonly uses forward prediction models like those described here, future robot actions are considered as a batch of candidate actions. The optimal action is selected by a discriminator based on the most desirable predicted tactile frames34,42.\nOur model aims to maximize the \\(p\\left(\\right.{\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:H-1}| {{\\bf{f}}}_{0:c-1},\\)\\(\\{{{\\bf{x}}}_{0:c-1},{{\\bf{a}}}_{c-1:H-2}\\},\\) \\(\\left.{{\\bf{z}}}_{0:c}\\right)\\) to predict tactile frame \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:T}\\) by applying stochastic assumption to the prediction model. Our objective is to sample from\nThe network can then be trained with the frame prediction model by maximizing equation (4).\nFor more information about action-conditioned prediction models, see refs. 35,43,44. The LSTM classifier takes the predicted tactile frames and classifies each predicted time step as either slip or non-slip. The resulting slip signal, where the binary value of 0 indicates no slip and 1 indicates slip, is then used in the model predictive control framework to adjust the robot\u2019s movements accordingly.\nSlip classification model\nTo classify tactile frames as slip and non-slip signals, we leverage the temporal processing capabilities of LSTM networks, which have been shown to significantly enhance the classification performance by incorporating historical tactile features, compared with traditional classification methods such as support vector machines45,46.\nFormally, we define the slip classification task as mapping the predicted tactile state sequence \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:H-1}\\) to a sequence of slip classifications \\({\\hat{{\\bf{s}}}}_{c:H-1}\\), where each \\({\\hat{{\\bf{s}}}}_{i}\\in \\{{c}_{{\\text{slip}}},{c}_{{\\text{non-slip}}}\\}\\) denotes the slip status at time step i within the prediction window. The LSTM model is trained to learn the temporal dependencies in the tactile data, enabling it to effectively differentiate between slip and non-slip conditions.\nGiven a sequence of predicted tactile states \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:H-1}\\), the LSTM-based slip classifier processes these states sequentially, with the LSTM unit updates defined as follows:\nwhere hi and ci are the hidden and cell states at time step i, respectively. The output of the LSTM at each time step is passed through a fully connected layer to produce the slip classification logits, which are then converted into probabilities using a sigmoid activation function:\nwhere \u03c3 is the sigmoid function, and Ws and bs are the weight and bias of the output layer, respectively. The final slip classification \\({\\hat{{\\bf{s}}}}_{i}\\) is obtained by thresholding the probability output, assigning it to either the slip or non-slip class.\nThe architecture of the LSTM-based slip classification model is depicted in Fig. 2. Building on the work in ref. 34, which demonstrated that a simple LSTM-based tactile forward model combined with a slip classifier outperforms classifiers labelled with future slip instances, we use a state-of-the-art tactile forward model35 to estimate tactile states over the future prediction horizon and classify these predicted states accordingly.\nTo determine the stability of the object in the robot\u2019s grip, the slip classification model primarily utilizes the shear force components from the predicted tactile states. To enhance the model\u2019s generalization ability, we incorporate two dropout layers with a dropout probability of 0.5.\nThe slip classification dataset is imbalanced, comprising 16% slip instances and 84% non-slip instances. To address this imbalance, we train the classification model using the binary cross-entropy loss function, with a weighting scheme that penalizes slip instances more heavily than non-slip cases, using a relative weight of 3:1. This approach helps ensure that the classifier is conservative, with a strong tendency to predict actual slip instances as positive, leading to high recall rates, as reflected in the metrics in Supplementary Table 1 (right) for most of the train and test objects.\nSlip control using trajectory modulation\nOur proactive control approach, based on our previous work34, consists of a tactile forward model, a slip classifier and a predictive controller. A detailed presentation of model architecture and hyperparameters settings of ACTP and the slip classification models is included in Supplementary Section 1. We have made several improvements to the original approach that have led to substantial performance gains. First, we have incorporated our ACTP model to improve the accuracy of the slip classifier (Supplementary Table 1 provides the results). Second, we have extended the control variable from one DOF to six DOFs. This control strategy regulates the distance to the reference trajectory (which we call residual values), rather than learning the Cartesian velocity, as that in ref. 47. This results in improved optimization and better convergence and generalization. Additionally, we have expanded the object and trajectory sets, further improving the generalization of the approach. We denote the Cartesian-space velocity vector of the robot as \\(\\overrightarrow{V}=({V}_{x},{V}_{y},{V}_{z},\\,{W}_{x},{W}_{y},{W}_{z})\\).\nIn the trajectory modulation loop, the first three components of the control vector represent the translational velocities along the Cartesian coordinate axes, whereas the last three components represent the angular velocities around those axes. Our goal is to minimize the future slip likelihood \\(L({s}_{c,\\ldots ,H-1}| \\alpha ,\\beta ,{\\bf{x}},{\\bf{a}})=\\mathop{\\prod }\\nolimits_{i = c}^{H-1}f({s}_{i}| \\alpha ,\\beta ,{{\\bf{x}}}_{0:i},{{\\bf{a}}}_{i})\\) by learning the optimal deviation from the reference velocity profile, where \u03b1, \u03b2, x and a represent the tactile forward model and slip classifier parameters, past tactile states and planned robot actions, respectively. si indicates the ith observed slip value within a prediction horizon of length c. We choose spherical coordinates as the robot\u2019s input {ac\u22121\u2026aH\u22122} to adapt a given reference trajectory. As such, we modify the reference velocity vector by separately adjusting its norm and direction. To facilitate this modification, we represent the translational and angular velocities in spherical coordinates as follows.\nThe variables \u03c1, \u03b8 and \u03d5 correspond to the norm, polar angle and azimuthal angle, respectively, in spherical coordinates. The relationship between the spherical and rectangular coordinates is illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1. Using spherical coordinates enables the optimization process to separately learn the modifications needed for the norm and direction of the velocity vector in space. The optimization process returns the residual values, which are added to the components in equation (8) to modify the reference velocity profile.\nWe express the residual values of equation (9) in the matrix form as \\({\\zeta }^{{\\rm{d}}}=({\\zeta }_{{\\rho }_{v}},{\\zeta }_{{\\theta }_{v}},{\\zeta }_{{\\phi }_{v}},{\\zeta }_{{\\rho }_{w}},{\\zeta }_{{\\theta }_{w}},{\\zeta }_{{\\phi }_{w}})\\). The residual trajectory values form the difference between the executed robot trajectory \u03b6e and the reference trajectory \u03b6r are \\({\\zeta }_{c:H-1}^{\\;{\\rm{d}}}={\\zeta }_{c:H-1}^{\\;{\\rm{e}}}-{\\zeta }_{c:H-1}^{\\;{\\rm{r}}}\\) and \\({\\zeta }_{c:H-1}^{{\\rm{e}}}=\\{{{\\bf{a}}}_{c-1}\\ldots {{\\bf{a}}}_{H-2}\\}\\), where \\({\\bf{a}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{6}\\) and \\(\\zeta \\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{6\\times c}\\).\nParameterized residual learning for trajectory adaptation\nTo optimize the robot\u2019s trajectories over a future time horizon (that is, \\({i}_{{\\rm{p}}}\\in \\{c,\\ldots H-1\\}\\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}^{c}\\)), we represent the residual values using a parametric action representation48 that includes a weight parameter matrix w to be computed by the optimizer using Gaussian basis functions49, which is denoted by \u03a6: \\({\\zeta }_{c:H-1}^{\\;{\\rm{d}}}={{\\bf{w}}}^{{\\rm{T}}}\\times \\varPhi\\), where \\(\\varPhi \\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{n\\times c}\\) and \\({\\bf{w}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{c\\times 6}\\). For the sake of simplicity, we express \u03b6c:H\u22121 by \u03b6.\nThe parameterized action space representation reduces computation complexity compared with direct search in continuous action space48. The benefit is more effective when the action is optimized in a future time horizon rather than a single time step due to the fewer search parameters in the optimization problem. We close the loop for the slip prevention controller by solving the constraint optimization in equation (10).\nwhere \u03b6e = \u03b6d(w, \u03a6) + \u03b6r, and f denotes the tactile state vector \\(\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{48\\times c}\\). The first nonlinear constraint in the optimization formulation is based on the expected value of the slip signal over the prediction horizon c, given by \\({\\mathbb{E}}[{s}_{c:H-1}({\\zeta }^{{\\rm{e}}}({\\bf{w}},\\varPhi ))]\\), where s is a function of the robot\u2019s future trajectory. The second constraint limits the difference between the generated robot velocities and the observed velocity (measurement) to ensure compliance with the robot\u2019s low-level controller maximum acceleration limit. The optimization problem seeks to minimize the expected slip over the prediction horizon and remaining close to the provided reference trajectory.\nThe resulting spherical velocity components are transformed back to rectangular coordinates before being sent to the robot\u2019s Cartesian-velocity controller as per equation (11). The Vx, Vy, Vz, Wx, Wy and Wz values are used to update the robot\u2019s Cartesian-velocity controller, which regulates the robot\u2019s motion along the desired trajectory and avoiding slipping.\nWe provide a detailed presentation of the grip force control method as the baseline controller for benchmarking our proactive controller in the Supplementary Information.\nTraining and testing\nWe trained our ACTP model and slip classification model offline using a dataset of pick-and-move tasks. Figure 2 illustrates the forward model and its architecture within a predictive control pipeline50.\nThe manipulation dataset consists of 420,000 data samples collected from 600 manipulation trials involving 13 box-shaped objects. Each object (including both train and test set objects; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 list the dataset details) was involved in an equal number of trials, with three objects reserved as test objects, which were not seen during training. The performance of the ACTP and slip classification models was validated by analysing the mean absolute error and F-score values for the unseen objects, respectively. All models were trained on a Ubuntu machine equipped with an AMD Ryzen Threadripper CPU, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 GPU and 64 GB of memory. The training was conducted using the PyTorch v. 1.13.1 library with CUDA v. 11.7. The trained ACTP and slip classification models are then used with fixed-weight parameters for real-time control tests.\nDuring testing, the trajectory modulation module utilizes the inference from these two models in an online optimization loop to determine the optimal next robot action that minimizes the likelihood of slip occurrence in a receding horizon framework. We will now present the design details for each building block of the proactive control system (Fig. 2).\nObjects, metrics and comparison method\nTable 2 presents the objects used for training and testing our controller (Supplementary Table 1 provides the pictures of each object). It also details the performance metrics for both train and test objects. The train and test sets are based on the data collection for training the underlying tactile forward model and slip classifier in the proactive control, consisting of ten train objects and three test objects. The performance metrics for the slip controller include rotation of >6\u00b0, time steps (RTS) and maximum object rotation (MOR) in degrees. RTS represents the number of time steps during which the object\u2019s rotation exceeded the slip classification threshold (6\u00b0). Smaller RTS values indicate better slip avoidance performance. The proactive control achieved excellent performance with no slip instances (RTS = 0) for five objects in the train set and two objects in the test set (boldface values in the RTS column). The MOR values show that for five objects, the maximum rotation slightly exceeded 6\u00b0, the threshold set for slip classification. This may be attributed to the imprecision of the forward model, the classifier (Supplementary Table 1) or the threshold we set on the number of iterations in the controller computations to find the optimal actions (as we allow only ten optimizer iterations due to real-time constraints). Nonetheless, MOR remains below 9\u00b0, preventing failure despite slip instances. Comparing the mean values of MOR and RTS for the train and test sets demonstrates that our proposed controller generalizes well to unseen objects during training and effectively avoids slip instances on average. DRT denotes the distance to the reference trajectory, calculated by summing the Euclidean distance between the reference and optimized trajectories across all task time steps (measured in m s\u22121). ROV represents the resulted optimality value, indicating the convergence of the optimization process at the final iteration.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe experimental data used in this work including the robotic experiments are available at https://proactive-control.github.io/.\nCode availability\nThe code used for training and testing the slip prediction models, as well as implementing the slip controller, is publicly available via GitHub at https://github.com/imanlab/bgf and via Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14524629 (ref. 51).\nReferences\nBillard, A. & Kragic, D.

      "text": "Abstract\nEnsuring a stable grasp during robotic manipulation is essential for dexterous and reliable performance. Traditionally, slip control has relied on grip force modulation. Here we show that trajectory modulation provides an effective alternative for slip prevention in certain robotic manipulation tasks. We develop and compare a slip control policy based on trajectory modulation with a conventional grip-force-based approach. Our results demonstrate that trajectory modulation can significantly outperform grip force control in specific scenarios, highlighting its potential as a robust slip control strategy. Furthermore, we show that, similar to humans, incorporating a data-driven action-conditioned forward model within a model predictive control framework is key to optimizing trajectory modulation for slip prevention. These findings introduce a predictive control framework leveraging trajectory adaptation, offering a new perspective on slip mitigation. This approach enhances grasp stability in dynamic and unstructured environments, improving the adaptability of robotic systems across various applications.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nMain\nSlippage of objects (we call it \u2018slip\u2019) during robotic manipulation tasks can result in instability and task failure1,2. Robotic systems are still far behind human-level dexterity in handling slip3. Improving slip controllers can be attributed to enhancing tactile sensors4,5,6 for reliable slip detection7,8,9 and intelligent control strategies for slip prevention10. In this study, we focus on the latter and present a bioinspired11 approach for slip control. Current slip controllers primarily rely on increasing grip force in response to detected slip events10. However, it is still unclear whether grip force modulation is the only means of slip control. Inspired by the inherent dynamics of slip events indicating rapid adjustments in motion trajectories can stabilize the physical interaction12,13 and findings in ref. 11 showing humans deploy hand acceleration adaptation besides grip force modulation for slip prevention, we explore the effectiveness of trajectory modulation as an alternative control policy in robotic pick-and-place tasks where grip force control is not always possible or effective. The code can be found at https://github.com/imanlab/bgf, and our dataset and other information are available at https://proactive-control.github.io/.\nGrip force control in robotics (based on detected14,15,16,17,18,19 or predicted10 slip instances) is inspired by neurophysiological studies on humans\u2019 control policies (for example, refs. 20,21,22). These studies have shown that humans optimally adjust the grip force to be slightly larger than the required amount for preventing object slip. However, grip force control may not be effective or possible in many robotic scenarios, for example, when the maximum grip force is already applied23 or when handling delicate objects24. Moreover, many robotic architectures do not permit real-time grip force control, for example, the Franka Emika arm25. Hence, our hypothesis involves a robot controller using hand trajectory modulation that can be as effective in preventing object slip as a controller using grip force modulation.\nWe introduce a predictive trajectory modulation approach for slip control, which dynamically adjusts planned motions in real time to prevent anticipated slippage during robotic manipulation tasks, with supplementary insights from human studies11. Although our results show that reactive trajectory modulation reduces slip instances, it is suggested that humans\u2019 dexterity is owed to a predictive control system relying on internal forward models26,27. Forward models (Fig. 1) are thought to enable the prediction of sensory consequences of motor actions and allow bypassing unavoidable delays due to latency associated with sensorimotor loops27,28,29,30, whereas the motor cortex defines optimal actions to achieve the task goal31. Hence, our next hypothesis is to test whether a predictive controller can yield better performance in slip control. Learning a forward model in physical robot interaction with the high-dimensional state space32,33 is challenging and has limited the robotic systems to benefit from predictive controllers in cases such as slip prevention.\nWe, therefore, proposed a six-dimensional proactive control for trajectory modulation to avoid slip, relying on a learned tactile forward model that predicts slip instances within a prediction horizon.\nA predictive controller adjusts the reference trajectory based on a predicted slip signal to minimize the likelihood of future slips. This extends our previous one-dimensional controller34 to a six-dimensional velocity controller and leverages our state-of-the-art action-conditioned tactile prediction (ACTP) model35 for slip prediction. Proactive control closes the control loop with the predicted system states and outperforms current reactive grip force controllers by achieving a smaller likelihood of slip control failure. Proactive slip control also benefits from a slip classification on the ACTP prediction signals, making it superior to that of a simple long short-term memory (LSTM)-based classification34, contributing to the improved performance of the proactive controller.\nWe conducted a series of experiments using the Franka Emika arm to demonstrate the effectiveness of reference trajectory modulation. We implemented and tested both reactive and proactive controls. Our experiments include a variety of objects, trajectory classes and robotic manipulation tasks, in which slip may cause task failures. Our results show that trajectory modulation is effective in controlling slip where grip force control is not either possible or sufficiently effective in robotic manipulation. We evaluated the generalization capabilities of proactive control for trajectory modulation. We observed the controller generalizes well to unseen object classes, robot trajectories and motion start/end poses.\nOur contribution is manifold: we propose a robotic slip control approach that utilizes reference trajectory modulation. Inspired by the proactive control strategy used by humans36,11, we introduce a proactive control framework that uses a forward model to predict slip incidents and ensure task success in physically interactive scenarios. The proposed approach offers a substantial improvement over current slip control methods.\nResults\nWe aimed to explore the role of trajectory modulation in slip control. Our predictive control strategy uses a forward model, in contrast to the reactive grip force control that is commonly used in robotics, to predict the consequence of its action and select future trajectory points, yielding no slip during manipulative movements. Our findings in our previous study11 indicate that humans rely on trajectory modulation, when grip force control is insufficient, for slip control. This insight motivated the development of our proactive control policy that modulates trajectories to prevent slip. Ref. 11 demonstrates that participants use hand acceleration modulation as a strategy to minimize task completion time and prevent slip occurrences. Building on this insight, we have developed a slip control approach for robotic manipulation. This innovative method involves optimizing the robot\u2019s predetermined trajectory through the application of its tactile forward model, directly addressing our second hypothesis and representing a notable advancement in the field of robotic slip control.\nTrajectory modulation for object slip control\nHypothesis\nA robot controller using reference trajectory modulation can be effective in slip control: we attached a pair of uSkin37 tactile sensors to Franka Emika robotic arm\u2019s fingers for closing the loop for trajectory modulation. Our proactive controller involves lifting an object from a top grasp pose by a parallel gripper and moving it to the target pose by modulating a given reference trajectory. Object slip is predicted in real time within a specified prediction window using a tactile forward model. The trajectory optimization pipeline (Fig. 2) then leverages these predicted slip values to learn how to dynamically adjust the Cartesian reference trajectory, thereby minimizing the likelihood of future slip events. If the tactile forward model does not predict a positive slip event during the trial, the predefined reference trajectory will be executed without modification. Figure 3 shows the robot Cartesian-space acceleration for a linear movement from (0.4, \u20130.3, 0.3) to (0.1, 0.25, 0.3) in the robot base frame (Table 1). This result obtained with the Domino object, which is a sample object from our test objects set (see the list of ten objects used for training and three objects used for testing the tactile forward model, namely, the train object set and test object set; Table 2). The object\u2019s in-hand pose is measured using a wrist-mounted Intel RealSense camera and a visual marker attached to the object. The threshold for switching the contact state from stick to rotational slip was chosen as 6\u00b0. The small deformation of the tactile sensor taxels allowed <6\u00b0 object rotation without slip.\nWe show the results of trajectory modulation for three reference velocity trajectories (Fig. 3): trapezoid (panel a), cubic (panel c) and quintic (panel e), and the object rotation achieved by the proactive controller in panels b, d and f, respectively. For each test case, we repeated each task execution five times. Variations are due to the nonlinear nature of the slip, variability in initial contact and stochastic nature of the forward model used in our proactive controller. The onset of the predicted slip is shown with a green-shaded band in Fig. 3a,c,e. This shows that the proactive controller effectively controls slips regardless of the onset time and nature. Figure 3b,d,f shows the object rotation (blue line) without the proactive controller where the reference trajectory is executed without modulation.\nThe data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the object rotations obtained by proactive control are significantly smaller than those obtained with the open-loop controller and remain within the set slip boundaries. These achievements can be attributed to the deviations of the generated trajectories from the reference trajectory. Proactive control can effectively minimize slip incidents by modulating the robot\u2019s trajectory despite a constant grip force applied, which is within a safety margin for forming a stable grasp and lifting the object. These are in agreement with the human slip control strategy presented in ref. 11.\nThe rows showing the mean value for DRT (Table 2) explain that the deviation from the reference trajectory remains comparatively close between the train and test objects, illustrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach in generalizing to unseen objects during training. Nonetheless, the ROV has an 8% increase for the test objects compared with the train set objects, showing that a reach object set (representing a variety of object classes) can enhance the performance.\nWe also tested the proactive control in three classes of manipulative movements, each with a varying number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) and quantitatively compared its results with a baseline slip control model, that is, a reactive grip force control with an MHZ2 SMC gripper. For each motion class, we fix a few DOFs in Cartesian space and generate a reference trajectory for the remaining DOFs to set the robot\u2019s velocity. This allows us to examine the relationship between specific movements and slip instances. We focus on test movements relevant to common pick-and-place tasks, including linear motions in a horizontal plane (TM-1), motions in a horizontal plane with wrist rotation (TM-2) and lifting motions in a vertical plane by moving an object up and down (TM-3).\nAs a baseline, we use a reactive (grip force) control, which is the common approach in the literature, using the MHZ2 SMC gripper to modulate the grip force in real time. By attaching uSkin sensors to the fingers, we created a setup that is comparable with one with the default Franka Emika gripper, which cannot be controlled in real time. The grip force slip control method is a reactive control system that tightens the grip whenever a positive slip signal is detected. We repeated each test case ten times and report the mean and standard deviation for each performance metric. Table 1 presents the average performance of reactive control for test objects set on various reference trajectories and classes of motion. Both RTS and MOR values in Table 1 indicate that the trapezoid reference trajectory is the most challenging for controlling the slip in all three classes of test motions. This is due to the jerk in the phase of switching from linear to constant velocity and vice versa. Although the quintic reference has the lowest RTS in all test motions, the cubic reference has the smallest MOR in TM-2. This table shows that the average MOR for reactive grip force control is 11.51\u00b0, which is 5.51\u00b0 larger than the slip threshold. We conduct the same test cases for our proposed proactive controller and present the results in Table 1. On the basis of RTS and MOR values, similar to reactive control, the trapezoid reference trajectory is the most challenging for proactive control for slip avoidance. However, proactive control showed notable improvement for both metrics in each test motion with all reference trajectories compared with reactive control. Although the quintic reference has the lowest RTS and MOR in TM-1 and TM-3, in TM-2, the cubic reference has the best RTS and MOR values. The mean value for MOR for proactive control is 6.48\u00b0, which has 82% improvement with respect to reactive control. The mean RTS value for proactive control is also 780% smaller than the mean RTS for reactive control. We also present three other metrics specific to proactive control for its optimization performance evaluation. ET shows the execution time in seconds. Table 1 shows that the deviation from the quintic reference is the largest for all classes of test motions. ROV values agree with RTS and are indicative of the convergence of the optimization loop. ET is close for all three classes of test motions.\nThese results elucidate our hypothesis, proving that slip control with robot trajectory modulation can be significantly more effective than the common grip force slip controllers in certain scenarios. Furthermore, the use of the tactile forward model for trajectory modulation increases the slip controllers\u2019 reaction time, resulting in better performance than the reactive grip force modulation for slip control.\nSlip control generalization to novel trajectory start and end poses\nWe examined the impact of the robot movements within the robot\u2019s workspace on the model\u2019s performance by testing the model to pick the objects and place them with start and end points unseen during training. The coordinates are as follows: the original (x, y, z)start = (0.4, \u20130.3, 0.3) and (x, y, z)goal = (0.1, 0.25, 0.3), and new points (x, y, z)start = (0.3, 0.4, 0.3) and(x, y, z)goal = (0.15, \u20130.2, 0.3) in the robot base frame, respectively. This helps us understand how much the variance in the task-space start and end poses could affect the model\u2019s performance. Table 3 presents the mean performance of the controllers with ten repetitions for the three test objects with new start and goal points. A comparison of the results in Table 1 and Table 3 illustrates that the controller is robust to changes in the motion zones in the task space and it can effectively adapt to different start and end points within the robot\u2019s workspace.\nHypothesis\nProactive slip control can outperform reactive slip control with trajectory modulation: we show the advantages of proactive trajectory modulation compared with reactive trajectory modulation in a pick-and-place task. Although the former utilizes the tactile forward model consisting of ACTP and slip classification model for slip prediction, the latter uses only a slip classification model to detect slip at the current time. We use TM-1 and Domino as the comparison task motion and object (Table 1), respectively. In the ten trials of the test, the proactive trajectory modulation significantly reduced the object\u2019s in-hand rotation (35% reduction in MOR) and the number of slip instances (63% reduction in RTS) compared with the reactive trajectory modulation. The proactive approach starts the trajectory modulation before a real slip incident occurs, whereas the reactive method starts the modulation of the reference trajectory after observing a slip instance. This helped the proactive approach result in better slip control performance. This observation addresses our third hypothesis, which states that proactive trajectory modulation is more effective in slip control than reactive trajectory modulation.\nDiscussion\nOur research investigated the slip control mechanisms during manipulation, revealing that trajectory modulation, not just grip force, is crucial in slip control, especially during long-range movements. This is in line with findings in human slip control11. We proposed an approach that uses predictive controllers, to enhance robot interaction with complex environments. Traditional reactive control methods are limited by their reliance on the observed states, whereas our proactive controller uses predicted slip states to control object slip during object transport tasks. Our method demonstrated substantial improvements in slip control without requiring increased grip force, outperforming traditional grip force control methods. It proved effective across various trajectories, objects and motions, making it versatile and adaptable.\nProactive control offers broader benefits to robotics by enhancing the robots\u2019 ability to operate in unstructured environments, potentially revolutionizing robotic deployment. However, future work should address limitations such as the controller\u2019s neglect of prediction errors, reliance on offline training, limited object set and computational complexity. Furthermore, extending our approach beyond tasks with predefined reference trajectories would further improve its applicability.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we have tested two hypotheses for designing a controller for robot physical interaction in the context of slip control. First, these results were instrumental in proposing our trajectory modulation slip control approach, which offers a promising solution to cope with complex interactive tasks and dynamics. Second, by integrating an action-conditioned forward model into a predictive control architecture to modulate the reference trajectory, our approach allows robots to use the predicted slip events and adjust their trajectory in real time to avoid those cases in contrast to reactive control policies that activate after the slip occurrence. Our results show a substantial reduction in the likelihood of task failure and an increase in the robot\u2019s success rate compared with traditional reactive control policies. Using the data-driven forward model improved the slip state estimation and slip controller performance. We believe that our approach has notable potential in a variety of industrial and service robotic applications, and our work opens up new opportunities to bring robots into our daily life. We hope that our findings will inspire future research in this area and further advance the field of robotics.\nMethods\nHere we delve into the implementation of proactive trajectory modulation as a means of slip control, which addresses our first hypothesis. We present the methodology and experimental setup used to examine the effectiveness of trajectory modulation in preventing slip incidents during robotic manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of incorporating a forward model in proactive control, an approach aimed at slip avoidance, as per our second research hypothesis. We outline the key aspects of proactive control, its implementation and the experimental framework used to evaluate its performance in slip prevention.\nExperimental setup\nTraditional parallel jaw grippers are still widely used in many robotic manipulation tasks, such as bin picking 38. Usually, a motion planning module generates a reference trajectory for the robot by minimizing, for example, time or jerk before motion execution. Then, the robot executes them in an open-loop manner with respect to task failure/success due to a slip in real time. This limits the robot\u2019s success, and solutions in the literature suggest increased grip force on the fly, which may not be feasible in many cases39,40,41. We address this issue using our data-driven predictive control concept, referred to as proactive control.\nFirst, we collected a dataset of open-loop trajectory executions in which the robot manipulates an object included in our train objects set shown in Supplementary Table 2. We equipped the fingers of a Franka Emika robotic arm with a pair of 4 \u00d7 4 uSkin tactile sensors and performed moving tasks with multiple objects. The uSkin tactile sensor has 16 sensing points (taxels) that measure triaxial forces, including shear x, shear y and normal z (Fig. 1). To create various types of reference trajectory, we used two main motion strategies during data collection: (1) kinaesthetic robot motions, where a human user performed moving tasks with qualitative fast and slow motions; (2) automatic robot motions, where trapezoidal reference trajectories with various acceleration/deceleration values were sent as a reference Cartesian velocity. A D435i camera manufactured by Intel RealSense mounted on the robot\u2019s wrist measures the pose of an ArUco marker attached to the top of the object. The pose data are then post-processed to create binary slip labels based on the object\u2019s in-hand displacement.\nACTP\nIn this work, tactile data are referred to as frames, representing single time-step readings of the respective sensing modality. Given (1) a set of context frames f0:c\u22121 = {f0\u2026fc\u22121}, which are the previously observed frames with a context sequence length of c, and (2) a prediction horizon of length H \u2013 c (that is, the number of future frames to predict); here we assume equal context and prediction window size, that is, H = 2c, where \\({i}_{c}\\in \\{0,\\ldots ,c-1\\}\\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}^{c}\\), \\({i}_{p}\\in \\{c,\\ldots ,H-1\\}\\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}^{c}\\) and \\(i\\in \\{0,\\ldots ,c-1\\}\\cup \\{c,\\ldots ,H-1\\}\\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}^{H}\\) (Fig. 3b shows details of the samples in the context and prediction horizons). Although here we show the formulation for one time step f(t), generalization for training for the entire trajectory, that is, t = 0:T, is straightforward. A tactile prediction model can be defined as f (we use *i:i+n = {*i, *i+1\u2026*i+n}; Fig. 3b) to denote variables representing the set of frames and \\(\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}\\) to denote the corresponding predicted values:\nwhere \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:H-1}\\) represents a set of predicted frames \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{i}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{48}\\) (tactile images). The goal is to optimize equation (2), for each time step in the prediction horizon counted by ip:\nwhere \\({\\mathcal{D}}\\) denotes the loss function in the tactile reading space or pixel space, such as \\({{\\mathcal{L}}}_{1}\\) or \\({{\\mathcal{L}}}_{2}\\), measuring the difference between the predicted and observed frames.\nIn a physical robot interaction, we aim to develop a cause\u2013effect understanding of the robot\u2019s actions. Thus, we condition the prediction model on the past context frames f0:c\u22121, the past robot trajectory x0:c\u22121 and planned robot actions ac\u22121:H\u22122 to output future frames \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:H-1}\\) (which are known in our physical robot interaction datasets but unknown during the inference time). Here \\({{\\bf{x}}}_{{i}_{c}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{6}\\) represents the robot trajectory at past steps, and \\({{\\bf{a}}}_{{i}_{p}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{6}\\) represents the planned future robot actions at time t. The model assumes a known and nearly constant sampling frequency (typically around 10 Hz with less than 10% variance), and we work with discrete values. The prediction model can be expressed as\nwhere f denotes tactile frames. In model predictive control, which commonly uses forward prediction models like those described here, future robot actions are considered as a batch of candidate actions. The optimal action is selected by a discriminator based on the most desirable predicted tactile frames34,42.\nOur model aims to maximize the \\(p\\left(\\right.{\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:H-1}| {{\\bf{f}}}_{0:c-1},\\)\\(\\{{{\\bf{x}}}_{0:c-1},{{\\bf{a}}}_{c-1:H-2}\\},\\) \\(\\left.{{\\bf{z}}}_{0:c}\\right)\\) to predict tactile frame \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:T}\\) by applying stochastic assumption to the prediction model. Our objective is to sample from\nThe network can then be trained with the frame prediction model by maximizing equation (4).\nFor more information about action-conditioned prediction models, see refs. 35,43,44. The LSTM classifier takes the predicted tactile frames and classifies each predicted time step as either slip or non-slip. The resulting slip signal, where the binary value of 0 indicates no slip and 1 indicates slip, is then used in the model predictive control framework to adjust the robot\u2019s movements accordingly.\nSlip classification model\nTo classify tactile frames as slip and non-slip signals, we leverage the temporal processing capabilities of LSTM networks, which have been shown to significantly enhance the classification performance by incorporating historical tactile features, compared with traditional classification methods such as support vector machines45,46.\nFormally, we define the slip classification task as mapping the predicted tactile state sequence \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:H-1}\\) to a sequence of slip classifications \\({\\hat{{\\bf{s}}}}_{c:H-1}\\), where each \\({\\hat{{\\bf{s}}}}_{i}\\in \\{{c}_{{\\text{slip}}},{c}_{{\\text{non-slip}}}\\}\\) denotes the slip status at time step i within the prediction window. The LSTM model is trained to learn the temporal dependencies in the tactile data, enabling it to effectively differentiate between slip and non-slip conditions.\nGiven a sequence of predicted tactile states \\({\\hat{{\\bf{f}}}}_{c:H-1}\\), the LSTM-based slip classifier processes these states sequentially, with the LSTM unit updates defined as follows:\nwhere hi and ci are the hidden and cell states at time step i, respectively. The output of the LSTM at each time step is passed through a fully connected layer to produce the slip classification logits, which are then converted into probabilities using a sigmoid activation function:\nwhere \u03c3 is the sigmoid function, and Ws and bs are the weight and bias of the output layer, respectively. The final slip classification \\({\\hat{{\\bf{s}}}}_{i}\\) is obtained by thresholding the probability output, assigning it to either the slip or non-slip class.\nThe architecture of the LSTM-based slip classification model is depicted in Fig. 2. Building on the work in ref. 34, which demonstrated that a simple LSTM-based tactile forward model combined with a slip classifier outperforms classifiers labelled with future slip instances, we use a state-of-the-art tactile forward model35 to estimate tactile states over the future prediction horizon and classify these predicted states accordingly.\nTo determine the stability of the object in the robot\u2019s grip, the slip classification model primarily utilizes the shear force components from the predicted tactile states. To enhance the model\u2019s generalization ability, we incorporate two dropout layers with a dropout probability of 0.5.\nThe slip classification dataset is imbalanced, comprising 16% slip instances and 84% non-slip instances. To address this imbalance, we train the classification model using the binary cross-entropy loss function, with a weighting scheme that penalizes slip instances more heavily than non-slip cases, using a relative weight of 3:1. This approach helps ensure that the classifier is conservative, with a strong tendency to predict actual slip instances as positive, leading to high recall rates, as reflected in the metrics in Supplementary Table 1 (right) for most of the train and test objects.\nSlip control using trajectory modulation\nOur proactive control approach, based on our previous work34, consists of a tactile forward model, a slip classifier and a predictive controller. A detailed presentation of model architecture and hyperparameters settings of ACTP and the slip classification models is included in Supplementary Section 1. We have made several improvements to the original approach that have led to substantial performance gains. First, we have incorporated our ACTP model to improve the accuracy of the slip classifier (Supplementary Table 1 provides the results). Second, we have extended the control variable from one DOF to six DOFs. This control strategy regulates the distance to the reference trajectory (which we call residual values), rather than learning the Cartesian velocity, as that in ref. 47. This results in improved optimization and better convergence and generalization. Additionally, we have expanded the object and trajectory sets, further improving the generalization of the approach. We denote the Cartesian-space velocity vector of the robot as \\(\\overrightarrow{V}=({V}_{x},{V}_{y},{V}_{z},\\,{W}_{x},{W}_{y},{W}_{z})\\).\nIn the trajectory modulation loop, the first three components of the control vector represent the translational velocities along the Cartesian coordinate axes, whereas the last three components represent the angular velocities around those axes. Our goal is to minimize the future slip likelihood \\(L({s}_{c,\\ldots ,H-1}| \\alpha ,\\beta ,{\\bf{x}},{\\bf{a}})=\\mathop{\\prod }\\nolimits_{i = c}^{H-1}f({s}_{i}| \\alpha ,\\beta ,{{\\bf{x}}}_{0:i},{{\\bf{a}}}_{i})\\) by learning the optimal deviation from the reference velocity profile, where \u03b1, \u03b2, x and a represent the tactile forward model and slip classifier parameters, past tactile states and planned robot actions, respectively. si indicates the ith observed slip value within a prediction horizon of length c. We choose spherical coordinates as the robot\u2019s input {ac\u22121\u2026aH\u22122} to adapt a given reference trajectory. As such, we modify the reference velocity vector by separately adjusting its norm and direction. To facilitate this modification, we represent the translational and angular velocities in spherical coordinates as follows.\nThe variables \u03c1, \u03b8 and \u03d5 correspond to the norm, polar angle and azimuthal angle, respectively, in spherical coordinates. The relationship between the spherical and rectangular coordinates is illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1. Using spherical coordinates enables the optimization process to separately learn the modifications needed for the norm and direction of the velocity vector in space. The optimization process returns the residual values, which are added to the components in equation (8) to modify the reference velocity profile.\nWe express the residual values of equation (9) in the matrix form as \\({\\zeta }^{{\\rm{d}}}=({\\zeta }_{{\\rho }_{v}},{\\zeta }_{{\\theta }_{v}},{\\zeta }_{{\\phi }_{v}},{\\zeta }_{{\\rho }_{w}},{\\zeta }_{{\\theta }_{w}},{\\zeta }_{{\\phi }_{w}})\\). The residual trajectory values form the difference between the executed robot trajectory \u03b6e and the reference trajectory \u03b6r are \\({\\zeta }_{c:H-1}^{\\;{\\rm{d}}}={\\zeta }_{c:H-1}^{\\;{\\rm{e}}}-{\\zeta }_{c:H-1}^{\\;{\\rm{r}}}\\) and \\({\\zeta }_{c:H-1}^{{\\rm{e}}}=\\{{{\\bf{a}}}_{c-1}\\ldots {{\\bf{a}}}_{H-2}\\}\\), where \\({\\bf{a}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{6}\\) and \\(\\zeta \\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{6\\times c}\\).\nParameterized residual learning for trajectory adaptation\nTo optimize the robot\u2019s trajectories over a future time horizon (that is, \\({i}_{{\\rm{p}}}\\in \\{c,\\ldots H-1\\}\\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}^{c}\\)), we represent the residual values using a parametric action representation48 that includes a weight parameter matrix w to be computed by the optimizer using Gaussian basis functions49, which is denoted by \u03a6: \\({\\zeta }_{c:H-1}^{\\;{\\rm{d}}}={{\\bf{w}}}^{{\\rm{T}}}\\times \\varPhi\\), where \\(\\varPhi \\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{n\\times c}\\) and \\({\\bf{w}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{c\\times 6}\\). For the sake of simplicity, we express \u03b6c:H\u22121 by \u03b6.\nThe parameterized action space representation reduces computation complexity compared with direct search in continuous action space48. The benefit is more effective when the action is optimized in a future time horizon rather than a single time step due to the fewer search parameters in the optimization problem. We close the loop for the slip prevention controller by solving the constraint optimization in equation (10).\nwhere \u03b6e = \u03b6d(w, \u03a6) + \u03b6r, and f denotes the tactile state vector \\(\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{48\\times c}\\). The first nonlinear constraint in the optimization formulation is based on the expected value of the slip signal over the prediction horizon c, given by \\({\\mathbb{E}}[{s}_{c:H-1}({\\zeta }^{{\\rm{e}}}({\\bf{w}},\\varPhi ))]\\), where s is a function of the robot\u2019s future trajectory. The second constraint limits the difference between the generated robot velocities and the observed velocity (measurement) to ensure compliance with the robot\u2019s low-level controller maximum acceleration limit. The optimization problem seeks to minimize the expected slip over the prediction horizon and remaining close to the provided reference trajectory.\nThe resulting spherical velocity components are transformed back to rectangular coordinates before being sent to the robot\u2019s Cartesian-velocity controller as per equation (11). The Vx, Vy, Vz, Wx, Wy and Wz values are used to update the robot\u2019s Cartesian-velocity controller, which regulates the robot\u2019s motion along the desired trajectory and avoiding slipping.\nWe provide a detailed presentation of the grip force control method as the baseline controller for benchmarking our proactive controller in the Supplementary Information.\nTraining and testing\nWe trained our ACTP model and slip classification model offline using a dataset of pick-and-move tasks. Figure 2 illustrates the forward model and its architecture within a predictive control pipeline50.\nThe manipulation dataset consists of 420,000 data samples collected from 600 manipulation trials involving 13 box-shaped objects. Each object (including both train and test set objects; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 list the dataset details) was involved in an equal number of trials, with three objects reserved as test objects, which were not seen during training. The performance of the ACTP and slip classification models was validated by analysing the mean absolute error and F-score values for the unseen objects, respectively. All models were trained on a Ubuntu machine equipped with an AMD Ryzen Threadripper CPU, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 GPU and 64 GB of memory. The training was conducted using the PyTorch v. 1.13.1 library with CUDA v. 11.7. The trained ACTP and slip classification models are then used with fixed-weight parameters for real-time control tests.\nDuring testing, the trajectory modulation module utilizes the inference from these two models in an online optimization loop to determine the optimal next robot action that minimizes the likelihood of slip occurrence in a receding horizon framework. We will now present the design details for each building block of the proactive control system (Fig. 2).\nObjects, metrics and comparison method\nTable 2 presents the objects used for training and testing our controller (Supplementary Table 1 provides the pictures of each object). It also details the performance metrics for both train and test objects. The train and test sets are based on the data collection for training the underlying tactile forward model and slip classifier in the proactive control, consisting of ten train objects and three test objects. The performance metrics for the slip controller include rotation of >6\u00b0, time steps (RTS) and maximum object rotation (MOR) in degrees. RTS represents the number of time steps during which the object\u2019s rotation exceeded the slip classification threshold (6\u00b0). Smaller RTS values indicate better slip avoidance performance. The proactive control achieved excellent performance with no slip instances (RTS = 0) for five objects in the train set and two objects in the test set (boldface values in the RTS column). The MOR values show that for five objects, the maximum rotation slightly exceeded 6\u00b0, the threshold set for slip classification. This may be attributed to the imprecision of the forward model, the classifier (Supplementary Table 1) or the threshold we set on the number of iterations in the controller computations to find the optimal actions (as we allow only ten optimizer iterations due to real-time constraints). Nonetheless, MOR remains below 9\u00b0, preventing failure despite slip instances. Comparing the mean values of MOR and RTS for the train and test sets demonstrates that our proposed controller generalizes well to unseen objects during training and effectively avoids slip instances on average. DRT denotes the distance to the reference trajectory, calculated by summing the Euclidean distance between the reference and optimized trajectories across all task time steps (measured in m s\u22121). ROV represents the resulted optimality value, indicating the convergence of the optimization process at the final iteration.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe experimental data used in this work including the robotic experiments are available at https://proactive-control.github.io/.\nCode availability\nThe code used for training and testing the slip prediction models, as well as implementing the slip controller, is publicly available via GitHub at https://github.com/imanlab/bgf and via Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14524629 (ref. 51).\nReferences\nBillard, A. & Kragic, D.

  "argos_summary": "Researchers have developed a new approach to enhance robotic manipulation by using trajectory modulation instead of traditional grip force modulation to prevent object slippage. This method, inspired by human handling techniques, allows robots to adjust their movements in real-time based on predicted slip events, significantly improving grasp stability and reducing the risk of damaging fragile objects. The study demonstrates that this predictive control framework can outperform conventional grip-force-based strategies, making it a promising advancement for robotics in various applications.",
