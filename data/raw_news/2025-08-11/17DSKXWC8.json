  "content": "Over a recent dinner at his private Bedminster, New Jersey, club, as President Donald Trump recounted his move against the country\u2019s top economic statistician and riffed on New York City politics, the conversation turned to a politically potent issue still in flux: loosening federal restrictions on marijuana.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at that,\u201d Trump acknowledged to the small gathering of donors, according to two people in attendance. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re going to look at.\u201d\n\nNearly a year ago, Trump suggested his return to the White House would usher in a new era for marijuana, one that would make it easier for adults to access safe products and give states greater leeway to pursue legalization. He signaled support for removing marijuana from the same legal category as dangerous narcotics like heroin. The pronouncement set him apart from many of his Republican predecessors and came as Trump courted younger Americans, minority groups and libertarian-leaning voters.\n\nBut seven months into his second term, Trump\u2019s inaction so far on marijuana remains a notable unkept commitment by a president who has acted swiftly on other campaign pledges.\n\nBehind the scenes, the issue has exposed sharp fault lines within Trump\u2019s team. Trump\u2019s top political advisers, who have led an aggressive push to check off campaign promises, have urged action, according to two people familiar with the internal discussions. They have argued that such a move could help bolster Republican support ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nOther policy advisers, though, remain wary, cautioning that the moral and legal ramifications of loosening marijuana restrictions could outweigh the potential gains and even backfire politically .\n\nIn a statement to CNN, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that when it comes to marijuana, \u201call policy and legal requirements and implications are being considered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only interest guiding the president\u2019s policy decision is what is in the best interest of the American people,\u201d she said.\n\nIntensifying deliberations are happening as mixed signals are being telegraphed publicly on what Trump might do next.\n\nScotts Miracle-Gro CEO James Hagedorn told Fox Business last week that Trump has privately assured him and others \u201cmultiple times\u201d that he plans to reclassify marijuana to a less controlled category of substances. The 157-year-old lawn and garden giant has become a leader in the nascent cannabis industry, with a fast-growing hydroponics business that Federal Election Commission records show donated $500,000 to a Trump-aligned super PAC last year.\n\nBut reforming marijuana policy was noticeably absent from the top objectives recently published by Trump\u2019s newly installed head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terrance Cole.\n\n\u201cI think what (Cole) needs to hear is a call from the president or the chief of staff saying, \u2018This is a promise he made during the campaign, and promises made are promises kept, \u2018\u201d he told Fox Business.\n\nThat \u201cpromise\u201d from Trump, as Hagedorn cast it, arrived in a social media message last year during the closing months of his presidential campaign, when he was aggressively pushing to expand his coalition beyond traditional GOP voters.\n\nWriting on Truth Social in September, Trump announced he intended to vote for a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in his home state of Florida. Trump then added that, as president, he would \u201ccontinue to focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug.\u201d\n\nMarijuana is currently classified as a Schedule 1 drug \u2013 the federal category for illicit substances with \u201cno currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\u201d Moving it to Schedule 3, which the DEA defines as \u201cdrugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence,\u201d is something Trump has said he supports.\n\n\u201cAs I have previously stated, I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,\u201d Trump also wrote in the post.\n\nHe even discussed the topic with Joseph Edgar Foreman, the pro-pot rapper better known as Afroman, when the two both appeared last summer at the Libertarian Party Convention in Washington, DC.\n\nFor a time, it seemed change could come before the 2024 election.\n\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden ordered the departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to review whether marijuana should be reclassified. The next year, HHS recommended moving marijuana to Schedule 3 and in 2024 the Department of Justice initiated a new rule to codify the proposal. Biden called the move \u201cmonumental\u201d and a \u201cmajor step.\u201d\n\nBut momentum stalled and Biden left office before the rule could be finalized. A hearing the DEA scheduled for the day after Trump took office was canceled and hasn\u2019t been rescheduled.\n\nIn her statement, Jackson, the White House spokeswoman, noted that the current administration is still contending with the process initiated under Biden. One White House official suggested that executive action is unlikely until that is settled. The DEA did not respond to questions from CNN.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks at the recent Bedminster donor dinner underscore the expectation that the president, not anyone else, will ultimately decide whether to overhaul decades of marijuana policy in the United States.\n\nPrivately, the White House has spent months researching whether and how to move ahead. Chief of Staff Susie Wiles requested affected agencies to weigh in and their responses, compiled by Trump\u2019s Domestic Policy Council, now sit in a report on her desk, two people with knowledge of the report told CNN.\n\nOne issue raised in ongoing deliberations is whether reclassifying marijuana would undermine law enforcement\u2019s ability to use the smell of marijuana as probable cause for stops and searches, one of the people said. For Trump, whose tough-on-crime platform has emphasized empowering police to pursue drug offenders, that concern could emerge as a flashpoint.\n\nThen there\u2019s Trump\u2019s personal views. While Trump\u2019s public posture on marijuana use has softened in recent years, he remains a known teetotaler whose opinions on drug use were dramatically shaped by his late brother\u2019s alcohol addiction.\n\nIn remarks captured on video in 2018, Trump shared other \u2013 unproven \u2013 concerns about the drug.\n\n\u201cIn Colorado, they have more accidents,\u201d Trump said in the video. \u201cIt does cause an I.Q. problem.\u201d\n\nProponents of a change have been publicly and privately urging Trump to commit to rescheduling marijuana, arguing it would open research opportunities, create jobs and give clarity to millions of patients in states that have legalized medicinal marijuana, including many veterans.\n\nIn April, CNN reported that a group backed by the cannabis industry, American Rights and Reform PAC, aired pro-marijuana ads specifically targeting Trump\u2019s TVs at the White House and Mar-a-Lago. The PAC also donated $1 million in March to MAGA, Inc., a Trump aligned super PAC, recent FEC records show. In 2024, the marijuana company Trulieve and the US Cannabis Council contributed a combined $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nOther influential voices have urged action as well. Podcaster Joe Rogan, a key supporter during the presidential campaign, reiterated his call to legalize marijuana on his show last month. And Alex Bruesewitz, the Gen Z Trump adviser who spearheaded the Republican\u2019s courtship of young men last year, has also taken to social media lately to urge for a policy change on marijuana, suggesting it has widespread support. He called rescheduling marijuana a \u201cno brainer.\u201d\n\nNearly 60% of Americans support legalization of recreational marijuana against just 11% of people who think it shouldn\u2019t be legal for any purpose, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center survey.\n\nRecent polls suggest the president is at risk of losing support among young men as Rogan and other \u201cmanosphere\u201d influencers grow disenchanted by Trump\u2019s return to Washington. A high-profile change in marijuana policy could provide an avenue to win them back.\n\nIn a memo reported by CNN earlier this year, top Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio and his partners wrote that changing marijuana policy was \u201can easy way to attract the voters needed to win in 2026, particularly young voters.\u201d",

Please contact webmaster@usdoj.gov if you have any questions about the archive site.\nThe Justice Department today announced that the Attorney General has submitted to the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking initiating a formal rulemaking process to consider moving marijuana from a schedule I to schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).\nMarijuana has been classified as a schedule I drug since Congress enacted the CSA in 1970. On Oct. 6, 2022, President Biden asked the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to launch a scientific review of how marijuana is scheduled under federal law. After receiving HHS\u2019s recommendations last August, the Attorney General sought the legal advice of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) on questions relevant to this rulemaking. In light of HHS\u2019 medical and scientific determinations, and OLC\u2019s legal advice, the Attorney General exercised his authority under the law to initiate the rulemaking process to transfer marijuana to schedule III.\nThe rescheduling of a controlled substance follows a formal rulemaking procedure that requires notice to the public, and an opportunity for comment and an administrative hearing. This proposal starts the process, where the Drug Enforcement Administration will gather and consider information and views submitted by the public, in order to make a determination about the appropriate schedule. During that process, and until a final rule is published, marijuana remains a schedule I controlled substance.\nThe notice of proposed rulemaking submitted by the Department can be viewed here, and the OLC memorandum regarding questions related to the potential rescheduling of marijuana can be found here.\nLearn more about the rulemaking process here."

      "text": "Justin Centers fits the profile of many younger men who helped power Donald Trump\u2019s political comeback last fall.\nHe\u2019s a 21-year-old autoworker from the Detroit suburbs and was newly eligible to vote in presidential elections \u2014 a cross-section of traits Trump aggressively targeted in his bid to reclaim battlegrounds like Michigan. He\u2019s also a longtime fan of Theo Von, the shaggy-haired, free-wheeling comedian and podcast host whose viral interview with Trump last August signaled an emerging political shift among millennial and Gen Z men.\nCenters ultimately voted for Trump, and Von had a VIP seat at the inauguration. But in recent months, Von has expressed growing dissatisfaction with Trump\u2019s second stint in the White House \u2014 sentiments that were echoed by Centers outside Detroit\u2019s Fox Theatre as he waited to catch Von\u2019s stand-up tour.\n\u201cCompletely being honest, I\u2019m a little iffy now,\u201d Centers said of the president. \u201cOne of the things I primarily voted for was \u2018No new wars,\u2019 and unfortunately, that has been a big lie to my face. So, it\u2019s extremely disappointing to see that.\u201d\nAfter losing men under 50 by double digits in 2020, Trump\u2019s campaign made a concerted push to reverse that trend. His outreach included appearances on podcasts and YouTube shows hosted by a growing universe of male comedians, pranksters, streamers and other right-leaning influencers who had cultivated large, loyal followings. The approach paid off and has already spawned copycats in both parties.\nLately some of the most influential voices within the so-called manosphere have begun expressing concerns, if not outright regret, with Trump\u2019s return to Washington.\nJoe Rogan, who interviewed Trump on his top-rated podcast last October before endorsing him, recently called the new administration\u2019s immigration crackdown \u201cinsane.\u201d Von criticized Trump\u2019s bombing of Iran as a \u201chorrible idea,\u201d saying it made the US look like it\u2019s \u201cworking for Israel.\u201d Billionaire X owner Elon Musk, once a prominent Trump ally and a key figure in reshaping the online media ecosystem, is now publicly warring with the president over the cost of his legislative agenda and promising to bankroll a third party. And comedian Andrew Schulz, a Trump supporter last year, told listeners of his \u201cFlagrant\u201d podcast that the president was \u201cdoing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\u201d\nEven unexpected corners of the manosphere have begun to show signs of revolt. Professional poker players, for example, have lashed out at Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d for changes in tax law that will require them to pay the government even when they lose money.\n\u201cYou just really start to feel very disillusioned pretty quickly,\u201d Von said in a recent podcast.\nWarning signs\nAt Von\u2019s recent Detroit show, Carhartt logos, camo and mullets mixed easily with A-frame hats, golf polos and tins of nicotine pouches. Plumes of vape periodically hovered over the audience. The crowd\u2019s overwhelmingly White complexion was a reoccurring source of material for the comedian.\nDuring a rollicking 90-minute set, Von didn\u2019t directly broach politics or Trump. But the conflicting feelings he has shared on his podcast were voiced by his fans, too.\nSteven Deuby, a 34-year-old mail carrier from Wayne County, scoffed at the price tag of Trump\u2019s massive tax cuts and spending package. \u201cFive trillion dollars? That\u2019s insane,\u201d he said.\nBut Deuby, an Army veteran, said he backed Trump\u2019s military moves to date and remained supportive of the president overall.\n\u201cThere\u2019s stuff to criticize about Trump, but for the most part, I think he\u2019s doing much more important (stuff) than Joe Biden,\u201d Deuby said.\nWalking up to the Fox Theatre in a Von T-shirt, Tyler Goldsmith said he understood the complaints from Von and others, but would give Trump the benefit of the doubt for now.\n\u201cWhen you go into your first year, you\u2019re not going to do what everybody wanted you to at the beginning, because there are going to be things that you have to retract on, that you have to take care of,\u201d Goldsmith, a 32-year-old lawn-care business owner from Constantine in southwest Michigan.\nPolls midway through Trump\u2019s first year back in office suggest growing disapproval with his administration \u2014 and there are signs the shift is hitting these younger voters, too. A new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds that among men younger than 35, 40% approve of the way Trump is handling his job now and 60% disapprove, significantly worse than Trump\u2019s ratings with older men. In February, 44% of men under 35 approved and 54% disapproved.\nBut whether this disenchantment presents trouble for Republicans or creates an opening for Democrats remains to be seen.\nWhile the concerns that are animating Von and other online influencers may produce compelling podcast content, they are less likely to dictate how young men vote in future elections, said David Winston, a veteran Republican pollster. Economic factors like wages and inflation weighed heavily on the minds of many voters last fall and likely will moving forward, he said.\n\u201cWhen a voter has just gone a different direction, they\u2019re the ones that can go back the other way. They just made a decision and now they\u2019re going to see if that worked or it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Winston said. \u201cThe idea that they could bounce back to Democrats is certainly very possible. Having said that, they left for a reason.\u201d\nCenters, for his part, voiced frustrations on several fronts. He\u2019s a recent Tesla owner concerned Trump\u2019s vendetta against electric vehicles will ultimately hurt his purchase. He\u2019s also an expecting father who is worried about having a family in an economic environment he doesn\u2019t believe is improving.\nStill, Centers said he was unlikely to change to vote Democrat.\n\u201cA lot of stuff I identify with falls along the conservative agenda,\u201d he said.\nAnger over Epstein\nWhite House advisers have long held concerns that many voters who helped elect Trump in November \u2014 including young men \u2014 are at risk of skipping a midterm election when he isn\u2019t on the ballot. Motivating those voters has been a top priority for Trump\u2019s political team as it seeks to maintain control of Congress.\nMark Mitchell, the top pollster for the conservative-leaning Rasmussen Reports, has publicly warned that the Trump\u2019s coalition could be fractured by his administration\u2019s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, a longtime fixation for Rogan and other right-leaning podcasters favored by men.\nThe Department of Justice concluded last week the accused sex trafficker killed himself in prison and did not keep a list of elite and high-profile clients, sparking outrage from MAGA conspiracists who had long been told otherwise by many in Trump\u2019s orbit.\nThe CNN poll found 65% of men younger than 35 are dissatisfied with the amount of information the federal government has released about the Epstein case, while just 10% are satisfied. That\u2019s higher than the share of dissatisfied among the general population.\n\u201cWhat is enraging people right now is it\u2019s insulting our intelligence,\u201d Schulz said on his podcast last week.\nOn Saturday, Trump urged his supporters to move on from their Epstein outrage in a lengthy social media post \u2014 a message that landed poorly among some of Von\u2019s fans.\n\u201cYou said you were going to show us (the Epstein files), now you\u2019re just being the very thing you said you were going to end,\u201d said Ben, a chemical worker from Battle Creek, Michigan, who asked CNN not to use his last name. \u201cNot as transparent as what I thought.\u201d\nHe said Trump\u2019s posture on Epstein was the final straw. If he could go back, \u201cmaybe I just wouldn\u2019t vote,\u201d he said.\nDemocrats wade in\nAmid the discontent, Democrats have sought to make inroads into the manosphere.\nFormer Transportation Secretary and potential 2028 contender Pete Buttigieg appeared earlier this year on \u201cFlagrant.\u201d Multiple outlets reported that Rogan recently interviewed Texas state Rep. James Talarico, a rising Democratic star considering a Senate bid. Von recently spoke at length with Rep. Ro Khanna, the progressive Democrat from California, and revealed he planned to chat with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, before a scheduling conflict postponed their conversation. (He also released an episode with Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican whom Trump has threatened to help defeat.)\nSchulz recently suggested democratic socialists like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders appear to be prioritizing America more than Trump.\n\u201cIf MAGA wants to take this \u2018America First\u2019 thing back, they got to start looking out for America,\u201d he said.\nGiving airtime to politicians across the spectrum isn\u2019t just a pivot from the Trump-centric content of the previous election cycle. Many of the most prominent male influencers dub themselves as independent thinkers unbeholden to either party.\nRegardless, Nathan Sheldon, a 35-year-old from Northville, Michigan, sporting a \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Comedy\u201d shirt at Von\u2019s show, told CNN he appreciated hearing from Democrats in full, unfiltered interviews.\n\u201cThem going on to platforms like Schulz and Rogan, I can finally hear some ideas,\u201d Sheldon said. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to stand out.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report."

      "text": "President Donald Trump as a candidate vowed to decriminalize marijuana and make it easier for weed companies to obtain bank accounts and for universities to research the drug. Now, commercials carrying reminders of Trump\u2019s promises will air on televisions where the president spends most of his time.\nAmerican Rights and Reform PAC, a group backed by the cannabis industry, is planning a seven-figure ad campaign that is noticeably critical of two of Trump\u2019s regular fixations: former President Joe Biden and Canada. One ad attacks Biden\u2019s failure to fulfill a pledge to end decades of federal policy that treats marijuana like addictive and deadly narcotics such as heroin; the other says Canadians \u201ccash in\u201d on Washington\u2019s anti-marijuana policies by listing American cannabis companies on its stock exchange.\nBoth ads also laud Trump for championing patient access to experimental treatments in his first term and suggest that taking steps to ease federal marijuana restrictions would be in line with the president\u2019s agenda.\n\u201cThis an \u2018America first\u2019 fight,\u201d a narrator says in one ad. The other encourages viewers to push the White House to \u201cend Biden\u2019s war on medical cannabis.\u201d\nBiden said last year he supported decriminalizing marijuana. He also started (but didn\u2019t complete) the process of reclassifying it from a Schedule I narcotic \u2014 reserved for illicit substances with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse \u2014 to Schedule III, which are drugs that have some medical use and can be prescribed by a doctor.\nAmerican Rights and Reform PAC will spend more than $1 million airing the two 30-second spots on cable and streaming services over the next month in Washington, DC, near the White House and in the West Palm Beach media market surrounding Mar-a-Lago, where Trump has spent most weekends since taking office, a person familiar with the super PAC\u2019s plans told CNN. The ads will appear on digital devices as well.\nThe super PAC previously went by the name \u201cLegalize America,\u201d according to federal campaign finance records. A lobbyist for Curaleaf, a marijuana company based in New York, is listed as the organization\u2019s treasurer, and it is bankrolled by the cannabis industry.\nThe group is also circulating a survey from the firm of top Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio that argues there would be overwhelming support for the president to act on the promises he made last fall. In a memo from March 6 obtained by CNN, Fabrizio and his partners argue that Republican views on marijuana have flipped to favoring legalization of the drug, adding that \u201cthere is no significant political or demographic group that doesn\u2019t believe cannabis should be legal for consenting adults.\u201d\nThe findings of the poll are in line with a 2024 Pew Research Center survey which found that nearly 6 in 10 Americans support legalization of recreational marijuana and only 11 percent of people \u2014 and just 17 percent of Republicans \u2014 believe it shouldn\u2019t be legal for any purpose.\nPassing pro-marijuana legislation, Fabrizio and co. contend, is \u201can easy way to attract the voters needed to win in 2026, particularly young voters.\u201d\nTrump announced on social media in September that he intended to vote for a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in his home state of Florida. In the post, Trump also said that if elected he would push through a series of measures long-sought by proponents of weed, criminal justice advocates and the cannabis industry, such as allowing marijuana companies to access financial institutions and \u201csupporting states rights to pass marijuana laws.\u201d\nAfter winning the election, Trump and his transition team quietly backed an unsuccessful attempt to incorporate legislation easing restrictions on banking for marijuana companies into a December continuing resolution to fund the government, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations. A version of the bill, known as the SAFE Banking Act, has passed the House a handful of times but hasn\u2019t received Senate approval.\nWhile Trump has moved swiftly to fulfill other promises, his administration has yet to take steps to implement his marijuana-related campaign proposals. Discussions on marijuana that began during the transition largely stalled as the White House waited for the Senate to confirm Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will oversee the Drug Enforcement Administration as head of the Department of Justice.\nA White House official said \u201cno action is being considered at this time\u201d on marijuana.\nIn a process initiated under Biden, the DEA is currently reviewing marijuana\u2019s classification. A hearing to consider the change was slated for Jan. 21 \u2014 a day after Trump took office \u2014 but was canceled and hasn\u2019t been rescheduled.\nBondi has been less receptive to marijuana reforms than Trump\u2019s first choice for the job, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a longtime advocate of legalizing cannabis for recreational use. However, the hope among marijuana advocates and the industry is that Trump will move unilaterally and not allow a campaign promise to get bogged down by bureaucratic procedures set up by his predecessor and onetime political rival."

      "text": "Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand the public\u2019s views about the legalization of marijuana in the United States. For this analysis, we surveyed 5,140 adults from Jan. 16 to Jan. 21, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.\nHere are the questions used for the report and its methodology.\nAs more states pass laws legalizing marijuana for recreational use, Americans continue to favor legalization of both medical and recreational use of the drug.\nAn overwhelming share of U.S. adults (88%) say marijuana should be legal for medical or recreational use.\nNearly six-in-ten Americans (57%) say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes, while roughly a third (32%) say that marijuana should be legal for medical use only.\nJust 11% of Americans say that the drug should not be legal at all.\nOpinions about marijuana legalization have changed little over the past five years, according to the Pew Research Center survey, conducted Jan. 16-21, 2024, among 5,14o adults.\nThe impact of legalizing marijuana for recreational use\nWhile a majority of Americans continue to say marijuana should be legal, there are varying views about the impacts of recreational legalization.\nAbout half of Americans (52%) say that legalizing the recreational use of marijuana is good for local economies; just 17% think it is bad and 29% say it has no impact.\nMore adults also say legalizing marijuana for recreational use makes the criminal justice system more fair (42%) than less fair (18%); 38% say it has no impact.\nHowever, Americans have mixed views on the impact of legalizing marijuana for recreational use on:\n- Use of other drugs: About as many say it increases (29%) as say it decreases (27%) the use of other drugs, like heroin, fentanyl and cocaine (42% say it has no impact).\n- Community safety: More Americans say legalizing recreational marijuana makes communities less safe (34%) than say it makes them safer (21%); 44% say it has no impact.\nPartisan differences on impact of recreational use of marijuana\nThere are deep partisan divisions regarding the impact of marijuana legalization for recreational use.\nMajorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say legalizing recreational marijuana is good for local economies (64% say this) and makes the criminal justice system fairer (58%).\nFewer Republicans and Republican leaners say legalization for recreational use has a positive effect on local economies (41%) and the criminal justice system (27%).\nRepublicans are more likely than Democrats to cite downsides from legalizing recreational marijuana:\n- 42% of Republicans say it increases the use of other drugs, like heroin, fentanyl and cocaine, compared with just 17% of Democrats.\n- 48% of Republicans say it makes communities less safe, more than double the share of Democrats (21%) who say this.\nDemographic, partisan differences in views of marijuana legalization\nSizable age and partisan differences persist on the issue of marijuana legalization though small shares of adults across demographic groups are completely opposed to it.\nOlder adults are far less likely than younger adults to favor marijuana legalization.\nThis is particularly the case among adults ages 75 and older: 31% say marijuana should be legal for both medical and recreational use.\nBy comparison, half of adults between the ages of 65 and 74 say marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use, and larger shares in younger age groups say the same.\nRepublicans continue to be less supportive than Democrats of legalizing marijuana for both legal and recreational use: 42% of Republicans favor legalizing marijuana for both purposes, compared with 72% of Democrats.\nThere continue to be ideological differences within each party:\n- 34% of conservative Republicans say marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use, compared with a 57% majority of moderate and liberal Republicans.\n- 62% of conservative and moderate Democrats say marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use, while an overwhelming majority of liberal Democrats (84%) say this.\nViews of marijuana legalization vary by age within both parties\nAlong with differences by party and age, there are also age differences within each party on the issue.\nA 57% majority of Republicans ages 18 to 29 favor making marijuana legal for medical and recreational use, compared with 52% among those ages 30 to 49 and much smaller shares of older Republicans.\nStill, wide majorities of Republicans in all age groups favor legalizing marijuana at least for medical use. Among those ages 65 and older, just 20% say marijuana should not be legal even for medical purposes.\nWhile majorities of Democrats across all age groups support legalizing marijuana for medical and recreational use, older Democrats are less likely to say this.\nAbout half of Democrats ages 75 and older (53%) say marijuana should be legal for both purposes, but much larger shares of younger Democrats say the same (including 81% of Democrats ages 18 to 29). Still, only 7% of Democrats ages 65 and older think marijuana should not be legalized even for medical use, similar to the share of all other Democrats who say this.\nViews of the effects of legalizing recreational marijuana among racial and ethnic groups\nSubstantial shares of Americans across racial and ethnic groups say when marijuana is legal for recreational use, it has a more positive than negative impact on the economy and criminal justice system.\nEconomy\nAbout half of White (52%), Black (53%) and Hispanic (51%) adults say legalizing recreational marijuana is good for local economies. A slightly smaller share of Asian adults (46%) say the same.\nCriminal justice\nAcross racial and ethnic groups, about four-in-ten say that recreational marijuana being legal makes the criminal justice system fairer, with smaller shares saying it would make it less fair.\nHowever, there are wider racial differences on questions regarding the impact of recreational marijuana on the use of other drugs and the safety of communities.\nUse of other drugs\nNearly half of Black adults (48%) say recreational marijuana legalization doesn\u2019t have an effect on the use of drugs like heroin, fentanyl and cocaine. Another 32% in this group say it decreases the use of these drugs and 18% say it increases their use.\nIn contrast, Hispanic adults are slightly more likely to say legal marijuana increases the use of these other drugs (39%) than to say it decreases this use (30%); 29% say it has no impact.\nAmong White adults, the balance of opinion is mixed: 28% say marijuana legalization increases the use of other drugs and 25% say it decreases their use (45% say it has no impact). Views among Asian adults are also mixed, though a smaller share (31%) say legalization has no impact on the use of other drugs.\nCommunity safety\nHispanic and Asian adults also are more likely to say marijuana\u2019s legalization makes communities less safe: 41% of Hispanic adults and 46% of Asian adults say this, compared with 34% of White adults and 24% of Black adults.\nWide age gap on views of impact of legalizing recreational marijuana\nYoung Americans view the legalization of marijuana for recreational use in more positive terms compared with their older counterparts.\nClear majorities of adults under 30 say it is good for local economies (71%) and that it makes the criminal justice system fairer (59%).\nBy comparison, a third of Americans ages 65 and older say legalizing the recreational use of marijuana is good for local economies; about as many (32%) say it makes the criminal justice system more fair.\nThere also are sizable differences in opinion by age about how legalizing recreational marijuana affects the use of other drugs and the safety of communities."

  "argos_summary": "During a recent dinner, President Donald Trump expressed a willingness to reconsider federal marijuana restrictions, a topic he previously supported during his campaign. Despite this, his administration has yet to take significant action on marijuana policy, leading to internal divisions among his advisors regarding the potential political implications of such reforms. As public support for marijuana legalization grows, particularly among younger voters, there are concerns that Trump's inaction could alienate this demographic ahead of the midterm elections.",
