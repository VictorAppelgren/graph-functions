      "feedback": "The current draft nears coherence on near‑term inflation and policy but fails the multi‑year, first‑principles framing the SECTION FOCUS requires; upgrade by embedding a formal anchors box (tariff‑inflation‑policy reaction, price transmission, and macro regime logic) anchored to the available numbers (CPI around 2.8–2.9% YoY and core ~3.1% in July; Fed target band 4.25–4.50% with markets pricing an 86% chance of the first cut in September; Ford data such as 17% YTD gain, Q2 adjusted operating margin of 4.3%, ROIC 10.1%, and a $1.3B EV loss; CATL lithium mine halt and Albemarle up ~7% on that news; TKO/Paramount UFC deal worth $7.7B total and ~$1.1B/year; Nvidia/AMD 15% of China chip revenues for export licenses) and then map regimes and transition conditions. Specify four regimes (e.g., Regime 1: inflation remains above target with slow Fed easing; Regime 2: inflation is contained and early rate cuts occur; Regime 3: EV/critical raw‑material supply constraints widen; Regime 4: growth and demand cycle turns decisively negative) with explicit transition triggers (CPI surprises, Fed communications, lithium/semiconductor supply shifts, or tariff announcements) and the causal chain from policy to pricing to equities. Rebuild the causal chain into a clean transmission map: tariffs push consumer prices (CPI/core) → Fed reaction/forward guidance → risk premia and equity multiples (noting the 86% odds of a September cut) → valuation re‑pricing in tech/semis and in autos (Ford’s cyclical, low‑margin profile with 17% YTD gain but 4.3% margin and 10.1% ROIC; EV losses amid a mature auto cycle); EV/materials channels (CATL mine halt implying lithium price risk and Albemarle +7%) and IP/AI capex implications (Nvidia/AMD 15% China revenue sharing) as distinct transmission lanes (95HSFUG7Z). Quantify base‑case with explicit numbers pulled from sources and attach citations after each claim (e.g., CPI/core levels and Fed rate band from 95HSFUG7Z; rate‑cut odds from 95HSFUG7Z; Ford metrics 22PL3Q360; CATL/CATL‑related lithium risk and Albemarle move from 95HSFUG7Z; UFC/Paramount deal figures from 95HSFUG7Z; chip‑export constraints from 95HSFUG7Z; auto industry mechanics and EV profitability from 22PL3Q360). Address conflicts by presenting two reconciled interpretations: (a) the Ford EV push remains unprofitable in the near term but Ford still benefits from F‑series cyclicality and cash generation; (b) the broader EV transition could improve profitability if scale and pricing power emerge, though that is not guaranteed (consistently tie to 22PL3Q360). Improve structure, brevity, and focus by: (i) adding a distinct “First‑principles anchors” section; (ii) a concise “Regime map and transitions” section; (iii) a tight “Base case, catalysts, and watch list” section; (iv) a short, explicit “what could invalidate the thesis” subsection with trigger thresholds; (v) a clean, source‑tight citation plan that uses only IDs 95HSFUG7Z and 22PL3Q360 after each relevant factual assertion; and (vi) a dedicated uncertainty budget (probabilities by regime, sensitivity to ±10% in EV margins or lithium prices) to raise the analysis to world‑class quality.",
