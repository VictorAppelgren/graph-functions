      "summary": "Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un’s joint appearance at Beijing’s military parade projected a united front against the West, but analysts argue it merely signals a symbolic alliance rather than a functional bloc.  No substantive defense cooperation emerged, and the leaders’ relationship remains largely bilateral, with limited trilateral coordination.  The event coincided with Russia‑China gas pipeline talks and other bilateral deals, but it does not alter the broader geopolitical balance.  U.S. officials view the display as a propaganda exercise that does not materially change the strategic landscape.",
