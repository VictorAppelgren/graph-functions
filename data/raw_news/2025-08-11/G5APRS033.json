  "description": "A money shift refers to sudden, catastrophic engine damage that can be caused by downshifting at high RPM instead of moving to a higher gear.",
  "content": "Money shifting sounds like some kind of dodgy business that goes down on Wall Street, but it couldn't be further from that. For those who drive stick, it's a costly mistake to avoid at all costs. A \"money shift\" refers to the accidental downshifting of a manual transmission into too low a gear while the car is traveling at high speed \u2014 typically when a driver intends to shift up but instead misplaces the shifter, which then results in catastrophic damage to the engine. It's important to note that downshifting into too low a gear while at high speeds doesn't always end badly; the money shift only happens when there is serious and costly damage to the car, hence the term \"money\" shift.\n\nThe damage can be instant and catastrophic. A money shift forces the engine to spin far beyond its redline, sometimes jumping by 3,000 RPM or more in the blink of an eye. The sudden over-revving can cause serious damage to the engine, like bent valves, snapped connecting rods, or it can even destroy the crankshaft entirely. The engine will need a complete rebuild or replacement in most cases. It's not just the engine that suffers either, as the drivetrain components can also be collateral damage, depending on the severity of the shift.\n\nEven modern vehicles with rev limiters aren't immune. Rev limiters work during acceleration, not forced over-revving from a lower gear. Once the wrong gear is engaged, the mechanical energy from the wheels drives the engine past its limits. Avoiding money shifting is manual driving 101 as it's the mechanical equivalent of a sudden and violent sucker punch.",

The damage can be instant and severe, and even more severe, can lead to a complete rebuild or replacement.
