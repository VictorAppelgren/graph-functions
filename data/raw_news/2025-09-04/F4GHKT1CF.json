  "title": "Swiss Inflation Holds Steady as SNB Mulls Rate Cut Below Zero",
  "description": "",
  "content": "Swiss annual inflation held at a low level in August, keeping the country's central bank on guard as it considers cutting its key interest rate to below zero later this month.\n\nConsumer prices were 0.2% higher than the same month of last year, matching July's rate, Switzerland's statistics office said Thursday. That remains within the Swiss National Bank's target of positive inflation lower than 2%.\n\nThe SNB meets later in September, with most investors currently expecting it to hold its key rate at 0%. The central bank last cut its key rate in June as it sought to rein in appreciation of the Swiss franc, which had acted as a safe haven for investors amid the turmoil of increased trade tariffs and Middle East tensions. A higher franc makes exports more expensive for foreign importers. The dollar has lost around 10% against the franc in the last six months.\n\nThe bank at its last meeting in June forecast average annual inflation at 0.2% for 2025, before rising to 0.5% and 0.7% for 2026 and 2027, respectively, should interest rates be left at zero until then.",
