  "title": "Is Instagram Map showing your location? How to check and turn it off",
  "description": "Instagram could be sharing your precise location whenever you open the app, but it's off by default and requires opt-in. Here's how to see what you're sharing and with whom.",
  "content": "\u2022 Location sharing is off by default and requires opt-in.\n\u2022 You can turn off Map sharing and block location access entirely.\n\nInstagram recently added a new Map feature. At first, it seemed neat. Similar to Snapchat's Snap Map, it shows your precise last-active location, as well as any content with a location tag, such as Reels, posts, and Stories from people you follow, which are all available on the Map for 24 hours after they're posted. But, over the weekend, I noticed a ton of backlash on social media.\n\nIt seems not everyone wants a map that highlights their real-time location or location-tagged content. Some users seem annoyed, while others are raising alarm bells about potential doxing and privacy risks, including stalking.\n\nAlso: How Instagram is using AI to uncover teen accounts lying about their age\n\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri has responded to the criticism, saying location sharing is not turned on by default, and you must opt in for the Map feature to access your location. He also confirmed his team is working on \"improvements\" that should roll out soon.\n\nIn the meantime, if you feel Instagram's new Map feature is more invasive than it is useful, you can turn it off completely and block the app from accessing your phone's location. Here's how.\n\nYou can turn off precise location sharing First, let's look at Instagram Map to see who, if anyone, you're sharing your location with right now. If you choose to share your location with friends, close friends, or select friends, your precise location will update on the Map every time you open Instagram, but it will disappear if you don't open the app again for 24 hours. How to turn off Instagram Map location sharing:\n\u2022 Open Instagram and tap the Messages icon in the top right of your feed.\n\u2022 Tap Map at the top of your inbox. (If it's your first time using Map, dismiss the \"Introducing Instagram Map\" pop-up by tapping Not now, and then tap Map at the top of your inbox.)\n\u2022 Tap the Settings icon in the top right.\n\u2022 Under \"Who can see your location,\" select No one. You may be asked to specify a time frame. You can choose \"Until I turn it back on.\"\n\u2022 Tap Update or Done at the bottom to save your changes. Also: How to delete Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram - if you want Meta out of your life This setting controls whether your friends can see your precise, last-active location on the Map. If you've never given Instagram permission to use your location, the Map feature will already be disabled by default. Show more\n\nThere a couple of ways you can access Instagram Map:\n\u2022 DM Inbox: Tap the Map icon at the top of your Direct Messages tab to launch the interactive map.\n\u2022 Story or post: Tap the location tag in a Story or Post, and then Instagram will open the Map view for that place. Also: Best data removal services: Delete yourself from the internet Is Instagram Map's location sharing on by default? No. You have to opt in before anyone can see your precise, last-active location in Instagram Map. Can strangers see my real-time location? Not unless you share it. Map only shares your precise, last-active location with friends you've approved. You can set it to \"No one.\" How often does Instagram Map update my shared location? Instagram has said your location updates every time you open the app, and it disappears after 24 hours if you haven't been active. Why am I seeing people on my Map who haven't opted in? According to Instagram head Adam Mosseri, people are seeing location-tagged posts and Reels on Map and assuming that means their live location is being tracked. \"Your last reel is showing up on the map, not your current location. Your live location is not being shared, and it will never be unless you decide to share it,\" Mosseri wrote on Threads. So, if you tag a location in content, it will appear on the map for 24 hours -- but this does not share your precise, last-active location (which is what Mosseri calls \"live location\"). If I tag a location in a post, will it show up on the Map? Yes, if your account is public, then tagged posts and Stories can appear on the Map. Can I hide certain locations or places from some people? Yes, you have the option to choose up to three places to set as hidden. When you're at a hidden place, no one will see you on the map. You can also choose specific people to hide your location from.\n\u2022 Open Instagram and tap the Messages icon in the top right of your feed.\n\u2022 Tap Map at the top of your inbox.\n\u2022 Tap the Settings icon in the top right and then Options.\n\u2022 Add a hidden place: Tap Add, drag a pin to the map, click next, and done.\n\u2022 You can then go back to Options, tap, \"Hide from...,\" and choose accounts to hide your location.

      "text": "Instagram lets you see your friends' locations now, and vice versa - here's how\nZDNET's takeaways\n- Instagram is unveiling several new features.\n- Its new Snapchat-style map lets you see where your friends are.\n- There's also a new way to see content your friends are interacting with.\nMeta has unveiled a number of changes to Instagram, all aimed at helping you better connect with your friends and their favorite content. A new location-sharing map is on the way, along with new ways to find content.\nA Snapchat-style friend map\nMaybe the most useful feature is one taken directly from Snapchat (whose upcoming AR glasses are looking special): Instagram Map. This feature shares the last location you used the app with people you choose (followers you follow back, close friends, selected friends, or no one). You have to opt in and share your location with Instagram for your friends to see your location, and you can turn this off at any time, Meta says. You can also open the map at the top of your DMs list to see content from your friends.\nIf you're a parent of a teen account, you can control their location sharing. You'll get a notification if your teen starts sharing their location, and you can decide whether your teen has access to location sharing on the map and who your teen shares their location with.\nAlso: How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work\nWhether you're sharing your location or not, you can still use the map to explore content around you. You can browse stories from friends at a new restaurant, find a new hangout from a popular local creator, and more. Any content with a location tagged can show up on the map, Meta explained, including Reels, posts, and stories from people you follow. These will be available for 24 hours after they're posted.\nInstagram Map is rolling out today.\nLike what your friends are liking\nMeta is also introducing a new Friends tab in Reels.\nIn this tab, you'll see public content your friends have interacted with or recommendations from Blends you've started. The Friends tab will help you see which Reels your friends are creating and engaging with, Meta says, hopefully helping you connect a little more. Friends began rolling out earlier this year, but now it's launching globally. You have control over what's shown in the Friends tab, like the ability to hide your own likes and comments on Reels and to mute activity bubbles from specific people.\nAlso: How to delete Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram - if you want Meta out of your life\nYou'll find the Friends tab at the top of Reels. Tap the \"Reels\" tab to return to your usual Reels feed.\nRepost your favorite Reels and posts\nA new Repost feature lets you repost public Reels and feed posts, making it easier for you to share interests with friends. Reposts are recommended to your friends' and followers' feeds, but you can also find them in a separate tab.\nThe original poster will get credit, but content reposted by someone else might show up for that person's followers, even if those people don't follow the creator. To repost a Reel or post, tap the repost icon.\nYou can also add a note to your repost by typing into the thought bubble.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work\nFacebook has not been making friends lately with its policy changes. While some people have left, others find it hard to leave. It's where their friends and social groups -- from old co-workers to church members to fellow sufferers of obscure diseases -- are.\nAlso: The best data removal services in 2025: Delete yourself from the internet\nIn addition, Meta, Facebook's parent company, tracks your activity not just on Facebook, but across the internet with Meta's tracking pixel. If you'd rather not have Big Zucker looking over your shoulder, here's what you can do to limit how much Meta can track you.\nFacebook has been collecting data on you for years\nBefore getting into protecting your privacy, you should know what data Facebook has already been collecting data on you for years. Besides the obvious -- your name and that you liked Aunt Jodie's funny cat picture -- companies that use Facebook Business Tools, such as Facebook Pixel, the Facebook Software Development Kit (SDK), and Facebook Login and Account Kit, also share what they know about you with Facebook.\nSpecifically, Meta tracks when you're:\n- Opening an app\n- Logging into an app with Facebook\n- Viewing content\n- Searching for an item\n- Adding an item to a shopping cart\n- Making a purchase\n- Making a donation\n- When you've been naughty or nice\nOK, I made up the last one, but when you use Facebook, you really are giving up your privacy in ways that would make Santa Claus envious. Don't believe it? According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Facebook tracks you on 30% of the top 10,000 websites. On my own account, I see that Facebook and its partners have data on me from 955 apps and websites that I've used or visited in the last 180 days.\nThat includes every time I checked my Ring doorbell, the time I checked StubHub for WVU-Kansas basketball tickets, and how often I checked into Zillow when searching for a new home. And, of course, what sites I visit daily.\nAlso: What is DuckDuckGo? If you're into online privacy, try this popular Google alternative\nAlso keep in mind that things that sound like they help, such as clearing your Facebook history, may not help at all. Clearing your history, for example, doesn't delete anything. Instead, all it does is disconnect your activity history from your account. Meta will continue to receive your activity from the businesses and organizations you visit in the future.\nThe only real way out is to delete your Facebook account. But even then, Facebook says it will take up to 90 days to remove all your data. It may take longer. Much longer. In any case, Meta doesn't spell out what it does with your activity history.\nWhat doesn't work\nYou can turn off, sort of, the data Facebook and its partners share about you. But, even then, Facebook says: \"We'll still receive activity from whatever site. It may be used to measure and improve their ads, but it will be disconnected from your account.\" (You can believe Facebook if you like, but I'm inclined to doubt it.)\nNext, simply putting a post on your page that claims to be a legal notice forbidding Meta from using your personal data and photos won't help you a bit. No, I don't care who told you that this would work. It doesn't. Never has, never will.\nAlso: Stop exposing your Venmo activity - by changing this privacy setting. Here's why\nSo, what can you do? Well, first things first. Facebook has a bad habit of changing its menus. If the specific suggestions below don't work for you, use the Facebook search function to find the settings you're looking for.\nDon't share public posts - it's dangerous\nYou should be careful about what you share in the first place. If you really don't want people to know your favorite TV show is Happy Days, don't post about Richie Cunningham and The Fonz. That's a silly example, but I trust you get my point.\nAlso: Why you don't need to pay for antivirus software anymore\nRelated to this, if you're comfortable with, say, your friends knowing you won't be going to Great-Uncle Jack's fifth wedding but not the world at large, use the \"Post audience\" to restrict the people who can see your post to your friends or even more restricted groups, not the public.\nAdjust your default privacy settings for posts\nIndeed, unless you want everyone and anyone to see what you're up to, you should set your Facebook postings to always be for friends only. To do this, take the following steps:\n- Open the Facebook app or website.\n- Go to Settings & Privacy > Settings.\n- Navigate to Privacy Center.\n- Go to Common Privacy Settings.\n- Head to Manage Audience Settings.\n- Find \"Who can see your future posts?\"\n- Change this setting to \"Friends.\"\nThis ensures that all your future posts will be visible only to your friends by default.\nChange the privacy of your existing public or friends-of-friends posts\nWhat's that? You got years' worth of public posts that you'd rather not have public? Well, you can fix that too:\n- In the Privacy settings, locate Limit Past Posts.\n- Click on Limit Old Posts.\n- Confirm your choice.\nThis action will change all your past public and friends-of-friends posts to be visible only to friends.\nIt's not just Joe Random Snooper you need to worry about. Meta makes it easy for the company and its partners to use your information for anyone who uses its application programming interfaces (APIs), such as its Graph API, its Research Tools, and, of course, Facebook can use all your public data for AI at Meta.\nWhat else can you do to get Meta out of your hair?\nYou can control what you post and who sees it, but controlling what other people post about you is much harder.\nTake charge of who can tag you\nOne thing you can do, though, is take some control of the posts and images you're tagged in. To do this, take the following steps:\n- Click your profile picture in the top right of Facebook.\n- Select Settings & Privacy, then click Settings.\n- In the left column, click Profile and Tagging.\n- Click next to Review posts you're tagged in before the post appears on your profile? to turn this setting on or off.\nThis only controls, however, whether you allow their posts to show up on your profile.\nYou can (and should) also block users\nTo stop someone from tagging you at all, you need to block them using these steps:\n- Switch to the profile that you want to use.\n- Click your profile picture in the top right of Facebook.\n- Select Settings & Privacy, then click Settings.\n- In the left column, under Audience and Visibility, click Blocking.\n- In the Block Users section, click Edit.\n- Click Add to Blocked List.\n- Type the name of the profile you want to block.\n- Click Block next to their name.\n- Click Confirm.\nHow to control your Facebook apps\nFacebook apps, yes, even the FarmVille game you downloaded years ago, can spy on you. To control them and eliminate the ones you don't use, head over to Facebook's App Settings. Here, you can see the Facebook apps, games, and websites you've connected to your Facebook account. To control these, do the following:\n- Click your profile picture in the top right of Facebook.\n- Select Settings & Privacy, then click Settings.\n- Click Apps and Websites in the left side menu.\n- Scroll down to Preferences, then next to Apps, websites, and games, click Turn Off for each one.\nOr, instead of cherry-picking and disabling Facebook apps, you can choose to completely disable the Facebook app platform. This means you won't be able to use Facebook integrations on third-party apps or websites that access data through OAuth. This should cut down on the information you've been sharing with Meta.\nHow to manage your off-Facebook activity\nYou can also control how much of your information you're sharing with Meta's partners by going to the Off-Facebook Activity (OFA) page. To view this page, you may need to enter your Facebook password.\nOnce there, to see exactly what each one is up to in general terms, click on the ones you're concerned about. Since you probably have hundreds of them, I doubt you'll want to go through all of them.\nHowever, to quote Meta, \"We receive more details and activity than what appears here.\"\nRemember to turn off future activity\nFrom the Manage Your Off-Facebook Activity page, toward the bottom of the display, you can Turn off Future Activity. Again, that doesn't stop either Facebook or the company from getting your data; it just breaks, in theory, the connection between your Facebook identity and your data.\nAlso: Why you should power off your phone once a week - according to the NSA\nYou're not done yet. Head back once more to Manage Your Off-Facebook Activity. There, click on More Options in the right-hand column. Once that's done, toward the bottom of the column, you'll see a link to Manage Future Activity. Click on it, and you'll get another window with a button for, once again, Manage Future Activity.\nFrom here, you get an option: \"Your future off-Facebook activity saved with your account allows us to personalize your experience.\" If you turn this off, you'll more permanently break the connection between your account and everyone else. If you do this, you should know before doing this that you'll no longer be able to use Facebook to log into third-party websites.\nAt the end of all this, Facebook and friends will still be spying on you, but at least they'll be seeing through a dark glass instead of looking right at you.\nThe Meta-nuclear option\nIf you decide you want to get rid of Facebook once and for all, you can start by deactivating Facebook. This closes down your use of Facebook, but you can always come back to it. Unless you are absolutely sure you want to leave Facebook for good, I recommend deactivating it for a while to see if you'd miss it before deleting it forever.\nAlso: How to delete Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram\nDelete or deactivate Facebook\nYou take the same steps to do either one. These are:\n- Open the Facebook app or access Facebook through a web browser.\n- Tap or click on your profile picture in the top right corner.\n- Select Settings & Privacy, then click Settings.\n- In the left menu, click on Your Facebook Information or Accounts Center.\n- Select Personal Details under Account Settings.\n- Click on Account Ownership and Control.\n- Choose Deactivation or Deletion. If you deactivate it, you can always come back and bring it back again.\n- Select the account or profile you want to delete.\n- Click on Delete Account and then Continue.\n- You may be asked to enter your password to confirm your identity.\n- Optionally, you can select a reason for leaving Facebook.\n- Review your options, which may include downloading your information. Click Delete Account to confirm. Your account will be scheduled for permanent deletion after a 30-day grace period. During the grace period, you can log back in to cancel the deletion if you change your mind.\nThis is the only way out of Facebook that will truly protect your privacy. I know that's easier said than done, but it's the only way to be sure. Even then, however, Meta will keep its eye on you.\nMeta admits to keeping your data around for 90 days, but a recent security study found that Meta will keep all your data for 180 days. Still, it's truly your only option if you're fed up with Meta and want out. Good luck."

Open WhatsApp and go to Settings\nOnce you've opened and signed into the WhatsApp app on your phone, go to the Settings area to begin your account deletion process. On iPhone, tap the Settings tab located at the bottom-right corner of the screen. On Android, tap the More Options menu (three vertical dots) in the top-right corner and select Settings.\n2. Navigate to account deletion options\nNow you'll need to find the deletion options with your WhatsApp settings. On iPhone, go to Account and select Delete My Account. On Android, navigate to Account and tap Delete My Account.\nAlso: Halliday's new AI glasses are what Meta, Google, and Apple have been trying to build\n3. Provide your number\nWhatsApp requires that you enter your phone number and submit a reason for deletion. On iPhone, enter your phone number in full international format (e.g., +1 for the US), select a reason for deletion from the dropdown menu, and proceed to the next step. On Android, follow the same process: Enter your phone number in the required format, choose a reason, and continue.\n4. Confirm account deletion\nNow, to finish everything: On iPhone or Android, tap Delete My Account, and you'll complete the deletion process.\nFAQ\nDo you need to delete each Meta account separately?\nYes, unfortunately. Each of your accounts -- Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- must be deleted individually.\nCan you delete your Facebook and still keep Messenger?\nNo. If you want to keep Messenger, for whatever reason, you'll need to deactivate your Facebook account rather than delete it.\nDo you need a computer to delete your Meta accounts?\nYou can delete Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp directly from their respective apps on your phone. A computer is optional. However, you need the Messenger mobile app to delete your Messenger account if you've already deleted Facebook.\nAlso: Meta's latest update is a devastating blow to advertisers - what you need to know\nCan you recover your accounts after deleting them?\nNo. Once the deletion process is complete, your Meta accounts cannot be recovered. There is a grace period -- 30 days for Facebook and Instagram -- where you can log back in to cancel the deletion process, however. There is no grace period for deleting a WhatsApp account,\nWhat happens to your data after you delete your accounts?\nMeta says it retains some data for legal or operational purposes, but most of your content and personal data will be permanently deleted.\nWhat's the difference between deleting and deactivating?\nYou can deactivate Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, if you prefer that option instead.\nEach app has its own deactivation process. But essentially, once you deactivate your account -- specifically on Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp -- your profile and all its content will be temporarily hidden. (For Messenger, deactivation is tied to your Facebook account.) You can reactivate your profiles later on either app simply by logging back into the platform.\nDeleting your account is permanent, erasing all data and making recovery impossible after a certain grace period (e.g., 30 days for Facebook and WhatsApp). Deactivation is a good choice if you want a break but think you might return later, while deletion is if you're certain about leaving for good.\nFor step-by-step guidance on deactivating or deleting accounts, see the following resources pages:"

      "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-gpt-5s-coding-skills-and-it-was-so-bad-that-im-sticking-with-gpt-4o-for-now/",
      "text": "I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- OpenAI's new GPT-5 flagship failed half of my programming tests.\n- Previous OpenAI releases have had just about perfect results.\n- Now that OpenAI has enabled fallbacks to other LLMs, there are options.\nSo GPT-5 happened. It's out. It's released. It's the talk of the virtual town. And it's got some problems. I'm not gonna bury the lede. GPT-5 has failed half of my programming tests. That's the worst that OpenAI's flagship LLM has ever done on my carefully designed tests.\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)\nBefore I get into the details, let's take a moment to discuss one other little feature that's also a bit wonky. Check out the new Edit button on the top of the code dumps it generates.\nClicking the Edit button takes you into a nice little code editor. Here, I replaced the Author field, right in ChatGPT's results.\nThat seemed nice, but it ultimately proved futile. When I closed the editor, it asked me if I wanted to save. I did. Then this unhelpful message showed up.\nI never did get back to my original session. I had to submit my original prompt again, and let GPT-5 do its work a second time.\nBut wait. There's more. Let's dig into my test results\u2026\n1. Writing a WordPress plugin\nThis was my very first test of coding prowess for any AI. It's what gave me that first \"the world is about to change\" feeling, and it was done using GPT-3.5.\nSubsequent tests, using the same prompt but with different AI models, generated mixed results. Some AIs did great, some didn't. Some AIs, like those from Microsoft and Google, improved over time.\nAlso: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability - and you can, too\nChatGPT's model has been the gold standard for this test since the very beginning. That makes the results of GPT-5 all that much more curious.\nSo, look, the actual coding with GPT-5 was partially successful. GPT-5 generated a single block of code, which I pasted into a file and was able to run. It provided the requisite UI.\nWhen I pasted in the test names, it dynamically updated the line count, although it described it as \"Line to randomize\" instead of \"Lines to randomize.\"\nBut then, when I clicked Randomize, it didn't. Instead, it redirected me to tools.php. What?? ChatGPT has never had a problem with this test, whether GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or GPT-4o. You mean to tell me that OpenAI's much-anticipated GPT-5 is failing right out of the gate? Ouch.\nAlso: How to use GPT-5 in VS Code with GitHub Copilot\nI then gave GPT-5 this prompt.\nWhen I click randomize, I'm taken to http://testsite.local/wp-admin/tools.php. I do not get a list of randomized results. Can you fix?\nThe result was a line to patch. I'm not thrilled with that approach because it requires the user to dig through code and to make no mistakes replacing a line.\nSo, I asked GPT-5 for a full plugin. It gave me the full text of the plugin to copy and paste. This time, it worked.\nThis time, it did randomize the lines. When it encountered duplicates, it separated them from each other, as it was instructed. Finally.\nAlso: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time\nI'm sorry, OpenAI. I have to fail you on this test. You would have passed if the only error was not using the plural of \"line\" when appropriate. But the fact that it gave me back a non-working plugin on the first try is fail territory, even if the AI did eventually make it work on the second try.\nNo matter how you spin it, this is a step back.\n2. Rewriting a string function\nThis second test is designed to rewrite a string function to better check for dollars and cents. The original code that GPT-5 was asked to rewrite did not allow for cents (it only checked for integers).\nGPT-5 did fine with this test. It did return a minimal result because it didn't do any error checking. It didn't check for non-string input, extra whitespace, thousands separators, or currency symbols.\nBut that's not what I asked for. I told it to rewrite a function, which itself did not have any error checking. GPT-5 did exactly what I asked with no embellishment. I'm kind of glad of that because it doesn't know whether or not code prior to this routine already did that work.\nGPT-5 passed this test.\n3. Finding an annoying bug\nThis test came about because I was struggling with a less-than-obvious bug in my code. Without going into the weeds about how the WordPress framework works, the obvious answer is not the right answer.\nYou need some fairly arcane knowledge about how WordPress filters pass their information. This test has been a stumbling block for more than a few AI LLMs.\nAlso: Gen AI disillusionment looms, according to Gartner's 2025 Hype Cycle report\nGPT-5, however, like GPT-4 and GPT-4o before it, did understand the problem. It articulated a clear solution.\nGPT-5 passed this test.\n4. Writing a script\nThis test asks the AI to incorporate a fairly obscure Mac scripting tool called Keyboard Maestro, as well as Apple's scripting language AppleScript, and Chrome scripting behavior.\nIt's really a test of the reach of the AI in terms of knowledge, its understanding of how web pages are constructed, and the ability to write code across three interlinked environments.\nQuite a few AIs have failed this test, but the failure point is usually a lack of knowledge about Keyboard Maestro. GPT-3.5 didn't know about Keyboard Maestro. But ChatGPT has been passing this test since GPT-4. Until now.\nWhere should we start? Well, the good news is that GPT-5 handled the Keyboard Maestro part of the problem just fine. But it got the coding so wrong that it even doubled down on its lack of understanding of how case works in AppleScript.\nIt actually invented a property. This is one of those cases where an AI confidently presents an answer that is completely wrong.\nAlso: ChatGPT comes with personality presets now - and other upgrades you might have missed\nAppleScript is natively case-insensitive. If you want AppleScript to pay attention to case, you need to use a \"considering case\" block. So, this happened.\nThe reason the error message referred to the title of one of my articles is because that was the front window in Chrome. This function checks the front window and does stuff based on the title.\nBut misunderstanding how case works wasn't the only AppleScript error GPT-5 generated. It also referenced a variable named searchTerm without defining it. That's pretty much an error-creating practice in any programming language.\nFail, fail, fail, McFaildypants.\nThe internet hath spoken\nOpenAI seemed to suffer from the same hubris that its AIs do. It confidently moved everyone to GPT-5 and burned the bridges back to GPT-4o. I'm paying $200 a month for a ChatGPT Pro account. On Friday, I couldn't move back to GPT-4o for coding work. Neither could anyone else.\nThere was, however, just a tiny bit of user pushback on the whole bridges burning thing. And by tiny, I mean the entire frickin' internet. So, by Saturday, ChatGPT had a new option.\nTo get to this, go to your ChatGPT settings and turn on \"Show legacy models.\" Then, as it has always been, just drop down the model menu and choose the one you want. Note: this option is only available to those on paid tiers. If you're using ChatGPT for free, you'll take what you're given, and you'll love it.\nEver since the whole generative AI thing kicked off at the beginning of 2023, ChatGPT has been the gold standard of programming tools, at least according to my LLM testing.\nAlso: Microsoft rolls out GPT-5 across its Copilot suite - here's where you'll find it\nNow? I'm really not sure. This is only a day or so after GPT-5 has been released, so its results will probably get better over time. But for now, I'm sticking with GPT-4o for coding, although I do like the deep reasoning capabilities in GPT-5.\nWhat about you? Have you tried GPT-5 for programming tasks yet? Did it perform better or worse than previous versions like GPT-4o or GPT-3.5? Were you able to get working code on the first try, or GPT-4o did you have to guide it through fixes? Are you going to use GPT-5 for coding or stick with older models? Let us know in the comments below.\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

      "text": "Do you use Snapchat's AI chatbot? Here's the data it's pulling from you\nIn April, Snap made its AI-powered chatbot, My AI, available to Snapchat users. The company says over 150 million users have talked to the chatbot. Snap says that its AI chatbot is equipped with more guardrails than ChatGPT, which should make it safer for younger Snapchatters.\nAlso: The best parental control apps\nAccording to Statista, about 20% of global Snapchat users are between the ages of 13 and 17, so it's crucial that kids aren't exposed to inappropriate content that the chatbot could output. But in some experimental chats with the bot, users found that Snapchat's bot would explain how to engage in underage substance use and sexual activity.\nWhen Snapchatters first started experimentally conversing with My AI, many were curious about the chatbot's access to their location. When My AI was asked if it had a user's location, it would promptly deny having access to geolocation data.\nBut if a user asked for a restaurant recommendation in their area, My AI could provide them, proving that the bot does have access to Snapchatters' location. People took to Twitter to express they were concerned by My AI and started to get curious about what user data the bot could access.\nAlso: Meta lowered the age limit for Quest accounts. Are those kids too young for exploring VR?\nSo, what data does My AI collect, and what does Snap do with it?\nLocation\nMy AI can access your location if you allow Snapchat to access your location. Snap says My AI doesn't collect any new location data from you and only pulls from the data you provided to Snapchat.\nAlso: Human or bot? This Turing test game puts your AI-spotting skills to the test\nSome users enable a Snapchat feature called Ghost Mode that allows you to hide your location from your friends and remove you from the Snap Map. However, Ghost Mode does not ensure that My AI cannot access your location. Snap says that even with Ghost Mode on, My AI may access your location if you've granted location tracking permission to Snapchat.\nConversations\nSnap stores your conversations with My AI until you manually delete them, but it can take up to 30 days for your conversation data with My AI to be removed from Snapchat servers. Snap uses your conversations with My AI to train the AI model and to better target you with personalized ads.\nAlso: How your kids can use ChatGPT safely, according to a mom\nSnapchat's privacy policy states that all Snaps are deleted from Snapchat servers after all recipients view them. But Snap makes a clear distinction that the chats sent to My AI do not follow this guideline and are only deleted if you request Snapchat to delete them. It should be assumed that Snap retains any audio or photos you send to My AI and can only be deleted if you do it yourself."

I compared it with a traditional Wi-Fi router, and here's my advice\nWith the adoption of remote and hybrid working, having a reliable internet connection at home is imperative -- not just for one device, but for several. If you have a family, maybe even dozens. So what's better, one single access point, or a mesh network spread about the home?\nThe answer depends on how your home and office are set up and what kind of connection you need. Wi-Fi routers are so good these days that a single access point is often the most straightforward solution. But if you have a larger home or your office is located far away from your router, a mesh network could be a game-changer, boosting the signal no matter where you are.\nAlso: The best VPN routers of 2025\nIf you're not sure of the difference, that's okay, too. Let's examine both types of connection and consider their pros and cons to determine which one is best for you.\nWhat is a traditional Wi-Fi router?\nA traditional router acts as a central hub for internet connectivity. The router acquires the connection from your internet service provider (ISP), and then allows other devices around the home to connect to it, either via Wi-Fi, or by simply plugging in an Ethernet cable. Typically, routers are password-protected so only your household can connect to it.\nYou should buy a traditional Wi-Fi router if...\n1. You're on a budget\nStandard routers are generally much more affordable than mesh network products. While you can still expect to pay a hundred dollars or more for a premium router, there are many budget-friendly options stable enough to keep your home office running effectively without further input.\n2. You have heavy bandwidth and speed requirements\nMany routers today, such as the TP-Link AXE5400 are designed with the technology needed to meet heavy bandwidth and streaming requirements. Some, like the Asus RT-BE86U, aim to exceed the requirements of most people for the fastest connection possible.\nAlso: Should you upgrade to Wi-Fi 7? Here's my verdict after testing this next-gen router at home\nGamers and live streamers, for example, should generally stick with wired Ethernet connections and traditional routers, as they will likely provide improved speeds and stability over wireless-first products.\n3. You want a plug-and-play product\nA standard router is often less hassle to set up than a mesh network. For something that \"just works,\" a typical router might be the best option. Set it up once, make sure updates are automatically applied, and forget about it.\n4. You want to separate devices and networks\nYou can set up guest Wi-Fi networks on most modern routers, but if you also want to keep all of your devices on a separate home network in the interests of security, most routers will allow you to do this without much hassle.\nWhat is a mesh router?\nWhile traditional routers are singular, centralized access points, mesh networking devices are decentralized.\nInstead of one device connecting to a single gateway to the internet, mesh networks are created from multiple Wi-Fi nodes that all provide web connectivity. For example, you could have a central hub in the kitchen and satellite nodes in the home office, kitchen, and bedroom.\nAlso: This is the fastest and most expensive Wi-Fi router I've ever tested\nWhen you access the internet while in the kitchen, you would automatically connect to the hub, whereas you would jump on a node while you're in your home office, and so on -- and this blanket coverage is why mesh devices are great for larger homes or offices. Most mesh systems will automatically select the best channels and nodes to avoid dead zones and lower the risk of poor connectivity.\nYou should buy a mesh networking system if...\n1. You have spotty coverage in your home\nThe main benefit of a mesh network is extended coverage. Investing in a mesh setup will remove annoyances, such as coverage blackspots or slow connections in larger properties with a lot of square feet. You're far less likely to have dead zones with a mesh system than you are with a single router access point.\nMesh networks can often cover up to 5,000 sq. ft., and more, with enough satellites. That's far more than you can expect from one central router.\n2. You need a reliable connection, no matter where you are\nAs your device will connect to the nearest satellite node rather than a central point of access, this feature helps ensure that -- no matter where you are in a property -- you are less likely to experience connectivity failures or drops.\nAlso: I switched my high-end Wi-Fi 7 router to a more affordable option - and don't regret it\nIn this manner, mesh networks are particularly useful if you have a home office in a garden area separate from your house, for example.\nAnother benefit is that mesh systems and satellites are often designed to look modern, sleek, and may be more discreet than bulky, traditional routers, giving you more options for placement.\n3. You want additional controls\nOnce a mesh network is active, many vendors allow users to control their system through a mobile app. This could include keeping an eye on network traffic, rebooting, or even turning off the internet entirely -- perhaps an appealing prospect for those with children who don't want to mess with a typical router's configuration. In addition, some mesh networks also act as smart hubs and are compatible with voice assistants.\nA note of warning, however: you may need to spend some time tweaking configuration settings when you first set up a mesh network.\nFAQs\nWhat are the disadvantages of using a Wi-Fi router?\nThere are three key disadvantages of using a traditional Wi-Fi router:\nCoverage issues: As internet access is distributed through a single point, this setup can mean that areas far away from your router will have slow or spotty connections that drop. Range extenders can help remove this barrier, and while they can still be cheaper than investing in a mesh network, it's an additional expense.\nOverload: Unless extenders or channel separation features are used, too many connections may result in overloading, bottlenecks, lags, and connectivity drops.\nTweaking: If you want to tweak the more advanced settings on a router, this can often require annoying visits to a platform via desktop, rather than the seamless mobile app connectivity we have learned to enjoy for many of our modern services.\nWhat router system is best for my home office?\nYou need to decide whether the financial outlay for a whole mesh network is worth it. In larger homes with dead spots, mesh networking can provide a way to improve your Wi-Fi signal strength and coverage immediately.\nHowever, it can be expensive to overhaul your existing router setup for a large home. Going for a complete mesh system may be overkill unless you consistently have multiple users and connected devices competing for bandwidth.\nA Wi-Fi extender can be a worthwhile investment instead if you decide to stay with a traditional home router but need to expand coverage.\nSome mesh network systems, such as Google Wifi, Netgear Orbi, and Amazon Eero, are relatively cheap to set up if you don't need too many satellites.\nAlso: The best mesh Wi-Fi routers: Expert recommended\nIf you're the only person using your network and need a stable, powerful internet connection -- such as for resource-hungry work applications or gaming -- a traditional router and an Ethernet cable may be all you need for reliable and rapid internet access. Wired internet speeds should be quicker than wireless if the connection is working properly, and investing in a simple Ethernet cable, easy to find for no more than $10 or $15, could be enough. This could save you the cost of a complete overhaul.\nWi-Fi range extenders, too, could be considered an alternative to mesh if you need to boost coverage and throughput in some areas, and they will likely be less expensive than purchasing individual mesh nodes. Some vendors also offer mesh \"bolt-ons,\" such as Asus' AiMesh, which creates a mesh-like coverage wireless network without ripping everything out and starting again. However, the downside is that you will probably have to spend some time setting these bolt-ons up and tampering with your router's configurations.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better for gaming?\nThe best way to answer this question is to consider latency. Overall, many mesh systems today trade extended coverage for potential downgrades to speed.\nIf your household has gamers using consoles casually, it shouldn't matter what type of router you use. However, professional and dedicated gamers will absolutely notice small lags or latency issues -- and they will want the best speed and stability available. In these cases, a wired, traditional router is likely your best bet.\nI prefer an Ethernet, cabled connection for PC, Internet-based gaming and sessions with friends, and while my mesh network would probably be adequate, I don't want to risk lagging.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better than an extender?\nWhile both mesh Wi-Fi and extenders will improve the coverage of your home, there are disadvantages to both.\nMesh systems require investment and the cost can add up quickly, but they provide seamless transitions between Wi-Fi access points dotted around your home. Furthermore, you can rapidly change settings or perform updates via mobile apps.\nWi-Fi extenders can't be tweaked so easily. However, they are cheaper and are the best option if you just want to tackle a few dead zones, as you just need to plug one into your main router. Keep in mind that, unlike mesh nodes, Wi-Fi extenders won't improve congestion or eradicate bottlenecks.\nCheck your ISP first\nBefore changing your setup, you should review your ISP package. If you're subscribed to a low-speed offering, or your internet provider throttles your speed at peak times, new equipment is not going to help. Instead, a package upgrade could be a better option.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

Microsoft has stated, forcefully, that it will not revise those requirements. You will also hit roadblocks if your PC doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0, or if the TPM is not enabled.\nAlso: Two ways to get free Windows 10 security updates through October 2026\nThat might be the official policy, but -- as with everything Windows-related -- it pays to read the fine print.\nThose pesky restrictions prevent you from automatically upgrading to Windows 11 using Windows Update or the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Yet, as I detail in ZDNET's Windows 11 FAQ, there are documented workarounds for most PCs that were originally built for Windows 10.\nOver the past few years, Microsoft has played a cat-and-mouse game with enthusiasts, adding occasional speed bumps that make it more difficult to bypass these compatibility checks. There are workarounds for most modern PCs, but some older devices, especially those built using AMD processors, might be out of luck. The instructions below take all those developments into account.\nAlso: Can your old PC handle the Windows 11 upgrade? How to find out - before you try\nThese instructions also assume that you have a PC running a retail or OEM edition of Windows 10 (Home or Pro) and that you are signed in as an administrator on the PC you want to upgrade.\nWhich option should you choose?\nPlease don't skip over this section.\nThis article describes two upgrade options. To take advantage of the workaround described in option 1 below, your computer must meet all the other requirements for Windows 11.\n- It must be configured to start up using UEFI, not a legacy BIOS configuration.\n- Secure Boot must be supported, although it does not need to be enabled. (But seriously, folks, you should enable Secure Boot.)\n- A TPM must be enabled; version 1.2 is OK, but a system without any TPM or with the TPM disabled will fail. Any PC that was originally designed for Windows 10 should include a TPM 2.0.\nTo check these details on a PC you're considering upgrading, run the System Information utility, Msinfo32.exe, and look at the System Summary page. Pay special attention to the BIOS Mode value. If it says \"Legacy,\" you'll need to reconfigure your system to UEFI mode (and convert your system disk from MBR to GPT partitioning) before you can install Windows 11 as a normal upgrade.\nAlso: Why Windows 11 requires a TPM - and how to get around it\nTo see whether your PC has a TPM enabled, run the Trusted Platform Module Management tool, Tpm.msc. If your computer includes a TPM and it's turned on, this app will display information about it. Under the TPM Manufacturer Information heading, check the specification version to confirm that it is 2.0. If there's no TPM, or if the TPM is disabled in firmware settings, you'll see a message that says \"Compatible TPM cannot be found.\"\nIf you're unable (or unwilling) to change from Legacy BIOS to UEFI, or if you have an older PC that doesn't have a TPM option at all, you'll need to use the second option, which takes advantage of an undocumented hack that allows you to bypass the compatibility checks and complete the upgrade. Skip to the Option 2 section of this post for details on how to use the free Rufus utility to perform this upgrade.\nAlso: How to install Windows 11 your way (and avoid Microsoft's restrictions)\nFinally, note that Microsoft added a new set of restrictions as part of the Windows 11 version 24H2 update. These changes require a CPU that supports specific instructions -- SSE4.2 and PopCnt. Most PCs with Intel CPUs from 2009 or later will meet this standard. AMD CPUs from 2013 or later should also meet these requirements. But it is impossible to upgrade to Windows 11 version 24H2 on a PC that was built in 2008 or earlier. For details, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that.\"\nIf you plan to perform a clean installation of Windows 11, you can boot from installation media and run Windows Setup. That option skips the CPU compatibility check completely (but still requires a TPM and Secure Boot support). After the installation completes, you'll need to reinstall all your apps, restore your data files, and tweak settings to personalize your system preferences.\nWant to avoid all that hassle? Choose the option that's appropriate for your hardware.\nOption 1: Use this simple registry edit\nWith this registry edit, you can bypass CPU checks and accept any TPM version. Please be aware that this option requires that you run the Setup program from within your current Windows installation. You can't boot from a USB flash drive and install Windows 11 this way.\nThis process requires four steps.\n1. Change one key in the Windows registry\nYou need to make one small change to the Windows registry. For more than three years, this change was documented at Microsoft's support website, but the company removed those instructions in December 2024. (Here's an archived version of that support article.) This change tells the Windows 11 Setup program to skip the check for compatible CPUs and to allow installation on a PC with an older TPM (version 1.2). The usual warnings apply when working with the registry; I recommend you make a complete backup before proceeding.\nOpen Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and navigate to the following key:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\MoSetup\nIf the MoSetup key doesn't exist, you need to create it. Right-click the node for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup in the left-hand navigation pane, then choose New > Key. Name it MoSetup and press Enter.\nAlso: Wiping your Windows laptop? Here's the simplest way to erase all personal data\nSelect the MoSetup key and then right-click in any empty space in the pane on the right. Choose the option to create a new DWORD value. (Don't choose the QWORD option!)\nReplace the default name for that key by typing the text AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU and then press Enter. Then double-click the new value and change the \"Value data\" box to 1. The result should look like this:\nCheck for typos before proceeding -- Windows is frustratingly literal about the contents of the registry, and if you misspell the key or value name, your upgrade will fail. Click OK to save your change, and then restart your PC.\n2. Download the Windows 11 ISO\nOn the PC you want to upgrade, go to the Windows 11 Download page (aka.ms/DownloadWindows11) and choose the option at the bottom of the page, \"Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices.\" Save the ISO file in your Downloads folder.\nNote that this is a big file. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, the download could take a while.\nAlso: The ultimate Windows 11 upgrade guide: Everything you need to know\nFor those running Windows with English (UK) as the selected language, choose English (United States) when prompted for a product language. Several readers have reported that choosing English International results in an upgrade that does not allow you to keep installed apps and data files.\n3. Mount the ISO file in File Explorer\nAfter the download completes, open File Explorer and double-click the ISO file you downloaded in the previous step. Doing so mounts the file as a virtual DVD drive in its own folder, with its own drive letter.\n4. Run Windows Setup\nIn File Explorer, find the Setup.exe file in the virtual drive you opened in the previous step and double-click it to begin the upgrade. You'll see a stern warning about compatibility issues and the possibility that performing an upgrade will mean you are not entitled to future updates. You can safely click Accept to move past this message. (For details on what that warning message really means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\" Spoiler: They are not going to cut off security updates.) After you click OK on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.\nIf you're upgrading from the same edition (Home or Pro), you'll have three options: You can keep your apps, settings, and files (Full Upgrade); keep your data files but start fresh with apps and settings (Keep Data Only); or start completely fresh (Clean Install).\nOption 2: Use the free Rufus utility\nOn older PCs without a TPM and on PCs that don't support Secure Boot, you'll need to use an undocumented hack to bypass the compatibility checker. You can do this manually by replacing the Appraiserres.dll file (in the Sources subfolder on the Windows 11 installer drive) with a zero-byte version and then making a series of registry edits. But it's simpler to use the free, open-source Rufus utility to create installation media (on a USB flash) drive that includes these tweaks automatically.\nTo get started, download Rufus version 4.6 or later. Earlier versions won't work, thanks to changes Microsoft made in October 2024 to its compatibility checking tools. For details of how the newer versions work, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This just-released tool can get the job done.\" In addition, be aware that using Rufus will not allow you to bypass the new restrictions on very old PCs that were introduced with Windows 11 version 24H2.\nIf you have a PC with a CPU that lacks support for SSE4.2 and PopCnt instructions, not even Rufus can help. (Of course, any PC that fails that test is nearly 20 years old and probably deserves to be retired.)\nAlso: Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it\nTo get started, you'll need to download the Windows 11 ISO. Be sure to save it to the Downloads folder of your Windows system drive so you can find it easily. You'll also need a USB flash drive of at least 16 GB in size. You will reformat this drive as part of the process, so back up any data on that drive first -- and do not store the Windows 11 ISO here!\n- Download Rufus from the developer's site or from the Microsoft Store and run the app.\n- Choose the USB drive and then choose the \"Disk or ISO image\" option.\n- Click the Select button, choose the Windows 11 ISO you downloaded earlier, and then click Start.\n- In the Windows User Experience dialog, select the first checkbox to remove hardware requirements, as shown in the screenshot below.\n- Click OK to begin creating the drive.\nAfter Rufus successfully creates your installer, open that USB drive in File Explorer, and double-click Setup. Do not try to upgrade by booting from that USB drive and performing a clean install; it won't work.\nAs is the case with the other option, you'll see a warning about compatibility issues. It's a scare tactic. (For details on what the language in that warning message actually means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\") After you click Accept on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.\nAlso: Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that\nMy ZDNET colleague Lance Whitney has more details on the other options available with Rufus in \"How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and bypass Microsoft's restrictions).\"\nDid your upgrade work?\nIf you've tried this upgrade, I want to hear about your experience.

Well, the company has since proved its point: the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable is now available to consumers for an eye-watering $3,300, but packed with premium design elements, solid hardware, and a 120Hz OLED display that extends to almost 17 inches at the press of a button.\nAlso: Lenovo's $3,000 rollable ThinkBook laptop is officially available to buy - know this before you do\nI've been using the ThinkBook Plus for over a week as my main laptop, and I have to admit, I'm enamored by the extendable screen, particularly as a productivity machine for work.\nBut as the first of its kind, it's far from perfect. There are a handful of trade-offs due to the laptop's form, and the sky-high price invites a critical eye to every element of its design. That being said, it is ultimately a well-engineered laptop. Let's take a closer look.\nLike all ThinkBooks, the laptop exudes business, featuring a metallic, two-tone design. It's not my favorite aesthetic, but it's certainly durable and resists fingerprints way better than all the matte black designs out there.\nUpon first glance, the laptop looks like any other. One of the first things to stand out is the thick bezels framing the display, but as your eye draws to the bottom, you notice something strange: there's no bottom bezel -- the screen just continues below the keyboard.\nAlso: How to buy a laptop for school, work, or gaming (and our top picks for each)\nThe rest of the rollable screen is parked underneath, waiting to be unfurled. With the push of a button, the standard-sized display extends upwards, increasing the screen size to 16.7 inches.\nThe result is a large, portrait-style display that goes far beyond any other standard laptop screen size on the market. The glossy, OLED screen delivers a fantastic picture, with no flickering or dimming around the edges, although there is some visible creasing that looks like what you'd see on a foldable phone's display.\nThis is especially true if you rotate the glossy display to reflect the light. It's a little more visible than I expected and certainly something of note (given the price), but ultimately, it doesn't really overshadow the benefit of the large screen.\nFor example, you stop noticing the creasing when your attention is focused on what you're actually doing. It's one of those things that's an inevitable part of its mechanics -- it took foldable phones several years to reduce the creasing on their displays -- and although it doesn't exactly scream \"premium\", it doesn't cancel out the benefits the screen provides.\nAlso: I tried Lenovo's infamous 'rollable' laptop at CES - it's more practical than I thought\nSo what are the said benefits? First off, the extra room is a breath of fresh air. It allows for a spacious workspace that I have to admit, makes for a very nice user experience. Personally, I like running one large, full-screen desktop, but you can also put two windows, one on top of the other, for two 16:9 desktops.\nTo maximize real estate, I set the scale in Windows to 125%, bringing the UI down to a more manageable size that results in a crisp and efficient interface. However, if you want a larger UI, it still feels more roomy than a regular laptop display.\nIf you're a programmer, you'll appreciate the extended portrait orientation, but anyone who works with documents will love being able to see a third more content on the screen at a glance.\nAs an editor, it drastically improves working in Google Docs and my browser-based CMS, both of which benefit from more visibility without having to squint at a UI that's been scaled down to the atomic level.\nEven basic web browsing is improved, with more of the page on the screen at once, and more content visible with less scrolling. In that sense, the display mirrors the mobile layout, which is ultimately more scrollable.\nRolling the screen up can be done by pressing the associated key or with a hand gesture in front of the webcam. While it's extending, the screen defaults to playing an animation (different ones are selectable in settings) with some thematic music, then reloading your desktop once it reaches the desired size. The music can be a little much in a quiet office, so luckily, all of these features can be turned off.\nWhen fully extended, the bottom third of the screen is occupied by the Lenovo widget panel, which shows reminders, your to-do list, and a calendar at a glance. You can pin this to stay permanently on or have it hide behind your other apps.\nThere's actually a lot of content here, including short videos that show how to use gesture controls to raise and lower the display and some suggestions on how to organize the screen more effectively.\nBeyond the display, the rest of the laptop's core components are quite nice. The keyboard is a little shallow, but the keys feel great, with a satisfying click that's crisp and responsive.\nI was also thrilled to find the haptic trackpad to be just as well-engineered, with a uniform click no matter where you press down on the pad, and a sensitive input for swipe gestures. One thing to note, however, is that in cooler temperatures, you might have some trouble with the pad recognizing your fingers, especially if they're cold.\nAlso: The Lenovo ThinkPad streak is over: This model I tested bucks a decade-long trend (for the better)\nAlso note that the laptop's form factor limits its I/O access, with just two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and a headphone jack. All three ports are located on the left side of the device, which might be problematic for some users, but is an expected trade-off for the features.\nAll in all, the laptop's core physical build feels premium (if a little chunky), and even without the rollable display, it would be a solid office laptop. The fingerprint reader on the power key, along with support for Wi-Fi 7 seal the deal as a modern business device.\nUnder the hood, the Intel Core Ultra 7 \"Lunar Lake\" processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage make for a standard hardware loadout comparable to any number of mid-to-upper range business laptops. The big display is powered by an integrated Intel Arc 140V GPU with 16GB of internal memory, supplying more than enough power for daily use.\nCinebench 24 MC | Geekbench 6.2.2 SC | Geekbench 6.2.2 MC | |\nThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable | 563 | 2,732 | 10,701 |\nDell 14 Premium | 732 | 2,626 | 15,462 |\nAcer Swift 16 AI | 518 | 2,743 | 10,932 |\nIf you're looking to game on this laptop, it can handle some mainstream titles, but it's not exactly built for running top-tier gaming content. In \"normal\" laptop mode, you've got a 2000 x 1600 resolution, standard fare for a 14-inch. But if your game supports a 2000 x 2350 resolution, you can play with the screen fully extended, which definitely feels like a unique experience, but because of all the screen space, it isn't exactly optimized for high-APM gaming.\nIf you're playing an older game that doesn't support that resolution, well, the game will simply revert to the traditional resolution, resulting in empty space below the window and negating the whole point of the extended display. The bottom line here: gaming can be a bonus for this laptop, but not what it's made for.\nAlso: Finally, a Windows laptop that I wouldn't mind putting away my MacBook Pro for\nRegarding battery life, the display expectedly cuts into the 66Whr battery's longevity, although not as much as you might expect. During normal use, you can get a full work day of use out of it with the screen extended, but it's cutting it close. If you add in videoconferencing and more demanding workloads, you might not make it through the day without a power top-up.\nThat being said, the Lunar Lake chip does allow for the battery loss to reduce to a trickle when not in use, and it charges fast: about 80% in an hour. In our video playback test, we got a little over 11 hours at half brightness in balanced mode over Wi-Fi.\nSo let's address the elephant in the room: the price. Lenovo is well aware that this laptop is not for everyone. In fact, it's probably the most niche product I've reviewed all year. Instead, it's more about proving a point.\nAlso: I've tested dozens of ThinkPads: Here's the Lenovo model I keep coming back to\nLenovo wants to project a reputation of innovation, but more importantly, it wants to prove it can deliver said products to market. This device reflects that mission, earning it an important place in Lenovo's portfolio, even if it's not the year's top seller.\nIt's also the first iteration of this rollable concept, and as such, the physical design is not quite as polished as you'd find in Lenovo's other high-end laptops, like the ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition or the X1 Carbon. These laptops come from a product line backed up by decades of design and engineering, with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 having room to improve in subsequent model versions.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 is an impressive product, even considering its trade-offs. The display has visible creases and thick bezels, but when it's fully extended, you forget about them. The battery isn't the best, but it's far from the worst. It's not a stellar gaming rig, but that's not why you buy a ThinkBook, anyway.\nIt's niche, and it's expensive, but it does what it's supposed to: deliver a fantastic user experience in the office, with an expansive, flexible display that looks great, pairs nicely with a premium haptic touchpad, and just the right amount of power under the hood.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for two weeks, and it made my XPS laptop look bad\nAt $3,200, this isn't a mainstream laptop, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're absolutely sold on the extendable display and are committed to the form factor in the long term.\nThe reality is that you can get almost anything for less: a MacBook Pro M4 with 24GB of RAM, or the new brand-new Dell 14 Premium with the same processor and an upgraded Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU for $1,000 less. But if you're in love with the big screen, I can say that it's a productivity game-changer in the office."

There are also some interesting features, such as digital map house blurring and SOC escalation for severe data exposures.\nWho should look elsewhere: Anyone who wants a budget-friendly option for data removal, as it can quickly become expensive.\nPricing begins at around $96 per year on an essential plan, an upfront cost that may deter some customers.

Family and business plans are also available.\nReviews still suggest that the service is secure and thorough.\nPrivacy Bee features: Company checks | Data deletion | Data broker management | Privacy browser extension | User dashboard | Mass marketing opt-outs | 24/7 monitoring | Search engine cleanup | Trustpilot rating: 3.1\nDuckDuckGo has a longstanding and respected attitude to consumer privacy. It began as a search engine and later extended to a dedicated browser. Now, the company has released a VPN and additional privacy-related services, including a personal data removal service.\nWhy we like it: You can take advantage of a VPN, data removal service, and ID protection in one package.\nWhile I have been a fan of DuckDuckGo for many years, this recommendation has a few caveats. Trustpilot ratings are low, and some users have complained about the VPN's server selection and lack of advanced features. Still, you can use the VPN on up to five devices simultaneously.\nThere are issues that need ironing out, but if your focus is on choosing a company with a pedigree in user privacy with data removal services as a bonus, check it out. I think that once the browser is more established, we can expect to see drastic improvements overall in DuckDuckGo's security packages.\nAlso: Best malware removal tools in 2025 & best antivirus\nWho it's for: DuckDuckGo Privacy Pro is worth considering if you want an all-in-one option that combines a virtual private network (VPN), data removal service, and identity theft protection.\nWho should look elsewhere?

The first seven days are free.\nDuckDuckGo Privacy Pro features: No-log search engine | VPN | Privacy browser | Data removal service | Identity theft restoration | Free trial | Trustpilot rating: 2.1\nKanary's old setup was a proven service for cleaning up your online information. A company that's now geared towards the tech-savvy generation, Kanary has recently shifted from broad family plans and data removal offerings to a mobile-first solution focused on automation called Kanary Copilot.\nWhy we like it: The company has pivoted to offering a free service to combat online stalking and doxxing. With the press of a button, this automated app will attempt to identify and address data leaks, process removal requests, and resolve security issues on your behalf.\nSo, why is it free? The company says: \"We don't want cost to be a barrier, especially for younger people just establishing their online footprint. We believe online safety should not be limited to executives or celebrities.\"\nThe service is new, but additional integrations will be added as the app is developed further.\nWho it's for: Individuals who want to try out free, mobile-first data removal.

Every provider I've listed can handle some degree of U.S.-based requests, but if you want to go further afield, ensure the service you are interested in provides this coverage.\n- Advanced protection: Do you just want a data removal service, or are other security features important to you? Consider if you also want a service known for reducing spam, for example, or one that also provides you with data breach alerts or works well with a VPN.\n- Reporting: Do you want alerts on each individual data broker tackled, or do you want weekly check-ins? Take a look at the company's typical practices.\n- Free trials and features: A free report may help you ascertain the scale of the problem and just how public your information is. Think about signing up for a free report before you make a purchase decision.\n- Budget: Many of us have numerous subscriptions to everything from streaming services to insurance, and so think about whether a data removal service will work in your monthly or annual budget.\nHow did I choose the best data removal services?\nWhen choosing the best services for deleting yourself from the internet, I considered factors such as:\n- Price: While selecting the best services, I aimed to offer a range of options, including affordable subscriptions and plans. Depending on your needs, signing up can be a long-term investment, so I have included a variety of data removal solutions with different price points and contract periods.\n- Removal: I focused on services that can scan, monitor, and check online databases and data broker repositories for your personal information and then work on your behalf to have it removed. After all, if you're paying for a service, you should expect the challenging parts of the process to be handled for you.\n- Protection: The services listed above also include protective features that may reduce the likelihood of personalized spam calls and phishing emails, as well as trolling, stalking, or identity theft. You may also want, for example, to combine automatic data removal with data breach alerts and antivirus software.\n- Frequency: My recommended services can conduct frequent scans on your behalf. While you may want one check and deletion session, our information is constantly changing hands, which means that your data could reappear online unless removals are monitored and enforced.\n- Reports: The services I recommend will often provide reports with each scan to keep you updated on where your data was found, what has been deleted, and potentially what your next steps should be.\n- Free trials, reports, and features: I have included data removal solutions that offer free reports and snapshots of your data exposure, allowing you to make the right choice before signing up for a plan. While free trials are uncommon, some of my recommendations offer free, limited plans or trial periods.\nLatest information on data removal services in 2025\nLatest news\nThese are some of the latest headlines in the data removal, data breach, privacy, and cybersecurity industries:\n- Allianz Life customers in the U.S. may have had their data stolen. An estimated 1.4 million individuals could be impacted.\n- Women's dating app Tea experienced a security breach that resulted in the theft of 72,000 images.\n- There is a rush to save decades of U.S. government-held data on scientific topics, including climate change and the environment.\n- Africa's largest mobile network, MTN, has reported a data breach.\n- VeriSource has revealed a data breach it suffered in 2024 has impacted approximately four million people.\nAre data removal services impacted by tariffs?\nData removal services and similar software or digital service plans, are not likely to come under fire directly due to tariff changes. This doesn't mean they are fully protected against market changes, as any potential rising costs for equipment and network infrastructure may be passed on to consumers. Research and new product development may also be impacted.\nAt the time of writing, a temporary exemption for smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics is in place, which means that the White House's tariffs won't impact the price you pay for now.\nFAQs on how to delete yourself from the internet\nHow do I delete myself from internet search results?\nYou can take numerous steps to stop your name from appearing in internet search results and through engines, including Google and Bing, but it can be a complicated and time-consuming process. Below are some steps to help you get started.\n- Use a search engine: Your first action should be to type in your name, nicknames, and online handles into search engines. This step will reveal the information that anyone can easily find on you and can help you plan your next steps like which companies to contact for data removal or what accounts to delete.\n- Lock down or delete social media accounts: Deletion is the nuclear option, but most social media platforms will have the option to stop your profile from appearing in search engine results. As our profiles -- even if they are publicly limited -- contain our photos, full name, and more, removing them from search engine queries can help reduce our online footprint. For step-by-step guides, visit Facebook, Instagram, and X.\n- Delete old, unused accounts: Whether it's shopping sites, social media networks, or forums, each service you use -- or have used -- may tie your online identity to your personally identifiable information (PII). All of this could be at risk if a data breach occurs. If you do not want to use a dedicated service, consider going through your email and password managers to find active accounts. You will need to access them and request removal manually.\n- Clean up forum posts: Forums can often be overlooked, but if someone finds out the handles you commonly use, they may be able to find content connected to you. This could now be utterly irrelevant to the person you are today or embarrassing if exposed. Delete old forum posts and preferably remove your accounts entirely.\n- Contact webmasters: If you have old accounts that do not have auto-delete features, contact webmasters directly to have your profiles and data deleted. This process will likely be more straightforward if you are in an area covered by regulations such as the E.U.'s GDPR.\n- Request that people finder websites delete your information: People finder websites can be used as \"search engines\" to look up someone based on their name, phone number, and other personal information, which can be a privacy nightmare. Opting out and forcing the removal of your information from these organizations, which may buy it from data brokers, can be a challenging process to perform manually as it may require contacting each service individually to negotiate. If these organizations prove difficult, deletion could also require understanding applicable privacy and data protection laws to enforce your requests. Consider using a service such as Incogni or DeleteMe to do the legwork for you.\n- Deactivate email accounts: Our email accounts tend to be the core platform that ties your digital profile together, but once they're gone, they're gone. When you are ready, delete your email accounts, which will break the common threads between your online services. Only take this step if you are sure.\nCan I remove my personal information from Google search?\nYou can, but the process is limited, and your request may be rejected if the company doesn't believe there are grounds for removal.\nYou will need to contact Google using this form, requesting to remove information you see or asking to prevent information from appearing in Google search results. Removal requests can also be made for:\n- Exposed personal identifiable information (PII)\n- Explicit images, including adult content\n- Involuntary, fake pornography\n- Images of minors\n- Information from websites with \"exploitive\" removal practices, such as those that demand payment\nIn some cases -- for example, a request to remove links to law enforcement statements or media articles concerning an individual and a prosecution -- Google may refuse, as such information could be in the public interest. If Google refuses, it will provide a reason for its decision.\nHow can I protect my identity online?\nThere are numerous ways you can protect your identity online. Experts recommend securing personal information, locking down your social media accounts to friends and connections only, using antivirus software, regularly updating programs and software, and changing your passwords regularly.\nFurthermore, if you find \"clones\" of your identity such as a fake Facebook or dating app profile, ensure you report the fake account to associated online services.\nIf you suspect your data has been leaked online, use the Have I Been Pwned service to see if you have been involved in any data breaches.\nHow do I quickly remove my name from social media?\nYou'll have to follow some basic steps to remove your name from social media. First, change your name to a nickname or surname that isn't linked to your true name. This should ensure that photos or linked content will also change.\nNext, switching all of your content to private can keep it away from search engines and individual search queries. You can also delete all of your accounts and potentially file a Google request to remove content connected to you. This will not always be accepted, especially if such information is considered in the public interest or a deletion request is believed to be without true cause.\nHow do I hide what I search for on the internet?\nThe majority of search engines will log your search queries, and some will use this information to tailor ads and recommendations. If you want to keep your search queries hidden, I recommend using DuckDuckGo. The service which offers a free search engine that does not log your activities or use its browser for extra privacy.\nDuckDuckGo is a privacy-focused company that does not store your information and also allows you to anonymously use modern online tools including AI chatbots.\nHow do I find out if my information has been leaked online?\nThe easiest way is to visit Troy Hunt's HaveIBeenPwned to see the vast troves of data posted online due to company data breaches. Once you have entered your email address, the search engine will reveal if you have been involved in any third-party information leaks. You should consider checking every so often to ensure you are aware of any new data breaches.\nHow do I remove my information from the dark web?\nThere's no easy way and unfortunately it is often outside our control.\nInstead of chasing removal, the best thing you can do is to see what information has been leaked and make it redundant. For example, if an email and password combination for an online service has been exposed, change it immediately for that service -- as well as any other platforms using the same set -- and never use that combination again. Using multi-factor authentication can also prevent your online accounts from being compromised.\nAre personal data removal services worth it?\nIt is worth it as online threats, phishing, and impersonation are now permanent problems in our lives. This may be especially true for anyone who grew up oversharing and before we understood that once something is online, it is usually there forever. If you want to mask problematic information and cut the links that connect you between different online services, investing in a personal data removal service -- at least, for a while -- is worth the cost.\nOther data removal services worth considering\nLatest updates\n- In ZDNET's July update, we performed editorial changes and news updates.\n- In ZDNET's June update, we performed editorial changes and updated information on pricing and deals.\n- In our April update, we overhauled our recommended services and completed substantial copy changes, including a new news section and notes on tariffs."

  "argos_summary": "Instagram has introduced a new Map feature that allows users to share their precise last-active location and view location-tagged content from friends. While the feature is designed to enhance user connectivity, it has faced backlash over privacy concerns, prompting Instagram head Adam Mosseri to clarify that location sharing is off by default and requires user opt-in. Users can turn off location sharing entirely and control who sees their location, with the option to hide specific places from selected friends.",
