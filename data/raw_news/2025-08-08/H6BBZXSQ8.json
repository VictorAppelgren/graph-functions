  "content": "Ingo Arnold - Deputy Chairman of Executive Board & CFO\n\n Robin John Andres Harries - CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board\n\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the freenet AG Conference Call on the Q2 2025 and Half Year Results. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to Robin Harris, who is leading this earnings call for the first time as the new CEO of freenet AG.\n\nGood morning, everyone. My name is Robin Harries, and I'm honored to speak with you today as the new CEO of freenet. I joined this exciting company at the beginning of June, and it's been a dynamic and inspiring start. Prior to freenet, I served as CFO of trivago, a NASDAQ-listed company. Before that, I was a Board member at 1&1, while I led marketing and sales for over 5 years. So I'm no stranger to this industry, and it feels very familiar and energizing to be back.\n\nI would like to begin by sharing some of my impressions of freenet after these initial 2 months. What stands out immediately is the agility of the company. We have a strong competitive position in both mobile and TV, supported by powerful and well-established sales infrastructure. We are proud to have nearly 500 retail stores, which allow us to maintain daily direct contact with our customers. In addition, we benefit from numerous strong partnerships and a broad market presence, which gives us an excellent position",
