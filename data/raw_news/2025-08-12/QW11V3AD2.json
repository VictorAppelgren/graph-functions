  "title": "DC attorney general Brian Schwalb slams Trump's federal takeover, breaking with police union",
  "description": "DC Attorney General Biran Schwalb spoke out against President Donald Trump's federal takeover of Washington, D.C., and said it was an \"unprecedented step.\"",
  "content": "DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb spoke out against President Donald Trump's plan for crime in Washington, D.C., during an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Tuesday.\n\n\"We as public officials need to do everything we can to drive crime down, and we have done that. Unfortunately, the President's characterizations of what's happening on the ground here in the District of Columbia is not consistent with the facts. We have seen meaningful, significant drops in crime since I was elected in 2023, when there was a crime. Spiked crimes, violent crimes have consistently gone down every year,\" Schwalb said.\n\nTrump announced on Monday that he was deploying the National Guard to DC and said he would federalize the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington to respond to crime \u2014 placing it under the authority of Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\n\"We do not believe we need this takeover of MPD. Our Home Rule Act provides that, while we do have limited authority to govern ourselves, local affairs like local policing are entrusted to our mayor and our chief of police, who are doing the job. There are things the federal government could do to help us. We certainly have a problem with the fact that more than 20% of the judges on our superior court \u2014 that are required to be on the bench to handle criminal matters, juvenile matters, housing matters and other matters \u2014 are vacant. And that's something that the federal government, the President and the Congress could make sure we had some meaningful help right away in terms of the administration of justice in our city,\" Schwalb continued.\n\nTOP HOUSE REPUBLICAN SAYS TRUMP 'RIGHTLY' TOOK OVER DC POLICE, DEMANDS BOWSER, OTHERS TESTIFY ON CRIME\n\n\"I'm very concerned about the law of the country, the Home Rule Act and the D.C. Charter being complied with,\" Schwalb said. \"This is an unprecedented step taken by the President of the United States. In more than 50 years of Home Rule in the District of Columbia, this provision of the Home Rule Charter has never been invoked by a president.\"\n\nMayor Muriel Bowser also reacted to Trump's announcement on Monday and called for DC statehood. Bowser also said Sunday during an MSNBC interview, \"Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.\"\n\n\"If people are concerned about the President being able to move the National Guard into our city, the time to do that would have been when the Congress had a bill that it could have given control of the D.C. National Guard to D.C.,\" she told reporters on Monday, according to Politico. \"So there are things that, when a city is not a state, and not fully autonomous, and doesn\u2019t have senators, that the federal government can do.\"\n\nThe chair of the Washington D.C. police union, Gregg Pemberton, said he supported Trump's takeover.\n\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\n\n\"We completely agree with the President here that crime in the district is out of control and something needs to be about it, \" union chair Gregg Pemberton said in support of Trump's actions during an interview on Fox Business on Monday. \"This concept that crime is down is really an old trope. They're using statistics in a way that makes it appear that crime is going down, but our rank-in-file officers know that we're going call to, call, to call, for armed car jackings, stabbings, robberies, shootings, homicides and the crime isn't going anywhere.\"\n\nPemberton said they welcomed the assistance of the National Guard but expressed concern that the measure was only temporary.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump slammed crime in the city during his press conference on Monday.\n\n\"Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,\" he said. \"And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it,\" he said.\n\nThe nation's capital in the following years has been rocked by shootings that have left innocent children shot and dead, a trend of juveniles committing carjackings that have turned deadly in some cases, shoplifting crimes and attacks on government employees, summer interns and others, including the fatal shooting of 21-year-old congressional intern, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, in June.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump claimed crimes in Washington, D.C., trounce data from notoriously violent cities in nations such as Mexico and Colombia during his Monday morning press conference announcing he is federalizing the D.C. police department to curb spiraling violence.\n\"The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher,\" Trump said Monday. \"This is much higher. The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse.\"\nTrump whipped out charts showing the media that the nation's capital allegedly suffers worse crime trends than other cities worldwide, calling on them to \"take a look at numbers\" as he rattled off the data's findings.\n\"Look at these. Baghdad is \u2026 we doubled up on Baghdad. Panama City, Brasilia, San Jose, Costa Rica, Bogota, Colombia. Heavy drugs. Mexico City, I mentioned Lima, Peru, all double and triple what they are. So do you want to live in places like that? I don't think so. I don't think so. And I think the people in this room, if you wrote correctly, you'd see. Look at the kind of numbers we have. D.C. 41 per 100,000 (for homicides in 2023). Number one that we can find anywhere in the world. Other cities are pretty bad, but they're not as bad as that. That the way you want to live? The reporters of the world? Juvenile offenders and crimes against persons as they say, it's getting worse, not getting better. It's getting worse,\" he continued.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nThe White House directed Fox Digital to a pair of graphs published on the White House Rapid Response's X account on Monday when asked for copies of the charts, data and its citations. The graphs published to X show D.C.'s murder rate in 2024 sat at 27.54 per 100,000, according to FBI data \u2013 reportedly higher than the stats in cities such as Bogota and Mexico City.\nThe nation overall saw an uptick in violent crimes in 2020, when protests and riots broke out in cities across the nation at the height of the pandemic. That year notched a nearly 30% increase in murders compared to the year prior, according to FBI data, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes.\nThe nation's capital in the following years has been rocked by shootings that have left innocent children shot and dead, a trend of juveniles committing carjackings that have turned deadly in some cases, shoplifting crimes and attacks on government employees, summer interns and others, including the fatal shooting of 21-year-old congressional intern, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, in June.\nWASHINGTON, DC IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CAPITALS OF MANY THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES, SENATOR SAYS\nTrump announced Monday that he was federalizing the local police department starting Monday under section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume emergency control of the capital's police force.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back,\" he said. \"We're taking it back under the authority vested in me as the president of the United States, I'm officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. You know what that is. And placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control. \u2026 In addition, I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC. And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly.\""

      "text": "President Donald Trump is weighing whether to deploy up to 1,000 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., as early as this week, Fox News has learned, in an effort to help deal with what he characterized as a surge in violent crime.\nThe plans come just one day after Trump vowed on Truth Social to evict homeless persons from that nation's capital. \"The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\" Trump said on social media. \"We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong.\"\nTrump's plans, which are expected to be detailed further at a 10 a.m. press conference Monday, would likely involve members of the D.C. National Guard, or the 2,700-member National Guard force that acts at the express authority of the commander in chief.\nUnlike other branches, Trump would not have to get the sign off of local authorities to act \u2014 likely making their activation a tempting option.\nFBI OUSTS FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, AGENT INVOLVED IN J6 PROSECUTIONS, WITH MORE EXPECTED\nWhen speaking to reporters in the Oval Office last week, Trump railed against what he described as a \"ridiculous\" level of crime in the nation's capital, buffeted most recently by the assault on a former DOGE staffer earlier this month.\n\"We want to have a great, safe capital,\" Trump said last week. \"And we\u2019re going to have it.\"\nTrump also told reporters that his White House lawyers are looking into ending the Home Rule Act, a law passed by Congress in 1973 that gave Washington, D.C., residents the right to elect their own mayor and local representatives.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also told reporters last week that Trump had ordered law enforcement personnel to increase their presence in the capital, though the additional details on the scope and timeframe of that presence remain unclear.\nTrump is expected to address those plans in a press conference Monday morning.\nHowever, for Trump, delivering on this promise could be fraught with long-term legal complications \u2014 in part, because crime in the city is actually down to its lowest point in nearly 30 years.\nFEDERAL JUDGES GRILL TRUMP LAWYERS OVER 'LIBERATION DAY' TARIFFS ON EVE OF ENFORCEMENT\nViolent crime in the first seven months of 2025 has dropped by roughly 26% compared to 2024, according to data compiled by the D.C. Police Department and released earlier this month. Overall, crime in the nation\u2019s capital has dropped by roughly 7%.\nOn Sunday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in an interview with NewsNation that Washington, D.C., \"is more violent than Baghdad.\"\nWashington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, for her part, told MSNBC in an interview Sunday that \"Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.\"\nHowever, it's not the first time Trump has sought to crack down on crime in the nation's capital \u2014 an effort he has returned to frequently, including during his first term in office.\nTrump in March signed an executive order, \"Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force,\" designed to address issues with a city he has long derided as \"filthy,\" \"horribly run\" and \"crime-ridden,\" among other things. \"We want to have a great, safe capital,\" he told reporters. \"And we\u2019re going to have it. And that includes cleanliness and it includes other things.\"\nHowever, those powers aren't indefinite, experts explained to Fox News Digital.\nTrump does have the authority to activate the 2,700-member D.C. National Guard without the approval of local officials. Guard troops provide \"mission-ready personnel and units for active duty in the armed services\" in Washington, D.C., according to their website.\nBeyond that, Trump's ability to exercise authority in the nation's capital is bound by the Home Rule Act.\nIn the more than 50 years since that law was passed, \"there really hasn't been a serious conversation about ending home rule governance,\" George Derek Musgrove, a history professor at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County, told Fox News in an interview.\n\"And the problem with our federal system is that there are places where Trump really doesn't have any supporters, and therefore, with the limits of executive power, really doesn't have that much sway,\" Musgrove said. \"And he's constantly probing for ways around that.\"\nOther options available to Trump aren't without their own limits. In order to call up the local police force for any meaningful length of time, as Trump has suggested, a president must be able to assert \"special conditions of an emergency nature,\" according to the 1970s law.\n\"If D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take federal control,\" Trump said last week.\nHowever, that's easier said than done, individuals familiar with the law told Fox News Digital.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"DC is just a tempting target because there's not even a lot of legal gymnastics you have to do in order to exert tremendous power [in a city with ]a 90% Democratic jurisdiction. He has it already,\" Musgrove said.\n\"But it is morally questionable, I think, and violates democratic principles,\" he added."

Home Rule Act \u2013 which granted Washington, D.C., more independence from Congress \u2013 allowing him to seize control of the local police for up to 48 hours.\n\"Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of violent youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore,\" Trump said during a press conference at the White House.\nTRUMP TO HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE ON DC CRIME AFTER FEDERAL AGENTS HIT STREETS\nHowever, in order to go beyond the 48-hour mark, the president needs approval from the House Oversight Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \u2014 the two panels that have oversight of Washington, D.C.\nTrump can take over the district\u2019s police force for up to 30 days if he sends a special notice to the panels, but beyond that would require a joint resolution from the House and Senate extending the takeover.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA spokesperson for the Oversight Committee told Fox News Digital that the White House notified the panel of its intent to go beyond the 48-hour window.\nFox News Digital reached out to the Senate Homeland Security Committee for comment but did not immediately hear back."

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden.

      "text": "President Donald Trump shared new details on Monday about his plan to take control of public safety in Washington, D.C., following a brutal attack on a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer, but D.C. residents aren't convinced.\nTrump announced on Monday that he is activating the District of Columbia National Guard and seizing control of the Metropolitan Police Department after floating the idea since last week's assault in Washington\u2019s Logan Circle.\nSome Washington residents who spoke to Fox News Digital called it a \"terrible idea\" that \"doesn't make a lot of sense.\"\n\"I think D.C. politics should stay with D.C., and, unfortunately, the federal government is apparently overstepping their bounds right now, so I hope that D.C. is allowed to govern itself, as well as police itself,\" one Washington resident told Fox News Digital ahead of Trump's announcement.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nTrump controversially federalized the California National Guard amid anti-ICE protests that delved into riots in Los Angeles in June. Protesters were rejecting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations and Trump's robust immigration crackdown.\nThe president bypassed Gov. Gavin Newsom's authority to deploy National Guard troops to support ICE deportation. It was the first time a president federalized the National Guard without the governor's request in more than 60 years.\nNow, the tension between local and federal powers is unfolding in the nation's capital. But just like in California, many Washington residents have concerns about seeing \"troops on our streets.\"\n\"We have laws for a reason,\" one resident told Fox News Digital.\n\"Privatizing security is a terrible idea, and I think anything that Trump does is garbage,\" another Washington resident added.\nDespite their apprehension about National Guard troops patrolling the nation's capital, many residents said something needs to be done to address crime in Washington, D.C.\nWhile the Department of Justice indicated a 30-year low in violent crime last year, concerns about the city's safety linger, with one resident telling Fox News Digital, \"The city is getting dangerous.\"\n\"I think it's a good idea,\" one resident said of Trump's new plan. \"It's something that needs to be done for the city to be safe. Right now, we're not safe. The kids and the teenagers are doing everything. So yeah, I think that's a great idea.\"\nAnd another Washington resident said, \"We need all the protection that we can get in the city, because the city is really getting dangerous,\" telling Fox News Digital that she has to \"make sure to come home before sundown\" and she is afraid of getting robbed when she gets off public transportation.\n\"Things do seem out of control and desperate, but I don't know what kind of numbers to take, what numbers to read. One minute they'll say crime is out of control. Next minute, they will say crime is down a certain percentage. It's kind of confusing, and I don't know who to believe in and which way to go, to be honest,\" a Washington resident said, articulating the dichotomy between the low crime statistics and the alarming crime stories.\nBut another D.C. resident said, \"There's no way he should be in control of anything,\" and Washington, D.C., \"should be a state,\" so the district has more power to make decisions for itself.\n\"I don't think it's necessary,\" another Washington resident added. \"I do think there needs to be some change within [the] Metropolitan [Police Department] because safety is an issue.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShe added: \"It needs to be localized.\"\nFox News Digital's Diana Stacy contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb criticized President Trump's plan to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department and deploy the National Guard in Washington, D.C., arguing that crime has significantly decreased since his election in 2023. Schwalb emphasized that local policing should remain under the authority of local officials, citing the Home Rule Act, while Trump claimed that crime in the city is out of control and invoked emergency powers to take action. Mayor Muriel Bowser also opposed Trump's characterization of D.C. as a war-torn city, calling for statehood to enhance local governance.",
