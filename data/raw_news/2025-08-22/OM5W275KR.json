  "content": "OnlyFans founder Leonid Radvinsky was paid over $700 million in dividends in 2024 amid plans for the online platform to be sold.\n\nThe payout to the Ukrainian-American entrepreneur, 43, was disclosed Friday in financial filings for the year ended November 30 by Fenix International Ltd., a London-based company in charge of running the brand.\n\nOnlyFans allows content creators to offer X-rated subscription material directly to fans, a feature that is restricted on other social media platforms.\n\nAs of November 30, 2024, the company had a cash balance of $808 million.\n\nThe group employs just 46 people directly, reports The Financial Times.\n\nIn May, it was reported that the company was exploring a sale at a potential valuation of $8 billion, according to Reuters.\n\nRecent filings showed that revenues had shot up by 9 per cent to $1.41 billion in 2024, compared with the previous year. It took in around $7.2 billion from subscribers over the year, and paid out $5.8 billion back to creators.\n\nThe site\u2019s popularity shows no sign of slowing down, with the total number of creator accounts growing by 13 per cent \u2013 hitting 4.6 million.\n\nCreators earn 80 per cent of all payments made by fans on the platform.\n\nAudience-wise, there continues to be a growing demand for the exclusively-paid content, with 377.5 million paying to access photo and video material globally.\n\nThe company is headquartered and pays tax in the UK, but takes the majority of its profits from U.S. sales.\n\nAccording to OnlyFans, \u201csignificant growth and profitability\u201d was owed to the increase in platform users and higher earnings for existing creators.\n\nChief executive Keily Blair, who formerly worked as a privacy lawyer, told the FT that OnlyFans had \u201cexpanded in new verticals, demonstrating the strength and potential of the platform across a wide range of genres\u201d in the year.\n\nInitially founded in 2016 by British entrepreneur Tim Stokely, it was then sold to Radvinsky, a previous owner of adult websites, for an undisclosed sum in 2018.\n\nThe site made headlines with the controversy surrounding sexfluencer Bonnie Blue, after she was blacklisted from the content site after touting and posting extreme sex challenges.\n\nSeveral notorious figures have openly revealed that they post content on the site, including Pro tennis player Sachia Vickery, who is simultaneously competing in the U.S. Open qualifiers while she generates cash on OnlyFans.\n\nThe site draws both favorability and condemnation, with some branding it exploitative, while others praise it as a lucrative resource for generating a modern-day income.",

      "text": "Empowered or degraded? The truth about Bonnie Blue \u2013 and what happens behind the scenes\nAfter having sex with more than 1,000 men in a single day, Bonnie Blue\u2019s notoriety was sealed. But while she tells Zo\u00eb Beaty her sex stunts bring her financial freedom and a way of fighting against male loneliness, a new documentary paints a more complex picture of how she feels about men and women\nYou may not know her by name, but chances are, you\u2019ve heard of her. Bonnie Blue \u2013 real name Tia Billinger \u2013 is less a person now than a provocation, a social Rorschach test who incites fascination and fury \u2013 often both at once. In just a few years, the 26-year-old has gone from anonymity to infamy, propelled by controversial sex stunts and built on a mix of sexual provocation, circus, and a talent for turning the internet\u2019s thirst for outrage into cash.\nIn a new Channel 4 documentary, she doesn\u2019t just double down on the spectacle; she insists it\u2019s a public service. But beneath the latex slogans and TikTok bravado lies something far more complex.\nIt\u2019s rare to find someone who doesn\u2019t have a strong opinion about Bonnie, though seldom does anyone agree. Depending on who you ask, she\u2019s either a dangerous role model or a genius businesswoman; empowered or deeply traumatised and degraded. She\u2019s frequently held up as the poster child of bad feminism, as someone who has confused objectification, over-sexualisation and regression of women with our hard-won rights. Her own self-proclamation is that she\u2019s \u201cbasically a community worker\u201d. Referring to her most infamous stunt \u2013 one that catapulted her notoriety into another league earlier this year, when she had sex with more than 1,000 men in a single day \u2013 Bonnie also compares herself to \u201cathletes running marathons\u201d.\nShe is at the apex of a very modern phenomenon \u2013 the world of sexfluencers who, in recent years, have become a mainstream presence on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. The rise of subscription-based social media site OnlyFans \u2013 and TikTok\u2019s QVC-for-Gen-Z culture, where everything is for sale \u2013 created a boom in women selling sex on their terms and, they argue, taking control of their online presence.\nBorn in May 1999 in Stapleford, which borders Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, Bonnie grew up in a middle-class family in the village of Draycott near Nottingham. After dropping out of her A-levels she began working in recruitment \u2013 but she found the humdrum life of a nine-to-five job suffocating, she says. After the pandemic, she and her long-term partner, Ollie, whom she met at 15, decided to change things \u2013 in 2022, they married and moved to Australia. It was then that, with encouragement from Ollie \u2013 from whom she\u2019s now getting a divorce \u2013 Bonnie started selling sex online.\nWith the full backing of her mother and stepfather, Nicholas Elliott (she\u2019s never known her biological father), she began working as a cam girl and, over the following years, built a business that she considers to be freedom. She has taken control over sexualising herself, she says, in a society that was going to do it anyway. Her subscriptions, beginning with OnlyFans, made her \u00a38,000 in her first month. Together with the stunts, like her most recent, Bonnie can make her more than \u00a32m a month.\nIt\u2019s in the middle of her most recent and most divisive stunt that the Channel 4 documentary finds her. In January this year, at a venue in central London, Bonnie prepared to sleep with 1,000 men in one 24-hour period \u2013 or, more specifically, 1,057 as it turned out. She was frantically talked about online by both men and women; even those who expressed their disgust followed along with morbid fascination. Most had the same question: how?\nIt\u2019s fair \u2013 logistically, this sort of extreme gang bang is all a bit grim. Footage shows painfully mediocre men queuing up in just their white ankle socks; each has precisely 41 seconds to penetrate Bonnie for the operation to be successfully completed. A clip shows Bonnie asking one of them outside the designated house, \u201cWhat are you going to do to me in there, then?\u201d in her broad Nottingham accent. He shuffles about, mumbling, \u201cErr, everything.\u201d There are no STI checks, but under OnlyFans rules \u2013 where Bonnie hopes to sell the footage \u2013 everyone must provide ID and wear a condom.\nIn preparation, one of Bonnie\u2019s team tells her that they\u2019ve ordered \u201c20 tubes of KY Jelly, even got a numbing one, I think \u2013 there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to be in pain,\u201d he says.\nThe so-called challenge was a record \u2013 previously, porn star Lisa Sparks held it for having sex with 919 men in 2004. After all the \u201cbonking\u201d (a term used far, far too often in Bonnie\u2019s world), the men begin to turn up on social media boasting about their part in it all by reciting their number in line (\u201cI was number 641\u201d, they say) like marathon runners or prisoners upon release. We, on the other hand, cut straight to Bonnie in Las Vegas a few days later, struck down by flu and doing a puzzle.\n\u201cShe\u2019s incredibly ordinary behind the scenes,\u201d explains documentary director Victoria Silver. \u201cShe likes her table crafts and telly \u2013 funny documentaries, crime, watching Dexter.\u201d\nHer family remains fully supportive. On camera, her mum remarks how quickly anyone\u2019s supposed morals would go out of the window for \u00a32m per month. But, inevitably, there\u2019s a lot of backlash that comes with it. Bonnie has been the subject of incredible levels of vitriol and hate for selling sex \u2013 not just from the public, but within the sex industry. OnlyFans\u2019 top earner Sophie Rain publicly criticised her, saying Bonnie was singlehandedly destroying porn. \u201cI hope one day she realises the trauma she\u2019s causing herself and so many women,\u201d 20-year-old Rain posted on X, telling TMZ that Bonnie\u2019s stunts mean their work is \u201cno longer about women\u2019s empowerment\u201d.\nOnlyFans banned Bonnie after her mass gang bang, too. After facing an onslaught of abuse and death threats on social media every day, she doesn\u2019t go out alone any more. Although the men who take part in her stunts are rarely held under any sort of similar level of scrutiny or threat.\nOf course they\u2019re not \u2013 and Bonnie is (jarringly) keen to defend her clients when we speak over Zoom. \u201cI\u2019ve never been bothered about myself personally, but I've always hated the backlash that the people who sleep with me get,\u201d she says, \u201cthe people who spend time queuing for me.\u201d\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons she wanted to do this documentary in the first place. \u201cI was like, I\u2019d love to paint them in a different light. I wish I could show that they\u2019re not disgusting, they\u2019re not vile, they\u2019re not weird, they\u2019re normal, nice men.\u201d She is helping the fight against male loneliness, she says.\nYet, when it comes to women \u2013 whom Bonnie says she receives the majority of hate from \u2013 it\u2019s quite a different story. It takes less than a minute for Bonnie to bring up her fractious relationship with other women, whom she deems \u201cpoorly educated\u201d people who \u201cwant to see her cry\u201d.\nThree times she repeats misogynistic tropes: \u201cit\u2019s not my fault\u201d that \u201clazy wives\u201d, who have \u201chad children, or they\u2019re busy \u2026 or they just want money\u201d find their husbands cheat with her, she says. Women are offended, she says, and \u201ctake it personally\u201d because she\u2019s hitting a raw truth.\nI\u2019m increasingly convinced that I\u2019ve met the final boss of rage bait. I hardly expected that our chat would see her confess, as many people aggressively project onto her public persona, that she really is harbouring \u201cdeep-seated trauma\u201d, or \u201cdaddy issues\u201d, or whatever other narrative might make her actions more palatable or understandable to some. I knew that she would tell me she likes doing what she does. I just wasn\u2019t expecting to experience her fury factory so close up.\nDuring what becomes a tensely defensive discussion at points, she also often slips into marketing mode: just as she appears to churn out go-to lines in the documentary \u2013 \u201cI want to get my insides rearranged,\u201d she says, flatly; \u201cI just love to pleasure men\u201d \u2013 her tone, especially when it comes to defending men, and especially when it comes to baiting women, feels like bland sales strategy, or the work of an AI girlfriend-bot. Some comments are quite simply very crass, like showing off about a time that she was \u201cf***ing herself\u201d on camera while her family waited in the next room. But when the talk turns to her fame and the responsibility that comes with that, things turn more alarming.\nMuch of the criticism of Bonnie centres around relatively clear issues: her recruitment of \u201cbarely legal\u201d teenagers on university campuses and the insistence on seeking out virgins to sleep with, for one, which has been deemed exploitative. More recently, the (cancelled) \u201cBonnie Blue Petting Zoo\u201d, wherein she would be positioned publicly in a glass box to engage with \u201cpotentially thousands of men\u201d, was called out as \u201crape culture in a display case\u201d. Her fellow sex worker Annie Knight deemed it morally unconscionable. The health implications \u2013 both psychological and physical \u2013 of extreme porn stunts like Bonnie\u2019s have also been increasingly called into question, as has her normalisation of them.\nYet Bonnie says that she cannot be held solely responsible for the moral conscience of the porn and sex industry \u2013 and she\u2019s right, though she has a role to play in it. It\u2019s clear that everything she does is with full consent, which she is very vocal about and, as Silver says, she \u201cnever looks under any duress or zoned out or whatever\u201d.\nStill, her attitude to teens and rough sex is uncomfortable. \u201cI love making content with people that are new to sex \u2013 virgins, 18-year-olds \u2013 because I\u2019m allowing them to experience a woman\u2019s body and try out things they\u2019ve seen online,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBecause it\u2019s one thing watching porn online where someone\u2019s been choked and slapped and then actually doing it in person and making sure you\u2019re not hurting that girl, woman, whatever.\u201d\nIt reflects a wider, increasingly violent culture of sex and porn. Sexism expert Laura Bates, earlier this year, warned that we\u2019re in the middle of a \u201cnational emergency\u201d in terms of sexual violence in schools, with around one rape per day in school terms being reported among young people.\nThe rise of AI deepfakes, increasingly legitimised and normalised misogyny, is strengthening the dangerous ideology of influencers like Andrew Tate, who are fuelling the burgeoning toxic masculinity crisis. Bonnie is a fan; he has called her \u201cthe perfect end result of feminism\u201d.\nThings get a little fraught when I bring Tate up. If Bonnie sounded a bit bot-like earlier, it\u2019s here she sounds as if she is malfunctioning. When I question whether she is concerned about the wider effects of publicly supporting a self-proclaimed misogynist and accused rapist (he denies all charges), who boasts about beating up women, she says that women should \u201clearn to stick up for themselves\u201d, something she learned from her \u201cbrilliant upbringing\u201d.\n\u201cI get that people get hurt, which is terrible, and they\u2019ve not put themselves in that situation, not all the time. But I think women will happily sit there and blame everyone else, whereas a lot of the time, if they just looked in the mirror and realised they\u2019re responsible for their sh*t lives.\u201d The level of victim-blaming and phrasing (at one point she uses a tired analogy of women complaining about being robbed who had \u201ca fancy watch on\u201d) feels at odds with the vibrant twentysomething taking control of her sexuality as she claims to be.\nIs it more bait from the Bonnie Blue marketing machine that I\u2019m falling for? Potentially. Either way, it\u2019s worrying, because the key thing is that this is all now very mainstream.\nLike most sex workers now, Bonnie Blue isn\u2019t just a presence on subscriber apps or dedicated porn sites but a prolific social media star, posting constantly on Instagram and several TikTok accounts (she has many \u201cbackups\u201d as they get taken down so often). It\u2019s bizarre to see relatively recent clips of Bonnie Blue appearing on ITV\u2019s This Morning where a ribbon banner at the bottom of the screen asks if she is a \u201ccontent creator or dangerous predator\u201d, but what it means is that this world is very much a part of our lives \u2013 particularly young people\u2019s lives \u2013 whether we like it or not.\nThe Channel 4 documentary doesn\u2019t offer neat resolutions or moral clarity \u2013 because there is none. Instead, it presents the messy contradictions of a woman who has weaponised her sexuality for influence, profit and notoriety in a world that already commodifies women by default. Yet it\u2019s poignant that this documentary comes out less than a week after national crime figures show violence against women and girls has increased across all categories. And while the government and policing leaders call for whole-system reforms involving health and education on VAWG, we\u2019re left to scroll past the headlines and straight into the algorithm that made her infamy possible.\nIs Bonnie in control, or merely playing the only game that guarantees attention?\nEither way, the world is watching \u2013 and she\u2019s charging for it.\nChannel 4\u2019s one-off documentary \u20181,000 Men and Me: The Bonnie Blue Story\u2019 is scheduled to air on Tuesday, 29 July at 10 pm in the UK\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"
