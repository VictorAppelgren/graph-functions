      "feedback": "The analysis is strong on structure and sources but should be pruned into a 4–6 sentence executive brief and sharpened into a crisp, decision-useful house view; start with a single, probability-weighted thesis for Intel under a three‑pillar regime (tariffs, deregulation, CHIPS/equity) and then map each pillar to a concrete impact on Intel’s onshore capex, margins, and risk premia, with quantified read‑throughs drawn from sources (e.g., CHIPS subsidies ~$7.8B, potential government equity up to ~10%, EU 15% MFN with autos relief, India 50% tariff, July tariff receipts ~$21B and ~18.6% average tariff, Sri Lankan apparel metrics WLXM1819K); convert Alt 1/Alt 2 into a compact base/upside/downside scenario with explicit triggers (EU exemptions/steel quotas, CHIPS disbursement pace, any Intel equity terms, emergence or containment of chip tariffs, legal/deregulation reversals) and attach probability weights and a clear read-through to Intel’s execution timeline; tighten the causal chain so it flows from policy regime to onshore incentives and supplier-network reallocation, including Adyen cross‑border dynamics as a sector spillover (QRX2HD4X0); ensure every assertion is sourced or clearly labeled as conditional (e.g., the “300% chip tariffs” claim treated as uncorroborated) and replace generic language with numbers or ranges anchored to the cited IDs (RHFWI02JT, 9W8ZUIBDY, 5M9M1KACF, QRX2HD4X0, 2SJORBV6H, DGG6HXUFZ, CWVWSACA7, DNG58CC09, OFY11YO0I, AJTHKYXQ3, WLXM1819K, WC37STSUD); compress near-term windows (0–3 weeks) into one concise watchline with 3–4 fixed catalysts and avoid repetition; present a concise watch-list (4–6 items) with explicit source anchors and a short guidance on how each item could alter Intel’s risk-reward; and fix formatting and consistency across horizons so the piece reads as a cohesive, decision-ready brief rather than a catalog of moving parts.",
