  "content": "Files is a modern file manager that helps users organize their files and folders. Our mission with Files is to build the best file manager for Windows, and we're proud to be building it out in the open so everyone can participate. User feedback helps shape the features we work on, & the bug reports on GitHub help to make Files more reliable. Built and maintained by the open-source community, Files features robust multitasking experiences, file tags, deep integrations, and an intuitive design.\n\nExplore a beautiful Windows-first design.

And so much more.\n\nIntegration with cloud services such as OneDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud allow you to manage your documents and photos in the cloud, right from the sidebar.\n\nPreview documents, photos, and more without opening them. Support for rich previews, syntax highlighting, markdown and video playback is all built in.\n\nQuickly mark and organize your files and folders for later by assigning them colored and named tags for easy identification. You can even add your own custom tags!\n\nAvoid multiple windows and keep your desktop clutter-free.

By default, the icon is always visible, but you can configure it to appear only when tasks are in progress.\n\u2022 Notification badges clear automatically when you open the Status Center.\n\u2022 Font installation progress is now displayed in the Status Center.\n\nThe Actions settings page now adapts to smaller window sizes, and we added a search box so you can quickly filter commands.\n\u2022 The 7-Zip dependency has been updated to version 25.01.\n\u2022 New archives now default to UTF-8 encoding.\n\u2022 When extracting archives, Files auto-detects the encoding.
