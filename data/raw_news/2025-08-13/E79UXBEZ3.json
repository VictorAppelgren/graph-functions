      "text": "Recent Analyst Stock Rating News\nWhat Are Analyst Stock Ratings?\nAnalyst ratings measure the expected performance of a stock during a given time period. Analysts and brokerage firms often use ratings when they issue stock recommendations to stock traders.\nAnalysts arrive at stock ratings after they research companies\u2019 public financial statements, communicate with executives and customers and interact with companies in other ways.\nMost analysts issue ratings 4 times a year, usually at 3-month intervals.\nHow to Use Analyst Ratings\nAs an investor or trader, you want to be able to use analyst ratings effectively. Here are steps you can take to understand how to synthesize all the information analysts report about a particular company and how to apply it to your own trades.\nStep 1: Check Ratings History\nIn the short term, look to see whether analysts suggest an initiation, upgrade or downgrade for a particular stock. Understand how the rating changed compared to the previous rating and whether a price target gets announced or changed.\nSometimes the rating stays the same and only the price target changes, which could cause the stock to move in either direction, depending on the significance of the change between the 2 price targets.\nStep 2: Check for Other News\nIn the short term, check to see how the stock reacts to positive or negative news. This will be an indication of the company\u2019s outlook because analyst ratings usually come out after the company announces news (it\u2019ll typically be earnings news).\nStep 3: Look at the Sector for News\nCheck to see if other stocks in the sector also received similar ratings. This could indicate micro news, which refers to when the whole sector or specific company trades in a specific way due to news outside of one company.\nStep 4: Look at the Note\nIf available, look over the analyst note itself. The beginning of the note has the main information of the rating and price target. Investors should also take a look at the summary of the note, which you can find in the first couple pages and give you a concrete overview of the company. This can help you get an understanding of how analysts arrived at their thesis on the stock.\nAn example of an analyst note. Source: Needham\nStep 5: Make a Decision\nAfter reviewing the analyst ratings (and whether the analyst proposes a change or initiation) and find the reason for that note. Make a decision based on the analyst thesis on the company. This should give you guidance on how to make your thesis. Analyst ratings are a good indication of what professionals believe the company or sector will do, helping you get a better understanding of the companies you\u2019re interested in.\nAnalyst Rating Accuracy\nAnalyst ratings are not set in stone and nobody knows indefinitely what a stock will do. Therefore, analyst ratings should be taken as an educated guess made by professionals who carefully study the specific company and sector in question. It's not a surprise that the accuracy of each rating can vary by each individual analyst and specific ratings on companies.\nIn other words, there\u2019s no hard number or percentage on how accurate analyst ratings are because they are like educated guesses on what they think the stock will do based on their research, within that particular sector. In addition, each firm has so many analysts and so many different companies to review that you can compare ratings to glean what you believe is the truth.\nWhere Analyst Ratings Come From\nAnalyst ratings come from stock analysts. Analysts \u201cgo deep\u201d on companies within a particular industry or sector. Some analysts employ a top-down approach (they start with an industry or sector and look for excellent companies within that industry or sector) and other stock analysts choose a bottom-up approach, which means they start with the company first and connect the dots within that company\u2019s sector or industry. Analysts evaluate:\n- Financial statements\n- Economic fundamentals\n- Suppliers, customers and competitors\n- Management quality\n- Business model\n- Revenue\n- Expenses\n- Assets\n- Liabilities\nWhile these evaluations are done using facts and figures that any investor can access, they come down to a conclusion the analyst must draw. While this isn\u2019t an unqualified opinion, analysts will disagree because their interpretations of the data could vary.\nTypes of Stock Ratings\nStock ratings can range from simple \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201csell\u201d ratings to \u201cequal weight\u201d and \u201coutperform\u201d ratings. Here\u2019s a quick overview of how analysts rate stocks.\nBuy Rating\nA \u201cbuy\u201d rating indicates that an analyst is optimistic about a stock\u2019s short-term or mid-term growth and recommends that traders purchase the stock. An analyst may even go so far as to indicate that a stock is a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d At the same time, you may choose to swing trade the asset for a profit and come back later to start the process all over again.\nSell Rating\nA \u201csell\u201d rating means that an analyst believes the stock will trend downward in a particular time frame. Analysts might even refer to a security as a \u201cstrong sell.\u201d Remember, though, you may want to swing trade and come back to this asset in the future even though you just chose to sell, just as you would under a \u201cbuy\u201d rating.\nHold\nA \u201chold\u201d rating suggests that investors should not buy more of or sell the specified stock because they believe the stock should perform in a way that\u2019s consistent with the market or will perform similarly to comparable companies within that particular sector. This is akin to the value investing approach that Warren Buffett uses, looking to gain long-term value from a single stock rather than flipping it because of a bad week. As many have said, it\u2019s not a loss until you sell.\nUnderperform\nAn \u201cunderperform\u201d rating means an analyst indicates that a stock is expected to perform below the market or sector average. And yes, while the underperform rating may not bode well for an asset in the next few weeks, it may not stay that way. Continue to carefully monitor your portfolio to ensure that an underperforming asset hasn\u2019t turned itself around. As companies are faced with the Herculean task of pleasing shareholders, they will push to fix their underperforming stocks, meaning that a stock you wrote off could rise again.\nOutperform\nAn \u201coutperform\u201d rating means that an analyst expects a stock to outperform the market or sector average. While the stock may look to outperform the market or a sector\u2019s average, that doesn\u2019t mean it will continue to soar forever. You must look at an outperform rating as what that asset will do in recent times, but it may not maintain that trajectory.\nEqual-Weight\nAn equal weight rating means that an analyst believes that an individual stock's performance will tie to the average of all the stocks that an analyst covers in that particular sector. This type of rating helps investors get a true comparison of stocks to each other within a particular sector or industry. At the same time, equal-weight ratings could change at any time.\nPrice Target\nA price target is an analyst\u2019s projection of a stock\u2019s future price. A price target is generally set up in a general trade or area where the asset might land. This means that the analyst could get close without hitting the figure on the head. Even so, the analyst wants to get close and better predict the movement of the marketplace and the asset.\nUnderstanding Stock Ratings\nStock ratings are assessments of the investment potential of a particular stock. They are typically created by financial analysts who evaluate a company's financial performance, competitive positioning, and market outlook to provide guidance on the stock's expected future performance.\nRatings typically range from \"buy\" to \"sell,\" with variations in between, such as \"hold,\" \"accumulate,\" or \"neutral.\" A \"buy\" rating suggests that the stock is likely to perform well in the future, and investors should consider purchasing it. Conversely, a \"sell\" rating indicates that the stock is expected to underperform, and investors should consider selling it.\nIt's important to note that ratings are not guarantees of performance and should not be relied upon solely when making investment decisions. Ratings are just one factor to consider when evaluating a stock's potential, and investors should also conduct their own research and analysis to make informed decisions.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that different analysts may have different opinions on a stock, so it's a good idea to consider multiple ratings before making an investment decision.\nIn addition to analyst ratings, investors can also consider other factors when evaluating a stock, such as its financial statements, management team, industry trends, and overall market conditions. By combining all of these factors, investors can make informed decisions about which stocks to buy or sell.\nIn summary, stock ratings are an important tool for investors to consider when evaluating a stock's potential, but they should not be the only factor used in investment decision-making. It's important to conduct your own research, consider multiple ratings, and take into account other factors before making an investment decision.\nShould You Use Analyst Ratings to Inform Your Own Trades?\nYou can definitely use analyst ratings to inform your own trades and inform your own thesis but it\u2019s a good idea to do your own research. However, analyst ratings are just one step in what should be a much larger investment strategy. Don\u2019t fall in love with just one analyst. Compare notes. Look into how these ratings match with activity on the market and current events. Plus, remember that an analyst rating could easily be incorrect. No one is perfect, but these ratings are a good place to start.\nVisit Benzinga News for more guidance on how to research companies and make decisions about research, trading and investing.\nCompare Online Stock Brokers\n- Best For:Active and Global TradersVIEW PROS & CONS:Securely through Interactive Brokers\u2019 website\n- Best For:Active Short Sellers With Modest CapitalVIEW PROS & CONS:securely through TradeZero's website"

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first. They can help you:\n- Create a tax-smart drawdown plan\n- Manage and grow a diversified investment portfolio\n- Maximize Social Security strategies\n- Protect assets for your spouse or heirs\n- The matching service is fast and free\u2014and designed specifically for individuals with significant investable assets who are looking for personalized, high-quality advice.\nTake the first step toward a more confident retirement. If you have at least $100,000 in investable assets, WiserAdvisor can match you with a pre-screened fiduciary financial advisor in your area.\nBook here to get started; no cost, no obligation.\nBenzinga Money is a reader-supported publication.
