  "description": "The brand witnessed strong retail sales growth across North America, Europe and Asia",
  "content": "Fashion brand Ralph Lauren has reported that its financial performance in the first quarter (Q1) of the fiscal year 2026 (FY26) exceeded expectations with a 14% increase in net revenue to $1.7bn.\n\nThe brand witnessed strong retail sales growth across North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nRalph Lauren president and CEO Patrice Louvet stated: \"We delivered strong first quarter results across geographies, channels and consumer segments.\"\n\nRalph Lauren achieved a gross profit of $1.2bn, with gross margin reaching 72.3%, an increase of 180 basis points over the previous year.\n\nGross margin expansion was primarily attributed to the growth in average unit retail, advantageous shifts in channel and geographic sales mix, and a reduction in cotton costs, which collectively outweighed the additional costs arising from tariffs and other product-related expenses.\n\nNet income for the quarter was $220m - $3.52 per diluted share - on a reported basis, and $236m - $3.77 per diluted share - on an adjusted basis.\n\nRalph Lauren's Q1 saw a surge in new customer acquisition and loyalty, with 1.4 million new consumers in their direct-to-consumer businesses.\n\nGlobal direct-to-consumer comparable store sales saw a 13% increase, propelled by positive retail comparisons across regions and channels.\n\nRalph Lauren raised its full year 2026 outlook to low to mid-single-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis, with foreign currency expected to provide a positive impact by between 150 and 200 basis points.\n\nIt expects operating margin expansion between 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency, driven by operating expense leverage.\n\nIn the second quarter, revenues are projected to grow in the high-single digits on a constant currency basis, with further margin expansion anticipated.\n\nThe company is expecting its capital expenditures to remain between 4% and 5% of revenue in FY26.\n\nLouvet added: \"While we continue to approach the current global operating environment with prudence, we are encouraged by the broad-based strength in our brand and our businesses as we execute on our long-term strategic priorities \u2014 including recruiting new and younger consumers, strengthening our core and high-potential categories, and developing our key city ecosystems in each region.\"\n\n\"Ralph Lauren raises FY26 outlook as Q1 sees 14% revenue growth\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\n\n The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.
