  "summary": "New York City mayoral hopeful Andrew Cuomo has been mocked for re-sharing a tweet from an account named \"Andrew Cuomo is a sex pest\" on his own account, X. The X account, which initially shared a post praising Cuomo's newly unveiled campaign logo, changed its display name after the fact, thereby obscuring the explicit \"sex pest\" claims on Cuomo's account. Cuomo, who resigned in disgrace in 2021 amid a wave of sexual harassment claims, was trolled by X users, who suggested his social media team should be fired. This follows another public mockery of Cuomo for a mea culpa about his campaign.",

We either win or even I will move to Florida. God forbid!\u201d Cuomo told business leaders and other honchos at a Hamptons breakfast hosted by supermarket mogul John Catsimatidis.\nThe statement drew laughs \u2014 and Cuomo\u2019s campaign later insisted he was joking.\n\u201cIt was a wow line,\u201d said one attendee. \u201cIt got everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d\nCuomo, who lost the Democratic primary last month to Mamdani and is running in November\u2019s general election as an independent, repeatedly referred to the 33-year-old socialist as \u201ckid\u201d throughout the breakfast held at hot spot 75 Main.\nThe governor took plenty of shots at Mamdani\u2019s pie-in-the-sky proposals to freeze rents on stabilized apartments, calling it a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for the housing market because it would likely lead to many landlords spending less money maintaining properties.\nMamdani\u2019s campaign did not respond to The Post.\nCuomo saved plenty of ammo for Mayor Adams, another Dem seeking re-election as an independent.\nHe claimed the Big Apple hasn\u2019t had \u201ca competent mayor\u201d since Michael Bloomberg left office at the end 2013 and that Adams \u201ccould not focus\u201d for much of his three-plus years on the job because of a now-closed federal corruption probe and other controversies.\nThe city \u201cfeels out of control,\u201d Cuomo said.\nThe Hamptons crowd included real estate titan Bruce Mosler, former US Ambassador to Greece George Tsunis, state Assemblywoman Rebecca Seawright, Democratic fundraiser Dennis Miehl, longtime Cuomo top aide Melissa DeRosa and Cuomo campaign chairman and former top aide Bill Mulrow.\nCuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said Cuomo was joking about moving to Florida and that the crowd got it.\n\u201cGovernor Cuomo would never give up on New York,\u201d Azzopardi said. \u201cThat said, the line underscored the stakes in the upcoming election and the risk of electing a dangerously inexperienced, hate-spewing 33-year-old socialist whose campaign consists of unrealistic bumper sticker slogans.\u201d\nAdams \u2013 who told The Post earlier this week he\u2019d never leave New York even if it\u2019s run by a socialist \u2013 said Saturday if Cuomo \u201cis serious about moving to Florida, he should go ahead \u2013 he\u2019s already spent three [recent] weekends in the Hamptons.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Craig McCarthy."
