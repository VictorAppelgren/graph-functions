      "summary": "A 46‑year‑old California hiker, Ryan Wardwell, was rescued after two days trapped behind the Seven Teacups waterfalls, with rescuers using a drone and helicopter to extract him from a dark cave. Separately, a 7‑year‑old boy in Florida sustained permanent injuries when a drone from a holiday show struck him, leading to a lawsuit against the city of Orlando and other parties. In Colorado, 23‑year‑old Blake Kieckhafer disappeared after a rideshare drop at Rocky Mountain National Park, with no updates since his last sighting on August 7 and authorities urging tips.",
