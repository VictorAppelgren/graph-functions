      "text": "Cases of tularemia, also known as \u201crabbit fever,\u201d are on the rise in the U.S., according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nCaused by the bacteria Francisella tularensis, the disease commonly infects rabbits, hares and rodents.\nHowever, it is zoonotic, which means it can spread from animals to humans.\nThe bacteria is a \u201ctier-1 select agent,\u201d a classification given to agents and toxins that \u201cpresent the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with significant potential for mass casualties or devastating effects to the economy, critical infrastructure or public confidence, and pose a severe threat to public health and safety,\u201d per the CDC.\nAlthough tularemia is relatively rare, with only 2,462 diagnoses between 2011 and 2022, cases have risen 56% compared to the prior decade (2001 to 2010), as reported in the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\u201cIncreased reporting of probable cases might be associated with an actual increase in human infection, improved tularemia detection or both,\u201d the report states.\nDaniel Ruderfer, M.D., chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Hackensack Meridian K. Hovnanian Children\u2019s Hospital in New Jersey, believes that the increase in cases is mostly due to improved microbiology detection methods.\n\u201cThe traditional method of confirming cases has historically been via growth in culture and antibody testing,\u201d he told Fox News Digital.\n\u201cHowever, newer detection methods, such as PCR testing, are likely a major contributor to the increase in reported cases.\u201d\nHumans can contract the disease through bites from deer flies or ticks, contact with infected animals, or exposure to contaminated water or aerosols, the same source stated.\nSymptoms of tularemia can vary depending on the type of disease.\nGeneral symptoms include chills, headache, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, myalgia, chest discomfort, cough, severe sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, according to Ruderfer.\n\u201cDepending on the location of the infected bit or scratch, people can develop localized lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes) and a cutaneous ulcer at the infection site,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOther manifestations include conjuctivitis, pneumonia and potentially even bloodstream infections.\u201d\nThe death rate from the disease is typically low, less than 2%, but the CDC noted that it can be as high as 24% in rare, severe cases.\nTularemia can be treated with antibiotics, but no vaccine is currently available.\n\u201cThe infection is absolutely dangerous and potentially life-threatening if not treated with appropriate antibiotics,\u201d said Ruderfer.\nThose most at risk include children between 5 and 9 years of age, older men, American Indian and Alaskan Native people, and those living in central U.S. states, according to the report.\nThe general population is not at an \u201cobvious\u201d risk for infection unless they come into physical contact with an infected rabbit, tick or deer fly, the expert noted.\nThose who hunt or interact routinely with rabbits should see a doctor if they develop any concerning symptoms, he advised.\n\u201cMany factors might contribute to the higher risk for tularemia in this population, including the concentration of Native American reservations in central states and sociocultural or occupational activities that might increase contact with infected wildlife or arthropods,\u201d the CDC wrote."

      "text": "The world\u2019s scariest rabbit lurks within the Smithsonian\u2019s collection\nAmong the bats, rats and other ferocious animals that lie within the storage drawers of the mammal collection in the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., an unusual freak of nature can be found.\nThe jackalope, also commonly known as a \u2018Frankenstein\u2019 rabbit, is the stuff of nightmares, with elongated horns protruding from its furry little head. The mythological jackrabbit with the horns of an antelope is an American legend, one that young biology students are taught to regard with the same disbelief as unicorns and werewolves.\nSo when one of the museum\u2019s mammal collection managers, Suzanne Peurach, from U.S. Geological Survey Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, discovered an eastern cottontail rabbit with horny facial growths in the collection, she could not believe it was real.\n\u201cWhen I pulled the rabbit out of the box I thought this must be a joke. I went to school in Albuquerque, N. M., and everywhere you go there are jackalopes in biology professors\u2019 offices and even being sold in stores,\u201d Peurach explains.\n\u201cThose are fake animals, the result of people sewing taxidermy rabbits and deer antlers together. This rabbit was definitely not one of those.\u201d\nIndeed the rabbit was real, and after conferring with Robert Hoffmann, senior Smithsonian mammologist and world authority on rabbits and hares, Peurach learned that the rabbit was infected by Shope papilloma virus. The virus infects rabbits and hares worldwide, causing tumors to grow in various places on a rabbit\u2019s head and body.\nThe Shope papilloma virus is a cancer-causing strain related to the human papillomavirus, or HPV. Whereas HPV corrupts cells in the human cervix to build cancerous tumors, in rabbits the papillomavirus manifests as hard, keratinized horns. If they develop near the mouth, the tumors can become large enough that they interfere with the host\u2019s ability to eat, eventually causing starvation. Such papillomaviruses are found throughout the animal kingdom, including in other mammals, birds and reptiles.\nAlthough American virologist Richard Shope discovered the virus in the 1930s, its distinctive symptoms in rabbits and hares have mystified and inspired people for centuries. Descriptions of horned hares as real or mythical creatures date back to medieval and early Renaissance times, appearing in Bavarian folklore and early scientific texts. Stories and illustrations of horned rabbits as real animals last appeared in scientific books in the late 1700s, after which the idea of a horned hare as a distinct species was mostly rejected.\nSightings of virus-affected rabbits in North America are thought to have influenced the resurrection of the horned rabbit legend. The term \u201cjackalope\u201d was most likely coined by taxidermists who reproduced the horned hare of legend by grafting pronghorn horns onto the mounted head or complete body of a jackrabbit.\nThe New York Times attributes the popularization of the jackalope to Douglas Herrick (1920\u20132003) of Douglas, Wyoming., who in 1932 created and sold the first taxidermy \u201cjackalope.\u201d These taxidermy mounts became hugely popular, with many thousands being made and sold by Herrick\u2019s brother and son.\nToday the jackalope legend is still a popular story, with many outlandish and largely tongue-in-cheek claims as to the mythological creature\u2019s habits. Like most campfire stories, a little bit of truth mixed in with large amounts of imagination can result in a strange cottontail."

      "text": "Head Tumors and Cancer in Rabbits\nShope Papilloma Virus\nShope papilloma virus, sometimes referred to as cottontail cutaneous papilloma virus, is a viral disease that causes malignant tumors to grow in rabbits, often on its head. The virus is seen in wild rabbits, as well as domestic or pet rabbits.\nOutbreaks of the disease more commonly seen during the summer and fall, when populations of disease-carrying insects are highest. Keeping rabbits indoors during these seasons is recommended.\nSymptoms and Types\nA member of the Papovaviridae family, this virus is frequently seen in cottontail rabbits, but may be contagious for other breeds. A rabbit suffering from Shope papilloma virus will have raised, red and rough lesions (usually circular), which are greater than one centimeter in length. These lesions are found in various locations on the upper half of the animal's body, including the neck and shoulders, but are primarily found on the eyelids, ears and other areas of the head. (They are occasionally seen on a rabbit's feet.)\nCause\nThis type of papilloma virus is often spread by biting insects known as arthropods, more specifically mosquitoes and ticks.\nDiagnosis\nTo diagnose the disease, the nodules will have to be removed. A biopsy will then be performed to confirm the malignancy of the cancer.\nTreatment\nSurgical removal of the tumors is generally recommended, as the nodules may become malignant, however, they do occasionally resolve themselves on their own.\nLiving and Management\nRoutine follow-up exams at the veterinarian's office is recommended. This will allow them to monitor the rabbit's progress and remove any recurring tumors. The rabbit must not be allowed to scratch the lesions, as they may bleed and can lead to an infection.\nPrevention\nKeeping the rabbit away from pests, including mosquitoes and ticks, is the best way to prevent the animal from contracting Shope papilloma virus; it will also prevent the spread of the disease.\nFeatured Image: iStock.com/skynesher"

      "text": "Shroud of Turin study unlocks new, key details of Jesus\u2019 burial \u2014 reinforcing accuracy of biblical accounts\nThe blood, sweat and tears on these threads are still \u2014 sorta \u2014 shrouded in mystery.\nNew findings provide more evidence on what Jesus might have been buried in after he was crucified.\nA recent study conducted by Johns Hopkins-trained immunologist Kelly Kearse suggests that it is, in fact, possible that Jesus was buried unwashed, wrapped in spices and linen \u2014 which is believed to be the Shroud of Turin \u2014 as biblical narratives suggest.\nThe research, published in the International Journal of Archaeology in June 2025, specifically referenced a garment where evidence of blood clotting was found.\nAmong the key discoveries from the study, visible rings around bloodstains \u2014 or serum halos \u2014 were found on the linen when examined with a UV light.\nKearse tested multiple samples \u2014 mimicking blood conditions after death, including thickened consistency and increased acidity.\nThe expert also studied the way that blood transfers to textiles in various conditions and compared it to the bloodstains on the Shroud of Turin with a microscope.\nThe immunologist, who has studied the shroud for years, believes that this is a revealing element that can help provide context for Jesus\u2019 burial conditions \u2014 specifically, for what he calls \u2018the washing hypothesis,\u2019 according to the study.\nA previous study of the shroud, done in 1998, concluded that if a body was indeed enveloped in the cloth, it was washed before burial.\nThe serum halos are only visible if wounds begin to clot before touching the surface. If the body were washed or cleaned, the stains wouldn\u2019t be as prominent.\nBiblical passages suggest that the Jewish burial customs observed prohibited the washing of bodies that suffered violent deaths, with the belief that blood should not be separated from the physical body in the case of murder.\nCountless studies about the Shroud of Turin have been conducted across the centuries since it surfaced, and skeptics have suggested various theories about the authenticity of the shroud itself and the biblical account.\nOne such recent inquiry into the iconic cloth is that it was not the messiah\u2019s post-mortem mode, but rather, it was used to swathe an artist\u2019s chiseled Christ-like copy, a study suggested."

Please view the news release for additional details and alternative office information.\nMeeker Office Closure\nThe Meeker office is closed until further notice due to the Lee Fire. Please view the news release for additional details and alternative office information.\nColorado is home to three species of cottontail rabbits: the mountain, the desert, and the eastern cottontails.\nAlmost everyone recognizes rabbits with their distinctive hopping gait and long ears. Colorado is home to three different species of cottontail rabbits; the mountain cottontail, the desert cottontail, and the eastern cottontail. The species of cottontails differ mostly by color and are difficult or impossible to distinguish in the field, except by habitat and geographic location.\nDisease\nRabbit papillomas are growths on the skin caused by the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus. The growths have no significant effects on wild rabbits unless they interfere with eating/drinking. Most infected cottontails can survive the viral infection, after which the growths will go away. For this reason, CPW does not recommend euthanizing rabbits with papillomas unless they are interfering with the rabbit\u2019s ability to eat and drink.\nLike other papillomaviruses, this virus is specific to rabbits and does not cause disease in other species. There is a risk of transmission to domestic rabbits, especially if rabbits are housed outdoors where they may contact wild rabbits or biting insects. In domestic rabbits, the disease is more severe than in wild rabbits and should be treated by a veterinarian.\nCottontails are about 16 inches long and weigh about two pounds. Cottontails are smaller and have shorter ears than shoeshoe hares and jackrabbits. Also unlike hares, cottontails do not change color in the winter.\nMountain cottontails live in the mountains and in the northwest, desert cottontails live in the southwest and on the eastern plains, eastern cottontails live in woodlands along watercourses in the east.\nCottontails mostly live in brushy country. Therefore they may be favored by habitat disturbance, such as forest clearance, burning, and ornamental plantings. They spend the day in a shallow depression in the shelter of a thicket. Cottontails are a familiar sight across Colorado, including in urban and suburban areas.\nThey eat vegetation, both herbaceous and woody, feeding early morning and late afternoon throughout the year.\nReproduction takes place throughout the warmer months, with females giving birth to two to six litters of four to seven blind, pink young after a gestation period of about four weeks. Such high birth rates obviously must be balanced by high death rates or ecosystems would be overwhelmed by cottontails.\nThe primary predators of adult cottontails are coyotes, foxes, hawks, and owls. Weasels and rattlesnakes prey on the young, and disease and parasites take a toll on all age groups. Maximum life span in the wild is no more than about a year. Human hunters kill 50,000 or more cottontails some years."

Unfortunately, this year, due to the shower peaking close to a nearly Full Moon, visibility will be compromised.\nThe moon will technically be in its waning gibbous phase, or 85% illuminated, making meteor viewing more challenging. Still, according to experts, sky gazers still stand to see 10 to 20 meteors per hour.\nWhen to watch the Perseid meteor shower\nHopeful watchers have two windows tonight and in the wee hours of tomorrow to catch the shooting star show.\nThis evening, there will be a one-hour gap between dusk and moonrise, providing a prime canvas to see \u201cEarth grazers,\u201d or meteors that graze the upper atmosphere.\nWhile these beauties may be few and far between, they are long and long-lasting, painting the sky for two to three seconds a pop.\nOur second viewing window opens in the last hours before daybreak on Wednesday, roughly 3 a.m. \u2013 6 a.m.\nWhile the nearly full moon will be clogging the southern sky with its lunar light, viewers can turn their gaze northward toward the constellation Perseus and catch a few bright meteors before the sun rises.\nWhere to see the Perseid meteor shower\nAs a celestial boon to those who are rising early or staying up late, the Perseid peak occurs just after the conjunction of Venus and Jupiter, and the two luminaries will still be cuddling close together and shining brightly in the sky just before sunrise.\nHow to see the Perseid meteor shower\nThe Perseids are best viewed under clear skies and away from the maddening hum of crowds and the ugly interference of light pollution.\nAnd while many a noob will reach for a telescope or binoculars, it is better to take in the entirety of the sky, rather than a small part.\nThe meteors can and will appear anywhere up there, but your best bet is to stare into the darkest part of the sky that your location affords. For best results, lie flat on your back. After roughly 30 minutes, your eyes will adjust to the dark..\nWhile the Perseids peak tonight, the shower will keep on showering through Sept. 1, giving us more time for gazing. Conditions will improve as the moon wanes back to the black of a New Moon on Aug. 23.\nAstrologer Reda Wigle researches and irreverently reports on planetary configurations and their effect on each zodiac sign.

      "text": "Psychopaths are most likely to live in these 4 states, a frightening new study reveals\nAs it turns out, our personalities are, in fact, shaped by the environments we grow up in, and Nevada, New York, South Dakota, and Texas contain the highest percentages of those in possession of \u201cdark personality traits.\u201d\nA recent study conducted by Ingo Zettler, Lau Lilleholt, Benjamin E. Hilbig, Morten Moshagen, and Martina Bader at the University of Copenhagen found that humans display different levels of dark personality traits depending on their location and the concentration of aversive societal conditions (ASC) that place possesses.\nDark personality traits, or the dark triad, are recognized by psychologists as psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism \u2014 the desire or urge to exploit others.\nMeanwhile, ASC can be defined as societal circumstances that occur on a large, collective scale, such as exploitation, fraud, corruption, inequality, and violence, among others.\n\u201cIt is relatively well known that both genetic and socio-ecological factors shape individuals\u2019 personality. However, respective research has hardly considered ethically or socially aversive personality characteristics,\u201d Ingo Zettler, co-author and point-person on the study, told Newsweek.\nThe study, published in 2025, took place across a period of 20 years, in which researchers studied global correlations between general living conditions and the percentage of the population that possesses dark traits.\nThe study probed 183 countries across the world with a total of 1,791,542 participants.\nIn their exploration of the correlation between dark personality traits and aversive social conditions, the researchers examined the U.S. through the lens of individual states.\nData was gathered via survey, and for the U.S.-focused portion of the study, used Census data on socioeconomic disparity and poverty, FBI homicide rates, and Justice Department corruption sentences to draw conclusions.\nWithin the U.S., researchers looked into all 50 states and compiled responses from 144,576 Americans.\n\u201cThe more adverse conditions in a society, the higher the level of the dark factor of personality among its citizens,\u201d Zettler summarized. \u201cAversive personality traits are associated with behaviors such as aggression, cheating, and exploitation \u2014 and thus with high social costs. Therefore, even small variations can lead to large differences in how societies function.\u201d\nUrban areas of the United States tend to house extraordinarily economically diverse populations \u2014 cities like Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco \u2014 in close concentration, which can lead to tensions and concerns over quality of life and equal access to essential resources, resulting in higher D levels.\nOn the other hand, rural areas \u2014 like much of Vermont, Utah, Maine, and Oregon, the four states with the lowest probability of producing individuals as a result of living conditions \u2014 are more likely to be geographically isolated and relatively economically balanced, per findings from the study.\n\u201cBecause you might grow up in a country with a high ASC, you\u2019re not necessarily fated to become an immoral, exploitative, and self-centered individual,\u201d wrote Susan Krauss Whitbourne in Psychology Today. \u201cWhat the findings suggest, instead, is that consistent with the adaptational hypothesis, people may acquire a tendency toward high levels of D if that\u2019s what they see around them, or if their own economic deprivation and hardship are particularly pronounced.\u201d\n\u201cOur findings substantiate that personality is not just something we are born with, but also shaped by the society we grew up and live in,\u201d Zettler concluded.\n\u201cThis means that reforms that reduce corruption and inequality not only create better living conditions just now, they may also contribute to mitigating aversive personality levels among the citizens in the future.\u201d"

The virus, transmitted by parasites like ticks and fleas, primarily affects wild rabbits but can be more severe in domestic ones, potentially leading to starvation or cancer. While the virus poses no threat to humans or pets, wildlife experts advise the public to avoid contact with infected rabbits.",
