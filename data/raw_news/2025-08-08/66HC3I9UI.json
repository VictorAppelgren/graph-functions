[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Trae Fitzgerald. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Please note that our remarks in this conference call may include forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws or forward-looking information under applicable Canadian securities legislation, which we collectively refer to as forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the company's current views and intentions with respect to future results or events and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or events to vary from those indicated in forward-looking statements.\n\nExamples of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in our disclosure documents filed with the SEC or the security regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada. Because of these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements made in this conference call are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligations to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\n\nThe second quarter financial supplement and financial news release as well as the related financial statements are available on the SEC's website.\n\nI'll now turn it over to our CEO, Casey Hoyt, to get things started.\n\nOkay.
