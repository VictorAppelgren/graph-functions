  "description": "Jordan and Bryant take a joint place atop the sports card world",
  "content": "A unique Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant card has officially surpassed the two most iconic baseball cards in history to claim supremacy in the sports card world.\n\nThe one-of-a-kind Jordan and Bryant 2007-08 Upper Deck Exquisite Collection Dual Logoman (the NBA logo patch from each of their game-worn jerseys) autographed patch card sold for $12.932 million through Heritage Auctions early Sunday morning. It\u2019s now the most expensive sports card ever sold. Heritage\u2019s estimated value for the card going into the auction was $6 million, just above the previous record sale for a basketball card.\n\nThe Jordan/Bryant card, which Heritage\u2019s director of sports auctions Chris Ivy called \u201cthe finest modern basketball card in the world,\u201d passed the top two sales of the T-206 Honus Wagner card ($6.6 million and $7.25 million), as well as the sale of the only 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle #311 with a \u201cMint-Plus\u201d 9.5 grade from SGC \u2014 the \u201cfinest known example\u201d of that card \u2014 which went for $12.6 million in August 2022. The Wagner and Mantle cards have long been the ultimate icons of the sports card world, but the new record represents a passing of the torch to a new generation of icons.\n\nThe previous all-time record for any known basketball card sale was held by a one-of-one Stephen Curry 2009 Panini National Treasures Logoman autographed patch rookie card that went for $5.9 million in a private sale. The previous record price for any basketball card within a public auction was $3.12 million in 2022 for a one-of-a-kind Luka Don\u010di\u0107 2018 Panini National Treasures Logoman autographed patch rookie card (that had changed hands in a private sale a year earlier for $4.6 million).\n\nJordan\u2019s previous highest priced card was his one-of-a-kind 2003-04 Upper Deck Ultimate Collection Ultimate Logos Logoman autographed patch card, which sold in June 2024 for $2.93 million via Goldin. Bryant\u2019s previous highest priced card sale happened earlier this month when his one-of-a-kind 2015-16 Panini Flawless Logoman autographed patch card sold for $2.3 million in a private sale.\n\nHere\u2019s an updated list of the most expensive sports cards of all time, according to Card Ladder, which tracks trading card sales across a variety of platforms:\n\nThe record sale for a piece of sports memorabilia of any kind came almost exactly one year ago, when Babe Ruth\u2019s 1932 World Series \u201ccalled shot\u201d jersey was sold by Heritage for $24.12 million.\n\nThis Jordan/Bryant card is the only dual Logoman card to feature these two players together. Jordan shares four with LeBron James, however. Cards featuring Logoman patches are among the most coveted by modern basketball card collectors and this one is made even more unique since the Jordan patch in it is the gold variant used during the NBA\u2019s 50th season in 1996-97.\n\nThe stratospheric sale displays the continued popularity of Jordan and Bryant within today\u2019s sports card market.\n\nEven now, Jordan is consistently the most searched athlete on eBay every month, with total card sales of $34,108,318 from January through July 2025, according to GemRate \u2014 almost $10 million more than the athlete with the second highest sales total this year, Shohei Ohtani. Bryant ranks fourth with $15,239,311 spent on his cards during the same time period, according to GemRate. Mantle isn\u2019t too far behind with $13 million in card sales this year, ranking eighth.\n\nWhat to read next:\n\u2022 The best Michael Jordan cards to collect\n\u2022 The best Kobe Bryant cards to collect\n\u2022 Michael Jordan card prices are surpassing pandemic peaks \u2014 why now?\n\u2022 What we learned from the sports card industry\u2019s biggest month of 2025 so far\n\nThe Athletic maintains full editorial independence in all our coverage.

      "text": "Michael Jordan\u2019s impact on both the NBA and the growth of the basketball card industry has left a lasting influence.\nThe five-time NBA MVP\u2019s trading cards have been graded by PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator), by far the largest grading company, over 1.6 million times, unquestionably the most by any athlete (Ken Griffey Jr. is a distance second with more than 700,000). Jordan also consistently leads eBay\u2019s list of most searched athletes more than 20 years after he ended his playing career once and for all. His one-of-a-kind legacy and the Jordan brand\u2019s continuing cultural influence beyond the court both contribute to the massive demand for basketball cards and collectibles that we see today.\nAdvertisement\nSo what are the best options when it comes to the large selection of Jordan trading cards on the market? We can\u2019t list them all, but here\u2019s what we like at a wide range of price points.\nTop pick (full recommendations below)\nJordan\u2019s 1987 Fleer #59 is my top value recommendation based on it being one of the first official NBA-licensed trading cards of his career. Another factor is its reasonable cost in near-mint PSA grades (currently about $450) compared to the high-end price of his 1986 Fleer which makes it especially appealing to the average collector.\nThings to know before buying\nThe value of sports cards can fluctuate for various reasons such as condition, print runs, or graded population. Other factors that can cause prices to go up or down include player performance, market trends, and health of the wider economy. The secondary sales market for individual cards of a given sport generally hits its lowest point during the offseason (in other words, you can usually find better prices in the offseason than during the season). My recommendations are not an attempt to promote specific investment behavior or trading advice, but to guide and inform readers about popular and unique cards that are celebrated by the sports card community.\nUltimately, the best cards to collect are always the ones you will personally enjoy most, regardless of whether they go up or down in value. The recommendations below should serve as a starting point for cards to consider, but a big part of the fun in collecting is the hunt for the cards you like.\n\u201cRaw\u201d cards vs. Graded cards\nCards can come out of the pack (their \u201craw\u201d state) with a wide variety of imperfections that can impact their value. Card grading is a process in which an expert of the field determines the condition of a card based on a number of factors (including corner sharpness, image centering, print imperfections, and more) and assigns a numerical grade, usually on a scale of 1-10 (with the latter being close to perfect) and sealed in a protective case. There are a number of grading companies, each with their own unique grading scales, but PSA is by far the largest and most prominent in the industry. Cards graded a \u201cPSA 10\u201d can carry a significant value multiplier compared to raw cards or those graded by other companies.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s fine (and often cheaper) to buy cards raw, but if you want to ensure authenticity and/or a minimum condition level, and you\u2019re not experienced at determining card condition for yourself, you may want to buy a graded card instead \u2014 particularly if you\u2019re buying online and only able to see the card in photographs.\nBest low-end (~$1-$99) Michael Jordan cards\nThis is a category for collectors who are on a tighter budget or aren\u2019t as concerned about the long-term monetary value of the cards they buy.\nTopps Finest cards are generally recognized as one of the earliest chromium basketball sets in modern collecting, so I had to include the first NBA-licensed chrome card of \u201cHis Airness\u201d from 1993.\nUnlike traditional paper cards, chrome cards use a thicker, shinier paper stock, which gives them a polished, metallic look. The card\u2019s darkened portrayal of Jordan commanding a rebound that\u2019s accompanied by a colorful background may not look as aesthetically pleasing as today\u2019s modern chrome cards, but it\u2019s a testament to the industry\u2019s innovation over the last three decades.\nDespite the set\u2019s claim to fame in the hobby, this card lands in the low-end section of the price ranges because of the surplus of MJ 1993 Finest base cards produced and graded. As a result, Raw and PSA 8 copies of this card are fetching around $50.\nThe set also offers a refractor that I\u2019d highly consider if you are interested in a limited parallel of his base card and are willing to spend a bit more money.\nThe significance of this being Jordan\u2019s first chrome card during his NBA career and the mainstream appeal of chrome sets to both novice and experienced collectors alike makes it a desirable one.\nMore expensive variations and parallels: Refractor\nFleer\u2019s Metal Universe is one of the most appreciated basketball sets of the 1990s and known for its ultra-rare and highly coveted Precious Metal Gems parallels and out-of-this-world base card designs.\nThe front of Jordan\u2019s 1997 Metal Universe #23 card features an image of him soaring through outer space on his way to the rim for a sensational dunk \u2014 a particularly fun design for the star of the original Space Jam movie. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s Jordan\u2019s most beautifully designed base card from this era.\nAdvertisement\nThe recognition and high price tag of Jordan\u2019s Metal Universe PMGs have caused a growing demand for his more accessible base card from the set.\nEven though it wasn\u2019t not issued during his rookie season or early in his NBA career, the nostalgic aspects of this card design have it selling ungraded for around $50-$100.\nMore expensive parallels of this card: Precious Metal Gems (Red /100, Emerald /10)\nBest value (~$100-$499) Michael Jordan cards\nThis is a category for collectors looking to pay a bit more for cards that have some degree of scarcity and have a better chance at retaining or increasing in value long-term.\nMost fans are generally priced out of some of the first Jordan cards that were produced, but his 1987 Fleer #59 won\u2019t break the bank and is still one of his earliest NBA cards. Even though Jordan\u2019s rookie season was in \u201984-\u201985, in terms of nationally distributed sets that were available in traditional packs and boxes, it\u2019s considered his second-year card.\nWhen Jordan made his NBA debut, basketball cards were not being made by major companies like Topps and Fleer because of a lack of interest. Since he didn\u2019t have an official industry-standard rookie card during his first NBA season and this one marks his second appearance on a Fleer basketball card (his first coming in the now iconic \u201986-\u201987 set), the collecting community deems it to be the sophomore card of MJ\u2019s career.\nThe card\u2019s centering issues (collectors and graders want the design elements to be close to dead center on both the front and back of the card, but the manufacturing process can be imperfect and make that difficult to find) have resulted in a small number of PSA-graded examples at the highest end of the scale \u2014 only 215 have received a PSA 10. Out of the nearly 20,000 examples of this card submitted to the company, less than 3,000 have received a PSA 9 or 10 grade.\nAdvertisement\nThe more affordable price of his 1987 Fleer #57 in raw and near-mint PSA graded copies, combined with it being one of his first official NBA cards is why this is my best value recommendation. Raw and graded up to PSA 8 copies of his second official NBA-licensed card are selling for between $200 and $500 on eBay.\nJordan has three cards in the 1988 Fleer set, which marks the third year the company produced official basketball cards of the NBA\u2019s new superstar.\nJordan\u2019s 1988 Fleer All-Star #120 card is generally less recognized than his #17 base card from the set, but the image of his free-throw line dunk from the 1987 Slam Dunk contest is much more iconic than the one used for his base card.\nAccording to the PSA population report, there are less than 19,000 examples of this card graded by the company, and under 4,000 have received a Mint 9 grade. (For comparison, there are around 28,000 PSA graded examples of his 1988 Fleer #17 and about 8,200 PSA 9s.)\nDespite the card\u2019s relatively low supply in high grades, PSA 9 copies are selling for under $500. If you prefer to buy the card not graded, you can own one for less than $100, depending on its condition.\nJordan\u2019s 1988 Fleer All-Star card is a must-have for basketball card historians and represents a monumental moment in his career before the MVP awards and championships.\nBest high-end (~$1,000+) Michael Jordan cards\nThis is a category for collectors looking to acquire the most desired Jordan cards on the market.\nThe overall importance of Jordan\u2019s 1986 Fleer #57 is undeniable and heavily influenced the future of basketball card collecting as we know it today. While it\u2019s technically not Jordan\u2019s first NBA card (more on that shortly), it\u2019s widely accepted as his official rookie card.\nThe gap in the production of nationally distributed NBA cards between Topps\u2019 last offering at the time in 1982 and Fleer\u2019s return to making traditional NBA sets in 1986 make that year\u2019s checklist a who\u2019s who of rookie cards. At 50 cents per pack upon release, collectors had a chance to pull rookie cards of Jordan, Charles Barkley, Hakeem (then \u201cAkeem\u201d) Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, Patrick Ewing, Dominque Wilkins, and Karl Malone \u2014 just to name a few eventual Hall of Famers.\nAdvertisement\nPSA has graded around 25,000 copies of Jordan\u2019s most famous card, with less than 350 receiving a Gem Mint 10 grade. As I write this, PSA 10s are selling between $165,000 and $200,000 (down from an all-time high of $840,000 achieved during the pandemic boom of 2021). On the flip side, graded examples that have received the lowest score (PSA 1) are selling in the range of $2,000.\nSince the legendary set\u2019s release, Jordan\u2019s Fleer #57 rookie card has become a cultural phenomenon and is the most treasured sports cards on the planet. It\u2019s one card I hope to add to my collection one day (even if it\u2019s a PSA 1).\nAlthough the hobby has long crowned Jordan\u2019s 1986 Fleer as his most coveted card, the 1984 Star #101 is his first NBA card with the Chicago Bulls.\nBefore Fleer released basketball cards in 1986, Star made limited amounts of NBA-licensed cards from 1983 to 1985 that were mostly distributed as team sets through specific NBA promotions and were not released in conventional packs. Since Star cards were not produced at a nationwide scale or available in traditional packs, many collectors classify this card as an extended rookie card, or \u201cXRC.\u201d\nIts low quantity in raw and PSA graded copies cannot be understated and is one of the major selling points of Jordan\u2019s 1984 Star #101 card. PSA has graded less than 400 copies with only three receiving a PSA 9 (one of which sold for $925,000 in 2024) and none graded higher. It\u2019s worth noting that the lack of PSA graded cards stems from many counterfeits produced during the 1980s and 90s. The difficulty of differentiating the real card versus fake copies proved to be too troublesome, which caused PSA to stop accepting authentication or grading submissions for 1984 Star basketball cards for a time. However, in 2022, the company announced it would resume grading and authenticating Jordan\u2019s highly coveted Star #101. Since then, the demand and popularity surrounding the card have skyrocketed, with sales of near-mint-to-mint examples graded by PSA reaching six figures.\nHaving said that, the fact that it predates Jordan\u2019s historic 1986 Fleer makes it a key card to own for his hardcore fans.\nOther cool Michael Jordan Cards\nOnce Jordan propelled the popularity of the NBA to new heights, overproduction came to basketball cards in the early \u201990s, making most of his cards in that era largely worthless. But with overproduction came more variety and fun inserts, like \u201993-\u201994 Upper Deck\u2019s Skylights, which featured players soaring across the skyline of the city in which they played. The result were cards that looked like the ubiquitous sports posters of that time. Jordan\u2019s Skylights card was particularly fitting. You can get a raw example of it for just a few bucks, but the production flaws of that period make PSA 10s relatively rare (just 221 out of more than 2,700 graded) and valuable.\nMichael Jordan\u2019s shot to end the 1998 NBA finals and seal his sixth championship is arguably the most iconic moment in the league\u2019s history. Jordan retired for the second (but not final) time after that series and Upper Deck decided to commemorate the occasion by buying the actual court Game 6 was played on from the Utah Jazz and put pieces of it into trading cards. The result were these MJ\u2019s Final Floor cards that are a unique item for any fan of Jordan or The Last Dance. Be aware that there are regular-sized versions of these cards and jumbo-sized versions, with the smaller ones generally carrying the higher price tag.\nThe first official autographed cards of Jordan in a Chicago Bulls uniform were offered by Upper Deck in its debut release of 1996 SPx Basketball. The innovative set introduced collectors to Holoview technology for the first time, a process that creates unique hologram cards with a perimeter die-cut design.\nAdvertisement\nCollectors who purchased packs in hopes of pulling the set\u2019s biggest chase card certainly did not have luck on their side, with one Jordan SPx autograph redemption card found in every 34,560 packs.\nIn exchange for the pulled redemption card, Upper Deck sent back the autograph card with a serial numbered hologram sticker on the back and a separate authentication card that matched the numbers on the sticker. The original redemptions that were placed in packs and redeemed have a serial that starts with BAC or BAD. Other autograph versions of this card with different hologram prefixes were not included in SPx packs and were distributed by Upper Deck as promotional giveaways at Jordan\u2019s basketball camps.\nAside from obvious reasons, Jordan\u2019s autograph cards command four-figure prices because he simply does not sign cards as much as he used to. The main reason for this is that he has an exclusive autograph deal with Upper Deck, who haven\u2019t produced NBA-licensed trading cards in nearly 15 years.\nAdding any Jordan autographed card to your collection would be a special achievement, but the 1996 SPx is a particularly special one. (The non-autographed 1996 SPx #8 card is still cool too, and much more affordable and readily available).\nWhen I think about the popular multi-sport athletes, Jordan usually takes a backseat to players like Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders. However, his transition to professional baseball in 1994 produced some really cool and somewhat surreal cards.\nAlthough this card was made before his stint playing in the minor leagues, the 1991 Upper Deck baseball checklist included a fun short print card of Jordan hitting batting practice in a Chicago White Sox hat and uniform. The image of the card was captured at Wrigley Field before the 1990 Windy City Classic between the Cubs and White Sox. (A \u201cshort print\u201d is a card that is produced in significantly lower quantities than other cards in the same set.)\nIt\u2019s still a relatively common card that can be purchased for less than $20, but PSA 10 examples sell between $400-$500.\nGetting the best price\nPrices for a certain trading card can vary wildly and fluctuate quickly, making it important to check recent sales of a given card to make sure you\u2019re buying at a fair value. You can check recent sales of an item on eBay by selecting the \u201csold items\u201d filter on search results. You can also run a search on 130point.com, which is a free site that provides sales data from a number of top online marketplaces. There are also several apps that provide more in-depth sales data, often charging subscription fees for full access.\nAdvertisement\nTo account for outliers and scams, it\u2019s important to consider multiple previous sales, not just the single most recent. It\u2019s also important to note the recency of those sales and any real-world factors that could affect changes in value.\nWhy you should trust us\nAs a second-generation collector, Tyler Holzhammer started collecting cards and attending the National Sports Collectors Convention at 10 years old. He\u2019s evolved his passion as a collector into a career, previously providing sports card content and market analysis for companies like Sports Card Investor and Goldin Auctions. Tyler\u2019s sports card collection is centered around players from his favorite teams, the Los Angeles Rams and the St. Louis Cardinals.\nThe Athletic maintains full editorial independence in all our coverage.

      "text": "There are many theories why the value of sports cards exploded during the pandemic but the fact itself is undeniable. The peak prices achieved then are viewed as an outlier, a bubble, something to be ignored when looking at the otherwise linear appreciation of vintage cards.\nBut four years after that market peak of early 2021, that\u2019s not true for a subset of low-population cards of the long-retired athlete most identified with this period. These cards are now hitting new highs, surpassing even peak pandemic levels.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Bryan Denison, \u201cCajun Cardboard\u201d on YouTube, a Michael Jordan card collector who closely tracks their values, the most recent Fanatics Collect auction saw multiple Jordan cards exceed or meet prior-highest-ever prices. Denison has a 41-part series on YouTube where he ranks Jordan cards based on \u201cdemand, aesthetics, scarcity and value.\u201d His top tier of Jordan cards out of the 378 he assesses (you can see all four tiers listed out here) are mostly low population cards from the 1990s in high grades. This tier consists of 27 cards. While it includes his iconic 1986-87 Fleer rookie card for its demand, Denison\u2019s most heavily-weighted criteria, the card\u2019s value is currently a fraction of its all-time high (last sale of a gem-mint PSA 10 grade example sold for $348,000 in April and the all-time high was $645,000 in February 2021) while others are soaring.\nTop row: 1997 Metal Universe PMG Green #23 /10, 1997 Metal Universe PMG Red #23 /100* (Qty. 90), 1997 Metal Universe Championship PMG #23 /50, 1998 Metal Universe PMG #1 /50, 1998 Skybox Molten Metal Fusion Titanium #41 /40, 1997 E-X2001 Essential Credentials Now #9 /9, 1997 E-X2001 Essential Credentials Future #9 /72, 1998 UD Choice Starquest Gold #SQ30 /100, 1997 Finest Die-Cut Gold Embossed Refractor #154 /74\nMiddle row: 1998 Fleer Tradition Playmakers Theatre #9 /100, 1986 Fleer #57, 1997 Ultra Stars Gold #1, 1998 Hoops Slam Bams #1 /100, 1984 Star #101, 1997 Skybox Premium Team Skybox Star Rubies #235 /50, 1997 Skybox Premium Star Rubies #29 /50, 1998 Skybox Premium Star Rubies #23 /50, 1997 SPx Grand Finale #6 /50\nBottom row: 1997 E-X2001 Jambalaya #6, 1997 Flair Showcase Row 0 Legacy Collection #1 /100, 1997 Flair Showcase Row 1 Legacy Collection #1 /100, 1997 Flair Showcase Row 2 Legacy Collection #1 /100, 1997 Flair Showcase Row 3 Legacy Collection #1 /100, 1996 Flair Showcase Row 0 Legacy Collection #23 /150, 1996 Flair Showcase Row 1 Legacy Collection #23 /150, 1996 Flair Showcase Row 2 Legacy Collection #23 /150, 1998 NBA Hoops Starting Five #23 /5\nAdvertisement\nIt was that Jordan rookie card that became the symbol of the exploding sports card hobby during the pandemic. The combination of a housebound nation and the suspension of sports made his \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d docuseries a phenomenon. During its 10-episode run that spanned five weeks, \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d became the most viewed documentary in ESPN history. Then it transferred to Netflix, attracting nearly 24 million more international viewers. It turned out that many wanted to cap the experience by spending some of the money they saved by not being able to do anything or go anywhere on Jordan cards, particularly targeting his rookie card, a category long regarded as the best investment among buyers.\n\u201cCards actually entered a boom in 2018,\u201d Denison said. \u201cAt least what anyone in their right mind would consider a boom. Then the pandemic scared everyone (in the hobby) \u2014 we thought cards would go down. But they went up. \u2026 Then the Jordan doc hits and creates a wave of nostalgia and a massive increase in demand early in 2021.\n\u201cBut it was uneducated, FOMO (fear of missing out), unsophisticated. People ignored the fundamentals of card populations and what was certain to happen once grading got back online. There were thousands and thousands of cards that were going to be added to (graded) populations. So it was inorganic growth. You can say the supply was unknown but savvy people knew. Remember, 95 percent of cards in the hobby don\u2019t matter at all. Only five percent do. And for the five percent of cards, the so-called pandemic peak will prove to be just a speed bump.\u201d\nThe Jordan rookie, according to Denison, is too common to meet all of his top-tier criteria. According to CardLadder, which tracks trading card prices and populations, there are more than 47,000 graded examples of that card. That includes over 900 in gem mint condition. Denison said he sold his perfect Jordan rookie during the peak and put all that money into other Jordan cards in lower populations that were being largely ignored by newbie investors, \u201cbig-money fund managers and rich people\u201d who he says \u201cknew nothing about this market.\u201d\nAs iconic as the Jordan rookie card remains in the hobby, it\u2019s been mired in a post-peak malaise, relatively speaking. A PSA 8 (NM-MT on a scale of 1-to-10) sells for about $8,000-to-$9,000 now, according to CardLadder, far off its pandemic high of $20,000. Even if you ignore the top of the market that spiked dramatically and quickly retreated over a period of just a few months, your five-year return on investment on a Jordan rookie card is only about 30 percent. The S&P 500 has doubled in value in the same period.\nAdvertisement\nBut contrast that to Denison\u2019s rarities, which are at least matching and often selling well above prior highs. In a recent video, he highlighted eight cards, including a Jordan 1997 Flair Showcase Legacy Row Two numbered to 100 in PSA 8 condition, a 1996 Topps Mystery Finest Borderless Refractor and a widely issued 1992 Upper Deck McDonald\u2019s Hologram that\u2019s very hard to find in gem mint condition due to printing issues. Denison used historic prices to illustrate how all reached new highs, with the Topps Mystery selling for over four times more than its previous top sale.\nSavvy buyers are embracing the fundamentals of supply and demand.\n\u201cWith the way modern cards are trending, people are going for true rare and scarce,\u201d said Juho Whang, a New Jersey-based collector/investor who also sets up occasionally at shows. \u201cI collect Jordans. Focusing on scarcity is the way to go \u2014 1990s playing days in a Bulls\u2019 uniform in low population and in high grade.\u201d Whang warns that you need pretty deep pockets to pursue these cards at current prices, which are well into the four figures at a minimum.\nWhang added that he has an 8.5 BVG (Beckett graded) rookie Jordan and that the card had been worth as much as $17,000. But it\u2019s now worth about half that. If you ignore the very brief pandemic-fueled period where the card could have fetched that top amount, Whang said the card is \u201cbasically keeping up with inflation.\u201d\nDenison has his Top 10 Jordan cards listed on the Fanatics Collect website.\nThey are not listed in order. When pushed to pick a top five in order of expected return, he listed the 1997 Metal Universe Precious Metal Gems at the top (the Red, Championship and Green), 1997 SPx Grand Finale, and 1997 Skybox Premium Star Rubies. All of those cards had print runs of 100 or less.\nDenison and Whang agree these are old-school concepts rooted in the vintage, \u201850s and \u201860s era where the supply of cards is a paramount consideration. Back then, parents created scarcity by throwing children\u2019s cards away every year. For the past 30 years or so, that scarcity has been manufactured into the products. But sometimes it\u2019s due to the rarity of a common card in high grade.\nAdvertisement\nJordan\u2019s popularity is expected to endure. He is still consistently the most searched athlete across all sports on eBay every month, beating out the hottest stars of today. His brand and especially his sneakers keeps him relevant to new generations, and it was recently announced that he\u2019ll be joining the NBA coverage on NBC as a special contributor. He\u2019s widely considered to be at that Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle level of transcendent sports superstardom that will never fade in the eyes of the public.\nThe Athletic maintains full editorial independence in all our coverage.

      "text": "July was the biggest month in what is shaping up to be another big year for the trading card industry. According to CardLadder, which tracks trading card sales across online marketplaces, more than $314 million was spent on cards last month \u2014 and that\u2019s not counting all the in-person deals that happened as The National Sports Collectors Convention got underway in Chicago as July turned to August \u2014 the highest monthly total so far this year.\nAdvertisement\nAs by far the largest collectibles marketplace, eBay accounted for about 86 percent (about $267 million, by CardLadder\u2019s tally). So what were collectors buying, selling, and searching for in such big numbers? The answers tell a lot about the current state of the sports card market.\nAccording to eBay, the five most searched athletes on the platform are names that have dominated the list all year long: Michael Jordan, Jayden Daniels, Caitlin Clark, JJ McCarthy, and Shohei Ohtani. But while those names have firmly been atop the most searched list, some newcomers have been on the rise. Search interest in New York Giants rookie running back Cam Skattebo jumped more than 190 percent from June to July and searches for \u201cTetairoa McMillan auto,\u201d referencing autographs from the Carolina Panthers\u2019 rookie receiver, shot up more than 300 percent, eBay says.\nIn baseball, four rookies have seen significant increases in searches from March to July:\n- Jacob Misiorowski (up more than 3,800 percent)\n- Hyeseong Kim (up more than 2,900 percent)\n- Nick Kurtz (up more than 1300 percent)\n- Jacob Wilson (up more than 360 percent)\nAnd those searches for Kurtz have translated to big money moving into the Athletics\u2019 first baseman\u2019s cards. GemRate, which tracks graded card populations, has started compiling eBay sales data, which showed that Kurtz had the biggest increase in money shifting into his cards of any athlete in July.\n1. Nick Kurtz: +$935k ($1.15 million total July sales, $2.12m YTD)\n2. Hulk Hogan: +$840k ($960k, $1.8m)\n3. Caitlin Clark: +$734k ($3.08m, $15.16m)\n4. Michael Jordan: +$600k ($5.37m, $34.10m)\n5. Shohei Ohtani: +$393k ($3.82m, $24.13m)\n6. Ryne Sandberg: +$336k\n7. Cal Raleigh: +$316k\n8. LeBron James: +$286k\n9. Tom Brady: +$270k\n10. Patrick Mahomes: +$247k\nSome takeaways from this list: While Kurtz\u2019s spike was huge, his overall market is still relatively small. It will likely take a larger sample size of success to grow his market, especially since he\u2019s playing for the Athletics. \u2026 The deaths of Hogan and Sandberg prompted fans to pay tribute by adding to their collections. \u2026 Just a little more than half this list is active players, showing the power retired legends retain in the collectibles market. \u2026 Clark continued to be a force in the card market even as her second season in the WNBA has been hampered by injuries, showing that buyers still see long-term value with her.\nAdvertisement\nWhat about the biggest drops in July?\n1. Lamine Yamal: -$797k\n2. Jac Caglianone: -$728k\n3. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: -$666k\n4. Tyrese Haliburton: -$614k\n5. Jacob Wilson: -$305k\n6. Roman Anthony: -$283k\n7. Connor McDavid: -$249k\n8. Jalen Williams: -$208k\n9. Chase Burns: -$197k\n10. Drake Maye: -$128k\nTakeaways: While just 60 percent of the first list is active players, 100 percent of this list is active players, showing the more jarring fluctuations current athletes are subject to in the collectibles market. \u2026 This list also illustrates the cyclical and at often fickle nature of the sports card market. SGA, Haliburton, and Williams all saw drops after making big gains during the NBA Playoffs. The same goes for Yamal as European club soccer was in its offseason and McDavid with the NHL campaign ending. Buying increases during the season (raising prices) and drops in the offseason (lowering prices) \u2014 it\u2019s a common trend savvy buyers and sellers can take advantage of. \u2026 Then there\u2019s the churn of MLB prospecting that Caglianone, Wilson, Anthony, and Burns all fell victim to here. Prospectors like a hyped minor leaguer but once they reach the majors and they don\u2019t immediately play at a Hall of Fame level, it\u2019s on to the next guy. \u2026 Even though Yamal had the biggest drop, his sales were still significant. At $1.2 million, they were still higher than Lionel Messi\u2019s ($783k) and Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s ($305k) combined.\nA look at which NFL players buyers are gravitating toward ahead of the new season is also informative:\n1. Tom Brady: +$270k\n2. Patrick Mahomes: +$249k\n3. Joe Burrow: +$218k\n4. Lamar Jackson: +$135k\n5. Josh Allen: +$114k\n6. Michael Penix Jr.: +$90k\n7. Barry Sanders: +$88k\n8. Ja\u2019Marr Chase: +$76k\n9. Anthony Richardson: +$70k\n10. Jerry Rice: +$52k\n16. Jeremiah Smith: +$44k\nAdvertisement\n17. Arch Manning: +$42k\nFor full sales trends check out GemRate.\nTakeaways: Quarterbacks naturally dominate the list, but legends at other positions in Sanders and Rice show their staying power and perhaps the strength of nostalgia for their era right now in the collectibles world. Chase stands out as the only active non-QB. Buyers seem to be anticipating a big year from him and Burrow, who\u2019s ahead of Allen and Jackson on the list. \u2026 Maybe it\u2019s lack of faith in Daniel Jones, but the money going toward Anthony Richardson seems like a low-cost gamble on him finally fulfilling his rookie hype. Even at the reduced cost, whether it pays off or not is another question, though. \u2026 Smith and Manning are included here even though they\u2019re outside the top 10 to show the college players that speculators are consolidating around. \u2026 If you\u2019re wondering how McCarthy can be on the list of the five most searched athletes across all sports but not on this list, it\u2019s because his total sales have been consistently strong going back to the spring. A lot of football card buyers have high hopes for him this season and that started well before July.\neBay testing new features likely to impact card sales\nFollowing eBay\u2019s roll-out of extended bidding testing last month that is still ongoing, the company shared details of another new feature test that recently began: real-time auction updates via \u201cLive Activities\u201d on iOS. \u201cThe new feature will allow buyers to track the final 10 minutes of any auction via the iOS Live Activities feature,\u201d eBay said. In other words, the days of having to set a separate timer so you can remember to track the final minutes of an auction after getting the \u201c15 minutes left\u201d notification may soon be over. This feature would keep those final minutes of an auction front of mind by surfacing them on your iPhone\u2019s lock screen. Some further details on the test from eBay:\n- If a user has already bid on the item, they\u2019ll see Live Activities 10 minutes before the auction ends. If their first bid is within the final 10 minutes of an auction, they\u2019ll see Live Activities just after placing their first bid.\n- The test is for a limited pool of users who have iOS 17.2 or higher.\n- This rollout is to all auctions, not just collectibles, but is especially important for trading card and memorabilia buyers where bidding is often concentrated near the end of the auction.\n\u201cOur test of real-time updates via iOS Live Activities underscores our commitment to making auctions on eBay as seamless as possible,\u201d said Adam Ireland, VP and general manager, Global Collectibles at eBay. \u201cFrom casual bidders to serious collectors, this feature keeps buyers in the action right up to the final moments.\u201d\nThe last part of that quote is particularly interesting. Should the lock screen auction updates and extended bidding both be fully implemented at some point, they could contribute to higher auction prices realized and thus higher card values across the board by keeping more bidders engaged and keeping bidding going for longer. The Athletic will provide further details on these potential features when they\u2019re available.\nThe Athletic maintains full editorial independence in all our coverage.

      "text": "A New York Yankees jersey said to be worn by Babe Ruth in Game 3 of the 1932 World Series sold for $24.12 million at a Heritage Auction on early Sunday morning, smashing the record for the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia in history.\nThe road jersey was photo matched by multiple sources to Game 3 at Wrigley Field \u2014 when Ruth hit two home runs, including the famed, and debunked, \u201ccalled shot\u201d \u2014 though one leading photomatching company was not able to \u201cmatch\u201d the jersey after multiple attempts in recent years, sparking a conversation before the sale.\nAdvertisement\nThe previous record price for a game-worn piece of memorabilia was a Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls jersey from Game 1 of the 1998 NBA Finals, which sold for $10.1 million in 2022, while the most expensive price for any sports collectible sold at auction was $12.6 million for a Topps 1952 Mickey Mantle card that sold the same year.\nThis specific Ruth jersey was last sold at auction in 2005 when it went for $940,000. It was originally discovered around 1990 when a well-known collector purchased it from a woman in Florida. According to the official story, the woman\u2019s father had received the jersey from Ruth after a round of golf. The collector sold the jersey to another private collector for $150,000.\nIn 1999, the jersey was consigned back to Grey Flannel Auctions and advertised for auction as a 1930 Ruth road uniform. It sold for $284,000 and was eventually loaned to the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum in Baltimore. When the jersey returned to Grey Flannel in 2005, the company elected to do additional research, which is how it first became advertised as the uniform Ruth was wearing on Oct. 1, 1932, the day of the \u201ccalled shot.\u201d\nThe attribution to Game 3 was heavily debated at the time, but the recent rise of photomatching as a method of verification gave more credence to its connection to the \u201ccalled shot\u201d game. Chris Ivy, the director of sports at Heritage, called the jersey \u201cthe most significant piece of American sports memorabilia ever offered at auction.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nBabe Ruth's 'called shot' jersey could break auction records. Experts are mixed on its attribution\n\u201cBaseball is king,\u201d Ivy told The Athletic in the lead-up to the auction. \u201cI\u2019d say baseball represents probably 65 to 70 percent of the total sports collectibles market, and I would say the Yankees represent probably half of that.\u201d\nAccording to Heritage, the auction concluded late Saturday night in a bidding war that continued into early Sunday morning.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt has been an honor and a privilege to work with this incredible piece of American history, and I am proud that it will now be part of one of the finest private collections in the world,\u201d Ivy said in a statement after the sale. \u201cIt is clear by the strong auction participation and record price achieved that astute collectors have no doubt as to what this Ruth jersey is and what it represents.

      "text": "The impact that Kobe Bryant had on the NBA and a whole generation of sports card collectors during his career with the Los Angeles Lakers places him on the Mount Rushmore of modern basketball card legends. Trading cards of the 2007 MVP have been graded over half a million times by PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) to date, which ranks third among basketball players for most graded cards of all-time. He was also consistently among the 10 most searched athletes across all sports on eBay throughout 2024. The demand and prices of Bryant collectibles forever changed following his death in 2020, adding another layer of sentiment to his cards, autographs, and memorabilia.\nAdvertisement\nSo what are the best choices for fans looking to build a collection of Bryant\u2019s trading cards? Here are our picks.\nTop pick (full recommendations below)\n1996 Fleer Metal #181 rookie card\nBryant\u2019s 1996 Fleer Metal #181 rookie card is my best value recommendation based on its high demand and relative scarcity in gem mint copies. It\u2019s arguably one of his most difficult rookie cards to receive a Gem Mint 10 grade from PSA because its metallic foil-stamped design is highly susceptible to chipping and surface damage (only 837 examples have been deemed a PSA 10 out of 14,814 graded to date). The brand recognition of \u201990s Metal cards and the relatively reasonable cost of PSA 10 graded Bryant Metal rookie cards (currently about $500-$600) makes them attractive and more obtainable to many collectors.\nThings to know before buying\nThe value of sports cards can fluctuate for various reasons such as condition, print runs, or graded population. Other factors that can cause prices to go up or down include player performance, market trends, and health of the wider economy. The secondary sales market for individual cards of a given sport generally hits its lowest point during the offseason (in other words, you can usually find better prices in the offseason than during the season). My recommendations are not an attempt to promote specific investment behavior or trading advice, but to guide and inform readers about popular and unique cards that are celebrated by the sports card community.\nUltimately, the best cards to collect are always the ones you will personally enjoy most, regardless of whether they go up or down in value. The recommendations below should serve as a starting point for cards to consider, but a big part of the fun in collecting is the hunt for the cards you like.\n\u201cRaw\u201d cards vs. Graded cards\nCards can come out of the pack (their \u201craw\u201d state) with a wide variety of imperfections that can impact their value. Card grading is a process in which an expert of the field determines the condition of a card based on a number of factors (including corner sharpness, image centering, print imperfections, and more) and assigns a numerical grade, usually on a scale of 1-10 (with the latter being close to perfect) and sealed in a protective case. There are a number of grading companies, each with their own unique grading scales, but PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) is by far the largest and most prominent in the industry. Cards graded a \u201cPSA 10\u201d can carry a significant value multiplier compared to raw cards or those graded by other companies.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s fine (and often cheaper) to buy cards raw, but if you want to ensure authenticity and/or a minimum condition level, and you\u2019re not experienced at determining card condition for yourself, you may want to buy a graded card instead \u2014 particularly if you\u2019re buying online and only able to see the card in photographs.\nBest low-end (~$1-$99) Kobe Bryant cards\nThis is a category for collectors who are on a tighter budget or aren\u2019t as concerned about the long-term monetary value of the cards they buy.\n1996 Upper Deck Collector\u2019s Choice #267 rookie card\nBryant\u2019s 1996 Collector\u2019s Choice rookie card is one of his more affordable rookie cards in gem mint grades. Raw copies can be purchased for around $15 and PSA 10 graded versions for under $300.\nCollector\u2019s Choice sets were one of Upper Deck\u2019s low-end basketball releases in the 1990s targeted to kids and new collectors. The 1996 set was released in two series, but fans won\u2019t find Bryant\u2019s #267 rookie card in Series 1 \u2014 it can only be pulled out of Series 2 packs. However, Upper Deck produced factory-sealed complete sets and team packs featuring the same card. It\u2019s worth noting that Bryant\u2019s rookie card included in the Lakers team pack has a different card number (LA2) on the back than ones placed in packs and complete sets.\nIt\u2019s an inexpensive, yet recognizable rookie card. It also features an image of Bryant with the cast he wore at the very beginning of his NBA career after fracturing his wrist just before his rookie season began. That cast later sold at auction for $722.98.\n1996 Fleer Ultra #52 rookie card\nAnother entry-level Bryant base rookie card that\u2019s modestly priced in raw and high grades is from 1996 Fleer Ultra Series 2. The card features captivating photography and shows Bryant gliding to the basket. It also includes a \u201crookie\u201d designation stamp under the Fleer Ultra logo on the top left of the front of the card.\nAdvertisement\nThe basketball card hobby exploded in popularity in the 1990s, prompting a surplus of new releases made by Fleer, Topps, Upper Deck, and more. Fleer continued its success in producing basketball cards from the 1980s by creating innovative sets with fresh designs and unique themes. Ultra\u2019s introduction of the rare gold and platinum medallion parallels added a thrilling chase element to the set that are still highly coveted by collectors.\nEven though his base rookie card currently sells for around $20 in raw condition, PSA 10 graded versions sell for a huge premium because it is challenging to find them in gem mint condition. Out of the 10,000 or so Bryant Ultra base rookie cards graded by the company, only three percent have received a PSA 10 grade. Its scarcity in the highest grade has resulted in PSA 10 sales eclipsing $1,000, but you can find 9s (still a \u201cmint\u201d designation) in the $100 ballpark.\n1996 also happens to be the 10th anniversary of Fleer\u2019s iconic 1986 release and is celebrated by Ultra\u2019s checklist including a cool \u201cDecade of Excellence\u201d reprint insert of Michael Jordan\u2019s Fleer rookie card.\nAdditional variations and parallels: Gold Medallion (inserted 1:12 Series 1 packs on average) Platinum Medallion (inserted 1:180 Series 1 packs on average)\nBest value (~$100-$499) Kobe Bryant cards\nThis is a category for collectors looking to pay a bit more for cards that have some degree of scarcity and have a better chance at retaining or increasing in value long-term.\nThe five-time NBA champion\u2019s 1996 Topps #136 card is undeniably his most popular rookie card, and PSA has graded it more times than any other Bryant card.\nTopps basketball paper cards (as opposed to the Topps Chrome versions, which we\u2019ll touch on later) were not particularly known for high sales prices on the secondary market during this era, but its ultra-high demand today makes it one of his most transacted cards. PSA 9 copies are selling for around $150 while SGC and BGS 9.5\u2019s (mint+ and gem mint, respectively) are in the $300 range.\nAdditional variations and parallels: NBA 50th Silver Foil (inserted 1:3 packs on average)\n1996 Fleer Metal #181 rookie card\nThe 1996 Fleer Metal checklist includes a few first-year cards of the Lakers\u2019 all-time leading scorer, but I think his #181 card stands out because of its high transaction volume and rising demand for gem mint graded copies.\nDespite it being his second-most graded base rookie card by PSA, less than 900 examples have received a 10 grade. Fleer Metal cards submitted to PSA for grading have a low gem rate because the foil-etched design is easily susceptible to scratching and chip marks along the edges.\nAdvertisement\nBased on the relatively low number of Gem Mint 10 graded cards compared to his other base rookies, the ~$500 price tag is a reasonable cost to own a Bryant PSA 10 rookie card from a well-known brand such as Metal.\nIt may not be the first rookie card of the Los Angeles superstar that comes to mind, but the growing popularity of \u201990s Metal cards in recent years has increased demand and value.\nAdditional variations and parallels: Precious Metal (inserted 1:36 packs on average)\n1996 Skybox X \u2014 X2000 #30 rookie card\nSkybox\u2019s E \u2014 X cards are some of the most revered of the \u201990s and Bryant\u2019s #30 base card in the 1996 set is an example of their unique beauty. Ungraded, this card sells for around $150, but the most recent sale of a PSA 10 example of the card (with a population of just 24) sold for more than $24,000 in October 2024. Bryant\u2019s Star Date 2000 insert from this set, with its outer-space design, is another coveted and unique card that has been selling ungraded for between $350-$500 recently.\nAdditional parallels: Credentials /499\nBest high-end (~$500+) Kobe Bryant cards\nThis is a category for collectors looking to acquire the most desired Bryant cards on the market.\n1996 Topps Chrome #138 rookie card\nTopps Chrome basketball sets during the 1990s and 2000s produced some of the hottest rookie cards in the hobby because of their polished look and high status amongst collectors.\nIts debut in 1996 introduced a premium version of Topps flagship sets that included a new chase card coined \u201cthe Refractor.\u201d A Refractor parallel has a reflective rainbow-like effect when held into the light and is a limited card that runs parallel to the base set. Besides the amount printed, the difference between refractors and base cards can be in the color, design, image, or pattern. Nowadays, The sports card hobby is accustomed to newly released sets having quite a few versions of the refractor parallel, but 1996 Topps Chrome basketball only offered one standard refractor parallel.\nAdvertisement\nLooking back, the timing of Topps Chrome Basketball\u2019s first release in 1996 and the dominant rookie class featured in the set were perfectly aligned. Collectors had the chance to pull rookie cards of not only Bryant, but also future Hall of Famers Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, and Ray Allen. Bryant driving through the lane on his way to the basket isn\u2019t the most liked action shot on his first-year cards, but it has a distinctive look and is the same image used for his Topps flagship rookie card.\nAccording to PSA, there are less than 7,000 examples of Bryant\u2019s Topps Chrome rookie card graded by the company and less than 900 have received a PSA 10 grade. (For comparison, there are around 46,000 PSA graded examples of his 1996 Topps and about 5,000 PSA 10s.)\nOne of the notable condition-related concerns with Bryant\u2019s Topps Chrome rookie card is \u201cgreening\u201d or \u201chulking.\u201d This refers to the image on the card turning green over time caused by complications with the chemicals initially used in the printing process. Topps resolved the greening problem for future chromium card releases in 1998, but it\u2019s proven to have affected many of the Chrome sets from the mid-\u201990s. This issue has certainly impacted the number of PSA 10 Bryant Topps Chrome base rookie cards in existence and its value in high grades.\nThe innovative chromium-style basketball cards were and are still considered a top choice for hardcore hoops fans who collect rookie cards of players from the 1990s and 2000s. In my opinion, it\u2019s the crown jewel of Bryant\u2019s base rookie cards. PSA 9 examples of his high-end base rookie card are selling on eBay for close to $1,300 and PSA 10\u2019s are fetching between $5,000-$7,000.\nAdditional variations and parallels: Refractor (inserted 1:12 packs on average)\nThere are certain cards that have an artistic appeal to them that captures the attention of collectors, and Bryant\u2019s 1996 Topps Finest Heirs #269 is one of them. For starters, the photography used for the front of the card is museum-esque and elegantly portrays the 18-time All-Star flying backwards toward the hoop. The \u201cHeirs\u201d banner above his head gives off a regal vibe and presents Bryant as ascending basketball royalty. But my favorite aspect of this card is how its gold borders stylishly corresponds with Bryant\u2019s yellow Lakers uniform.\nAdvertisement\nTopps Finest sets during this time provided a protective coating on the surface of each card that can be removed. PSA has graded these for some time and will even label the card \u201cw/Coating\u201d if the protective film is still on the card. As a result, the price and PSA population of Bryant\u2019s Heirs rookie insert varies based on whether the coating was removed from the card or kept on when submitted for grading. Depending on other factors that determine a card\u2019s condition, Bryant Heirs inserts with the coating still on them are worth slightly more.\nThis beauty is at the top of my list of Bryant rookie cards with the best eye appeal.\nAdditional variations and parallels: Refractor (inserted 1:12 packs on average)\nUpper Deck SPx Winning Materials autographed cards\nAny Bryant fan would want to have one of his autographed cards in their collection, but since his death they have risen exponentially in value. Upper Deck\u2019s SPx Winning Materials inserts, which feature Bryant\u2019s autograph on the card (as opposed to on a sticker affixed to the card, which are less desirable among collectors) and pieces of his game-worn uniform or warm-ups are some of the nicest examples of Bryant autographed cards available. However, his autographed cards later produced by Panini in high-end sets like National Treasures and Flawless are top options, as well.\nOther cool Kobe Bryant Cards\nUpon its release 16 years ago, I doubt collectors expected to see sales of this common base card reach as high as $100 in 2025, but there\u2019s no denying how unique the photo on Bryant\u2019s 2008 Topps card is. The image captures a special moment of Bryant backing down LeBron James in a heated matchup between the Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers.\nTopps wisely used the same photo in the 2008 Topps Chrome set and offers a few refractors if you are a fan of Chrome and looking for a more limited version of this card.\nAdvertisement\nWhat\u2019s compelling about cards like this is that they weren\u2019t necessarily desired or valuable upon release, but significance has evolved over time.\nAdditional variations and parallels: Gold Foil, Gold (/2008), Orange (/1199) Black (/51), Platinum (1/1), Printing Plates (1/1)\nContinuing with the theme of two NBA icons on one card, Topps produced a unique East-West insert card featuring Jordan on the front and Bryant on the back. 1998 was a monumental season for both Hall of Famers \u2014 Bryant was selected to his first NBA All-Star game and Jordan won his fifth MVP award. The design gives off cosmic energy with the Earth taking up most of the background and is accompanied by each player\u2019s action shot as the center of attention.\nThe 1998 Topps Series 2 East-West subset included a 20-card checklist and was inserted in 1:36 packs on average. So the odds of pulling even one of them, let alone the Jordan/Bryant card weren\u2019t great. The set also offers an extremely limited refractor parallel card with numerous sales in the four figures.\nAdditional variations and parallels: Refractor (inserted 1:144 Series 2 packs on average)\nGetting the best price\nPrices for a certain trading card can vary wildly and fluctuate quickly, making it important to check recent sales of a given card to make sure you\u2019re buying at a fair value. You can check recent sales of an item on eBay by selecting the \u201csold items\u201d filter on search results. You can also run a search on 130point.com, which is a free site that provides sales data from a number of top online marketplaces. There are also several apps that provide more in-depth sales data, often charging subscription fees for full access.\nTo account for outliers and scams, it\u2019s important to consider multiple previous sales, not just the single most recent. It\u2019s also important to note the recency of those sales and any real-world factors that could affect changes in value.\nAdvertisement\nWhy you should trust us\nAs a second-generation collector, Tyler Holzhammer started collecting cards and attending the National Sports Collectors Convention at 10 years old. He\u2019s evolved his passion as a collector into a career, previously providing sports card content and market analysis for companies like Sports Card Investor and Goldin Auctions.
