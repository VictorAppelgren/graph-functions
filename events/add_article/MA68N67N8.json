      "summary": "US weekly initial unemployment claims decreased by 3,000 to 224,000, indicating a stronger labor market than expected. Following a stronger-than-anticipated PPI report, market expectations for a Fed rate cut shifted, with a 93% chance now assigned to a 25 basis point cut in September. Fed officials expressed skepticism about a larger cut, emphasizing the current strength of the labor market, while ongoing tariff discussions and upcoming economic reports are also influencing market sentiment.",
