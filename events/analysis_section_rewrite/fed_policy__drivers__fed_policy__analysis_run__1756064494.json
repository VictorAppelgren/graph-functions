      "feedback": "The draft does a solid job tying macro, policy, and flows to a Regime A/B/C framing and uses concrete proxies (Ford, ACMR, oil) but it weakens the world-class standard with gaps in regime clarity, causal logic, and quantification; non-core sources (Urban Crime, Marijuana scheduling, Intel/National policy talks) appear without a clear risk channel or measurable impact, which dilutes focus. Actionable edits: (1) formally define Regimes A–C with explicit, box-tested triggers, horizons, and probability anchors tied to the cited sources (e.g., NL5YYTLF2, T1QE6JPIX, SGB2PAZGK); state what constitutes a regime shift (e.g., tariff baseline widening to 15–25% or a durable protectionist stance) and the path for reversion risks; (2) articulate a clean causal chain: macro regime → policy/tariff trajectory → pricing power, input costs, and capex allocation (US fabs/AI infra) → valuation/multiples, with a one-paragraph map and a 1–2 sentence sensitivity note per link; (3) prune or tightly integrate non-core items (Urban Crime, Marijuana scheduling, Intel stake talks) by attaching them to a concrete market channel (policy uncertainty, supply chain stress, or industrial policy risk) or remove them if they remain anecdotal; (4) tighten numerical anchoring and source-consistency: fix inconsistent or incomplete numbers (e.g., “ACMR 2025 revenue midpoint ≈ $900m; gross margin ≈ 4%” should be verified against NL5YYTLF2 or 22PL3Q360 and cited precisely); ensure all tariff numbers are coherent (the draft cites a ~10% baseline vs. a 15% EU envelope—choose one framework per regime and clearly label negotiation risk); (5) expand the transmission analysis with explicit oil and yield channels: state ranges from J99EM2TPZ and T1QE6JPIX and show how Brent/WTI and the 10Y yield feed into inflation expectations and the policy stance (avoid vague phrasing); (6) deliver a sharp watch-list of 4–6 decisive signals with thresholds sourced from the material (e.g., duration of the 90-day US–China pause, progress on the EU 15% tariff envelope, Ford Q2 capex/AI announcements, oil-price breakpoints) and assign likely regime-implications and probabilities; (7) ensure the narrative adheres to the horizon (0–12 months) and format: convert to a compact 1–2 paragraph synthesis plus a 4–5 item watch-list, with every assertion traced to one of the IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL and no new facts; (8) check for internal consistency and reconcile any conflicts between sources (e.g., tariff baselines vs. protectionism risk) and clearly signal uncertainties. These edits will produce a tightly reasoned, first-principles-backed, quantitatively anchored cross-topic view with a precise, action-ready watch-list.",
