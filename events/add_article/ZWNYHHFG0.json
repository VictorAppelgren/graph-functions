      "summary": "The article covers the legal battle over President Trump's attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, focusing on the upcoming temporary restraining order hearing and its potential impact on Fed credibility and market stability. Lawyers argue that Cook’s removal could cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy, while the Fed and Trump contend that the president has the right to fire her without cause. The court’s decision will be closely watched ahead of the Fed’s September 17 policy meeting, as markets remain largely unchanged but could shift if the ruling undermines confidence in the central bank.",
