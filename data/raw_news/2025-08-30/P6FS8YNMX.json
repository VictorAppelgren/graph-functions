  "description": "Melbourne Symphony Orchestra had to restart its recital on Friday after a lengthy disturbance.",
  "content": "A performance by Melbourne's Symphony Orchestra (MSO) at the BBC Proms in London has been interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters. Friday night's recital had just begun when the orchestra was forced to stop playing for more than 10 minutes due to the demonstration. It later restarted its performance. Jewish Artists for Palestine, which describes itself as a group of \"anti-Zionist Jewish writers, visual and performance artists\" has claimed responsibility. It said in a statement that the interruption was in rejection to \"Zionist funding, censorship and complicity in our cultural institutions\" over the Gaza war, including the MSO and the BBC. Both organisations have been approached for comment.\n\nIn a video posted online by a pro-Palestinian group linked to the protesters, people can be seen standing in the upper gallery of the Royal Albert Hall holding black handwritten fabric signs reading \"complicit in genocide\" and \"Jewish Artists for Palestine\". \"The MSO has blood on its hands,\" a woman can be heard to shout. The interruption was captured on BBC Radio 3, which was broadcasting the performance. Announcer Ian Skelly could be heard narrating what was happening during the interruption, including that security was bought in to remove the protesters. BBC Radio 3 then broke out of the broadcast for several minutes to play recorded pieces of classical music, during which time Sam Jackson, controller of BBC Radio 3 and BBC Proms, came on stage to make a statement. Angela Tanner, who was in the stalls, told the BBC that it took quite a while for the protesters to be removed. \"The whole programme had to start again and has been put into a different order after the piano was put onto the stage and taken off again,\" she said. \"There was lots of booing from the audience then eventually they [the organisers] announced thanks for our patience.\" Jewish Artists for Palestine said in a statement that it had targeted the MSO's concert after they cancelled a performance by acclaimed pianist Jayson Gillham last year. Gillham's performance in Sydney was cancelled due to comments he made in support of Gazans. The MSO has since said the cancellation had been a mistake. Shouts of \"you silenced Jayson Gillham\" and the \"MSO is complicit in genocide\" was also heard, followed by booing from the audience. Jewish Artists for Palestine also cited the MSO's funding and previous performances that Friday night's principal artist, Khatia Buniatishvili, had given with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nAnother audience member, who did not wish to be named, said two of the protest groups were promptly taken out of the building by security but it took more time to eject the third. She said there was a second round of shouting after the performance resumed but that this was quickly stopped. \"Overall, the atmosphere seemed to be strongly against the protest, with many members of the audience annoyed and shouting obscenities with anger at the protesters.\" It is not the first time that a BBC Proms performance has been interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters. The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra had to stop its 2011 recital twice due to a disturbance by demonstrators. In 2023, two protesters from environmental campaign group Just Stop Oil interrupted the First Night of the Proms after targeting a number of other events. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 63,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been repeatedly displaced; more than 90% of homes are estimated to be damaged or destroyed; and the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed; and UN-backed global food security experts have confirmed that there is famine in the Gaza City area.",

Many other audience members booed in response.\nBBC Radio 3 said it had to interrupt its live broadcast twice \"as a result of sustained audience disturbance\".\nThe Palestine Solidarity Campaign had earlier called on people to boycott the concert and urged the BBC to cancel it.\nIn a statement published on its website, external ahead of the Proms, the pro-Palestinian group claimed the IPO showed \"complicity in whitewashing Israel's persistent violations of international law and human rights\".\nThe BBC Proms Team tweeted, external: \"We're sorry that the concert was taken off air following hall disturbance. Glad both pieces were heard by the audience in the RAH.\"\nIt later added: \"We regret that as a result of sustained audience disturbance tonight's concert was taken off BBC Radio 3.\"\nThe performance, which consisted of four parts, was interrupted at about 19:45 BST and coverage was cut off again an hour later after more protests.\nA spokeswoman for BBC Proms said it appeared each piece had been targeted by different protesters seated around the hall.\nShe said the broadcaster was \"disappointed\" the coverage had been taken off air but said the performance had continued in the hall.\nAbout 30 people were removed by security but there were no arrests and no violence, she said.\nThe BBC's Tom Symonds said: \"As Zubin Mehta stood up and began each piece a small group of protesters each time tried to stop the music.\n\"They sang, they shouted, they were met by boos by the audience and they had to be removed by the security staff.\"\nOutside the concert hall a group of about 20 campaigners waved banners and sang songs in protest against the appearance of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (IPO).\nSeveral pro-Israeli groups met them with their own protest outside, our correspondent said.\nHe said it had been a \"pretty disruptive\" but the orchestra was said to have \"taken it all in their stride and had smiles on their faces\".\nOde to Joy\nRegular Proms-goer Chris Keating said there were six or seven disturbances during the performance.\n\"The first was in a quiet passage of the first piece,\" he said.\n\"About a dozen protesters in the choir seats stood up with a banner saying Free Palestine and started chanting and singing to the tune of Beethoven's Ode to Joy.\n\"They were drowned out by the orchestra as the passage of music got louder and were ushered out.\"\n'Riot atmosphere'\nTheartsdesk.com music reviewer Igor Toronyi-Lalic, who was at the show, said: \"The whole hall was groaning and trying to slow clap them out.\n\"It had the atmosphere of a riot.\"\nThere had been increased security measures for the concert, including bag searches and a heightened police presence.\nPolice confirmed there had been no arrests but there were heated exchanges between not only supporters of both political sides but also concert-goers angry at the disruption to their evening.\nAnti-Israel protesters have targeted classical music performances before.\nIn August 2008, five members of the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign disrupted a concert by the Jerusalem String Quartet at Edinburgh's Queen's Hall.\nThe BBC said it would broadcast part of the concert on 7 September at 14:30 BST.\n- Published15 July 2011"

High profile barrister Greg Barns said the cancellation was \u201ctruly appalling,\u201d later adding that \u201cart is often powerful because it\u2019s political\u201d.\nArts critic and former Sydney Symphony Orchestra chairman Leo Schofield said of the MSO\u2019s apology, \u201cNot before time. How I wish Gillham was giving a concert in Sydney. He would get a standing ovation here from supporters who admire his courage almost as much as they admire his talent.\u201d\nThe Israel-Gaza war has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage.\nAs has been the case in countless other countries, there have been protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as sharp upticks in Islamophobia and anti-semitism."
