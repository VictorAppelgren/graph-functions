  "title": "Analysis: The Florida GOP ending vaccine mandates is playing with fire",
  "description": "The Republican Party\u2019s recent crusade against Covid-19 vaccine mandates has, rather predictably, begun to ensnare other vaccines.",
  "content": "The Republican Party\u2019s recent crusade against Covid-19 vaccine mandates has, rather predictably, begun to ensnare other vaccines.\n\nEven as US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has ramped up a hostile takeover of federal vaccine policy, Florida on Wednesday took an unprecedented step: It became the first state to move to eliminate all vaccine requirements.\n\nIn making the announcement, Florida\u2019s vaccine-skeptic Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo likened each of those mandates to \u201cslavery.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a huge moment, especially given Florida\u2019s size and the possibility that other red states will follow suit. After the state\u2019s announcement, top Trump health official Mehmet Oz endorsed its approach, saying on Fox News, \u201cI would definitely not have mandates for vaccinations.\u201d\n\nBut that would seem to be far out-of-step with the American public.\n\nSome Republicans are warning their party about going too extreme. Two Republican doctors who served in Congress until earlier this year wrote in STAT News before the Florida announcement that the party\u2019s vaccine moves are not just \u201cbad policy\u201d but \u201cbecoming a political liability for all Republicans.\u201d\n\nThey appear to have a point.\n\nFlorida\u2019s move means schoolchildren would no longer be required to get previously required vaccinations for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), polio, tetanus, chickenpox and hepatitis B. (The Covid-19 vaccine is not mandated for schoolchildren by any state.)\n\nWhile the decision is being billed as a win for freedom, the effectiveness of such vaccines relies upon widespread adoption in order to build herd immunity. We\u2019ve already seen just this year how depressed MMR vaccination rates can lead to measles outbreaks, like the one in West Texas.\n\nIt remains to be seen how Florida\u2019s move will affect its vaccination rates and whether it will lead to outbreaks. But polls suggest many Republicans especially would forgo vaccinations for their children if they could.\n\nAnd that could mark a major shift in the health of Americans. Even as Republicans targeted Covid-19 mandates earlier this decade, they often cast their efforts as being limited to that vaccine. When they occasionally suggested reviewing mandates for other vaccines, they often backed off. Now those appear to be in jeopardy, too.\n\nBut Florida\u2019s move \u2013 along with Kennedy\u2019s vaccine moves \u2013 are also rather politically risky.\n\nWhile Republicans have been quite skeptical of the Covid-19 vaccines and increasingly skeptical of other vaccines, too, recent polls show huge support for non-Covid vaccine mandates for schoolchildren:\n\nBelief in vaccine effectiveness also far outpaces vaccine skepticism, according to a 2023 Pew Research Center poll. While more than 7 in 10 Americans had at least \u201chigh\u201d confidence in the preventive health benefits of vaccines, a little more than 1 in 10 rated the risk of side effects that high.\n\nNot all polls show such lopsided margins. A 2024 Gallup poll, for instance, showed a new low in the percentage of Americans who said all children should be required to get vaccinated against diseases like measles. It pegged that number at 51%, which was down from 62% in 2019 and 81% in 1991). The question didn\u2019t invoke school attendance, though.\n\nAs that trendline shows, vaccine skepticism is clearly on the rise, especially on the right. But that\u2019s not the same as saying people want all vaccine mandates to go away. That doesn\u2019t seem to be what most Americans or even necessarily most Republicans or MAGA supporters want right now. Yet Florida is pressing ahead.\n\nThe devil is also in the details as far as what happens next.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know what will happen with Florida\u2019s vaccination rates, there are plenty of indicators this could significantly depress them. (Florida already has a relatively high vaccine exemption rate of 5%.)\n\nA US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study last year found 11% of parents disagreed with the statement that they would have vaccinated their children regardless of requirements. Another 16% were neutral on the question. That raises the prospect of vaccination rates in places that don\u2019t require them falling well below the 95% that health officials aim for to achieve herd immunity.\n\nAmid the measles outbreak in Texas earlier this year, as many as 1 in 5 children were unvaccinated in some of the hardest-hit areas, after having received exemptions.\n\nIf Florida faces outbreaks in the years to come, it won\u2019t be difficult to trace it to this policy shift.\n\nAnd vaccines have already been a political liability for Republicans as an issue. A recent Wall Street Journal poll showed Americans preferred congressional Republicans to congressional Democrats on nearly every issue tested. The only exceptions? Health care (40-26% for Democrats) and vaccine policy (40-31% Democrats).\n\nThese new moves appear likely to exacerbate that problem \u2013 and raise its salience in voters\u2019 minds.",

      "text": "At a glance\nSummary\nVaccination requirements to attend school and daycare are an important strategy for maintaining high vaccination coverage among children. However, parent-requested exemptions from vaccines required for school and daycare entry have increased and coverage with required vaccines has decreased since the COVID-19 pandemicA, possibly due to an increase in vaccine hesitancy. Though some children with an exemption eventually receive the required vaccines, many do not. Assessing reasons for obtaining an exemption can help eliminate barriers to vaccination and develop strategies to encourage parents to get their children vaccinated.\nCDC surveyed parents in June\u2013July 2024 to assess attitudes toward and experiences with vaccination requirements and exemptions and knowledge about the vaccines required or recommended for their children. The most common reason reported for seeking an exemption was philosophical or personal belief objection to vaccination (37.5%). Difficulty meeting school requirements by the deadline was reported as a reason for exemption by 22.6% of parents. Though most (76.6%) parents supported vaccination requirements for school and daycare attendance, 8.3% of all parents/guardians disagreed that vaccination requirements are important and necessary, 33.4% agreed that unvaccinated children should be allowed to attend school or daycare, and 21.2% disagreed that unvaccinated children should have to stay home during a disease outbreak.\nReasons for exemption\nThe most common parental reason for obtaining or planning to obtain an exemption for their child was philosophical or personal belief objection to vaccination.\nAmong surveyed parents of children aged 6 months\u201317 years in the United States whose child attended school or daycare in 2023\u201324 or will attend in 2024\u201325 (N=1,835), 3.8% have obtained an exemption from vaccinations required for attendance in the past and 3.7% plan to obtain one. Of these parents, 37.5% reported philosophical or personal belief objections as a reason. Over a quarter (27.2%) reported medical reasons, which is much higher than the 0.2% rate of medical exemptions reported to CDC by state health departmentsB; some parents might consider concerns about vaccine safety or side effects as a 'medical' reason to request an exemption, rather than their child having a true contraindication to vaccination. 22.6% reported difficulty meeting school requirements by the deadline as a reason for exemption.\nParental attitudes toward vaccination requirements\nThe majority (76.6%) of parents/guardians somewhat or strongly agreed that school and daycare vaccination requirements are important and necessary. However, 8.3% somewhat or strongly disagreed.\nParents were less likely to agree that vaccination requirements are important and necessary if:\n- their child has attended or will attend a private, charter, or home school (compared to public school)\n- they lived in a state with an exemption rate >5%B\n- they have requested an exemption, plan to request one, or for whom requirements and exemptions are not applicable due to being homeschooled\n- they had a White non-Hispanic child (compared to all other races and ethnicities)\n- they lived in a rural area (compared to suburban)\n- their child was uninsured (compared to insured) (Table)\nWhile 33.4% of parents agreed that unvaccinated children should be allowed to attend school and daycare, a majority (54.6%) agreed that these children should be required to stay home during an outbreak.\nParents were more likely to somewhat or strongly disagree that unvaccinated children should be allowed to attend school and daycare if:\n- their child was aged 0-4 (compared to aged 5\u201317)\n- their child had private insurance (compared to Medicaid or other insurance)\n- their child has attended or will attend a public school (compared to private, charter, or home school)\n- they have not requested and do not plan to request an exemption (Table)\nParents were more likely to agree unvaccinated children should be required to stay home during an outbreak if:\n- their child was aged 0-4 (compared to aged 5\u201317)\n- their child had private insurance or Medicaid (compared to other insurance)\n- their child has attended or will attend a public school (compared to private, charter, or home school)\n- they have not requested and do not plan to request an exemption (Table)\nOne in three parents who requested an exemption, plan to request one, or for whom requirements and exemptions are not applicable due to being homeschooled, agreed that unvaccinated children should be required to stay home during an outbreak.\nMethods\nData for this analysis were collected through an online survey using the Ipsos KnowledgePanelC. Respondents consisted of non-institutionalized parents/guardians aged \u226518 years living with at least one child aged 6 months\u201317 years for whom they make healthcare decisions. If the respondent had more than one eligible child, one child was randomly selected to be the subject of the survey. The survey was fielded June 26\u2013July 23, 2024. A random sample was drawn using an address-based sampling methodology, and the analytic dataset included 2,034 individuals who completed the survey and met eligibility criteria. Responses were weighted to the distribution of the U.S. population of adults \u226518 caring for children 0\u201317 years by age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, household income, and U.S. Census Bureau region.\nParents of children who attended school or daycare during the 2023\u201324 school year, or plan to attend for the 2024\u201325 school year, were asked if they have gotten an exemption from school vaccination requirements for their child, or if they plan to get one. A \"not applicable\" option was shown only to parents of homeschooled children who might not have been subject to vaccination requirements. Parents who got an exemption or plan to get one for their child were then asked about reasons for exemption.\nAll surveyed parents were asked to rate their level of agreement with statements about school and daycare requirements for routine childhood vaccines (other than flu and COVID-19) on a 5-point scale (strongly agree, somewhat agree, neutral, somewhat disagree, strongly disagree). Respondents who did not select a response for all five statements were excluded from analysis.\nThroughout this report, differences among groups were assessed using t-tests with p-values <0.05 considered statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by the CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy (45 C.F.R. part 46.102(l)(2), 21 C.F.R. part 56; 42 U.S.C. Sect. 241(d); 5 U.S.C.

On Wednesday, the state health department shared in a health alert that the number of confirmed cases had grown to six.\nAs of Friday afternoon, the outbreak has jumped to 14 confirmed cases and six probable cases among people who are symptomatic and had close contact with infected individuals, Zach Holbrooks, executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, told CNN.\nInvestigations are ongoing, as cases have been identified in parts of the region that are outside the Gaines County lines where the first cases were reported.\nAll the cases are believed to be among people who are not vaccinated against measles, Holbrooks said, and most of them are in children.\nA record share of US kindergartners had an exemption for required vaccinations last school year, leaving more than 125,000 new schoolchildren without coverage for at least one state-mandated vaccine, according to data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in October.\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services has set a goal that at least 95% of children in kindergarten will have gotten two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, a threshold necessary to help prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious disease. The US has now fallen short of that threshold for four years in a row.\nMMR coverage is particularly low in Gaines County, where nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year did not get the vaccine. The 18% vaccine exemption rate for the county is one of the highest in the state, according to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services.\nAt the state level, vaccine exemptions were highest in Idaho, where more than 14% of incoming kindergartners did not have their required shots, according to CDC data from last school year.

Children and adults who have not been vaccinated should get one dose immediately, followed by a second dose after 28 days. Infants between 6 and 11 months should get an early dose of the vaccine, and children who have had their first shot should get their second as soon as possible.\nThe South Plains Public Health District started a measles clinic Thursday, Holbrooks said, where daily testing and vaccination will be available starting next week."

      "text": "Democrats are grappling with their lowest approval ratings in 35 years. Voters prefer Republicans on nearly every policy issue, according to new polling by the Wall Street Journal.\nIn fact, voters trust Democrats more than Republicans on only two issues: health care and vaccine policy.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why voters are dissatisfied on vaccines, even as the Trump administration racks up win after win on everything from the border to the economy. The Department of Health and Human Services has made a series of decisions that appear to undermine President Trump\u2019s goal of making America healthy again. As the polling shows, these aren\u2019t merely bad policy \u2014 they\u2019re becoming a political liability for all Republicans.\nTake, for example, the administration\u2019s recent efforts to change longstanding, evidence-based vaccination guidelines. HHS fired every member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the expert panel responsible for making national vaccine recommendations, and replaced them largely with ideological allies.\nThe administration has also advanced policies that threaten vaccine development. HHS has proposed a requirement that all new vaccines be tested against saline injections, even though testing new vaccines against existing ones is much safer for trial participants.\nMore recently, HHS has stated its intent to overhaul the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. This decades-old federal fund was established on a bipartisan basis to provide payments to patients in the rare instances when vaccines cause harm. Although not opposed to reforms, we urge extreme caution to avoid further erosion of policies that support access to vaccines, monitor their safety, and encourage the development of new immunizations.\nHHS has promoted scientifically unsubstantiated theories that vaccines are unsafe while, at the same time, silencing science-based, pro-vaccination messaging from the CDC and other government agencies. Additionally, federal funding for infectious disease research and public health infrastructure has been cut.\nTaken together, these policies and rhetoric are a recipe for public health failure \u2014 a fact that is already painfully apparent to many Americans.\nSince the start of 2025, the U.S. has seen more than 1,400 confirmed cases of measles, the highest case count since 1992. We have already experienced almost twice as many measles outbreaks as in all of 2024. More than 90% of cases have occurred in unvaccinated people or those with unknown vaccination status.\nIf these trends continue, it could undo America\u2019s hard-won achievement of officially \u201celiminating\u201d measles 25 years ago. And considering that rates of childhood vaccination against other infectious diseases have been declining as well, the resurgence of measles is the canary in the coal mine warning of the dangers to come.\nThe most tragic part is that while distrust of vaccines has increased among some, the vast majority of Americans still understand the truth: Vaccines are our most effective and important safeguard against infectious disease.\nA bipartisan poll conducted earlier this year found that nearly three-quarters of voters hold favorable views toward vaccines. A similar number say it should be a top priority to ensure that FDA-approved vaccines remain widely available. Eight in 10 voters believe America should continue to lead in developing new vaccines. Even as vaccination rates among kindergartners continue to decline, 92% of them across the nation have received the recommended vaccines. That\u2019s not enough to stop the spread of measles, but it gives us a foundation on which to reverse trends.\nIf the White House and congressional Republicans abandon smart vaccine policy, health-conscious voters will sour on the GOP, resulting in electoral losses in the upcoming midterms.\nThere\u2019s no reason to continue down this path. Not only does it pose danger to the American public but, at a time when Republicans are winning policy arguments and generating results on so many fronts, it\u2019s politically self-defeating to attack our country\u2019s most successful, time-tested disease prevention efforts.\nEmbracing positive, evidence-based vaccination policies would be a remarkably easy way for Republicans to prove to voters that we\u2019re serious about protecting their health \u2014 all while capitalizing on Democrats\u2019 dysfunction.\nAmerica elected today\u2019s Republican leaders to govern with clarity and common sense. Our stance on vaccinations should live up to that standard.\nLarry Bucshon, M.D., practiced as a cardiothoracic surgeon for nearly two decades before representing Indiana\u2019s 8th Congressional District from 2011 to 2025. Michael C. Burgess, M.D., represented Texas\u2019s 26th Congressional District from 2003-2025 and previously practiced as a doctor of obstetrics and gynecology for more than 20 years."

      "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Fewer Americans today consider childhood vaccines important, with 40% saying it is extremely important for parents to have their children vaccinated, down from 58% in 2019 and 64% in 2001. There has been a similar decline in the combined \u201cextremely\u201d and \u201cvery important\u201d percentage, which was 94% in 2001 but sits at 69% today.\nThe July 1-21 poll also finds 17% of Americans saying it is somewhat important that parents get their children vaccinated, while 5% say it is not very important and 7% say it is not at all important. In 2001, 1% said having children vaccinated was not at all important.\nRepublican-Aligned Americans Account for Decrease in Importance\nThe declining belief in the importance of vaccines is essentially confined to Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, as the views of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have changed little over the past 24 years. Twenty-six percent of Republicans and Republican leaners -- half as many as in 2019 -- believe it is extremely important for parents to get their children vaccinated. In the initial Gallup poll on vaccinations, Republicans and Republican leaners (62%) held similar views to Democrats and Democratic leaners (66%); the two groups now differ by 37 percentage points.\nA slim majority of Republicans and Republican leaners (52%) now say it is either extremely or very important for parents to get their children vaccinated. That compares with 93% of Democrats and Democratic leaners. Eleven percent of Republicans and Republican leaners do not think it is important at all for children to be vaccinated.\nAmong parents of children under 18, 29% say it is extremely important to have children vaccinated, and 29% say it is very important. In 2019, the figures for parents were 54% and 23%, respectively. There is not a large enough sample of parents to analyze responses by Republican versus Democratic parents.\nBare Majority Say Government Should Require Vaccinations\nConsistent with the decline in the perceived importance of vaccines, Americans are now much less likely than in the past to say the government should require children to be vaccinated against contagious diseases such as measles. Fifty-one percent now hold this view, down from 62% in 2019. The question was also asked in a 1991 poll by Princeton Survey Research Associates, which found 81% in favor of vaccine requirements at that time.\nAgain, Republicans largely account for this change:\n- Thirty-six percent of Republicans and Republican leaners believe the government should require vaccines, compared with 53% in 2019. Most Republicans, 60%, now oppose government vaccine mandates.\n- Democrats\u2019 views on the matter have shown no meaningful change -- 69% believe this now, and 72% did so in 2019.\nThe 1991 study did not measure respondents\u2019 party identification, so it is not possible to know how partisans\u2019 views have changed since then.\nIncrease in Vaccine Skepticism Comes as Knowledge of Vaccine Advantages Steady\nEven as Americans have become less likely to believe children should be vaccinated, there has been no change since 2019 in the percentage of those who say they have heard about the advantages of childhood vaccinations. In the past five years, there has also been a decline in the percentage who have heard about the possible disadvantages of vaccines.\n- Eighty-eight percent of U.S. adults currently say they have heard a great deal (53%) or fair amount (35%) about the advantages of vaccinations, similar to the 89% recorded in 2019.\n- Meanwhile, 63% report hearing a great deal (27%) or fair amount (36%) about the possible disadvantages of vaccinations for children. This is down from 79% in 2019.\nLonger term, public familiarity with the advantages and possible disadvantages of vaccinations is broader today than in 2001, when 73% said they had heard a great deal or fair amount about advantages and 39% about disadvantages.\nVast majorities of both Democrats and Democratic leaners (95%) and Republicans and Republican leaners (82%) have heard about the advantages of vaccines. Fewer in each group -- 68% of Republicans and 61% of Democrats -- report hearing about vaccine disadvantages.\nSince 2019, Republicans have become slightly less likely to say they have heard about vaccine advantages (down eight points), which is offset by a slight increase (of five points) among Democrats. Both party groups have shown double-digit declines since 2019 in the percentages saying they have heard about vaccine disadvantages.\nIncreasing Percentage of Americans Regard Vaccines as More Dangerous Than Diseases\nThe poll finds a small but growing share of U.S. adults saying vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they are designed to prevent -- 20% now hold this view, up from 11% in 2019 and 6% in 2001.\nSeventy-six percent of Americans currently do not believe vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they are designed to prevent, down from 90% in 2001.\nUntil now, Republicans and Democrats generally held similar views of the net risks and benefits associated with vaccines. Today, 31% of Republicans and Republican leaners think vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they are designed to prevent, compared with 5% of Democrats and Democratic leaners. The current figure for Republicans is up from 12% in 2019 and 6% in 2001.\nOne of the controversies surrounding vaccinations is a supposed link between the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. The original research behind that alleged link has been discredited. Still, 13% of U.S. adults believe certain vaccines can cause autism, up from 6% in 2015 and 10% in 2019. About half of Americans are unsure if vaccines cause autism, while 36% say they are not a cause.\nAs might be expected given their views on vaccines, Republicans and Republican leaners (19%) are much more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners (4%) to say vaccines can cause autism. Whereas a majority of Democrats say vaccines are not a cause of autism, a majority of Republicans are unsure.\nParents of minor children are slightly more likely than U.S. adults overall to believe vaccines cause autism, with 18% holding this view, 29% saying vaccines do not cause autism and 53% unsure.\nBottom Line\nRepublicans\u2019 confidence in childhood vaccines has plunged over the past five years, resulting in a significant decline in Americans\u2019 overall belief that these vaccines are important. The changes in attitudes about childhood vaccines were presaged during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Gallup found far fewer Republican (19%) than Democratic parents (90%) saying they would have a young child of theirs (under age 12) vaccinated for COVID-19 once the vaccine was approved for that age group.\nThis political divide reflected the tendency for Democratic elected officials and party supporters to follow guidance on COVID-19 provided by medical authorities, while Republican elected officials and Republican identifiers were often skeptical of the reliability of that information.\nNow, those doubts appear to be extending to childhood vaccines that have long been used to prevent the spread of contagious diseases, as well as the field of science in general.\nAll U.S. states have immunization requirements for students, though most provide exemptions for medical or religious reasons, and some for philosophical reasons. While Gallup trends show such policies were widely supported in the past, only a slim majority of Americans today believe the government should require all parents to vaccinate their children.\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download)."

      "text": "Florida will move to end all vaccine mandates in the state, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo announced Wednesday.\nThe move would make Florida the first state to end a longstanding \u2013 and constitutionally upheld \u2013 practice of requiring certain vaccines for school students.\nThe state health department will immediately move to end all non-statutory mandates in the state, Ladapo said at a news conference. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was also at the event, said state lawmakers would then look into developing a legislative package to end any remaining mandates.\nLadapo said that every vaccine mandate \u201cis wrong and drips with disdain and slavery.\u201d\nAll 50 states have had school immunization requirements since the beginning of the 1980s, with incoming kindergartners needing shots to protect against diseases including measles, polio and tetanus. No states require a Covid-19 vaccine for schoolchildren.\nAll states allow medical exemptions from these school vaccine mandates, and most also allow for exemptions due to personal or religious beliefs. Exemption rates have been on the rise for years in the US, with a record share of incoming kindergartners skipping the required shots in the 2024-25 school year.\nFlorida\u2019s school vaccine exemption rate last school year\u2013 about 5% \u2013 was higher than the national average, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, and nearly all were for nonmedical reasons.\n\u201cWe are concerned that today\u2019s announcement will put children in Florida public schools at higher risk for getting sick, which will have a ripple effect across our communities,\u201d Dr. Rana Alissa, president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.\n\u201cFor many kids, the best part of school is being with friends - sharing space, playing on the playground, and learning together. Close contact makes it easy for contagious diseases to spread quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun. When children are sick and miss school caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.\u201d\nA study published last year by the CDC estimated that routine childhood vaccinations \u2013 such as those included in school mandates \u2013 will have prevented about 508 million illnesses, 32 million hospitalizations and 1,129,000 deaths among children born between 1994 and 2003. They also were estimated to avert $540 billion in direct costs.\nLadapo said that vaccination should be an individual choice.\n\u201cPeople have a right to make their own decisions, informed decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your god. I don\u2019t have that right. Government does not have that right.\u201d\nBut experts say that freedom comes with responsibilities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all routinely subject to rules that enable us to live together safely, and I personally want those rules in place to protect me and the people I care about. We abide by speed limits, traffic lights, infant car seat and seatbelt laws - all requirements that have expanded over the years as safety technology and engineering has improved,\u201d said Dr. Kelly Moore, president and CEO of immunize.org, a nonprofit organization focused on vaccine access.\n\u201cI share with many other people the belief that all children who are required to attend school should also have a right to the best possible defense from vaccine-preventable diseases while they are there,\u201d she said.\nSome vaccine mandates in Florida can be rolled back unilaterally by the state health department, Ladapo said, but others will require coordination with lawmakers.\nExperts who oppose the move to end vaccine mandates emphasize that the change is not final and that timing is critical.\nWith the announcement coming after the start of the school year, Floridians will have a chance to experience and reflect on what a year of low vaccination coverage looks like, Moore said.\n\u201cThis timing gives leaders several months to reconsider whether this is what\u2019s best for Florida families. It\u2019s quite likely that Floridians will have reasons to regret that decision as time goes by and outbreaks disrupt learning,\u201d she said.\nThe American Medical Association \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the plan to end vaccine mandates, Dr. Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, an internal medicine physician and member of the professional organization\u2019s board of trustees, said in a statement.\n\u201cThis unprecedented rollback would undermine decades of public health progress and place children and communities at increased risk for diseases such as measles, mumps, polio, and chickenpox resulting in serious illness, disability, and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile there is still time, we urge Florida to reconsider this change to help prevent a rise of infectious disease outbreaks that put health and lives at risk.\u201d"

      "text": "More than 1,000 current and former employees of the US Department of Health and Human Services wrote a letter to Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday, arguing that his leadership has \u201cput the health of all Americans at risk\u201d and demanding his resignation.\nThe letter, which was also addressed to members of Congress, comes after a tumultuous week at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that saw its newly confirmed director, Dr. Susan Monarez, declared to be fired by the Trump administration, spurring the resignations of four other senior officials at the public health agency. Monarez was ousted after refusing to bend to pressure from top HHS officials to sign off on potential new vaccine restrictions, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\u201cSecretary Kennedy continues to endanger the nation\u2019s health,\u201d the employees wrote in Wednesday\u2019s letter, citing actions including the facilitation of Monarez\u2019s firing, the resignations of key, longtime CDC leaders, the appointment of what they called \u201cpolitical ideologues\u201d to influential roles in vaccine policy, and the rescinding of emergency use authorizations for Covid-19 vaccines without, they said, \u201cproviding the data or methods used to reach such a decision.\u201d\nIn a statement Wednesday, HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon told CNN, \u201cSecretary Kennedy has been clear: the CDC has been broken for a long time. Restoring it as the world\u2019s most trusted guardian of public health will take sustained reform and more personnel changes.\n\u201cFrom his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door\u2014and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\u201d Nixon continued. \u201cThat commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\u201d\nHundreds of current and former HHS staffers also wrote to Kennedy last month, after the August 8 shooting at CDC headquarters that killed a police officer, imploring the secretary to stop \u201cspreading inaccurate health information\u201d and to guarantee the safety of HHS\u2019s workforce.\nIn response, an HHS spokesperson said in a statement from the department that Kennedy \u201cis standing firmly with CDC employees\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to conflate widely supported public health reforms with the violence of a suicidal mass shooter is an attempt to politicize a tragedy.\u201d\nIn an opinion piece published Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal, Kennedy claimed that his agency is \u201crestoring public trust in the CDC,\u201d which he said failed during the Covid-19 pandemic because of \u201cpoliticized science, bureaucratic inertia and mission creep.\u201d He pledged to return the agency to a main focus on infectious disease and claimed his replacement of experts on the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a move that shook public health experts, is a step toward eliminating \u201cconflicts of interest and bureaucratic complacency.\u201d\nThe current and former HHS employees who called for his resignation this week, some of whom signed the letter anonymously for fear of retaliation, emphasized that they signed in their own personal capacity. In the previous letter, staffers had asked for a response from Kennedy by September 2; they said Wednesday that he hadn\u2019t responded personally.\n\u201cShould he decline to resign,\u201d the employees wrote, \u201cwe call upon the president and US Congress to appoint a new Secretary of Health and Human Services, one whose qualifications and experience ensure that health policy is informed by independent and unbiased peer-reviewed science.\u201d\nKennedy has faced increasing pressure from some in Congress as well as public health groups; last week, after Monarez\u2019s ouster, US Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington and senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, called for the White House to fire him.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, called for Kennedy\u2019s resignation in an opinion piece published Saturday in the New York Times, citing his \u201clongstanding crusade against vaccines and his advocacy of conspiracy theories that have been rejected repeatedly by scientific experts.\u201d\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut and member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, was the latest lawmaker to call for Kennedy to be fired, at a budget hearing Tuesday.\nSen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican doctor from Louisiana who chairs the HELP Committee, said in a post on social media last week that the \u201chigh profile departures\u201d from the CDC \u201cwill require oversight by the HELP committee.\u201d He then called for the September 18 scheduled meeting of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to be postponed indefinitely.\n\u201cSerious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed,\u201d Cassidy said in a statement. \u201cThese decisions directly impact children\u2019s health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted. If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership.\u201d\nSeparately, Kennedy is scheduled to testify before the Senate Committee on Finance on Thursday morning in a hearing titled \u201cthe president\u2019s 2026 health care agenda.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Adam Cancryn and Sarah Owermohle contributed to this report."

      "text": "Herd immunity and COVID-19: What you need to know\nUnderstand what's known about herd immunity and what it means for COVID-19.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nHerd immunity is the name for a point in time when it's hard for a disease to spread through a group of people. The idea of herd immunity works for some diseases, such as measles. But it's a harder concept to apply to illnesses like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nRead on to learn how herd immunity makes sense for some diseases but not others.\nWhy is herd immunity important?\nHerd immunity is important because it defines when a whole community is protected. That includes people who haven't caught the disease, people who had the illness and recovered, and people who got a vaccine. It also includes people who can't get a vaccine.\nData on herd immunity helps guide vaccine goals set by public health agencies.\nHerd immunity can't be reached for every disease, but measles is one example of the idea. Measles is a disease caused by a virus that spreads quickly among people who've never had the disease or the measles vaccine.\nAs people recover or get a measles vaccine, the virus has fewer new people to infect.\nThe virus that causes measles doesn't change much, called mutate, over time. That means once you get the vaccine for measles or recover from the illness, you are not likely to get it again.\nBased on those facts, health officials estimate that herd immunity for measles is at least 94%.\nThat means 94 people out of 100 in a population need to be immune to stop the spread of the measles virus. That includes measles recovery or people who got both measles vaccine shots.\nSo keeping at least 95% of people vaccinated against the measles virus is a public health goal. At that level, people who can't get the vaccine, such as children younger than 12 months, are protected.\nHow is herd immunity achieved?\nHerd immunity for illnesses such as measles and polio happens when you and the people around you get vaccinated.\nBefore the vaccine for measles, millions of people got the disease. In the U.S., hundreds died of measles each year and thousands needed care in the hospital.\nAfter people could get the measles vaccine, the measles virus stopped spreading in the U.S. because so many people got the shots.\nEach year, there are still outbreaks of measles. These are mostly among people who haven't had a vaccine, are undervaccinated or who have a breakthrough illness. But the number of people in the U.S. who get measles is in the hundreds, not millions.\nBut herd immunity can be lost. If people can't get a vaccine, or choose not to, the protection among a population goes down.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, children worldwide missed getting a measles vaccine. Those missed doses led to an increase in measles cases and deaths in 2022 compared with 2021.\nAnd the idea of herd immunity doesn't work for every disease.\n- Herd immunity may not be possible when viruses change a lot in a short time, as with the virus that causes COVID-19.\n- Reaching herd immunity is harder if a disease can be spread by people who catch the virus but don't have symptoms.\n- Herd immunity is much harder to achieve if the protection from having and recovering from the illness or getting a vaccine doesn't last a long time.\nSpread of the viruses that cause COVID-19, flu and RSV are examples of when herd immunity may not be a realistic goal. With this type of illness, the goal is to control and limit the spread of the virus.\nWhat's the outlook for achieving herd immunity in the U.S.?\nGiven the challenges, it's unclear if herd immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 will be reached. However, the number of fully vaccinated adults continues to rise. In addition, more than 80 million people in the U.S. have had confirmed infections with the COVID-19 virus \u2014 though, again, it's not clear how long immunity lasts after infection.\nEven if it isn't currently possible to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the COVID-19 vaccine can lower the risk of death or serious illness caused by COVID-19. It lowers your risk and lowers the risk that you may spread it to people around you.\nHow can you slow the spread of respiratory disease, such as COVID-19?\nGetting vaccinations as they are updated and on schedule helps lower the risk of getting sick. Testing when you have symptoms to know when you need to avoid other people can help prevent spreading a virus.\nOne key action you can take is to wash your hands.\nWash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If you can't use soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure people around you, especially children, know the importance of hand-washing and how to do it correctly.\nIf you can, try to avoid being in crowded, indoor spaces with poor airflow when respiratory viruses are spreading.\nYou also can take other actions to prevent the spread of germs:\n- Cover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\n- Avoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs from entering the body there.\n- Clean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent the spread of viruses from a surface to your face.\n- Help others from afar. If you can, avoid close contact with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.\nWhen respiratory illness germs are spreading in your area, wearing a mask can give you another layer of protection. These types of germs spread when people talk, sneeze, cough or sing, for example.\nPeople who are at high risk of serious illness, or who are regularly around people at high risk, may choose to wear a mask. If you came in contact with a germ, are sick or are getting over sickness, wearing a mask can help protect the people around you.\nIn the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests wearing the most protective mask possible that you'll wear regularly, fits well and is comfortable.\nIf you have a chronic medical condition and may have a higher risk of serious illness, check with your healthcare professional about other ways to protect yourself.\nNov. 04, 2023\n- Poland GA.

  "argos_summary": "Florida has become the first state to eliminate all school vaccine mandates, a move championed by the GOP and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, amid growing Republican skepticism toward vaccines. The policy shift follows a rise in exemption rates and fears of measles outbreaks, with experts warning that lower vaccination coverage could erode herd immunity and increase illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. Politically, the decision risks further alienating voters who still support mandatory childhood vaccines, potentially harming Republican electoral prospects while prompting calls from health officials and the AMA to reconsider the rollback.",
