      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Add explicit magnitude ranges for the 10‑year**: after “higher probability of a cut compresses the yield curve,” insert a sentence such as “If the September cut materializes, the 10‑year is expected to fall 10–20 bp; a surprise 25‑bp hike would push it up 5–10 bp.”  \n2. **Specify catalyst windows**:  \n   - *September FOMC* – date: 2025‑09‑16/17.  \n   - *Tariff injunction finality* – court decision expected 2025‑08‑31 (cite GXYXMKIG5).  \n   - *Core PCE release* – 2025‑08‑29 (cite 3YAQ8JUPL).  \n3. **Insert inline citations** after each factual claim (e.g., “4.23 % today (3YAQ8JUPL)”).  \n4. **Clarify causal chain**:  \n   - Trump‑aligned Fed → sharp short‑term cuts → lower term premium → 10‑year drop.  \n   - Tariff block → lower import‑price inflation → cooler core PCE → Fed dovish tilt → 10‑year drop.  \n5. **Quantify thresholds**: state that 4.23 % is 30 bp above the 4.20 % “neutral” level; a drop below 4.20 % would signal a rate cut.  \n6. **Refine invalidation logic**: replace “rise in core PCE above 2.9 %” with “if core PCE > 2.9 % (projected 2025‑09‑01), the 10‑year could rise 5–10 bp.”  \n7. **Remove generic phrasing** (“convergence of dovish signals”) and replace with concrete data (“Fed‑funds futures imply 85 % chance of 25‑bp cut”).  \n8. **Ensure every claim rests on evidence**: add a brief note that the 85 % probability comes from CME FedWatch (cite U21K4ALYQ).  \n9. **Maintain focus on the asset**: keep all sentences tied to ust10y; avoid tangential discussion of equity indices or other assets.  \n\nImplement these edits to meet the 0–3‑week horizon, provide clear direction, magnitude, catalysts, and invalidation, and satisfy the acceptance gate.",
