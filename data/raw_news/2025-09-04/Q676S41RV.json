  "description": "Customer service AI agent startup Sierra claims to have hundreds of customers including SoFi, Ramp and Brex, among others.",
  "content": "Investors are clearly bullish about former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor\u2019s AI agent startup Sierra.\n\nSierra, which helps enterprises build customer service AI agents, announced it raised a $350 million funding round on Thursday. The round, led by earlier investor Greenoaks Capital, values the startup at $10 billion, according to a company blog post that confirmed an earlier report from Axios on Wednesday.\n\nSierra was founded in early 2024 by Taylor and longtime Google alum Clay Bavor. The company claims to have landed hundreds of customers, including SoFi, Ramp, and Brex, among others, in its 18 months of operation.\n\nSierra has now raised $635 million altogether, including a $110 million that closed in February of last year led by Sequoia and Benchmark, and a $175 million round that closed in October of last year led by Greenoaks.\n\nOthers of its investors include ICONIQ and Thrive Capital.\n\nAs TechCrunch has previously reported, Taylor and Bavor have a long history in customer service tech. Taylor spent nearly a decade at Salesforce and years ago founded Quip, which Salesforce bought for $750 million in the summer of 2016. Bavor managed Gmail and Google Drive at Google, among other consumer-facing products.\n\nTaylor met Bavor while at Google, where he worked before serving as Facebook\u2019s CTO for several years. At Google, Taylor is widely credited with helping to launch Google Maps. Years later, he\u2019d oversee the Twitter board throughout the social media site\u2019s takeover by Elon Musk.\n\nEarlier this week, in fact, Taylor announced that Sierra is launching its second year of its so-called APX program, a rotational opportunity for recent technical graduates that directly mirrors the Google program that launched both Taylor\u2019s and co-founder Clay Bavor\u2019s careers two decades ago.\n\nThe hiring announcement stands out in what has become an increasingly tough job market, particularly as companies assess the power of AI technologies like those Sierra is selling and their potential impact on workforce needs.\n\nThe program targets computer science graduates and offers experience in both agent engineering and product management, with participants building AI agents for companies across industries including retail, healthcare, financial services, and telecoms. Taylor described the role as providing what he calls \u201can irresponsible amount of responsibility\u201d \u2014 similar to the freedom to build and launch products that he and Bavor had at Google \u2014 with new graduates expected to work on multiple product launches during their first year.",

      "text": "Moments after Bret Taylor resigned as co-CEO of cloud-software giant Salesforce in January 2023, he received a call from an old friend inviting him to lunch.\nWith time on his hands, Taylor accepted the invitation and met Clay Bavor, a veteran Google executive, at a Mediterranean restaurant in Palo Alto. \u201cMy read on it was, he was checking in on me,\" Taylor recalled.\nThe duo, who had worked together at Google nearly two decades ago, spent the next several hours sipping herbal tea and chatting. By the time they left, Taylor and Bavor had decided to start a new company together.\nSierra, the name of their new joint venture, is hoping to make a mark in the crowded field of conversational AI startups, with a focus on business customers. Ahead of Sierra\u2019s official launch on Tuesday, the two founders sat down with Fortune and offered the first detailed look at their new startup, its roster of clients, and the technology that powers it.\nThe startup idea that began over lunch has now grown into a team of 30 staffers, with an office in San Francisco\u2019s SoMa neighborhood. The AI \u201cagents\u201d created by Sierra technology are already engaged in hundreds of thousands of customer conversations every month for clients including Weight Watchers, SiriusXM, Sonos, and OluKai, according to the company.\nAnd in another sign of confidence in the year-old startup, blue-chip Silicon Valley investors led by Sequoia Capital and Benchmark have already invested a total of $110 million.\nStill, Sierra is competing against some very large players who are investing vast sums into their own AI offerings \u2014 including Taylor\u2019s former company, Salesforce. And while the buzz and expectations for businesses\u2019 adoption of AI are red hot, the actual implementation of conversational AI tools is in its early stages, with the benefits still largely unproven.\nFor Taylor, whose exit from the Salesforce C-suite caught many observers\u2014including co-CEO and founder Marc Benioff\u2014by surprise, the challenge of making the magic of AI a standard feature for Main Street businesses is part of the appeal.\n\u201cI looked at these amazing technologies and it's so easy for the technology companies around us to deploy because we've got buildings full of engineers who can follow the latest research,\u201d said Taylor, who is CEO at Sierra.\n\"The greatest opportunity we have,\u201d he said, \u201cis to enable every company, no matter how sophisticated or technical, to deploy [AI] successfully.\"\nInspired by nature, not robots\nBy naming the company after the Sierra mountain range in the Western U.S., Taylor and Bavor hoped to drive home the message that their sights extend far beyond the Silicon Valley horizon. The name was a deliberate choice to counter what they say is the common imagery of robots and metallic objects associated with artificial intelligence.\n\u201cWe looked a lot at inspiration from nature because we felt like we wanted to sort of offset some of the naturally cold imagery that comes with AI,\u201d Taylor said.\nInstead of pitching AI as a tool for businesses to accomplish arcane internal tasks, Sierra is betting on easy-to-understand, pragmatic uses of AI technology like conversational \u201cagents\u201d who can interact with customers for support, account management and other issues. These AI agents can answer questions faster than humans and at much lower cost, the company says.\nSierra isn\u2019t the first to think of this, either. There\u2019s already a whole slew of chatbots for customer service: Twilio\u2019s CustomerAI, Zendesk\u2019s Answer Bot, and perhaps the most well-positioned, Salesforce\u2019s Einstein.\nTaylor draws inspiration from the dot-com era, suggesting that in today\u2019s landscape, small startups possess an opportunity to outmaneuver larger incumbents, who might be beholden to bigger obstacles.\n\u201cI think certainly incumbent technology companies have some advantages, data, customer base distribution channels, and we certainly understand that,\u201d Taylor said, adding that there\u2019s also an absence of clear market leaders, which presents an opportunity for Sierra to seize a portion of the market share. \u201cThe technology challenges are so formidable, even if you talk with three companies adjacent to the space, they\u2019ve got three completely different approaches.\u201d\nSequoia\u2019s Ravi Gupta, who is on Sierra\u2019s board along with Benchmark\u2019s Peter Fenton, is more blunt about the competitive landscape, telling Fortune that the $110 million in funding gives the startup the chance to \u201cto always be on offense.\u201d While Gupta and Sierra would not comment on the valuation of the startup, Bloomberg reported in January that Sierra was seeking to raise funds at almost a $1 billion valuation.\nSierra uses a mix of customized AI models\nIn a departure from the conventional Silicon Valley playbook, Sierra is actually building the AI agents for customers, rather than just selling the tools for customers to do it themselves. It\u2019s a business model that may not scale as rapidly, but the idea is that many companies, even very large ones, don\u2019t have the in-house resources, expertise, or desire to take on this kind of complex project.\n\u201cIt's possible to build a couch by going to Home Depot and buying lumber and cushions and fabric and putting it together yourself,\u201d Bavor said. \u201cMost people just want to buy a couch.\u201d\nAnd given the risks to a company\u2019s brand if an AI agent goes rogue, Sierra is betting that its expertise and experience will carry a lot of weight.\nA typical agent based on Sierra\u2019s technology uses four or five different AI models when it receives a message from a user \u2013 one of the models might generate a response, for example, while another model might be tapped to prevent hallucinations. Sierra uses a mix of proprietary and open source large language models, including frontier models from OpenAI and Microsoft that are tweaked by their team of researchers to fit a customer\u2019s use case.\nThe company trains its AI models to reason and make decisions by giving them specific goals and guidelines, similar to how a person might follow rules for their job. This approach allows them to onboard new customers quickly without needing a lot of their data, Taylor said, and he believes this sets them apart because they can adapt to new policies or changes in a customer's needs much faster than traditional AI models, which might take weeks or months to update.\nWhen your cofounder is also OpenAI's chairman\nWith Sierra, Bavor and Taylor are having a reunion 15 years in the making.\nTaylor, who was a co-creator of Google Maps, hired Bavor to work at Google in 2005. Over the following years, Bavor ascended the corporate ladder with roles managing products like Gmail and Google Drive, and taking charge of Google\u2019s virtual reality division in 2015.\nTaylor meanwhile left Google in 2007 and has spent the intervening years shuttling between entrepreneurship and Big Tech. After Facebook acquired FriendFeed, a social network he cofounded, Taylor went on to become CTO at Facebook. He then left to start Quip, a cloud productivity software tool that Salesforce acquired for $750 million in 2016\u2014this time the acquisition led him all the way to the co-CEO job at Salesforce, alongside Benioff.\n\u201cI joke that I've been trying to work with Clay again for the past 15 years. We have a monthly poker game that happens roughly twice a year,\u201d Taylor said.\nThe two cofounders take turns working out of each other\u2019s garages every couple weeks as a break from going into the San Francisco office. \u201c[It\u2019s] kind of the right time in both of our lives and I think it just came from kind of like a true, authentic, just excitement about the technology,\" Taylor said.\nThe return to startup life has not been without some drama for the 43-year-old Taylor. His surprise departure from Salesforce unsettled investors, particularly since he was widely considered to be Benioff\u2019s anointed successor. While Taylor and Benioff both said Taylor was leaving to return to his entrepreneurial roots, the Wall Street Journal reported that there had been growing tension between the two leaders.\nTaylor was also in the center of the storm during Elon Musk\u2019s chaotic, $44 billion purchase of Twitter, where Taylor was on the board and responsible for overseeing the transaction. In November 2023, Taylor found himself connected to another big Silicon Valley boardroom blow up when he was tapped to step in as chair of OpenAI following the ouster-and-return of founder Sam Altman.\nAsked about the possibility of a conflict of interest arising from his involvement with both Sierra and the board at OpenAI\u2014a situation that prompted LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman to step down from the same board\u2014Taylor emphasized that he doesn't view Sierra as directly competing with OpenAI initiatives. In instances where there might be perceived overlap, he said, he can simply recuse himself from the decision-making process.\n\u201cI took on the role because I care so much about the OpenAI mission and I was\u2014like many other people in the world\u2014pretty anxious over the course of that weekend that the mission was at risk,\u201d Taylor said, referring to Altman\u2019s stated goal of developing artificial general intelligence, a still theoretical type of AI that proponents hope will be able to perform most tasks as well as or better than humans.\n\u201cWe're at a slightly higher altitude, we're not building artificial general intelligence, right,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe're bringing a product to enterprises.\u201d\nIf the past year has been put Taylor in the center of the Silicon Valley spotlight, he\u2019s working with Bavor to keep Sierra on a different stage.\nDo you have insight to share?

We\u2019re doubling down on our investments to apply the latest advancements in AI to all parts of the agent development life cycle:\n- Making it even easier to get up and running with or without technical expertise\n- Enabling AI insights to automatically find and suggest agent improvements to drive CSAT, NPS, and revenue\n- Expanding beyond customer service to enable companies to improve the lifetime value of their customers by driving sales and engagement with their AI agent\nIn addition to investing in our platform, we\u2019re excited to expand beyond our offices in San Francisco, New York, London, and Atlanta to build a larger presence in Europe and Asia. We want to bring Sierra to every company in the world, and it starts with having a presence in all parts of it.\nThe path ahead\nWe're in this for the long term \u2013 to create the platform on which the best customer experiences in the world are built. Making that dream a reality is all about execution: we need to deliver for every customer, every time, without exception. The opportunity ahead is enormous, for our customers, their customers, and Sierra.\nIf you\u2019re interested in joining us on this journey, we\u2019d love to hear from you."

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions.
