  "description": "Are you need of a mechanic tool set for DIY projects or work? Here's everything included in the DeWalt ToughSeries 140-Piece Mechanics Tool Set.",
  "content": "Preloaded mechanics sets are a great way to start building out a garage toolkit, whether you're a professional, hobbyist, or just want to save some money by performing your own basic repairs and tune-ups. They can also be a great way to supplement existing kits or, if they're small enough or designed to be portable, useful to keep in the trunk or take on the road. Among the things you should know about DeWalt tools before buying any is that the brand offers several assorted mechanics sets, and that these sets differ in more than just how many pieces each includes. The DeWalt ToughSeries 140-piece Mechanics Tool Set, for example, differs from standard DeWalt sets since it's part of the brand's ToughSeries line. DeWalt ToughSeries tools are specifically designed to be more durable so that they can be used in rougher jobsites with harsher conditions. The ToughSeries system includes hammers, screwdrivers, lighted tape measures, and more. Tools are engineered with black chrome plating that offers 10x more corrosion resistance than standard DeWalt tools and grips with five times more durability for enhanced control in extreme environments. As part of its ToughSeries, DeWalt's 140-piece \u00bc-inch and \u215c-inch Mechanics Tool Set (model DWMT45408) provides not just a wide range of tools and accessories to tackle all sorts of automotive jobs, but includes the boosted resilience that defines the brand's ToughSeries line. If you're shopping for a new mechanics set, this extra durability may be a pivotal factor in your choice. So it's important to know that the difference between the ToughSeries 140-piece and other kits like the DeWalt 142-piece \u00bc-inch and \u215c-inch Mechanics Tool Set (model DWMT73802) isn't just their contents. Of course that's important too, so here's a closer look at everything included in the DeWalt ToughSeries 140-piece Mechanics Tool Set.\n\nThe set is built around two very high-precision ratchets Available from retailers including Ace Hardware and Acme Tools, the DeWalt ToughSeries 140-piece Mechanics Tool Set has a list price of $269.99. If you find that a bit steep, remember that the hand tools are built with an anti-resistant, full-polish chrome finish and packed in a portable, rugged case that keeps the tools very well-protected. The two included ratchets are also built with this ToughSystem durability, and DeWalt says they last four times longer than other models. Both ratchets are also powerful and highly precise, as each comes with a 144-tooth dual pawl mechanism and 2.5-inch arc swing (for comparison, the ratchets included in the 142-piece DWMT73802 are 72-tooth with 5-degree arc swings). This extremely high-tooth count and low arc swing allow you to use each ratchet, which DeWalt says offers 30% more torque on rounded fasteners, in very tight spaces. The ratchets come in the two most likely sizes you'll come across \u2014 \u00bc-inch and \u215c-inch \u2014 so you can use the set for everything from auto repair to fleet maintenance, farm equipment, and industrial applications. Also adding to the versatility of the set is its inclusion of both metric and SAE sizes for its combination wrenches, hex keys, and standard, deep, and hex-bit sockets. There are 32 \u00bc-inch 6\u2011point standard and deep sockets and 40 \u215c-inch 6\u2011point standard and deep sockets, as well as nine \u215c-inch hex\u2011bit sockets. Also included are eight Torx\u2011bit sockets and three spark plug sockets. The DeWalt ToughSeries 140-piece Mechanics Tool Set also comes with six extension bars, two universal joints, and 28 hex keys. Finally, the kit includes eight combination wrenches that offer 15-degree offset for use in tighter spaces and a long panel forging design for maximum torque.\n\nWhat tools are missing from the DeWalt ToughSeries 140-piece Mechanics Tool Set? With two high-precision ratchets and an assortment of sockets for \u215c-inch, \u00bc-inch, metric, and SAE applications, the DeWalt ToughSeries 140-piece Mechanics Tool Set has plenty to offer. However, there are some pieces lacking that you might end up needing. The very first thing that you may have noticed is missing from the 140-piece kit is a \u00bd-inch ratchet and socket set. There are plenty of uses for \u00bd-inch sockets, including lug nuts and larger fasteners commonly found on trucks, SUVs, lawn and agricultural gear, structural steel, and other heavy equipment. Additionally, you won't find screwdrivers or nut drivers in the kit, which you'll certainly require from time to time. The inclusion of various adapters and reducers, as well as flare nut and crowfoot wrenches, would also make the set more versatile. Considering it's a handheld set, it's not a surprise that other, larger tools like a torque wrench or breaker bar aren't included \u2014 but that doesn't mean you won't need them. You'll also want to have power tools on hand as well, like an impact wrench as well as impact-rated sockets to use with it, since the included sockets in DeWalt's 140-piece set, while durable, are not impact-rated. While you can get a lot done with just the DeWalt ToughSeries 140-piece Mechanics Tool Set alone, you'll likely need to supplement it with at least some of these mentioned tools if you want to be able to accomplish as much as possible in your garage. For what it's worth, DeWalt does sell more comprehensive kits, such as its 226-piece ToughSystem Mechanics Tool Set (model DWMT45226H), which, for starters, includes a \u00bd-inch ratchet and sockets.",

      "text": "DeWalt 226-Piece Mechanics Tool Set: Here's Everything That's Included\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nFor people who are just getting started with their automotive repair and maintenance journey, you'll need to invest in a mechanic's tool set. If you have the time and energy, you can definitely build your own mechanic's tool set for yourself. But if you can't, you also have the option to buy a ready-made set from a reputable seller instead. In the past, we've mentioned several options of affordable tool sets from brands like Pittsburgh, Stanley, Craftsman, Crescent, and of course, DeWalt. Now, DeWalt is known to produce a ton of mechanic's tool sets that range from the hundreds of pieces that are perfect for casual DIYers to those having more than 300 pieces, which professionals may enjoy more.\nPreviously, one of our team members at SlashGear, who is an ex-auto mechanic, gave us a rundown on why DeWalt's 192-Piece Mechanic Tool Set doesn't hit the right notes for him. In particular, he cited that it lacks a couple of key tools compared to other sets for the same price, which include pliers and wrenches. When it comes to that, the DeWalt 226-Piece Mechanics Tool Set fares a little better, because it includes combination wrenches, various drive extension bars, a drive universal joint, drivespark plug socket, and drive adapter. It also offers sets of L-Hex Keys in both SAE and metric, a bit screwdriver with 55 specialty bits, and three drive ratchet handles (1/4, 3/8, and 1/2-inch). Lastly, it has an almost endless list of sockets to choose from.\nWhich sockets are included in the 226-Piece DeWalt Mechanics Tool set?\nFor its 1/4-inch drive 6-point sockets and deep sockets (SAE), the set includes 3/16, 7/32, 1/4, 9/32, 5/16, 11/32, 3/8, 7/16, and 1/2-inch options. However, only the 1/4-inch drive 6-point socket (SAE) has the 5/32-inch. As for the metric versions, both the 1/4-inch drive 6-point sockets and deep sockets offer diameters that range from 4 to 14 millimeters.\nOn the other hand, its 3/8-inch drive 6-point sockets and deep sockets are available in sizes 1/4, 5/16, 3/8, 7/16, 1/2, 9/16, 5/8, 11/16, 3/4, 13/16, and 7/8-inch options. As for those who need it in metric, it's 3/8-inch drive 6 point sockets carry everything from 10- to 21 millimeters, while the deep sockets range from 13- to 21 millimeters. But take note, both options skip the 20-millimeter.\nLastly, both are 1/2-inch drive 6-point sockets and deep sockets come in the same SAE sizes that range from 7/16, 1/2, 9/16, 5/8, 11/16, 3/4, 13/16, 7/8, 15/16, and 1-inch. As for their metric options, both sockets carry sizes 13- to 19 millimeters. In addition, it has 21, 22, and 24-millimeter socket sizes as well. But, now that you know what's inside it, do people actually think it does it job well? Here's what the reviewers say and what other highly-rated options you can choose instead if these don't fit the bill.\nIs the DeWalt 226-Piece Mechanics Tool Set worth it?\nOn the DeWalt website, the 226-Piece Mechanics Tool Set doesn't have a ton of reviews yet. However, early feedback by customers have been quite promising, with all of its five reviewers giving it a perfect rating. Apart from the ease of use, which scored 4.8 stars, it also rated five stars for its quality, value, effectiveness, and durability. With the option to get it with ToughSystem Large Case, it retails for $342.99 on White Cap.\nAmong DeWalt website reviewers, one praised how it fulfilled most of his daily needs for both automotive and construction work. In particular, a few people said that they like the toolbox, citing that they bought it specifically to attach to their ToughSystem. And when one user mentioned that its handle broke, they mentioned being satisfied with DeWalt's response, as well as replacement.\nIf you're on a budget and don't think you need the full set anyway, you might want to consider the 142-Piece DeWalt Tool Set instead, which you can snag for as low as $99 on sale. Although if you want to get a little more bang for your buck in terms of quantity, you can actually get the 247-piece Mechanics Tool Set for just $199.99, plus installment options for qualified customers. With many similar components, it also boasts a high rating of 4.8 stars from over 11,400+ reviews. But take note, we've mentioned before that buying DeWalt tools on Amazon is risky in general."

      "text": "Everything You Need To Consider Before Investing In DeWalt Tools\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nIf you are in need of some new tools after years of use or are building up your toolbox for the first time, there are some big decisions to make. First and foremost is determining which brand to go with, as there are numerous to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One of the oldest and most widely trusted of them all is DeWalt, which came to fruition all the way back in 1924. Throughout the past century of its existence, the brand has expanded its influence over just about every area in the tool world.\nLooking over DeWalt's wide array of power tools, you'd be hard-pressed not to find exactly what you need for your next job. DeWalt has a variety of tools, from the DeWalt 142-piece tool set to any of its other sizable kits to more heavy-duty industrial power tools. Before making any purchases, though, there are some more nuanced things you need to consider before going all-in on customer-recommended DeWalt tools.\nWhat exactly does DeWalt's catalog contain?\nBefore looking into any other criteria regarding whether DeWalt is the right tool brand for you, it's good to know what exactly it has within its catalog. As mentioned before, DeWalt has stepped into just about every major tool area there is at this point. First and foremost are DeWalt's hand tools, ranging from tape measures to hammers to specialized drywall tools, to name a few. As mentioned before, it's not uncommon for DeWalt to offer larger kits featuring a bunch of useful hand tools, saving you time and money over trying to buy every single one individually if you need most or all of them.\nMoving on are DeWalt's power tools, which also cover a litany of tasks. There are relatively basic ones like hand drills, grinders, and saws, in addition to a host of more job-specific ones. DeWalt offers concrete equipment, tools designed for work on piping, and even EV and battery chargers for cars. On top of all of that, DeWalt is all about helping you make yardwork a breeze, no matter the task. DeWalt's outdoor tool catalog features lawn mowers, snow blowers, power washers, and a whole lot more, making the brand a great choice for a variety of different tasks.\nWhat is DeWalt's pricing like?\nDeWalt tools are sold through the likes of Home Depot, Tractor Supply, and Ace Hardware, to name a few. No matter where you ultimately choose to shop, you're probably wondering how much you're going to have to shell out for DeWalt products. More importantly, are the price points appropriate given your budget and the amount of use you hope to get out of them in the long run? DeWalt advertises its tools as tough and professional-grade, so one would expect them to be priced as such. While they might not be exorbitantly priced, they tend to be on the higher end compared to the competition.\nTake its pretty standard drill, for example, which runs for around $139 at retail. More budget-friendly brands like Hercules, Hart, and Ryobi have similar drills for $77.75, $69.99, and $99, respectively. More expensive brands, such as Milwaukee and Makita, sit at $129 and $149 for their comparable drills. With this price range laid out, it becomes clear that DeWalt tools are going to cost you a bit more than other names on the market. Still, one can find some pretty high-value DeWalt tools for below $100, so not everything the manufacturer has for sale is too pricey.\nOf course, this is sure to vary from tool to tool, so it would be wise to do some research into the exact ones you want. Once you cross-reference price points between companies, you can come to a more informed verdict.\nWhat have customers said about DeWalt?\nOver on Reddit, a user opened the floor for folks to share their feelings on DeWalt, and for the most part, folks endorse it. \"I've been using DeWalt for 25 years, and have never burned one up, but I've destroyed most every other brand out there. No, they are top-tier, and among the top tier, arguably the best,\" commented u/Asatmaya, with others sharing their favorite DeWalt tools and positive experiences with the company.\nIn another thread, u/AlwaysFrontin added their belief that DeWalt tools are especially good for carpentry and woodworking, while u/IAmKyleBizzle shared their appreciation for DeWalt keeping much of its manufacturing in the United States. Meanwhile, Ultimate Tool Reviews on YouTube has praise and criticism for the brand, applauding its customer service and selection while addressing its lack of innovation and lack of reliability in older batteries. As for fellow YouTuber Mr. Build It, he went as far as trading in his DeWalt tools for Ryobi, as doing so was comparatively lower cost, with a quality set of tools and battery system driving the decision home.\nThis is just a small sample of the DeWalt chatter online. Finding other information through the DeWalt Reddit, online store product reviews, and other forums and social media platforms is worth your time to give you the fullest picture of how the brand has served tradespeople and DIYers alike.\nHow does DeWalt's battery system work?\nLike most other major power tool brands out today, DeWalt has fully embraced the cordless tool framework. The bulk of DeWalt batteries come in three varieties: 12V, 20V, 60V, and 120V, with DeWalt discontinuing its 18V batteries along with their designated tools. The most common variety you're likely to encounter is the 20V, which powers hundreds of different DeWalt hand power tools. Within the enduring voltages, there are the standard MAX batteries, the longer-lasting, more compact MAX XR, and the even longer-lasting and more powerful 20V MAX Powerstack. Meanwhile, FlexVolt batteries can alternate between 20V and 60V for use with different tools.\nAs far as larger DeWalt products go, such as lawn mowers, they too can run on this battery system. DeWalt advertises several as using 20V or 60V batteries, increasing their already impressive versatility. The same goes for larger products like concrete core drills, which run on 60V batteries. Even DeWalt's stick welder runs on batteries, coming with a whopping four 20V/60V Max FlexVolt batteries to power up. No matter the tool in question, though, it will tell you which size is needed for it to operate, so it couldn't be easier to know which battery and charger to get ahold of. It should be noted that most DeWalt batteries come with a three-year warranty with one year of service and a 90-day money-back guarantee.\nWhat does the DeWalt warranty situation look like?\nRegardless of how much you personally use them, power tools are prone to breaking down over time. They're complex machines often put under stress and can be put together wrong at the factory on occasion. Therefore, knowing what kind of warranty they have attached to them is huge, allowing you to get a replacement or your money back under certain conditions. What does DeWalt have for customers in this regard?\nDeWalt has several robust warranty plans on the books. According to its website, its warranties range in length from 90 days to the entire lifetime of the tool, each with its own specific guidelines and limitations. DeWalt also has the No Break Guarantee for bits as well, meaning so long as the anchor wear mark is still visible and you have proof of purchase, they'll replace it for free in the event of failure. Most DeWalt purchases come equipped with a three-year warranty automatically. To find out more, you can always reach out to the company directly via phone at 1-800-433-9258 or through the online written contact form.\nWith all of these factors considered, hopefully, you're in a good enough place, or close to it, to determine if DeWalt is the brand for you, or if another should take that spot."

      "text": "What Comes In The DeWalt 142-Piece Tool Set (And Where Can You Buy It?)\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nWhen it comes to manual labor, either in a professional capacity or just around the house, it's always helpful to be prepared. One of the most annoying scenarios a worker can experience is being in the middle of fixing or building something, only to have to drop everything and drive to the hardware store to grab a single part you just happened to be missing.\nIf you're looking to prepare for any potential snafu you may encounter on the job, then the best course of action is to go for quantity. You won't have to worry about missing a single part if you've already got a full selection of every single part you could ever need ready to go. To that end, you might be interested in the 142-piece tool set sold by hardware brand DeWalt. Whether it's the tools themselves or the many sockets and bits that go in them, this kit will probably keep you covered on most jobs, sparring you from that last-minute drive to the store.\nThe set includes wrenches, ratchets, bits, and more\nTo clarify, the 142 pieces included in the DeWalt tool set include both individual hand tools and, where applicable, the sockets, bits, and assorted fittings you'd need to actually use these tools. All of this is packed into a metal-latched carrying case for security and convenience. As long as you remember to put each tool and fitting back into their designated slots in the case, you won't lose track of them.\nBut enough beating around the bush; what's actually in this thing? First, we have the individual hand tools, including a vinyl grip multi-driver, two pear-head ratchets, a set of 10 combination wrenches, and both standard and metric hex key sets. The kit is intended primarily for mechanical work, so these tools should meet most adjusting and fastening needs.\nBesides the tools themselves, there's a cornucopia of fittings and bits to meet most situations. You've got both 1/4-inch and 3/4-inch drive and deep drive sockets, extensions, universal joints, adapters, a spark plug socket, nut driver bits, and various specialty bits. Most of these tools and components have a chrome finish for extra corrosion resistance. As an added perk, there's a small accessory kit in the mix if you want to keep your favorite fittings close by.\nThe set is available at most physical and online hardware stores\nFor this kit's availability, we've got a bit of good news and a bit of not-so-good news. The good news is that it's readily available from just about anywhere that sells DeWalt products. Naturally, this includes the big-name brick-and-mortar stores like Home Depot, though you may also be able to find it at smaller, locally-owned stores. In addition to that, the kit is also for sale on several online storefronts. Not only can you buy it from Home Depot online, but you can also grab it from Acme Tools and even Amazon. In the particular case of Amazon, though, you should make sure you're buying directly from DeWalt, as there have been knock-off sellers hocking DeWalt products there in the past.\nThe not-so-good news is the price point. Even though there are no power tools in this kit, it's still 142 pieces. The sheer quantity of items means the price tag is going to go up a bit. Specifically, you're looking at around $132 to $155, depending on where you buy from. Ideally, you may be able to get it at a discount, usually around $99."

  "argos_summary": "DeWalt offers a range of mechanics tool sets, notably the ToughSeries 140\u2011piece set that emphasizes durability with black chrome plating and high\u2011tooth ratchets for tighter spaces, and the larger 226\u2011piece set that adds \u00bd\u2011inch tools and impact\u2011rated sockets. The 140\u2011piece kit is priced at $269.99 and includes a wide array of sockets, wrenches, and accessories but lacks larger ratchets, screwdrivers, and impact tools, making it suitable for DIYers and light professionals. The 226\u2011piece set, at $342.99, expands the tool range to include \u00bd\u2011inch ratchets and sockets, offering more comprehensive coverage for heavier automotive and construction tasks. Both sets are marketed through major retailers and highlight DeWalt\u2019s ToughSystem durability, though customers may need to supplement with power tools for full functionality.",
