  "content": "Oxford Business Group, in partnership with Ominvest, showcases Oman's investment potential and its role in shaping a resilient Gulf economy in its latest Growth Perspectives video\n\nMUSCAT, Oman, Sept. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Oman's investment sector is playing an increasingly strategic role in the country's economic diversification efforts under Vision 2040, supported by fiscal reforms, private capital mobilisation and cross-border partnerships. A new Growth Perspectives video produced by Oxford Business Group (OBG), in collaboration with Oman International Development and Investment Company (Ominvest), explores how Oman is strengthening its economic foundations while positioning itself as an active player in regional growth.\n\nThe video, titled \"How Oman and Ominvest drive sustainable growth beyond oil,\" highlights the country's progress in reducing its reliance on hydrocarbons over the past decade, underpinned by policy frameworks such as the Five-Year Strategy and the Medium-Term Fiscal Plan. These measures have helped lower public debt from nearly 70% of GDP to under 34%, restore investment-grade status and channel resources into infrastructure, private sector development and job creation.\n\nParticular focus is placed on the rise of emerging industries, including tourism, logistics, mining, fisheries and green hydrogen, all aligned with Oman Vision 2040. The video also examines how Ominvest is contributing to this shift, not only through domestic investment but also by expanding its footprint in high-growth regional markets such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\nWith sustainability, governance and innovation becoming core investment priorities, Ominvest is building partnerships across borders, investing in platforms that connect markets, and supporting sectors such as finance, insurance and technology. This approach reflects a broader transformation in the role of Gulf investment institutions, which are increasingly shaping industries and fostering deeper regional integration.\n\nDana Carmen Agarbicean, OBG's Country Director for Oman, said the video underscores the importance of aligning capital flows with national and regional objectives: \"Oman's investment sector is emerging as a catalyst for sustainable economic growth and diversification. By combining fiscal discipline with a forward-looking investment strategy, the country is creating opportunities for the private sector and reinforcing its position in the regional economy.\"\n\nThis Growth Perspectives video is now available to view online, offering insights into Oman's evolving investment landscape and Ominvest's role in supporting the country's diversification and regional integration efforts.
