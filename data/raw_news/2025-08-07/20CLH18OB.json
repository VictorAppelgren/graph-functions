  "title": "NASA Head Heralds New Space Race to Build a Power Station on the Moon",
  "description": "This time it's against China, with NASA planning to get a fission reactor to the Moon by 2030.",
  "content": "The acting head of NASA, Sean Duffy, has made it clear that the United States is in a new space race\u2014but it's a little different this time. Although it still means getting human boots on the Moon, this space race is about building something more permanent and providing enough power for it. In its race against China to power up the lunar surface, NASA wants to get a fission reactor there by 2030.\n\n\"We're in a race to the Moon, in a race with China to the Moon. And to have a base on the Moon, we need energy,\" Duffy told reporters (via Space.com) when asked about his plan to build a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030. That would be a relatively small reactor, equivalent to the amount of power a standard US household uses in a few days. But it would be plenty for the activities they want to conduct on the Moon and an enormous upgrade over any potential solar array, especially since it would continue to operate in darkness.\n\nDuffy's statements make the ongoing space race somewhat official, though it has been evident from the past few years of activity that many countries\u2014China, India, and Russia included\u2014want to return to the Moon to establish a longer-lasting presence there. Russian landers keep crashing, but China has had more success of late.\n\nWhat is potentially more dramatic about Duffy's statement is that he seemed to suggest the Moon would be carved up, and the US wants the best part of it.\n\n\"There's a certain part of the Moon that everyone knows is the best,\" Duffy said. \"We have ice there. We have sunlight there. We want to get there first and claim that for America.\"\n\nSuch claims would be in violation of the Outer Space Treaty, which the US, Russia, and China are all parties to. The treaty stipulates that no country may use the lunar surface (or any stellar body) for anything but peaceful purposes, shall not claim any kind of ownership of any territory on those bodies, and bans the building of any kind of military bases or fortifications there.\n\nStill, space-aimed treaties force participants to respect the sanctity of nation-state hardware, so if the US were to land in certain locations and build anything there, other countries would have to respect that\u2014legally, at least. There's not much in the way of policing so far from Earth.\n\nWith the reactor plan still years away, the more immediate focus is on getting astronauts back on the Moon's surface. NASA's Artemis 3 mission aims to send six astronauts to the Moon no earlier than 2027; they'll remain there for six days. That's twice as long as Apollo astronauts remained, but it will also be the first time humans have landed on the Moon in over 50 years.",

      "text": "'We want to get there first and claim that for America': NASA chief explains push for nuclear reactor on the moon (video)\n\"If we're going to engage in the race to the moon and the race to Mars, we have to get our act together.\"\nNASA's interim administrator says his call for the United States to put a nuclear reactor on the lunar surface by 2030 is part of a new race to the moon.\nAgency chief Sean Duffy made the remarks during a press conference titled \"Unleashing American Drone Dominance\" hosted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (which Duffy also runs) on Aug. 5. According to Duffy, the reactor is part of a new space race, one with the ultimate goal of establishing a sustained human presence on the moon.\n\"We're in a race to the moon, in a race with China to the moon. And to have a base on the moon, we need energy,\" Duffy told reporters in response to a question about reports that surfaced earlier in the week about his ambitious directive to launch a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor to the moon by 2030. Such a reactor would produce roughly the same amount of energy as an average U.S. household uses every 3.5 days.\nDuffy went further than simply saying he wants the United States to beat China to the moon, however. The acting NASA chief said that he wants the U.S. to claim the \"best\" part of the moon for itself.\n\"There's a certain part of the moon that everyone knows is the best,\" Duffy said. \"We have ice there. We have sunlight there. We want to get there first and claim that for America.\"\nBecause the moon rotates so slowly, the lunar surface experiences two weeks of darkness at at a time. That means solar power won't be efficient to power a crewed outpost \u2014 most robotic lunar rovers can't even survive the lunar night.\nIn addition, NASA and other international space agencies are interested in establishing bases in the moon's south polar region, near permanently shadowed craters where water ice is thought to be abundant. But because these areas are permanently dark, solar power won't cut it. Having another source of energy production could enable human explorers to venture into new areas where the sun literally doesn't shine.\nDuffy was quick to point out that putting a nuclear reactor on the moon doesn't mean launching an active reactor atop a rocket. \"We're not launching this live. That's obviously \u2014 if you have any questions about that, no, we're not launching it live,\" Duffy pointed out.\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\nNASA plans on returning human explorers to the surface of the moon with its Artemis 3 mission, currently scheduled for no earlier than mid-2027. That mission will see a yet-to-be-named crew land near the moon's south pole for a six-day stay on the lunar surface \u2014 twice as long as the Apollo astronauts spent on the moon.\nThe interim NASA administrator went on to compare the two moon exploration programs, downplaying the public reach of his agency's own Artemis program. \"A lot of people don't know even what Artemis is. Everyone knew what Apollo was. We all knew. The whole world knew what Apollo was. We were going to the moon; Artemis is, we're going back.\"\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

Negotiated and drafted under the auspices of the United Nations, it was opened for signature in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union on 27 January 1967, entering into force on 10 October 1967. As of May 2025[update], 117 countries are parties to the treaty\u2014including all major spacefaring nations\u2014and another 22 are signatories.[1][5][6]\nThe Outer Space Treaty was spurred by the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in the 1950s, which could reach targets through outer space.[7] The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, in October 1957, followed by a subsequent arms race with the United States, hastened proposals to prohibit the use of outer space for military purposes. On 17 October 1963, the U.N. General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution prohibiting the introduction of weapons of mass destruction in outer space. Various proposals for an arms control treaty governing outer space were debated during a General Assembly session in December 1966, culminating in the drafting and adoption of the Outer Space Treaty the following January.[7]\nKey provisions of the Outer Space Treaty include prohibiting nuclear weapons in space; limiting the use of the Moon and all other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes; establishing that space shall be freely explored and used by all nations; and precluding any country from claiming sovereignty over outer space or any celestial body. Although it forbids establishing military bases, testing weapons and conducting military maneuvers on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, nor the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space.[8][9] From 1968 to 1984, the OST gave birth to four additional agreements: rules for activities on the Moon; liability for damages caused by spacecraft; the safe return of fallen astronauts; and the registration of space vehicles.[10]\nOST provided many practical uses and was the most important link in the chain of international legal arrangements for space from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. OST was at the heart of a 'network' of inter-state treaties and strategic power negotiations to achieve the best available conditions for nuclear weapons world security. The OST also declares that space is an area for free use and exploration by all and \"shall be the province of all mankind\". Drawing heavily from the Antarctic Treaty of 1961, the Outer Space Treaty likewise focuses on regulating certain activities and preventing unrestricted competition that could lead to conflict.[7] Consequently, it is largely silent or ambiguous on newly developed space activities such as lunar and asteroid mining.[11][12][13] Nevertheless, the Outer Space Treaty is the first and most foundational legal instrument of space law,[14] and its broader principles of promoting the civil and peaceful use of space continue to underpin multilateral initiatives in space, such as the International Space Station and the Artemis Program.[15][16]\nProvisions\n[edit]The Outer Space Treaty represents the basic legal framework of international space law. According to the U.N. Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), the core principles of the treaty are:[17]\n- the exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries and shall be the province of all mankind;\n- outer space shall be free for exploration and use by all states;\n- outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means;\n- states shall not place nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies or station them in outer space in any other manner;\n- the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes; prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations, and fortifications\n- astronauts shall be regarded as the envoys of mankind;\n- states shall be responsible for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities;\n- states shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects; and\n- states shall avoid harmful contamination of space and celestial bodies.\nAmong its principles, it bars states party to the treaty from placing weapons of mass destruction in Earth orbit, installing them on the Moon or any other celestial body, or otherwise stationing them in outer space. It specifically limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes, and expressly prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations, and fortifications (Article IV). However, the treaty does not prohibit the placement of conventional weapons in orbit, and thus some highly destructive attack tactics, such as kinetic bombardment, are still potentially allowable.[18] In addition, the treaty explicitly allows the use of military personnel and resources to support peaceful uses of space, mirroring a common practice permitted by the Antarctic Treaty regarding that continent. The treaty also states that the exploration of outer space shall be done to benefit all countries and that space shall be free for exploration and use by all the states.\nArticle II of the treaty explicitly forbids any government from \"appropriating\" a celestial body such as the Moon or a planet, whether by declaration, use, occupation, or \"any other means\".[19] However, the state that launches a space object, such as a satellite or space station, retains jurisdiction and control over that object;[20] by extension, a state is also liable for damages caused by its space object.[21]\nResponsibility for activities in space\n[edit]Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty deals with international responsibility, stating that \"the activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty\" and that States Party shall bear international responsibility for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities.\nAs a result of discussions arising from Project West Ford in 1963, a consultation clause was included in Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty: \"A State Party to the Treaty which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by another State Party in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, would cause potentially harmful interference with activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, may request consultation concerning the activity or experiment.\"[22][23]\nApplicability in the 21st century\n[edit]Being primarily an arms control treaty for the peaceful use of outer space, the Outer Space Treaty offers limited and ambiguous regulations to newer space activities such as lunar and asteroid mining.[11][13][24] It is therefore debated whether the extraction of resources falls within the prohibitive language of appropriation, or whether the use of such resources encompasses the commercial use and exploitation.[25]\nSeeking clearer guidelines, private U.S. companies lobbied the U.S. government, which in 2015 introduced the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015 legalizing space mining.[26] Similar national legislation to legalize the appropriation of extraterrestrial resources are now being introduced by other countries, including Luxembourg, Japan, China, India, and Russia.[11][24][27][28] In addition, the U.S. has led the creation of a series of bilateral agreements known as the Artemis Accords that seek to clarify a number of issue related to the Outer Space Treaty, including the use of space resources.[29] This has created some controversy regarding legal claims over the mining of celestial bodies for profit.[24][25]\n1976 Bogota Declaration\n[edit]The \"Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries\", also known as the \"Bogota Declaration\", was one of the few attempts to challenge the Outer Space Treaty. It was promulgated in 1976 by eight equatorial countries to assert sovereignty over those portions of the geostationary orbit that continuously lie over the signatory nations' territory.[30] These claims did not receive wider international support or recognition, and were subsequently abandoned.[31]\nInfluence on space law\n[edit]As the first international legal instrument concerning space, the Outer Space Treaty is considered the \"cornerstone\" of space law.[32][33] It was also the first major achievement of the United Nations in this area of law, following the adoption of the first U.N. General Assembly resolution on space in 1958,[34] and the first meeting of the U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) the subsequent year.[35]\nWithin roughly a decade of the treaty's entry into force, several other treaties were brokered by the U.N. to further develop the legal framework for activities in space:[33]\n- Rescue Agreement (1968)\n- Space Liability Convention (1972)\n- Registration Convention (1976)\n- Moon Treaty (1979)\nWith the exception of the Moon Treaty, to which only 18 nations are party, all other treaties on space law have been ratified by most major space-faring nations (namely those capable of orbital spaceflight).[36] COPUOS coordinates these treaties and other questions of space jurisdiction, aided by the U.N. Office for Outer Space Affairs.\nList of parties\n[edit]The Outer Space Treaty was opened for signature in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union on 27 January 1967, and entered into force on 10 October 1967. As of May 2025, 117 countries are parties to the treaty, while another 22 have signed the treaty but have not completed ratification.[1]\nMultiple dates indicate the different days in which states submitted their signature or deposition, which varied by location: (L) for London, (M) for Moscow, and (W) for Washington, D.C. Also indicated is whether the state became a party by way of signature and subsequent ratification, by accession to the treaty after it had closed for signature, or by succession of states after separation from some other party to the treaty.\n| State[1][2][3][4] | Signed | Deposited | Method |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Afghanistan |\n|\n|\nRatification |\n| Algeria | 27 Jan 1992 (W) | Accession

  "argos_summary": "NASA's acting head, Sean Duffy, announced a new space race focused on establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon, emphasizing the need for energy to support this goal. He outlined plans to deploy a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the lunar surface by 2030, which would provide a reliable power source, especially in areas that experience prolonged darkness. Duffy also indicated a desire for the U.S. to claim the most resource-rich regions of the Moon, which raises concerns about potential violations of the Outer Space Treaty that prohibits territorial claims in space.",
