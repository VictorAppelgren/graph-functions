  "title": "This M4 Mac Mini Is Small, Fast and Surprisingly Affordable",
  "description": "Of all the Apple products I've tried, the M4 Mac Mini delivers the most for my money.",
  "content": "I bought the M4 Mac Mini after reading CNET laptop expert Joshua Goldman's review of the tiny machine. I was looking for a computer that would increase my productivity and better organize my workflow. Since then, I've found it to be the best value for money among Apple's lineup. For less than $600, you can get a more powerful computer than the $999 MacBook Air.\n\nThe M4 Mac Mini, Apple's smallest computer, is an easy recommendation for me since it's one of CNET's picks for the best desktop computers of 2025. It's also our go-to for the best cheap desktop alternative to a MacBook or iMac.\n\nThe M4 Mac Mini has been my best tech investment this year\n\nI've been joyfully surprised by the M4 Mac Mini's value and how wonderful it's been for me to work from a desk. As a freelance remote worker, I travel at least 10 days every month, so I need a portable computer. Based on my lifestyle, I should be recommending the M4 MacBook Air. But it's the remaining 20 days of the month that I need to work harder than usual to put together new pitches, deliver approved stories, sort admin tasks, conduct research and more. All this requires immense organization and productivity, and the M4 Mac Mini has helped make my life easier.\n\nThis smallest of Apple's computers doesn't compromise on power. It features a 10-core GPU, 16GB of unified memory and a 256GB solid-state drive for storage. It's very powerful for a $599 machine and a bargain at $557. You likely won't be able to find similar reliability and power on a Windows machine for $500. I've tried and failed. And no, I'm not forgetting that the Mac Mini doesn't come with a display or a mouse and keyboard.\n\nI paired my M4 Mac Mini with a 27-inch LG UltraGear monitor (currently down to $239) and a Logitech mouse and keyboard combo -- all for under $200. The UltraGear's big screen is quite useful for research and multitasking, as well as watching movies.\n\nThe M4 Mac Mini can be excellent for home office and content creation needs. As CNET's Goldman wrote in his review, \"The Mini can fit in your hand and be everything from an everyday home office computer to a full-on professional content-creation machine -- and an easily portable one at that -- with support for up to three 6K-resolution displays.\"\n\nThe M4 Mac Mini was launched in November 2024, and it's often available at a discount. The small Apple computer offers superb value for remote workers and content creators. If you've been on the fence about getting a PC for home, I'd say pick up a M4 Mac Mini and see the difference for yourself.\n\nWant to check out the competition? We've rounded up the best desktop computer deals from HP, Lenovo, Dell and, naturally, Apple. And if this desktop doesn't suit your taste, you can check out the best laptop deals.",

      "text": "There are plenty of reasons to choose a desktop over a laptop, despite the latter\u2019s greater popularity. What you sacrifice in portability with a desktop you gain in other areas, including greater performance and value plus a greater ability to upgrade. Desktops come in all shapes and sizes, from small-form-factor (SFF) and all-in-one PCs to full-tower, high-powered gaming rigs. At CNET, we test and review all varieties of desktop computers and have been doing so for decades. Here are the best desktop PCs you can buy right now, starting with Apple\u2019s excellent iMac and also including our favorite gaming PCs in three budget classes.\nOur Picks\nWhat is the best desktop computer overall?\nThe best desktop for most people is Apple's new M4-based iMac. It integrates the display and offers everything you could want in an all-in-one. For a reasonable sum, the iMac provides a fantastic design centered on a high-resolution, 24-inch display powered by Apple's new M4 processor. Performance from Apple's latest silicon is, without a doubt, impressive on all counts. If you need more screen space than you'd get with a laptop, the 24-inch iMac gives you added room on which to work and play. Yet, with its compact design and power cable that magnetically pops into place, the iMac is easy to relocate from room to room. The computer is also available in seven fun colors with accessories to match.\nIf you're looking for a traditional tower desktop or a small-form-factor PC instead of an all-in-one like the iMac, then keep reading because we also have recommendations for those. We like a pair of Lenovo Legion Towers as lower-cost gaming PCs and an HP Omen system at the higher-end. HP also makes our favorite Windows-based all-in-one PC and two other Macs made the list.\nBest desktop computers of 2025\nPros\n- Elegant, compact design\n- 16GB RAM is new minimum without price increase\n- Nano-texture glass is effective in reducing glare and reflections\n- Sweet-sounding six-speaker set\nCons\n- Standard 256GB SSD is insufficient\n- Upgrades are pricey\n- Misses out on Wi-Fi 7\nThe iMac starts at $1,299 for a configuration that features an M4 chip with an eight-core CPU and eight-core GPU along with a 16-core Neural Engine for running Apple Intelligence, the company's suite of AI features. It also includes Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse, which are now USB-C. An upgraded M4 chip with two more CPU cores and two more GPU cores is available, and you can also choose to expand the memory and SSD capacity.\nWhy we like it\nWith the recent update to Apple\u2019s M4 processor, the iMac is a more capable machine, especially with its new minimum 16GB of RAM. It also supplies an improved Center Stage webcam. And if you plan to put it in a bright and sunny room, there\u2019s an optional nano-texture glass option that reduces glare and reflections.\nWho it's best for\nThe 24-inch iMac is especially well-suited as a family computer or if you want something other than a laptop to easily move from room to room. It's small enough to squeeze into tighter spaces, like a kitchen nook, but big enough to spread out your work, kick back and stream a movie or do some casual gaming.\nPros\n- Strong 1080p performance for the money\n- Lovely case design and lighting\n- Good base specifications\n- A few user upgrade options\nCons\n- Lacks dust filtration\n- Some unsightly components\n- Just one USB-C port\nThe Lenovo Legion Tower 5i Gen 8 serves as a simple and economical entry point with the right blend of components, a reasonable price and a classy exterior to get gamers on their way to gaming without all the fuss.\nWhy we like it\nAt a base price of $1,149 before the many little discounts Lenovo systems usually see, the Lenovo Legion Tower 5i Gen 8 is already a good bargain. For the money, you get a system that is ready to handle 1080p games with relative ease.\nWho it's best for\nThe Legion Tower 5i Gen 8 is a good starting point for anyone looking for an entry point into PC gaming. The base configuration is absolutely respectable for 1080p gaming. The Intel Core i5-14400F is no powerhouse but it carries enough weight to keep frame rates fast in games that demand more from the CPU and the RTX 4060 proved more than adequate.\nPros\n- Great 1080p and 4K performance\n- Some quick and easy upgrade options\n- Good looks and abundant lighting\n- Quiet operation alongside sustained speeds\nCons\n- Lenovo's nebulous pricing leaves some uncertainty\n- Could use more USB-C ports\n- Limited dust filtration\nWhile we like all-in-ones for their convenience, they're not easy to upgrade, if they can be at all. Gamers and other power users need a traditional tower PC for its upgradability. And while building your own PC can often be the most cost-effective way to get a powerful gaming PC, it comes with its own share of hurdles.\nWhy we like it\nLenovo's Legion Tower 7i Gen 8 is a prebuilt system that offers a respectable array of powerful hardware packed in, wired up and cooled for only a small premium over what you'd pay if you tried to DIY.\nWho it's best for\nGamers without unlimited budgets looking for an excellent machine with style and substance.\nPros\n- Classy, RGB-lit design\n- Effective cooling with dust filtration on the intakes\n- Strong 4K performance\nCons\n- Memory and storage upgrades are overpriced\n- AMD CPU is a nonsensical pairing\n- Unimpressive port selection, though good quantity\nThe HP Omen 35L is a stylish machine with a compact chassis packing in any number of components and dousing them all in RGB lighting. HP has done smart work with the case, with effective airflow and useful filtration.\nWhy we like it\nHP has style and performance on lock but choosing a smart configuration is key to getting a good value here. Our test configuration of that paired an AMD Ryzen 7 8700G CPU with RTX 4080 Super graphics is better suited for 4K gaming, but you have many options with the highly customizable Omen 35L to tailor it to your needs.\nWho it's best for\nGamers looking for a compact system with lots of bling. HP has gone all-in with the looks of the Omen 35L. Just about every aspect that could have RGB LEDs has RGB LEDs -- it all adds up to one hell of a light show and much of it is readily customizable in HP's Omen Gaming Hub. And it's not all sizzle and no steak. In testing, it offered consistent performance and was also surprisingly quiet under heavy load.\nPros\n- Ultracompact design\n- Strong performance\n- Ample amount of ports\n- Good starting price\n- Supports up to 3 displays\nCons\n- M4 Pro more than doubles base price\n- Potentially awkward power button placement\n- Only 256GB SSD in base model\nThe Mac Mini desktop is one of Apple's longest-standing product lines, dating to 2005 (in a pre-Intel version), a year before the first MacBook. Unlike Apple's MacBook Pro and Air laptops, or the iMac desktop, the Mini is designed to work behind the scenes, fitting into small spaces and pairing with your choice of display and input devices.\nWhy we like it\nThe surprising thing about the M4 Mac Mini isn't that Apple made it smaller; it's how much smaller it is than its M2-powered predecessor and how it can still have a more powerful M4 Pro chip in it and stay cool. And starting at $599, it remains the least expensive way to get a MacOS computer by a large margin.\nWho it's best for\nThe Mini can fit in your hand and be everything from an everyday home office computer to a full-on professional content-creation machine -- and an easily portable one at that -- with support for up to three 6K-resolution displays.\nBest Mac desktop\nApple Mac Studio (2024)\nPros\n- Really fast and quiet\n- Compact\n- Thunderbolt 5/USB4 added\n- HDMI 2.1\nCons\n- Can't upgrade memory\n- M4 Max model has two fewer Thunderbolt connections than the M3 Ultra and the front ports aren't USB 4\nThe Mac Pro has long been the top dog in Apple's computer lineup but starts at a whopping $6,999. By comparison, the mainstream Mac Studio is far more affordable, starting at a reasonable $1,999.\nWhy we like it\nThe baseline Mac Studio model features Apple's M4 Max processor, 36GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. The step-up $3,999 model bumps you up to an M3 Ultra chip while upping the RAM to 96GB and doubling the SSD capacity. Either model is essentially a Mac Mini on steroids and for anyone who doesn't want to shell out for a Mac Pro, it's a great pick for running creative-centric Mac apps, including animation, graphics, video-editing and audio-editing software.\nWho it's best for\nThe Mac Studio is a powerful compact desktop that, given you spend enough money on it, can do almost anything most people likely need it to do.\nPros\n- Huge, bright 4K display\n- Compact, flexible design\n- Strong overall performance\nCons\n- 60Hz display not a good match for RTX GPU\n- Fan noise is constant\n- No Thunderbolt 4 or USB4\nWhile Apple ditched its large-screen all-in-one years ago and sells only a compact, 24-inch iMac M4, HP has embraced a bigger-is-better ethos for its new line of OmniStudio X all-in-one PCs.\nWhy we like it\nThe OmniStudio X is available with a 27- or 31.5-inch display and the larger display is absolutely massive. With a 4K resolution, the picture is super sharp and bright. Despite the hulking, 31.5-inch panel, however, the OmniStudio X is fairly compact. And even with its compact and simple base, the design is sturdy and flexible.\nWho it's best for\nWith an Intel Core Ultra CPU and mobile GeForce RTX 4050 GPU, the OmniStudio X offers performance on the level of a budget gaming laptop. It's pricey but provides plenty of value as a big-screen all-in-one for work and entertainment.\nPros\n- Incredibly compact for a desktop\n- Fast, sustainable performance\n- Extra M.2 drive slot\nCons\n- GPU is a slower mobile version\n- Costs as much as high-end laptops\n- Underwhelming storage\nIf you're looking for a powerful gaming system that takes up almost no space, the Minisforum AtomMan G7 Ti might just be it.\nWhy we like it\nThis system packs powerful gaming laptop internals into an ultraslim tower PC form. Between its Intel HX-Series processor -- a desktop-class chip -- and its Nvidia RTX 4070 mobile GPU, it can keep up with office workloads and high frame-rate gaming. The CPU is properly fast, and the GPU does a decent job, although it slightly lags desktop RTX 4070 GPUs. Its clever, compact cooling system effectively keeps thermals in check.\nWho it's best for\nPeople short on space who want a powerful desktop.\nPros\n- Excellent gaming and office performance\n- Tame looks\n- Ample front I/O\n- Quiet operation\nCons\n- Proprietary motherboard limits upgrade options\n- No dust filtration\n- Lackluster storage speeds for the price\nDell\u2019s XPS 8960 is an Alienware in a business suit. Its tame looks let it blend in anywhere -- home office, den, guest room -- but has optional performance upgrades that allow it to run graphics tasks and games exceptionally well.\nWhy we like it\nThe case's tight confines might seem like they'd choke its mighty components but it runs demanding workloads and even 4K gaming, all without making too much noise or running into serious thermal throttling.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're looking for a quiet, high-powered PC without the usual gaming PC flash, this XPS is that sleeper.\nRecent additions\nThe most recent addition to our best desktops list is Apple's latest Mac Studio. The new M4 Max model takes the place of the previous M2 Max model. Maxed out, the Mac Studio is likely the most powerful Mac you can get at the moment, at least until Apple upgrades the Mac Pro. Now it supports Thunderbolt 5 but it's mostly unchanged from the model that shipped in 2023, which was mostly unchanged from the original. It remains a well-designed compact desktop for Mac upgrades and one of the best desktops in general.\nBest desktops compared\nSee how our favorite desktops measure up.\n| CPU tested | GPU tested | RAM tested | Storage tested | Operating system | |\n| Apple iMac M4 | Apple M4 10-core | Apple M4 10-core | 24GB | 1TB | MacOS Sequoia |\n| Lenovo Legion Tower 5i Gen 8 | Intel Core i5-14400F | Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 | 16GB | 1TB | Windows 11 Home |\n| Lenovo Legion Tower 7i Gen 8 | Intel Core i9-14900KF | Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super | 32GB | 1TB | Windows 11 Home |\n| HP Omen 35L | AMD Ryzen 7 8700G | Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super | 64GB | 2 x 2TB SSD, 2TB SATA HDD | Windows 11 Pro |\n| Apple Mac Mini M4 | Apple M4 10-core | Apple M4 10-core | 16GB | 512GB | MacOS Sequoia |\n| Apple Mac Studio | Apple M4 Max 16-core | Apple M4 Max 40-core | 128GB | 1TB | MacOS Sequoia |\n| HP OmniStudio X | Intel Core Ultra 7 155H | Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 | 32GB | 1TB | Windows 11 Home |\n| Minisforum AtomMan G7 Ti | Intel Core i9-14900HX | Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 | 32GB | 1TB | Windows 11 Home |\n| Dell XPS 8960 | Intel Core i7-14700K | Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super | 32GB | 1TB | Windows 11 Home |\nOther desktops we've tested\nLenovo LOQ Tower Gaming Desktop: The LOQ Tower 17IRR9 borrows a lot from the Legion Tower 5i and packs it into a cheaper package but with some sacrifices.\nAlienware Aurora R16 Desktop: It offers good performance, but you should probably wait for Nvidia's next-gen GPUs.\nLenovo IdeaCentre AIO 27: This budget all-in-one PC is a good budget-friendly home office option and its extra screen space is welcomed but the low-resolution panel makes it much less attractive.\nDell Inspiron 24 All-in-One 5430: It costs hundreds less than the cheapest iMac but its design and build quality are also miles away from what you get with Apple's all-in-one.\nHow we test desktops\nThe review process for desktops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of objective and subjective judgments.\nWe test all desktops with a core set of benchmarks, including Primate Labs Geekbench 6, Cinebench R23, PCMark 10, a variety of 3DMark benchmarks (whichever can run on the desktop), UL Procyon Photo and Video (where supported), and our own battery life test. If a desktop is intended for gaming, we'll also run benchmarks from Guardians of the Galaxy, The Rift Breaker (CPU and GPU) and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.\nFor the hands-on, the reviewer uses it for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price.\nThe list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on our page on how we test computers.\nFactors to consider when buying a desktop computer\nPrice\nYou can find a good PC tower from brands like Acer, Asus, Dell or HP for between $500 and $600 that will prove useful for years for general use. The specs we'd suggest for a basic Windows 11 machine:\n- Intel Core i5 (13th- or 14th-gen) or AMD Ryzen 5 (7000 or 8000 series)\n- Default integrated graphics (such as Intel Iris or Arc or baseline AMD Radeon)\n- 16GB of RAM or more\n- 512GB or larger NVMe SSD drive\n- Four or more USB 3.2 or 4.0 ports with USB-C and USB-A formats (at least one or two on the front)\n- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless\n- At least one PCI-E (x16) expansion slot (for adding a video card)\nDo you want to do some PC gaming, or do you spend time editing photos or videos? You'll want to level up the configuration with more RAM and better graphics options. Expect price points to be between $800 and $1,200 (or even more) if you go for a more bleeding-edge video card.\n- Nvidia RTX or AMD Radeon RX graphics card (GPU)\n- 16GB of RAM or more\n- 450-watt (or more) power supply\nOperating system\nMicrosoft Windows and Apple's MacOS do basically the same things but they do them differently. Unless there's an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. Most desktops run Microsoft Windows while Apple's iMac, Mac Mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro desktops feature Apple's MacOS. There is also the odd Chromebox offering based on Google's ChromeOS. A Chromebox is easier to use and usually cheaper than a Windows PC or Mac but can't run Windows or Mac software.\nProcessor\nThe processor, aka the CPU, is the brain of a desktop. Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows desktops. Both offer a staggering selection of processors. You can head to Intel's or AMD's sites for explanations so you get the performance you want. Intel's current lineup is its 13th generation of Core chips, with 14th-gen processors expected in early 2024. AMD's current desktop processor is its Ryzen 7000 series. Generally speaking, though, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better the performance will be.\nApple makes its own chips for Macs, which makes things slightly more straightforward. The iMac and Mac Mini feature Apple's latest M4 processor. The Mac Studio features either an M2 Max or M2 Ultra, while the Mac Pro is based on the M2 Ultra. Again, generally speaking, the more cores it has, the better the performance.\nGraphics\nThe graphics processor (GPU) handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. For Macs, Apple's M series processors integrate the GPU. For Windows desktops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated (iGPU) or discrete (dGPU). As the names imply, an iGPU is part of the CPU package, while a dGPU is a separate chip with dedicated memory (VRAM) that it communicates with directly, making it faster than sharing memory with the CPU.\nBecause the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it's constrained by the limits of those. It allows for smaller desktops such as an all-in-one or SFF PC but doesn't perform nearly as well as a dGPU. In fact, there are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. Most productivity software, video streaming, web browsing and other nonspecialized apps will run fine on an iGPU.\nFor power-hungry graphics needs, like video editing, gaming and streaming, design and so on, you'll need a dGPU. Only two real companies make them: Nvidia and AMD, although Intel offers some based on the Xe-branded (or the older UHD Graphics branding) iGPU technology in its CPUs.\nMemory\nFor memory, we highly recommend a minimum of 16GB of RAM. RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. Some lower-end models supply only 8GB, which, in conjunction with a slower disk, can make for a frustratingly slow Windows experience.\nTower PCs will usually have free internal slots for adding more sticks of RAM, but all-in-ones and SFF PCs may not. Even if they do, those DIMM slots could be difficult to access.\nStorage\nYou may still find a cheaper hard drive in a budget desktop and larger hard drives in gaming PCs, but faster solid-state drives (SSDs) have all but replaced hard drives. They can make a big difference in performance. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper desktops typically have slower drives. If your PC has only 8GB of RAM, it may end up switching to that drive and the system may slow down quickly while you're working.\nGet what you can afford, but we recommend a minimum of 512GB for a desktop for most users. For storing large media or game libraries, we suggest 1TB or more. If you need to go with a smaller drive, you can usually add a second internal drive to a tower PC. For all-in-ones and SFF PCs, an external drive or cloud storage is usually the easier choice to bolster a small internal drive.\nDisplay\nAn all-in-one integrates the display with the computer's components placed not in a tower or small-form-factor enclosure but behind the display or in its base. The trade-off for this space-saving, streamlined design is fewer options for upgrades. For the display, you'll want a large screen with good resolution. The sweet spots we'd suggest are:\n- 24 inches at 1,920x1,080 pixels (aka 2K or 1080p)\n- 27 inches at 2,560x1,440 pixels (aka 1440p)\n- 32 inches at 3,840x2,160 pixels (aka 4K)"

      "text": "Pros\n- Ultracompact design\n- Strong performance\n- Ample amount of ports\n- Good starting price\n- Supports up to 3 displays\nCons\n- M4 Pro more than doubles base price\n- Potentially awkward power button placement\n- Only 256GB SSD in base model\nThe surprising thing about the M4 Mac Mini isn't that Apple made it smaller; it's how much smaller it is than its M2-powered predecessor and how it can still have a more powerful M4 Pro chip in it and stay cool. The Mini can fit in your hand and be everything from an everyday home office computer to a full-on professional content-creation machine -- and an easily portable one at that -- with support for up to three 6K-resolution displays. True, there's a sizable price difference between the M4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini, but even the $799 M4 model I tested is strong enough for media creation as well as Apple Intelligence, the company's suite of AI features.\nApple Mac Mini M4 Specs\n| Price as reviewed | $799 |\n|---|---|\n| CPU | 4.4GHz M4 (4 performance cores, 6 efficiency cores) |\n| Memory | 16GB LPDDR5 unified memory |\n| Graphics | Integrated GPU (10 core) |\n| Storage | 512GB SSD |\n| Ports | Front: USB-C (x2, up to 10Gbps), 3.5mm headphone jack; rear: USB-C Thunderbolt 4 (x3, up to 40Gb/s), HDMI out, Gigabit Ethernet, power input |\n| Networking | Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3 |\n| Operating system | MacOS 15.1 |\nMacOS Sequoia, Apple Intelligence and the Mini\nThe M4 Mac Mini arrived at the same time as the latest version of its operating system, MacOS 15.1 Sequoia, and Apple Intelligence, the company's personal, private AI designed to help you with everyday tasks (and part of the reason all new Macs now have at least 16GB of unified memory).\nSequoia has some interesting new tools that are worth exploring, and they all worked well on the Mini. For most people, iPhone Mirroring is likely to be the most interesting. As the name implies, it puts your iPhone on your display, giving you access to anything on it. You can, for example, open up a social app and post something or check notifications. My iPhone is for work, so I used mirroring to read and reply to email and Slack messages while I worked on this review on the Mac Mini. It worked fluidly, but navigating a touchscreen device without a touchscreen is not the best experience.\nAs for Apple Intelligence on the Mac Mini, it seems like a perfect pairing, especially if you're considering it for home office use. A lot of the tools are geared toward helping you get through work or tackle an endless to-do list faster. Things like summarizing emails and then generating replies (it can do the same with Messages), finding a device setting using natural language with Siri or using the Notes app to record and transcribe audio, and then Apple Intelligence will summarize it for you.\nTwo of my favorite features, though, are in the Photos app. One is Clean up, which lets you quickly remove things like people or objects from photos. It's similar to AI tools from Google, Adobe and others, and Apple's is pretty good with its fixes but not always perfect (which is the case with the competition too).\nThe other tool is natural language search. Simply type in what you're looking for and the search can drill down and find it. For example, I take a lot of photos of recipes, including cocktails. So I searched for \"cocktails\" and found pictures of drinks and people drinking. But adding \"recipe\" to the search terms, and finally \"whiskey,\" brought up the image I was hunting for. And this is all without me ever tagging a single photo with any info. If you're more organized than me and assign names to people, you can really drill down.\nAn Apple bargain?\nThe base model M4 Mac Mini is $599, which is kind of a deal. It features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, 16GB of unified memory and a 256GB solid-state drive for storage. The version I tested is $799, and the only difference is the storage capacity: 512GB. Bumping up to $999 increases memory to 24GB and 512GB storage. Essentially, every memory or storage bump adds $200 to the base price, with the M4 configurations maxing out at 32GB of memory and 2TB of storage for $1,799.\nIn general, your money is best spent on increasing memory, not storage, especially at $200 a pop. Although the 256GB SSD is a paltry amount, with three high-speed Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports (or even faster Thunderbolt 5 if you get the M4 Pro chip), adding more speedy external storage as needed is a better (and cheaper) option.\nNow, in addition to extra memory and storage, you can also upgrade to two M4 Pro chips. For $1,399, you'll get a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of memory and a 512GB SSD. An additional $200 gets you an M4 Pro with a 14-core CPU. Memory with the M4 Pro goes up to 64GB, and storage is 8TB. Another $100 puts in a 10-gigabit Ethernet jack for network-attached storage. Fully loaded, it's $4,699, which is a lot, but you're getting a lot. This is a long way of saying the M4 Mac Mini can be as powerful as you need it to be as long as you're willing to pay for it.\nIt's worth noting that this is the first Mac Mini to support connecting to up to three displays. If you get an M4 Pro model with Thunderbolt 5 ports, it allows for transfer speeds of up to 120Gbps and the ability to connect up to three displays up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt or its HDMI out. The standard M4 can also do three displays, but only two are up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt. The third can have a resolution of up to 5K at 60Hz via Thunderbolt or 4K at 60Hz over HDMI out.\nIs the Mac Mini good for gaming?\nAfter the M4 Mac Mini was announced, there was much chatter about how it could be a game console. Apple has certainly pushed the Mini for gaming in the past and is doing more so now. It's only about 1.5 inches larger than the Apple TV 4K streamer -- certainly tiny enough to live in or on the smallest of TV stands.\nIn my testing, the M4 Mini was fine for casual gaming, especially if you lean toward more mobile-friendly indie games. With more graphically demanding titles, you'll likely have to dial back to Medium on graphics settings and play at 1440p or 1080p for a more enjoyable experience. On Baldur's Gate 3, I set it to Ultra and it was not smooth, which is to be expected. No doubt bumping up to the M4 Pro or even going above the 16GB of memory in my Mini would address that.\nThe overwhelming issue is if you're looking for AAA games, you'll only really find older ones. The game Control, which Apple uses for demos of hardware-accelerated ray-traced reflections, is from 2019. Another, the Myst remake, is from 2021. So yes, if you want to play games, the M4 Mac Mini is up for it. But you just might not find all the games you want to play and you'll probably need to spend at least $999 for more graphics-intensive titles.\nAbout the power button\nFor all of Apple's design prowess, every once in a while, it makes a choice that leaves us scratching our heads. The M4 Mac Mini is remarkably small and certainly a design feat, especially given its high-performance potential. But for some reason, perhaps because of its compactness or simply to keep it hidden, Apple put the Mini's power button on the bottom of the computer's rear-left side. That means to power it on and off, you'll need to lift it up some.\nIt's not a huge hardship to lift the rear, but it's nonetheless unusual placement and potentially a bit of a pain if it is connected to three displays. It's also going to make mounting it to the back of a display or TV a little trickier. The thing is, the Mac Mini is so small and the back is so filled with ports, that it doesn't really leave a good place for a button.\nIs the M4 Mac Mini worth getting?\nIf you're looking for a home office computer, a home entertainment machine or a system for live streaming, podcasting or other content creation, the M4 Mac Mini can do all that. You'll get the best of what MacOS Sequoia and Apple Intelligence have to offer in a tiny box and at a reasonable starting price. The price ratchets up quickly from there, though. The good news is the M4 seems like it can handle quite a bit (we're still wrapping up our benchmark testing of it), so definitely consider just upping the amount of memory before rushing to the $1,399 M4 Pro, unless you need extra graphics performance and better display support. Also, for students and families, I would recommend the M4 iMac because the all-in-one design is easier to manage."

      "text": "Pros\n- Big performance gains from M1, Intel MacBook Airs\n- Great design, features\n- Support for two external displays simultaneously with MacBook display\n- 12-megapixel Center Stage camera\nCons\n- 256GB SSD might fill up fast\n- Expensive upgrades\nWhat continues to amaze me about the M-series MacBook Airs is that they crank out high-level performance and long battery life, yet the body is completely fanless. What's even more incredible is that the performance gets better year after year. So, while not too much has changed from the last-gen M3 MacBook Air, for the M4 Air, you'll still get a lot of computing power and upwards of 15 hours of battery life in a thin, light and quiet body making it one of the best laptops of 2025. And now it comes in a light metallic blue.\nThe new sky blue color is really more silver than blue to my eyes. It's a nice subtle color, so you should be happy if you're just looking for something slightly different. The thing is, I consider the Air the MacBook equivalent to the iMac and I'm not sure why Apple didn't go with one or more of the seven colors it uses for its all-in-one desktop. Maybe with the next full redesign, we'll get at least one of the iMac's brilliant colors.\nThe biggest change for the 2025 MacBook Air is the jump from Apple's M3 silicon to the M4, which was already added to the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Mini last year. The base 13-inch M4 MacBook Air has a 10-core CPU and eight-core GPU, while the 15-inch has an upgraded 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. Both start with 16GB of unified memory and 256GB of storage. Both sizes cost $100 less than the M3 models: $999 for the 13-inch Air and $1,199 for the 15-inch.\nApple MacBook Air (M4, 13-inch, 2025)\n| Price as reviewed | $999; \u00a3999; AU$1,699 |\n|---|---|\n| Display size/resolution | 13.6-inch, 2,560x1,664-pixel, LED-backlit IPS display, 500 nits brightness |\n| CPU | 10\u2011core CPU with 4 performance cores |\n| Memory | 16GB unified memory |\n| Graphics | Integrated 8\u2011core GPU |\n| Storage | Apple 256GB SSD |\n| Networking | Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) Bluetooth 5.3 |\n| Operating system | Apple MacOS Sequoia 15.3 |\nAn actual price drop is a pleasant surprise, but unsurprisingly, Apple didn't lower prices on upgrades to memory and storage. This means that if you want to upgrade to a 512GB solid-state drive, you'll need to pay an additional $200, and the same goes for increasing the memory. Since the Air configurations start with 16GB of memory, you're in pretty good shape there, but unless you store most stuff in the cloud or an external drive, you'll likely want to at least upgrade storage.\nFaster performance, same long battery life\nAgain, performance and battery life continue to be impressive. You can see the benchmark test results at the end of this review, but the short of it is that the M4's performance is an improvement on the M3's. It's not a big leap, but it's not nonexistent either, and it is in line with the CPU performance of a couple of Snapdragon X Elite Copilot Plus PCs we've reviewed.\nMost importantly, it's a sizeable improvement over the M1 MacBook Air (as was the M3), so if you have an older M1 Air or an Intel-based Air and it's not feeling snappy anymore, you have good reason to upgrade to an M3 or M4 MacBook Air.\nThe graphics performance is also better than that of the Snapdragon X Elite laptops, so if you're looking for something thin and light for photo and video editing or even some gaming, the M4 MacBook Air can handle it. You might need to dial back on the graphics settings on demanding games, and without fans, the Air does heat up, but you can definitely play less graphics-intensive titles and mobile games.\nAs for battery life, I got roughly 15 hours on our streaming video rundown test, which is more or less what I expected based on the M3 MacBook Air I tested last year. Battery life will depend on what you're doing, the screen brightness, audio level, etc., but with basic use, you'll have no problem getting through a workday.\nA few new features, too\nThe M4 MacBook Air's body is the same as its predecessor, which is generally fine: streamlined, clean and attractive. However, there are a few things I'm not a fan of, like the camera notch in the display and the fact that both USB-C ports and the MagSafe charging connector are lumped together on the left, which means all your charging options are on one side.\nApple dropped in a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera with Desk View support for the webcam. Center Stage tracks you and others in the camera frame so you stay centered or it makes room for everyone. Desk View gives you a second top-down view of the area in front of the laptop's keyboard, perfect for demonstrations. It's a bit distorted and low-res, but it works, and it's hard to argue with that. It would be nice if Apple added Face ID and a proximity sensor when it does the next full overhaul of its MacBooks. That would allow you to quickly lock and unlock a MacBook just as you would an iPhone. For now, the Touch ID on the power button is sufficient.\nApple upgraded the USB-C ports on the M4 MacBook Air from USB 4 to Thunderbolt 4. With these ports, the MacBook Air can now connect and extend to up to two 6K external monitors and the built-in Liquid Retina display simultaneously. That gives you up to three displays to work on, plus the use of the keyboard, trackpad and Touch ID.\nOverall, the M4 MacBook Air is a good, if minor, update to an already fantastic laptop, and it has a lower price to boot. If you have an M3 Air or even an M2 Air, there are some reasons to upgrade, like the better camera and external display support. But the performance difference is modest.\nOn the other hand, for Intel and M1 MacBook Air owners, the performance gap is sizeable enough that upgrading is definitely worth your while. Something to keep in mind, too, is that while the M3 MacBook Air is going away, you might be able to pick one of those up at a deep enough discount, new or refurbished, to make you forget about the features you're not getting with the M4. Another thing: The M4 Mac Mini is as powerful as the M4 MacBook Air and starts at $600. If you don't need a laptop's mobility (the Mini is certainly small enough for travel, though), it's a great option for less.\nThe review process for laptops, desktops, tablets and other computerlike devices consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our expert reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments.\nThe list of benchmarking software we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve.
