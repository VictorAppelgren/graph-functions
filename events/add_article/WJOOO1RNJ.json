      "summary": "Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup in September, with rumors pointing to new color options, a slimmer iPhone 17 Air, and a titanium frame for the Air. Leaks suggest the Pro models will switch from titanium to aluminum and feature an expanded camera island, while the standard models may see a 120Hz display and higher storage starts at 256GB. Pricing is likely to rise by about $50 across the range to offset rising component costs and tariffs, and the event may also showcase new Apple Watch, AirPods, and iOS 26 features.",
