      "feedback": "This draft covers the right breadth but needs a tighter, testable 0–3 week causal chain and sharper numbers to lift it to world-class quality. Actionable edits: (1) tighten the immediate drivers and causal flow by anchoring to tariff dynamics (tariffs topping 10% and front‑loaded imports) and to inflation/policy data, then tie those into the Fed’s likely reaction—use 0J41Q7KTX and 04M4L5BHA to show that wholesale inflation bounced 0.9% m/m while core inflation remains above target, shaping a Fed path that could still hinge on incoming data; (2) structure 0–3 week horizon explicitly around three near-term catalysts: tariff news/settlements (including de minimis/exemption developments), the September Fed decision path, and a fresh data volley (PPI/CPI/jobs) with explicit levels to watch; (3) render the reaction function as a concrete conditional: base case for a data‑dependent 1–2 week rally only if inflation pressures cool or policy relief is credible; otherwise expect choppiness or a pause/risk-off on hotter prints; (4) specify observable thresholds and invalidation points: Fed cut in Sept becomes less likely if PPI/CPI core prints stay sticky or rise; tariff escalations or new exemptions change the price pass‑through dynamics; China’s July slowdown + policy signals (04M4L5BHA, YVP1ZG37H) shift global growth and commodity demand; Nvidia/AMD’s 15% China tax channel into pricing and supply chains (0BHR62KGO) could alter risk assets; (5) quantify with concrete numbers from the sources: tariffs >10% share of imports; June trade deficit about $692.15 billion and exports share near 37%; wholesale PPI +0.9% MoM and YoY 3.3%; CPI +2.7% YoY; Open the door to the de minimis rule on Aug. 29 and the 15% chip tax; (6) prune extraneous tech‑race details (GPT‑5, Grok) to keep focus on macro transmission and policy; (7) improve coverage consistency by balancing conflicts: Bloomberg China long‑game framing (YVP1ZG37H) with the near‑term tariff‑driven inflation signal (04M4L5BHA) and the US policy stance (0J41Q7KTX); (8) add a succinct two‑ or three‑scenario table in prose (base, bullish, bearish) with triggers and probability weights to anchor the narrative; (9) ensure all citations refer only to IDs present in SOURCE MATERIAL and reconcile any contradictory strands by dating each data point and labeling its source provenance clearly; (10) deliver a crisp, single‑pass synthesis that ends with three monitoring cues for the next data release (Fed data volley, tariff news, and China policy signaling).",
