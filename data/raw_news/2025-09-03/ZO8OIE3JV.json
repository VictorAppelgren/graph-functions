  "title": "PayPal, Venmo Users Can Get Perplexity Pro, Comet Browser Access for Free",
  "description": "Link your PayPal account to Perplexity and skip the $20-per-month Perplexity Pro fee for a year.",
  "content": "Don't miss out on our latest stories. as a preferred source on Google.\n\nPayPal and Venmo are giving users a year of Perplexity Pro and access to the Comet AI browser.\n\nPerplexity Pro usually costs $20 per month or $200 per year for unlimited searches, advanced AI models, image generation, extended upload limits, exclusive support channels, and more.\n\nThe Comet AI browser , on the other hand, is a Chromium-based browser packed with AI features. It features an \"Assistant\" button at the top that you can click to receive AI summaries or ask follow-up questions about any web page you visit. It's also got agentic functions. You can, for example, provide prompts to clear out your Gmail spam folder or add stuff to your Instacart.\n\nHowever, access to the browser is currently limited to users invited by Perplexity or those paying for the $200-per-month Perplexity Max subscription. With Venmo and PayPal's new offer, though, you can unlock access to the browser and also get 12 months of free Perplexity Pro.\n\nTo claim the offer, users need to link their PayPal or Venmo account with Perplexity. They can do so from the respective apps or from a dedicated page on Perplexity's website.\n\nThe offer is valid through Dec. 31 for users who have never subscribed to Perplexity Pro before. It can be redeemed only once from a PayPal or Venmo account. If your PayPal account was created before Sept. 1, you get immediate access. Otherwise, you'll have to wait for 30 days.\n\nAlongside these perks, PayPal also announced the rollout of its new Subscriptions hub. In the US, customers will be able to track and manage all their recurring payments and see new offers and bundles here. Through Sept. 5, customers who link and pay for three subscriptions within the hub will get $50 cash back.",
