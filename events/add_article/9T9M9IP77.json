      "title": "Federal judge casts doubt on Bondi's move to sideline DC police leadership",
      "summary": "Judge Ana Reyes ordered the Trump administration and the District of Columbia to negotiate a deal limiting the DEA head Terry Cole’s authority over the Metropolitan Police Department, or face a temporary restraining order. The ruling comes after D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to block the federal takeover, arguing it violates the Home Rule Act and the district’s right to self‑governance. While the federal takeover remains in place for 30 days, Cole must now act through Mayor Muriel Bowser, who must defer to him for directives. Protesters and critics argue the administration’s “crime emergency” is unfounded, citing declining violent crime statistics. The judge will address broader legal questions in a hearing next week.",
