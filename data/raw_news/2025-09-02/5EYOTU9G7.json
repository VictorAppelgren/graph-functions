(NYSE: KRO) (the \u201cCompany\u201d) announced today that it is seeking to raise debt capital through a private offering of \u20ac75 million aggregate principal amount of additional 9.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kronos International, Inc. (\u201cKII\u201d). The Notes are being offered as additional notes to the existing \u20ac351,174,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 that KII issued on February 12, 2024 and July 30, 2024 (the \u201cExisting Notes\u201d). Other than with respect to the date of issuance and issue price, the Notes will have the same terms as the Existing Notes. The Notes will be maintained under the same ISIN and Common Code numbers as the Existing Notes, except that the Notes issued pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), will trade separately under different ISIN and Common Code numbers until 40 days after the issue date of the Notes, but thereafter, the Notes issued pursuant to Regulation S will be maintained under the same ISIN and Common Code numbers as the Existing Notes issued pursuant to Regulation S.\n\nThe Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior basis by the Company and each of its direct and indirect domestic, wholly-owned subsidiaries (other than the Issuer, the \u201cGuarantors\u201d), subject to certain exceptions and secured by first-priority security interests in certain assets of the Company and the Guarantors.\n\nThe completion of the offering depends on several factors, including market conditions. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the offering, after payment of fees and expenses, to pay amounts due under its 3.75% Senior Secured Notes due September 15, 2025 at maturity (or, alternatively, to repay any amounts the Company may draw under its global revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo to repay such notes at maturity). The Company intends to use any remaining net proceeds for its general corporate purposes.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Notes nor shall there be any sales of the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful without registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. This notice is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135c under the Securities Act.\n\nThe Notes and related guarantees subject to the private placement have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons (within the meaning of Regulation S) outside the U.S. that are not \u201cretail investors\u201d residing in a member state of the EEA or the UK. The Notes and related guarantees may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to registration under or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.",
