      "feedback": "Strong world‑class feedback would reframe the piece as a formal, multi‑year regime map anchored to explicit first‑principles and testable catalysts, then prune unsupported claims and sharpen the quantitative discipline. Specifically, replace the current narrative with: (1) a concise invariant framework drawing on the sources: structural long‑horizon costs (retirement/long‑term care, inflation, taxes on Social Security/withdrawals) as persistent anchors, plus policy‑driven price dynamics (tariffs and energy policy) that shape real purchasing power and capex cycles; cite YVQU6QCY4 for long‑horizon retirement costs, 4 for taxes/Social Security framing, and PA0F5MLE5 for tariff‑driven power and the embedded DCF inputs; (2) a regimes/transition map with at least three regimes and explicit transition triggers: baseline/slow‑growth with inflation near target, tariff/shock episodes raising price levels (tariff impact ~$3,800/household/year per Yale analysis cited in PA0F5MLE5), and a midstream energy capex cycle driven by NEPA‑like streamlining and “national energy emergency” language (cite the tariff article and the energy policy framing where available); (3) a tight causal chain from anchors to market pricing: higher long‑horizon costs elevate precautionary saving (and 3–6 month emergency buffers, 15% of income as a rule of thumb) and alter consumption/investment mix, which reweights sector valuations (e.g., growth/defensive pockets and energy/infrastructure plays) and external multipliers; reference the explicit saving and budgeting norms (15%, 3–6 months) and the Morningstar/Morningstar‑like risk guidance (3.7% safe withdrawal rate from 6 Key Signs You’ll Run Out of Retirement Funds Too Early) from 11; (cite YVQU6QCY4, 11, 9, PA0F5MLE5, 4BFO8TB1K). (4) Turn the valuation threads into testable base cases: link AVOL’s two‑stage DCF inputs (fair value CHF72.06, cost of equity 8.9%, 0.4% terminal‑growth proxy) to a concrete long‑horizon thesis and show how a modest +/− inflation regime or a capex cycle shock would shift that gap (PA0F5MLE5; 4). Do the same for Constellium by grounding the “solid EBITDA growth”/“fairly valued” stance in the EV/EBITDA growth trajectory and the stated valuation narrative (4BFO8TB1K). (5) Clarify the base case, risks, and what to watch with concrete, source‑backed triggers: if long‑horizon healthcare costs outpace inflation or if tariffs widen the price gap beyond ~$3.8k/year, if the energy capex cycle accelerates or disappoints, and if AVOL/Constellium earnings trajectories miss their growth anchors; monitor CPI/real income trends, Social Security tax policy, and the evolution of AVOL’s ROCE trajectory as the primary inflection points (cite 9, 11, PA0F5MLE5, 4BFO8TB1K, 4). (6) Tighten citation integrity and coverage: attach after each claim the exact IDs (YVQU6QCY4 for retirement costs; 4 for single‑retiree budgeting/tax considerations; PA0F5MLE5 for tariff/DCF inputs and fair value; 4BFO8TB1K for Constellium; 11 for withdrawal rates; 9 for long‑horizon costs and estate/tax considerations) and avoid importing concepts not present in the sources (e.g., BoP/terms‑of‑trade or generic sector hype). (7) Improve numerical discipline overall: insert the explicit numbers the sources provide (3–6 months emergency fund, 15% savings, ~$3,800 per year tariff hit, $115k/year long‑term care, 3.7% safe withdrawal, AVOL’s CHF72.06 fair value with 8.9% cost of equity and 0.4% terminal growth, Constellium’s EBITDA/trend assertions) and show sensitivity to small changes in these inputs. This will produce a coherent, regime‑driven, number‑anchored analysis with a transparent transmission from long‑horizon anchors to market pricing.",
