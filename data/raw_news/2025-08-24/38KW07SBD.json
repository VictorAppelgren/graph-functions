  "content": "SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia will seek to ratify a landmark security and economic treaty with its tiny neighbour Nauru by next month, Australian officials said on Monday, amid concern a A$1 billion (US$648.85 million) Chinese investment proposal could breach its provisions.\n\nNauru, with a population of 12,000, announced an investment deal with the little-known China Rural Revitalization and Development Corp earlier this month.\n\nThe leaders of Nauru and Australia announced a treaty in December in which Australia pledged A$100 million in budget support and A$40 million for security, and gained a veto over Chinese involvement in critical areas including Nauru's security, banking, and telecommunications.\n\nThe treaty has been ratified by Nauru, but not Australia, because its parliament was dissolved for months for a national election.\n\n\"It's important that we move forward and ratify as quickly as possible,\" Mark Tattersall, an official with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, told an Australian parliament committee examining the treaty on Monday.\n\nAn earlier press release from Nauru's government said the Chinese company would develop the renewable energy, phosphate industry, fisheries, water, agriculture, transportation and health sectors.\n\nAustralian diplomats had asked China and Nauru about the deal because of concern it could trigger provisions in Australia's security treaty, Tattersall said.\n\nNauru replied saying the Chinese investment had not yet been considered by Nauru's cabinet, he said.\n\n\"We have heard the details of the arrangement - it does appear as though actual implementation of any further investment in Nauru is potentially some time off,\" he added.\n\nAustralia has said it wants to announce the ratification of the Nauru treaty at a meeting of Pacific Island leaders next month, which China will not attend.\n\nAustralian concern about Beijing's ambitions in the Pacific Islands grew after the Solomon Islands signed a security deal with China in 2022, and China test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile with a dummy warhead into the Pacific last year.\n\nChina has said its presence in the Pacific is focused on building infrastructure to improve people's lives.",

Nauru has signed a deal with China Rural Revitalization and Development Corp to invest in sectors such as renewable energy and fisheries, while the treaty grants Australia a veto over Chinese involvement in critical areas. The treaty, already ratified by Nauru, has been delayed in Australia due to a parliamentary dissolution for elections. Australia aims to announce ratification at a Pacific Island leaders meeting, where China will not attend, amid growing worry over Beijing\u2019s expanding influence in the region.",
