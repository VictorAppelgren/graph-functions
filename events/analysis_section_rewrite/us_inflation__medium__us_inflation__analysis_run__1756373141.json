      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but still feels like a high‑level overview rather than a rigorous, 3–6‑month scenario map. Tighten the causal chain by linking each macro trigger (e.g., the “big beautiful bill” tax cuts, Medicaid cuts, and midterm turnout) directly to measurable consumer‑staples outcomes (e.g., Walmart’s private‑label margin, Bimbo’s production capacity, retail sales volume). Replace vague “political stability” with concrete metrics: projected midterm vote share in swing districts, RNC fundraising totals, and the pace of Medicaid roll‑out (source EPJYXB7DX). Quantify the impact of the bill on disposable income: CBO estimates a $4.4 trillion tax‑cut over a decade; translate that into a 0.5–1.0 % lift in per‑capita spending for the 30‑49 age cohort (cite EPJYXB7DX). For the Barista FIRE trend, use the 71 % figure from the CNBC survey (source ILYC1M41F) to estimate a 2–3 % shift in retail labor supply, and tie that to potential wage compression for entry‑level retail roles (cite UPV3X2MQ6). Include a clear timing window: e.g., “mid‑January 2026 election results → 30‑day lag for policy implementation → 60‑day lag for consumer spending response.” Add an explicit invalidation: a Fed rate hike > 0.25 % would erode disposable income by ~0.3 % (cite EPJYXB7DX). Finally, replace generic “consumer confidence” with specific indicators: CPI, PCE, and retail sales YoY growth. Ensure every claim is supported by a source ID and that all critical sources (YQOMV2HAJ, EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, V8TEZOR8R) are cited. This will elevate depth, clarity, and credibility to world‑class level.",
