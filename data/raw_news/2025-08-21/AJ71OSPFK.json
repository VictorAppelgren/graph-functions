  "title": "Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 3: Is the Sleek New Look Worth the Price?",
  "description": "We take a close look at the key differences between the Pixel Watch 3 and 4\u2014comparing everything from design and performance to battery life and new features\u2014to help you decide whether it's worth upgrading to the latest model or sticking with the previous one.",
  "content": "Google's Pixel Watch 4 and the Pixel Watch 3 have a lot in common. Both have curved teardrop glass above the watch face, pack the same set of sensors, support Fitbit-powered health tracking, and offer lifestyle features like calling, texting, and contactless payments. The Pixel Watch 4 has a curved display under the curved glass for an even more eye-catching look, built-in access to Gemini AI , extra health guidance, and more battery life. Do these upgrades warrant springing for the newest model, or does the Pixel Watch 3 hold its own? Let's break down the differences between the two to help you decide which smartwatch is right for you.\n\nGoogle keeps the price of the Pixel Watch 4 consistent with the last generation at launch. The smaller 41mm variant starts at $349, and the larger 45mm version costs $399. LTE connectivity costs $100 more for each. Google has since dropped the price of the Pixel Watch 3, with the 41mm model now available for $249.99 and the 45mm model for $299.99. Based solely on price, the Pixel Watch 3 is more affordable, and thus the winner in this category.\n\nWhen we saw the Pixel Watch 4 on display next to older models in a line, it clearly stood out thanks to its curved display. While striking in appearance, the Actua 360 display also has 10% more active area and 15% smaller bezels than the Pixel Watch 3. The screen is easier to see at an angle. It\u2019s brighter as well, at 3,000 nits (the Pixel Watch 3 tops out at 2,000 nits).\n\nBoth watches have AMOLED displays that cover the DCI-P3 color space, so they are equally sharp and vibrant.\n\nAside from the screen, the Pixel Watch 3 and Watch 4 have similar designs. They have aluminum bodies offered in either 41mm or 45mm sizes. They both have a customizable side button and a haptic crown. They have IP68 durability ratings and can survive in water up to 164 feet deep. Both come in a variety of colors with different band choices. The Pixel Watch 4 comes in black or silver, with the larger version also offering a Satin Moonstone finish, and the smaller version adding Champagne Gold to the mix. The Watch 3 also comes in silver, black, or gold with an additional hazel option.\n\nDifferent bands on the Pixel Watch 4 (Credit: Eric Zeman)\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 is the first watch in the line to be fully repairable. If something goes wrong, you can replace the screen or the battery without needing to replace the whole watch.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 has a bigger battery than its predecessor, increasing to 325mAh from 306mAh in the 41mm version and to 455mAh from 420mAh in the 45mm watch. Google has also upped the stated battery life for each. The 41mm version of the Pixel Watch 4 should now last 30 hours, and the 45mm version is estimated to last 40 hours, up from 24 hours for both versions of the Pixel Watch 3.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 3 exceeded Google\u2019s estimates in our testing, lasting 34 and 46.5 hours in our testing for the small and large sizes, respectively, with the always-on display enabled. The Pixel Watch 4 will need to continue that trend in our upcoming testing to win this category, but given the increased capacity, that\u2019s a reasonable expectation.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 on its new charger (Credit: Eric Zeman)\n\nGoogle has also promised faster recharge times for the Watch 4, and it debuts with a new charger. The Watch 4 should be able to go from dead to 50% charge in 15 minutes, and the charger holds it on its side so you can still see the time, the charge amount, and any set alarms while it powers up.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 has upgraded processors that come with a bump in efficiency, which may help improve its battery life even more. Like the previous version, the Watch 4 has a dual chipset, housing the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 processor with a Cortex-M55 coprocessor, upgrades over the Qualcomm SW5100 and Cortex-M33 in the Watch 3.\n\nSnapdragon\u2019s new wearable chip is making its debut in the Pixel Watch 4. It allows for emergency satellite communication, a first for a wearable chip. If you\u2019re out hiking away from your phone and a traditional signal, you\u2019ll still be able to call for help.\n\nBoth the Pixel Watch 3 and 4 have 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.\n\nOn the software side, the Pixel Watch 4 launches with Wear OS 6, which is one generation newer than what\u2019s available on the Pixel Watch 3. Most notably, it comes with Google\u2019s Gemini built in, and you can optionally raise your wrist to talk to the conversational AI assistant. You can use voice commands to ask Gemini questions, send texts, or interact with your watch\u2019s features and apps such as Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Maps.\n\nThe app drawer on the Pixel Watch 3 (Credit: Andrew Gebhart)\n\nOtherwise, the Pixel Watch 4 retains the lifestyle features of its predecessor, giving you access to many third-party wearable apps via the Play Store and the ability to make calls and mobile payments from your wrist.\n\nGoogle has not confirmed if Wear OS 6 and Gemini will come to the Pixel Watch 3 as an update, but I expect so, as Samsung has confirmed its last-generation Galaxy Watch 7 will get access. In that case, Google could keep the raise-to-talk feature exclusive to the Pixel Watch 4 to give its newest model an edge.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 3 is already a capable health and wellness tool thanks to its tight integration with the Fitbit app. The Pixel Watch 4 has the same set of sensors, including an accelerometer, an altimeter, an ambient light sensor, a barometer, a compass, an electrical sensor to measure skin conductance (cEDA) to gauge stress, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, a multi-path optical heart rate sensor, and a skin temperature sensor. It can also monitor blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) with red and infrared sensors and take an ECG with multipurpose electrical sensors.\n\nBoth watches can use those sensors to provide an AI-powered Daily Readiness Score, Cardio Load, and Target Load to give you a sense of how well your body can handle exertion, how your fitness is progressing over time, and specific goals for your workouts, respectively. They can also provide daily run recommendations and a library of audio and video workouts as part of a $9.99 per month Fitbit Premium subscription.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 can track more exercises than its predecessor (Credit: Eric Zeman)\n\nBeyond the capabilities of its predecessor, the Pixel Watch 4 will have an AI-powered coach to give specific fitness and sleep advice, launching as a preview this fall. It adds some new exercise tracking modes, including basketball and pickleball, and promises more reliable automatic workout tracking via AI. It has an improved skin temperature sensor for more accurate overnight health data, and a dual-frequency GPS for precise location tracking in cities and forests. It can even work with the Fitbit app to serve as a heads-up display for cycling.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 upgrades Bluetooth to 6.0 from 5.3 in the Watch 3, but otherwise has the same dual-band 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and optional 4G LTE cellular connectivity as its predecessor. Both support ultra-wideband wireless for precise location tracking. Since we already gave the Pixel Watch 4 credit for its emergency satellite communications and improved GPS, we\u2019ll call this category a split.",
