  "content": "The military said some troops are now carrying guns as Trump claims there is now \u2018no crime\u2019 in the US capital.\n\nNational Guard troops patrolling the United States capital at the direction of President Donald Trump have started carrying firearms, the military said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cStarting the late evening of August 24, 2025, [Joint Task Force-DC] service members began carrying their service-issued weapon,\u201d the Joint Task Force-DC said in a statement.\n\nThe troops are only authorised to use force \u201cas a last resort and solely in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm\u201d, the statement said.\n\nUnnamed officials told the Reuters news agency that the National Guard would either carry M17 pistols or M4 rifles.\n\nThe announcement came as Trump claimed, without evidence, on Sunday that there is \u201cNO CRIME AND NO MURDER IN DC!\u201d, one week after he deployed troops there.\n\nIn the same post on Truth Social, Trump said he might \u201csend in the \u2018troops'\u201d to neighbouring Baltimore, which he described as \u201cout of control\u201d and \u201ccrime-ridden\u201d.\n\nResponding to an invitation from Maryland Governor Wes Moore to visit Baltimore and walk its streets, Trump said: \u201cI would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a \u2018walk\u2019.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to the Baltimore police department, there was a double-digit reduction in gun violence in July compared with the previous year. The city has had 84 homicides so far this year \u2013 the fewest in more than 50 years, according to Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott.\n\nIn Washington, DC, which has a population of just more than 700,000 people, thousands of National Guard and federal law enforcement officers are now patrolling the streets.\n\nThe National Guard is a part-time force of reserve soldiers, which, according to the US Army, can be called on to respond to domestic emergencies, overseas combat missions and \u201ccounter-drug efforts\u201d.\n\nTheir presence in the national capital, along with federal law enforcement officers, has been met by protests, as well as fear and confusion from residents.\n\nAt Trump\u2019s request, some Republican governors have sent hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington, DC, which the president has depicted as being in the grip of a crime wave, although official data shows crime is down in the city.\n\nSince Washington, DC, is not a state, the president has the power to take over policing in the capital for up to 30 days.\n\nMany residents have long advocated for the district to become a state. However, Democrats did not further pursue efforts to make it a state after passing a bill in favour of it through the then-Democrat-controlled House of Representatives in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, on Sunday rejected Trump\u2019s push to send troops into Chicago.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is attempting to manufacture a crisis, politicise Americans who serve in uniform, and continue abusing his power to distract from the pain he is causing working families,\u201d Pritzker said in a statement.",

  "summary": "The US National Guard troops are now carrying firearms in Washington, DC, under the direction of President Donald Trump. This comes as he claims there is now \"no crime\" in the US capital. The troops are only authorised to use force as a last resort when threatened with death or serious bodily harm. The announcement was made by the Joint Task Force-DC. Since D.C. is not a state, the president has the power to take over policing in the capital for up to 30 days. The National Guard is a part-time force of reserve soldiers and can be called upon to respond to domestic emergencies, overseas combat missions and \"counter-drug efforts\".",

      "text": "Six Republican states send 1,100 troops to US capital amid crackdown\nTrump allies will nearly double number of troops in Washington, DC, as presidents orders prosecutors to be more aggressive in pursuing charges.\nGovernors from six Republican-led states are sending hundreds of troops to Washington, DC, bolstering United States President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive move to flood the city with soldiers and federal agents in what he says is an effort to fight violent crime.\nThe move comes as the Trump administration this week ordered federal prosecutors in Washington, DC, to be more aggressive in pursuing criminal cases against people arrested as part of a crackdown in the nation\u2019s capital, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsTrump admin orders Smithsonian museums to be reviewed for \u2018Americanism\u2019\nTrump\u2019s takeover of DC police department faces new lawsuit amid crackdown\nThe Republican governors of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee said on Monday they were deploying troops to Washington, days after the Republican governors of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio also did so at the Trump administration\u2019s request.\nOn August 11, Trump announced a temporary federal takeover of the DC police force, saying he was sending 800 federal DC National Guard members to staunch what he called a crime emergency \u2013 though crime in the nation\u2019s capital has been dropping.\nThe federal government also dispatched agents from numerous agencies, including the FBI, to patrol the city\u2019s streets. Following a legal challenge filed by the city\u2019s attorney general, the administration negotiated a deal with Mayor Muriel Bowser to keep Police Chief Pamela Smith in charge of the department\u2019s operations.\nOn Monday, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said he had approved the deployment of about 135 Guard soldiers to Washington, while Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said he had ordered 200 soldiers to the capital. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee has also deployed 160 Guard troops to the city, according to local media reports.\n\u201cWe cannot allow our cities to be overcome by violence and lawlessness,\u201d Governor Landry said in a post on X. \u201cI am proud to support this mission to return safety and sanity to Washington, DC and cities all across our country, including right here in Louisiana.\u201d\nDays earlier, West Virginia promised 300-400 troops; South Carolina, 200; and Ohio, 150.\nIn total, the six Republican states have announced deployments of more than 1,100 Guard troops to Washington.\nTrump has justified his takeover by pointing to the city\u2019s high crime rates; though data from the city shows a 30 percent drop from 2023 to 2024, which has continued to fall.\nThe Department of Justice has opened an investigation into whether police officials in Washington, DC, have falsified crime data, according to a source familiar with the probe who spoke to The Associated Press and was not authorised to publicly discuss an open investigation.\nIt was not immediately clear what federal laws could have been violated by the possible manipulation of crime data.\nThe mayor\u2019s office declined to comment on the matter.\nThe New York Times was the first to report on the investigation on Tuesday. Earlier this year, a Metropolitan Police Department commander suspected of manipulating crime data was placed on paid administrative leave, NBC Washington reported.\nMaximised federal charges and arming of troops\nThe head of the criminal division of the Washington, DC, US Attorney\u2019s Office, Jonathan Hornok, on Monday told prosecutors to charge as many federal cases as possible against people arrested in the sweeps, according to sources who spoke with Reuters on the condition of anonymity.\nThe move could both strain the court system and raise the stakes for criminal defendants because convictions for federal crimes can carry weighty sentences, said the people.\n\u201cIn line with President Trump\u2019s directive to make DC safe, US Attorney [Jeanine] Pirro has made it clear that the old way of doing things is unacceptable. She directed her staff to charge the highest crime that is supported by the law and the evidence,\u201d a spokesperson for Pirro\u2019s office said on Tuesday.\nIn what could also heighten tensions on the streets, the capital has been informed about the National Guard\u2019s plan to be armed. However, it has not received details about when that could happen or where armed Guard members could be deployed in the District, according to a person familiar who was not authorised to disclose the plans and spoke to The AP on the condition of anonymity.\nIt would be a departure from what the Pentagon and Army have said about the troops being unarmed. The Army said in a statement last week that \u201cweapons are available if needed but will remain in the armoury.\u201d\nPentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson also said last week that troops won\u2019t be armed.\nIn response to questions about whether Guard members in Washington would be armed in the coming days, the District of Columbia National Guard said troops \u201cmay be armed consistent with their mission and training.\u201d\nMaj Melissa Heintz, a spokesperson for the DC Guard, did not provide more details and said \u201ctheir presence is focused on supporting civil authorities and ensuring the safety of the community they serve.\u201d\nCritics maintain crackdown is \u2018political theatre\u2019\nThe extraordinary deployment of the National Guard in Washington, DC comes two months after Trump sent thousands of troops into Los Angeles to quell protests against an immigration crackdown. He has threatened similar takeovers of New York, Chicago, and LA.\nLegal challenges have mounted over the deployments, which experts have argued are a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which generally bars the National Guard and other branches of the US military from being used in civilian law enforcement.\nCritics have called the deployment little more than performative, intended to be a distraction from more pressing issues.\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s overreach is not going to make Washington, DC safer and is dangerous political theatre that imperils democracy in the nation\u2019s capital and beyond,\u201d the Centre for American Progress said in a statement.\nDespite the administration\u2019s insistence that troops are needed to clean up crime, it\u2019s not clear that the federal takeover has resulted in increased enforcement.\nSome 465 arrests have been made in the 12 days since the Trump administration\u2019s operations began, US Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X on Tuesday, an average of 39 arrests a day.\nBy comparison, however, the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department arrested an average of 61 adults and juveniles per day in 2024, according to city statistics.\nData published by restaurant-booking service OpenTable this week reservations plummeting nearly 18 percent since the takeover, despite Trump\u2019s statement on Monday that people felt safer and over the previous two days, restaurants \u201cwere busier than they\u2019ve been in a long time.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump has no basis to deploy troops to Chicago: Top Democratic US lawmaker\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker also accuses the Republican US president of pushing to \u2018manufacture a crisis\u2019 to abuse power.\nDemocratic leaders in the United States are warning that President Donald Trump does not have the authority to deploy US troops to Chicago amid reports of administration plans to send National Guard soldiers to the Midwestern city.\nTrump, a Republican, has said he would likely expand the deployment of federal forces to oversee policing in Washington, DC, to other cities, including Chicago. On Sunday, he also suggested the possibility of sending troops to Democratic-run Baltimore in Maryland.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsRussia accuses Ukraine of attacking nuclear plant, causing a fire\nHow burgers helped me better understand my Vietnamese immigrant mother\nDemocratic House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday denounced plans to deploy federal forces to Chicago. Crime rates, including murders, have declined in Chicago in the last year.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no basis, no authority for Donald Trump to potentially try to drop federal troops into the city of Chicago,\u201d Jeffries told CNN.\nThe US Constitution gives the power of policing to the states.\nThe Washington Post reported on Saturday that the Pentagon has been drawing up plans for a potential troop deployment in Chicago for weeks.\nJB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, where Chicago is located, was quick to reject the push.\n\u201cDonald Trump is attempting to manufacture a crisis, politicize Americans who serve in uniform, and continue abusing his power to distract from the pain he is causing working families,\u201d JB Pritzker said in a statement.\nLeveling criticism at Maryland\u2019s Democratic Governor Wes Moore over crime rates in Baltimore, Trump said he was prepared to deploy troops there, too.\nIn July, the Baltimore police department said there had been a double-digit reduction in gun violence compared to the previous year. The city has had 84 homicides so far this year \u2013 the fewest in over 50 years, according to the mayor.\n\u201cIf Wes Moore needs help\u2026 I will send in the \u2018troops,\u2019 which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime,\u201d Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Sunday.\nSince he entered politics in 2015, Trump has described major cities, which are almost all run by Democrats, as infested by crime, drugs and homelessness.\nThat perception echoed some rural conservative attitudes towards liberal cities.\nEarlier this month, several Republican governors sent hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington at Trump\u2019s request. The president has depicted the capital as being in the grip of a crime wave, although official data shows crime is down in the city.\nOn Sunday, Trump asserted without evidence that there was now no crime in the US capital and credited it to his deployment of troops and hundreds of federal law enforcement personnel.\nThe US president\u2019s critics have warned that the crackdown in Washington may be a test run for the broader militarisation of US cities.\nTrump has much less power over Chicago and Baltimore than he does over the District of Columbia, the seat of the federal government, which is not part of a US state.\nTitle 10 of the US Code, a federal law that outlines the role of the US Armed Forces, includes a provision allowing the president to deploy National Guard units to repel an invasion, to suppress a rebellion or to allow the president to execute the law.\nTrump cited this provision, known as Section 12406, when he sent National Guard units to California earlier this year to counter protests, over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom.\nIn the case of Chicago, Trump may argue that local laws that bar city officials from cooperating with federal immigration agents justify the military presence.\nTrump is almost certain to face legal challenges if he uses Section 12406 to send National Guard troops from Republican-led states into Democratic strongholds."

      "text": "South Korea\u2019s Lee set to meet Trump, with trade and security high on agenda\nJuly trade deal and status of US troops in South Korea in focus as two leaders meet for the first time.\nSeoul, South Korea \u2013 South Korean President Lee Jae-myung is set to meet United States President Donald Trump for the first time in a high-stakes visit to his country\u2019s closest and most important ally.\nAfter a one-day meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in Tokyo, Lee arrived in Washington, DC, on Sunday ahead of an official working-level meeting at the White House with Trump.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 4 itemsRussia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,278\nFrance summons US ambassador over anti-Semitism allegations\nHas Israel become a divisive issue in Europe?\nIt will be the first time the two heads of state meet.\nTheir summit follows a trade deal in July in which Washington agreed to cut its reciprocal tariff on South Korea to 15 percent from an initially proposed 25 percent.\nThe meeting is crucial for South Korea, whose engagement with the Trump administration was disrupted by domestic political turmoil, ignited by the brief declaration of martial law announced in December by the country\u2019s impeached former president, Yoon Suk-yeol.\nDiscussion will focus on ironing out details of the unwritten July trade deal, which involves South Korea agreeing to buy $100bn in US energy and invest $350bn in the US economy.\nOn top of those dizzying sums are direct investments in the US, which are expected from South Korean companies, and which Trump has mentioned will be decided during their talks.\nAccompanied by first lady Kim Hea-kyung, Lee will lead a delegation formed by the heads of South Korean top conglomerates, including Samsung Electronics, SK Group, Hyundai Motor and LG Group.\nThe four companies alone are already known to contribute approximately 126 trillion won ($91.2bn) in direct investments to the US, according to the South Korean daily Maeil Business Newspaper.\nChoi Yoon-jung, a principal research fellow at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, said Lee needs to be deliberate and direct with Trump in the talks, as \u201cSouth Korea is in a tough predicament in terms of trade with the US compared to the past\u201d.\n\u201cIt will be important for President Lee to explain how investments will be designed to serve US national interests and to remind Trump that the two nations are close trading partners who went through large ordeals to realise their Free Trade Agreement over two decades ago,\u201d Choi told Al Jazeera.\nMason Richey, a professor of international politics at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS), said the direction of the talks on investments is likely to be \u201cunpredictable\u201d.\n\u201cNot only are the current 15 percent tariffs overwhelmingly likely to stay on, but the investment part of the deal is likely to remain unclear and subject to unpredictable adjustment by the White House,\u201d Richey told Al Jazeera.\nAnalysts say shipbuilding is one area where Trump clearly desires to have South Korea as a key partner to play catch-up to China\u2019s naval fleet, which leads in terms of sheer numbers and is also making technological advancements.\nOfficials in Seoul have previously stated that a key component of the tariff deal with Washington would include a partnership worth about $150bn to assist in rebuilding the US shipbuilding industry.\nTo that end, after visiting the White House, Lee will head to Philadelphia to visit the Philly Shipyard, which was bought by the South Korean company Hanwha Group last year.\nAnalysts also say that battery production and semiconductors are some other sectors where Trump has set clear objectives to increase US capacity, and where South Korea has shown willingness and interest in being that partner.\n\u201cThe South Korean government is also willing to actively participate in the \u2018modernisation\u2019 of its alliance with the US, that could include increasing contributions to upholding the region\u2019s security and development,\u201d said the Sejong Institute\u2019s Choi.\nAnother major discussion point will be Seoul and Washington\u2019s defence posture regarding the growing threats from North Korea, as well as the development of a strategic alliance to address the changing international security and economic environment.\n\u201cThe pressures for the role of US forces on the Korean Peninsula to evolve has been growing for years,\u201d Jenny Town, the director of the Washington, DC-based research programme 38 North, told Al Jazeera.\nThis evolution was especially so with great power competition increasing from China, Town said.\n\u201cThe Trump administration is focused on how to maximise resources for US interests and priorities, so it is likely that some changes will be made during this term,\u201d Town said.\n\u201cHow drastic or dramatic those changes will depend on a number of factors, including the state of the US domestic political infrastructure that provides checks and balances to executive decisions,\u201d she said.\nA US Senate defence policy bill for fiscal year 2026 includes a ban on the use of funds to reduce the number of US Forces Korea (USFK) troops to below the current level of 28,500 service members.\n\u201cThis makes it unlikely that there will be an immediate change in troop deployment numbers in South Korea,\u201d Choi said.\n\u201cSo, the big point of contention will be the job assignment of the troops to match US interests. I think there\u2019s a possibility of Trump asking South Korea to take on a bigger role in regional security, such as taking part in the conflict involving Taiwan.\u201d\nFinancial negotiations between Trump and Lee may also tip into security details, as the US president has regularly called for South Korea to pay more for the US troops stationed on its soil.\nTrump has made that same call since his first presidential term.\nIn addition to providing more than $1bn for the presence of USFK forces, South Korea also paid the entire cost of building Camp Humphreys, the largest US base overseas, situated 64km (39 miles) south of Seoul.\nTrump has said that he wants defence spending to reach closer to 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for all US allies.\nToday, South Korea\u2019s defence budget is at 3.5 percent of GDP.\nTransfer of wartime operational command \u2013 referring to the transfer of control of South Korean forces during wartime from the US to South Korea \u2013 has long been a point of discussion between Seoul and Washington.\nUnder the Lee administration\u2019s five-year governance plan, Seoul hopes to have the transition happen by 2030.\nThe Trump-Lee meeting also comes after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s powerful sister recently dismissed Washington and Seoul\u2019s stated desires to restart diplomacy aimed at defusing Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme.\nKim Yo Jong said that Seoul could never be a \u201cdiplomatic partner\u201d with Pyongyang.\nFor Town, there were \u201cinteresting nuances\u201d in Kim Yo Jong\u2019s statements.\n\u201cWhile rejecting any kind of denuclearisation narrative as the basis of negotiations, her statements did create an opening for the US to engage North Korea to improve overall relations,\u201d Town said.\n\u201cKim suggested that there\u2019s a reason for two countries with nuclear weapons to avoid confrontational relations. This begs the question of whether the US is actually interested in building a different relationship with North Korea that is not hinged on denuclearisation, and how US allies would see such an agenda,\u201d Town said.\nFor Richey, the HUFS professor, the possibility of \u201cTrump bypassing Lee in diplomacy with North Korea\u201d poses a serious risk for South Korea down the road, in terms of influence and security.\nIn contrast to today\u2019s lack of contact between Washington and Pyongyang, Trump\u2019s first presidential term featured a suspension of US military exercises with South Korea and three separate meetings between the US president and North Korea\u2019s Kim.\nHis desire to earn a Nobel Peace Prize could also offer another set of motivations for Trump to extend a US hand of friendship to Kim.\nThe South Korean president\u2019s White House visit also coincides with annual, large-scale South Korean and US joint military exercises, which run for 11 days.\nDuring a visit to North Korea\u2019s most advanced warship last week, Kim denounced the drills as rehearsals for an invasion of North Korea and \u201can obvious expression of their will to provoke war\u201d.\nAlso, last week, Beyond Parallel, a project of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, unveiled an undocumented North Korean missile base about 25km (15.5 miles) from the border with China, which likely has intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the US.\nTown added that Russia could also play a cameo role in this summit.\n\u201cLee may bring up the issue of how Russia\u2019s relations with North Korea, especially their military cooperation, poses potential dangers to the alliance\u2019s security interests,\u201d she said.\n\u201cTalks could wind up to consideration of whether Trump\u2019s relationship with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin may help mitigate the situation,\u201d she said.\nNorth Korea\u2019s recent dealings with Russia adds another dimension to these inter-country relationships, as reciprocal exchanges of military troops for the receipt of food, energy, cash, weapons and technology have created a stable strategic bond between Moscow and Pyongyang.\nFurthermore, North Korea has shown an interest in strengthening ties with another of the US\u2019s biggest rivals \u2013 China.\n\u201cUltimately, I believe Trump will continue to make overtures toward North Korea,\u201d Choi said.\n\u201cHe may seem to be pushing an isolationist strategy, but the matter of fact is that the US continues to be in the middle of negotiations and talks whenever a big conflict arises in the world,\u201d she said."

      "text": "Chicago \u2018will be next\u2019: Trump teases troop expansion in Democrat-led cities\nTrump\u2019s threat coincided with the announcement that military members in Washington, DC, would be armed during patrols.\nPresident Donald Trump has hinted he plans to expand his domestic troop deployment to other Democrat-led cities in the United States, starting with the midwestern metropolis of Chicago, Illinois.\nTrump\u2019s warning arrived shortly after the Department of Defence confirmed to US media that the National Guard troops currently patrolling Washington, DC, will now be carrying weapons.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsFBI raids home of John Bolton, former Trump adviser turned critic\n\u2018On edge\u2019: Trump\u2019s military deployment in Washington stirs fear, confusion\nIn a statement on Friday, the Pentagon said the decision came directly from Trump\u2019s defence secretary, Pete Hegseth.\n\u201cMembers supporting the mission to lower the crime rate in our Nation\u2019s capital will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training,\u201d the statement said.\nTrump had called up the National Guard on August 11 to address crime in Washington, DC, dismissing nonpartisan data from the Metropolitan Police Department that shows violent crime in the city at a 30-year low.\nThe city had seen an uptick in murder and other crimes after the COVID-19 pandemic began, but since 2023, violent crime has fallen by 35 percent, according to the police statistics.\nTrump, however, renewed his attacks against the city\u2019s leadership on Friday and once again threatened to take over the local government. He has already federalised the local police force, a power he can exert for a period of 30 days.\n\u201cIt was a crime-infested rat hole, and they do have a lot of rats,\u201d Trump said of Washington, DC, during a meeting with reporters and FIFA football federation president Gianni Infantino at the White House.\nThreats against DC Mayor Bowser\nHe specifically called out Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, warning she could lose her democratically elected post.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of listening to these people say how safe it was before we got here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was unsafe. It was horrible. And Mayor Bowser had better get her act straight, or she won\u2019t be mayor very long because we\u2019ll take it over with the federal government and run it like it\u2019s supposed to be run.\u201d\nCritics have voiced concern that such a move would further disenfranchise the voters of Washington, DC, and legal experts warn that Trump may run afoul of the law if he attempts to seize control of the city.\nThe federal government already wields significant power over the affairs of the capital. But under the Home Rule Act of 1973, a local government \u2014 with a mayor and city council \u2014 was set up to manage the city\u2019s day-to-day policies, though Congress retained the right to review and reject local laws.\nIt is not clear how Trump could singlehandedly overturn the Home Rule Act, barring an act of Congress.\nStill, Washington, DC\u2019s unique status as the nation\u2019s capital has allowed Trump to deploy the National Guard more freely there than he could in other parts of the country.\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration faced trial for its use of the National Guard to quell demonstrations last June in Los Angeles, California.\nState and local officials have argued that the move not only violated the law, but also ignited tensions between protesters and law enforcement.\nIn explaining California\u2019s case against the Trump administration, state Attorney General Rob Bonta cited the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which bars the use of the country\u2019s military for domestic law enforcement.\n\u201cTwo months ago, the federal government deployed military troops to the streets of Los Angeles for the purposes of political theater and public intimidation,\u201d Bonta said in a news release. \u201cThis dangerous move has no precedent in American history.\u201d\nExpanding troop deployments to Chicago\nBut Trump has advanced the idea that he will continue to deploy the National Guard to other parts of the country, in the name of combating crime.\n\u201cAfter we do this, we\u2019ll go to another location, and we\u2019ll make it safe also. We\u2019re going to make our country very safe. We\u2019re going to make our cities very, very safe,\u201d Trump said, before turning his attention to one city in particular.\n\u201cChicago\u2019s a mess. You have an incompetent mayor. Grossly incompetent. And we\u2019ll straighten that one out probably next. That\u2019ll be our next one after this. And it won\u2019t even be tough.\u201d\nHe also named other cities he would like to \u201cclean up\u201d with federal troop intervention.\n\u201cI think Chicago will be next, and then we\u2019ll help with New York,\u201d Trump said at one point on Friday. At another, he hinted he might be inclined to once again deploy the National Guard to California.\n\u201cNow, you look at what the Democrats have done to San Francisco; they\u2019ve destroyed it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s just different. We can clean that up, too. We\u2019ll clean that one up, too.\u201d\nAny of those proposed efforts, should they materialise, would likely face challenges under the Posse Comitatus Act.\nAlready, some mayors have responded to the idea that their city could be the next stop for Trump\u2019s anti-crime campaign.\n\u201cIf President Trump wants to help make Chicago safer, he can start by releasing the funds for anti-violence programs that have been critical to our work to drive down crime and violence,\u201d Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement earlier this month.\n\u201cSending in the national guard would only serve to destabilize our city and undermine our public safety efforts.\u201d\nAs Trump faces the end of the 30-day window for his control of the Washington, DC, police force, he has indicated that he might try to circumvent the deadline by declaring the capital\u2019s crime a \u201cnational emergency\u201d.\n\u201c I don\u2019t know if there is a deadline because if I declare a national emergency, which this was, that ends the deadline,\u201d Trump said.\nHe also hinted that he considered calling up other branches of the military. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had to bring in the regular military, which we were willing to do if we have to.\u201d"

      "text": "Can Donald Trump take federal control of Washington, DC?\nUS president has warned of a federal takeover of DC, citing violent incidents and the city\u2019s crime problems.\nAfter a group of teenagers severely beat a prominent employee of President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency in an attempted carjacking in Washington, DC, Trump threatened a federal takeover of the nation\u2019s capital.\nTrump shared an image on August 5 on Truth Social of a bloodied Edward Coristine, also known by his online alias as \u201cBig Balls\u201d.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 4 itemsTrump calls on Fed board to take control from Powell over interest rates\nUS crime rates dropped in 2024, new FBI report shows\nTrump announces 100 percent tariff on semiconductor imports\n\u201cIf D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cPerhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime. If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d\nTrump repeated the idea to reporters on August 6, saying he was \u201cgoing to look at\u201d revoking the city\u2019s home rule, citing the attack on Coristine.\nData shows that in recent years, the district has had a significant crime problem, but offences such as homicide, gun-related and aggravated assault, carjacking, vehicle theft, robbery and sexual assault have declined from COVID-19-era peaks.\nBut a big question remains: can Trump undertake a federal takeover of the District of Columbia?\nExperts say it\u2019s possible, but not necessarily simple \u2013 he\u2019d have to get Congress to agree.\nWhat is DC\u2019s \u2018home rule\u2019?\nThe United States Constitution created the District of Columbia as a 10-square-mile seat of the federal government.\nBecause the district is not a state, its residents lack full congressional representation; it has one House delegate who cannot vote on the floor, and no senators.\nFor about a century until 1973, the city was run by three presidentially appointed commissioners. That year, President Richard Nixon signed the Home Rule Act, enabling district residents to elect a mayor and city council.\nWhile the home rule law granted the district significant autonomy for local governance, the city still answers to Congress on certain matters, including budgetary oversight and the ability to overturn local legislation.\n\u201cSince 1974, and indeed for all of DC history, members of Congress have interfered in city affairs to fiddle with everything from how long pools are open to banning the city from using its own tax money for a needle exchange programme,\u201d said George Derek Musgrove, a University of Maryland-Baltimore County historian.\nWhat does it mean to federalise DC?\nTrump hasn\u2019t detailed how federalisation would work, or said whether there are specific services he wants to take over.\nLegal scholars agreed, given the explicit language in the Constitution, that Trump cannot simply take over the district and oust its home rule-elected leadership. He would have to work with Congress, the entity entrusted with overseeing the capital.\n\u201cCongress may exercise this authority, not exercise it, or delegate it,\u201d Musgrove said. \u201cWith the Home Rule Act of 1973, it delegated a good bit of that authority \u2013 though not all \u2013 to a local government. It would have to act to reclaim that authority, or to delegate it to another entity, like the executive branch.\u201d\nCongress\u2019s Republican majorities have so far supported Trump\u2019s agenda with near-unanimity, but a repeal of home rule isn\u2019t a sure thing.\nIt would need to win passage in the House, which the Republicans narrowly control and where Trump might be able to enforce his will with the majority. But it would also need to clear the Senate, which would take 60 votes, including at least seven Democratic votes, to proceed to final consideration. Democrats have generally been supportive of home rule for the district.\nIn February, Senator Mike Lee and Representative Andrew Ogles introduced legislation to repeal home rule. But the measure has only three Senate co-sponsors and three House co-sponsors.\n\u201cAccording to the Constitution, Congress makes the laws for the district,\u201d said University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt. If Trump wants to \u201cfederalise DC in order for him to wipe out its Democratic leadership and replace it with people who are loyal only to him, that strikes me as precisely what the framers did not want\u201d.\nShort of a law, the president has other ways to exert influence in the district, including the authority to mobilise the DC National Guard without local consent. That\u2019s a possibility he floated in remarks to reporters on August 6.\nThe Home Rule Act also allows the president to assume temporary control over the city\u2019s police department in an emergency \u2013 something Trump threatened to do in 2020 amid nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd.\nWhat has Trump said over time about this?\nTrump has talked broadly since his 2024 campaign about expanding the federal government\u2019s powers over the district, including enhanced oversight and direct management.\nDuring the March 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump spoke about driving through the district, lamenting dirty roads. \u201cIt looked like somebody just took their garbage and just threw it all over the highways, the Beltway. It\u2019s so disgraceful, so disgusting,\u201d Trump said. \u201c\u2026 Frankly, the federal government should take over control and management of Washington, DC.\u201d\nDuring a July 2024 Florida campaign rally, Trump promised to \u201ctake over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, DC, and clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city so that it is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world\u201d.\nTrump echoed this in February, again focusing on blight and crime: \u201cI think the federal government should take over the governance of DC and run it really, really properly.\u201d\nIn March, Trump signed an executive order establishing the \u201cDC Safe and Beautiful Task Force\u201d. It mandates beautification efforts such as graffiti removal and enhanced park maintenance, and it includes provisions to address violent crime and issues related to homelessness.\nIn a July Cabinet meeting, Trump pitched the idea again: \u201cWe have tremendous power at the White House to run places where we have to. We could run DC. I mean, we\u2019re \u2026 looking at DC. We don\u2019t want crime in DC. We want the city to run well.\u201d\nHas home rule been revoked before?\nThere is precedent for removing home-rule powers, but not recently.\nIn 1874, local conservatives angry about voting rights for local Black and working-class white residents teamed up with opponents of Reconstruction-era voting in the South and some of their Northern allies to roll back democratic laws in the district, Musgrove said.\nThe changes lasted until Nixon signed the home rule bill a century later.\nA repeal of home rule would not be popular with Washingtonians. In 2024, Trump won less than 6.5 percent of the district\u2019s vote.\nWhile no city is perfect, the district has built a functioning city government under home rule, Musgrove said.\n\u201cThere is no question that people would be mad,\u201d Musgrove said."

      "text": "House votes in favour of Washington DC statehood in symbolic move\nUS House votes 232-180 to approve long-denied rights for 711,000 residents of the US capital city in a symbolic move.\nFor the first time in US history, a chamber of the United States Congress voted 232-180 on Friday in favour of giving Washington, DC statehood \u2013 a move towards fuller voting rights for the city\u2019s majority Black population.\nThe vote was along party lines, with Democrats who control the House supporting it and while historic, it was symbolic as Republicans in the Senate and President Donald Trump oppose the move.\n\u201cAcross the United States today, Americans are taking down the remnants of the Confederacy as symbols of inequality, just as the House of Representatives is raising up in our nation\u2019s capital to ensure equality for its citizens,\u201d said Eleanor Holmes Norton, who is Washington\u2019s non-voting delegate to the Congress.\nNorton, 83, has represented the District of Columbia in the US Congress since 1991. Norton cannot vote on legislation in the House but otherwise enjoys the privileges of a member of Congress. DC has no US senators.\n\u201cMy life as a third generation Washingtonian has marched toward this milestone,\u201d Norton said at a news conference at the US Capitol on Thursday.\nSymbolic vote\nRecent events in Washington, DC prompted House Democratic leadership to bring the DC statehood bill to a vote. In April, Republicans in the US Senate shorted the city $755m when the Congress doled out emergency funding for the coronavirus fight.\nMore recently, city residents and local leaders were outraged when federal law enforcement violently cleared protesters from Lafayette Square, a public park near the White House, and President Trump called up military troops to be on standby at bases just outside the city.\nIf Washington, DC were a state \u201cits residents would be protected from the kind of civil rights violations we saw in Lafayette Square\u201d, said Representative Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House.\n\u201cThis [is] not just an issue of local governance and fairness. It is a major civil rights issue as well. We must bring to an end the disenfranchisement of 711,000 American citizens,\u201d Hoyer said.\nVoting rights\nStatehood is the only way to recognise the full voting rights of DC residents and bringing the bill to the House for a vote now is a way \u201cto show respect to the citizens\u201d of DC who have been denied the right to representation in Congress for two centuries, Hoyer said.\nIn 2016, 86 percent of DC voters said \u201cyes\u201d to a referendum authorising the City Council to petition Congress for statehood.\nThe bill is unlikely to become law unless Democrats gain a majority in the Senate in the upcoming November election. Even then, it would face an uphill climb requiring support from Republicans.\n\u201cThey want to make Washington [DC] a state to rig the rules of our democracy and try to give the Democratic Party permanent power,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton told NBC News on Thursday.\nIn May, Trump told the New York Post newspaper: \u201cDC will never be a state. Why? So we can have two more Democratic \u2013 Democrat senators and five more congressmen? No, thank you. That\u2019ll never happen.\u201d\nThe balance of power between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate is a point of discontent. While Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, they represent fewer Americans than do Senate Democrats.\nTomorrow there will be a historic vote on #DCStatehood in the House. It\u2019s unacceptable that 700,000+ Americans in the capital of our democracy\u201463% of whom are people of color\u2014have no voting representation in Congress. We must forever end this injustice: DC statehood now!\n\u2014 Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBooker) June 25, 2020\nThe District of Columbia is comprised of 10 square miles (26sq km) of land ceded to the federal government by the state of Maryland in 1788. At the time, the US government was still in formation. George Washington was not yet installed as the first president in 1789. The city of Washington was an undeveloped swamp.\nThe US constitution mandates that a federal district serve as the seat of government that falls under the jurisdiction of Congress. The bill would shrink that district to encompass a smaller area to include the US Capitol, the national mall and a number of federal buildings, the rest of the land would become a state.\nThe Washington metropolitan area, including adjacent cities and suburbs of Virginia and Maryland, is now the sixth-largest metro area in the US with a population of more than six million.\nWith 711,000 residents, DC has a greater population than two states, Vermont and Wyoming. North Dakota and Alaska are similar in population.\nThe last time new states were admitted to the union was Hawaii and Alaska in 1959. Washington, DC residents received the right to vote for the president in 1961 and DC carries three votes in the US Electoral College which determines the winner of presidential elections."

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s testimony says a lot about our dystopia\nThat the US president needs a character certificate from a convicted criminal is quite befitting.\nAnd so the verdict is out. United States President Donald Trump\u2019s name has been cleared of ignominious association with the late disgraced financier and child sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein. This is according to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s former partner, who in 2022 was sentenced to 20 years behind bars on sex trafficking charges.\nEarlier this year, US Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly informed the president that his name appeared in the so-called \u201cEpstein files\u201d, the content of which Trump had said on the campaign trail he would be quite keen on releasing.\nOnce in office, however, he spontaneously decided that the Epstein case was old news, going so far as to reprimand those in his own MAGA base who were \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cfoolish\u201d enough to continue insisting that the files be declassified.\nNow, the US Justice Department has released transcripts of a July interview between Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a former personal lawyer for Trump, and Maxwell, who had nothing but praise for the president\u2019s moral solidity:\n\u201cI never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.\u201d\nThere was no limit, it seemed, to Maxwell\u2019s admiration for the president. \u201cTrump was always very cordial and very kind to me\u2026 I like him, and I\u2019ve always liked him,\u201d she declared.\nNever mind Maxwell\u2019s reputation as a serial liar who was charged with two counts of perjury for lying under oath \u2013 charges that were dropped following her conviction on other counts. Surely the obsequious tribute to Trump\u2019s allegedly upstanding nature has nothing to do with the fact that Maxwell is presently seeking a presidential pardon from the same man.\nAt any rate, the shining appraisal should at least help un-bunch the panties of many Trump supporters who have been dissatisfied with his handling of the Epstein matter. Far-right influencer and self-categorised \u201cproud Islamophobe\u201d Laura Loomer, for example \u2013 whom Trump has praised as \u201cterrific\u201d and \u201cvery special\u201d \u2013 welcomed Maxwell\u2019s testimony as proof that the president \u201chas always been an honourable person\u201d.\nExpressing her hope that \u201cthese transcripts will quell a lot of the nasty, salacious lies and rumors that were spread by bad actors online\u201d, Loomer appeared confident that harmony would soon be restored among MAGA adherents.\nTo be sure, there\u2019s nothing more uplifting than the members of a movement founded on hatred and discord getting along with each other.\nFor his part, Trump has now announced that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d about the US Justice Department\u2019s release of the Epstein files to Congress.\nSpeaking to reporters, the president nonetheless maintained that the \u201cwhole Epstein thing is a Democrat hoax\u201d \u2013 a result of the Democratic Party\u2019s inability to cope with Trump\u2019s spectacular success at the helm of America: \u201cSo we had the greatest six months, seven months in the history of the presidency, and the Democrats don\u2019t know what to do, so they keep bringing up that stuff.\u201d\nAs with most calculations emanating from the president\u2019s brain, the proclamation of the \u201cgreatest\u201d time period bears no correlation with reality. Indeed, pretty much everything that has transpired over the past six or seven months has been decidedly less than \u201cgreat\u201d \u2013 not that Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden presided over anything particularly inspiring.\nOn the domestic scene, Americans continue to be plagued by rising costs of living that for many folks make existence itself unsustainable. Basic rights like healthcare, education, nutrition, and housing have long been converted into for-profit industries, and gun violence constitutes a veritable national pastime.\nUnder Trump\u2019s guidance, US law enforcement agencies have gone about abducting and disappearing undocumented workers, international scholars, and US citizens alike. The nation\u2019s capital, Washington, DC, has also been militarised with the deployment of National Guard troops to supposedly \u201cfight crime\u201d in the mostly safe parts of the city.\nOn the international front, meanwhile, the past six or seven months have not only seen Trump bomb Iran in egregious violation of international law but also persist in sustaining Israel\u2019s genocide of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to the tune of billions upon billions of dollars.\nJust days ago, the United Nations officially declared famine in Gaza \u2013 a logical result of the US-backed Israeli policy of enforced starvation.\nAnd all of this against a backdrop of planetary self-combustion that is only being sped up by the Trump administration\u2019s prioritisation of climate change denial.\nConsidering the rather apocalyptic panorama, Trump\u2019s de facto character certificate from Maxwell is at best entirely irrelevant \u2013 a political soap opera in which one convicted criminal kisses the rear end of another convicted criminal who happens to be president of the United States.\nMaxwell\u2019s testimony is simply icing on the dystopian cake. And as the world goes up in flames, the character certificate at least sums up where the US is currently at \u2013 however many \u201cgreatest\u201d months into 2025.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance."

Washington police arrested an average of 56 people daily last year, according to city data.\nThe Justice Department, which did not respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for comment, has not specified whether the arrests were made entirely by federal agents or whether they include law enforcement action by Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\nBut local TV channel ABC 7 News quoted federal officials as saying the numbers included arrests by all agencies in the city.\nIt\u2019s also not clear whether the detention of undocumented immigrants is included in the tally. Arrests made by ICE were only distinguished in Bondi\u2019s daily announcements on Thursday and Friday.\nBut Trump and his aides are talking up the arrests as a considerable feat.\nOn Thursday evening, Trump rode around Washington with law enforcement officers in a show of control and defiance against critics of the crackdown.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some incredible results. \u2026 It\u2019s like a different place. It\u2019s like a different city. It\u2019s the capital. It\u2019s going to be the best in the world,\u201d the US president told soldiers and law enforcement officers.\nVice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also visited Union Station on Wednesday, where they ordered burgers at a fast food restaurant as protesters chanted against them.\nTrump first suggested federalising law enforcement in Washington after an employee of his cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency was assaulted during a carjacking early this month.\nOn Friday, Hegseth ordered National Guard troops in Washington to start carrying firearms, according to the Pentagon.\nWhy Washington?\nSince he entered politics in 2015, Trump has described major cities, which are almost all run by Democrats, as infested by crime, drugs and homelessness.\nThat perception echoed some rural conservative attitudes towards liberal cities.\nTrump has long threatened to send the military to cities he views as dangerous, but the US Constitution gives the power of policing to the states, not the federal government.\nWashington, DC, however, is not a state. As the US capital, it has no votes in the US Congress or enshrined state rights.\nWhile the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gives the local government some control over the city, the federal government retains some powers over Washington. For example, Congress may overturn local resolutions approved by the city council.\nThe law also allows the president to take over policing in the capital for 30 days.\nThe city votes overwhelmingly for the Democratic Party \u2013 Democrat Kamala Harris won Washington against Trump, a Republican, with 92.5 percent of the ballots last year \u2013 and it has been ripe for a Trump crackdown.\nSeveral residents expressed bewilderment to Al Jazeera and questioned the need for patrols by federal forces in crowded metro stations and tourist areas that are low-crime spots.\nIced out. \ud83e\udd76 pic.twitter.com/xhexqgmbzS\n\u2014 Homeland Security (@DHSgov) August 14, 2025\nCrime in DC\nWashington is a city of 700,000 people with a metropolitan area that extends into suburbs in Maryland and Virginia and encompasses more than six million residents.\nKindle said some tourists and Republican officials want Washington to look like an \u201camusement park\u201d rather than the densely populated metropolis that it is.\n\u201cThey think that this is like Disneyland. This is a tourist spot. It should be sanitised for them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re seeing what they would see in their own cities.\u201d\nDespite improvements in recent years, several residents told Al Jazeera that crime still remains a concern in Washington.\nThe city has a homicide rate of about 25 per 100,000 residents, which is significantly higher than the national average but lower than other cities of similar size, including Detroit, Michigan, and Memphis, Tennessee.\nUS News & World Report, which tracks crime data, does not include Washington on the list of the 25 most dangerous cities in the country.\nSome welcome the National Guard\nWashington continues to suffer from property crime that sometimes turns violent, especially carjackings involving juveniles, with 190 incidents recorded this year so far.\nIn defending the deployment of troops in Washington, the White House argued on its website that the capital has the fourth highest homicide rate in the country \u2013 \u201cnearly six times higher than New York City and also higher than Atlanta, Chicago, and Compton.\u201d\nLeroy Miles, a 75-year-old retiree, said \u201cit\u2019s good\u201d that federal forces are helping the local police.\nMiles said he was no fan of Trump and called him a \u201ccrook\u201d but accused local authorities of not doing an adequate job in combating crime.\n\u201cThese young people out here, they\u2019re robbing and killing. They\u2019re carjacking. So they need some type of old law and order,\u201d said Miles, who has always lived in Washington.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening \u2013 a lot of people don\u2019t like it, but it might work.\u201d\n\u2018Less safe\u2019\nParker stressed that there is no crime crisis in Washington, but he added that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have more work to do\u201d.\n\u201cThere are ways in which our local government can productively work with the federal government,\u201d Parker said.\n\u201cAnd what is happening here \u2013 where there is an influx of federal officers across the city and National Guards, people deployed, including those from other states \u2013 is not the way. This is not how this should be done.\u201d\nHe underscored that the Republican-controlled Congress has cut and so far failed to restore $1bn in funding for Washington \u2013 money that would go to fighting crime, paying police officers and supporting city services that enhance public safety.\nThe council member expressed admiration for National Guard troops, who are called on to help in crises and natural disasters, but he said bringing outsiders to police the city could erode trust between the community and law enforcement officers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing it. I have heard directly from residents who are second-guessing calling 911 in instances of true emergencies for fear of what\u2019s going to be the outcome or who might show up at their door,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing from parents that they are concerned about sending their kids to school for the first day of school next week. I am hearing from residents who are defending and rallying against ICE patrols that are seeking to criminalise our neighbours.\u201d\nParker said the federal crackdown is making Washington \u201cless safe\u201d.\n\u2018We are on edge\u2019\nA Washington Post poll released on Wednesday suggested 80 percent of Washington residents oppose \u201cTrump taking control of DC\u2019s police and federal troops patrolling the streets\u201d while 72 percent of respondents favour the city becoming a state.\nLoss of local control in a place where tax-paying citizens do not have federal voting representation is another aspect that is raising protests against the Trump takeover.\n\u201cWe have, as a country, allowed for the disenfranchisement of Washingtonians, and now there is an effort to undermine the local autonomy that we do have,\u201d Parker said.\nWes, a Washington resident who wished to be identified by his first name only, citing fear of reprisal by the government, warned that the tensions around the issue could boil over.\n\u201cWe are on edge. You got people that\u2019s scared to come out of their houses,\u201d Wes said outside the Columbia Heights metro station, which saw a heavy ICE presence earlier this week.\n\u201cYou got people scared to walk the streets like they used to because of this show of force. We do not trust the police here at all. Now you bring somebody we don\u2019t know, that has no skills about you. They\u2019re not even from here. They don\u2019t know how this city works.\u201d\nHe said that with people growing frustrated with excessive policing and cuts to social programmes, violence and riots could break out, and Trump would be to blame.\n\u201cHe thrives on chaos. And if there ain\u2019t no chaos, he creates chaos,\u201d Wes said."

      "text": "Trump administration seeks to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s case remains a flashpoint in US President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigration crackdown.\nImmigration officials in the United States say they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, according to a court filing, in what the man\u2019s legal team describes as an act of \u201cvindictiveness\u201d by US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\nThe court filing on Saturday said the idea of sending Abrego Garcia to Uganda came after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsTrump administration sanctions International Criminal Court judges\nUganda\u2019s President Museveni confirms bid to extend nearly 40-year rule\nHe has pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation from the US to El Salvador earlier this year.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s case has become a flashpoint in Trump\u2019s hardline, anti-immigration agenda after the Salvadoran national was mistakenly deported in March.\nFacing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the US in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.\nThe Costa Rica offer came late on Thursday, after it was clear that Abrego Garcia would likely be released from a Tennessee jail the following day.\nAbrego Garcia declined to extend his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his family.\nLater that day, the US Department of Homeland Security notified his lawyers that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.\n\u201cThe government immediately responded to Mr Abrego\u2019s release with outrage,\u201d Saturday\u2019s filing by Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers reads.\n\u201cDespite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr Abrego\u2019s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE\u2019s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning.\u201d\nThe filing also accuses US officials of \u201cusing their collective powers to force Mr Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat\u201d.\n\u201cIt is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness,\u201d it says.\nAlthough Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his lawyers, who feared the Trump administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.\nThose fears were somewhat allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland, which requires immigration officials to allow Abrego Garcia time to mount a defence.\nBut Al Jazeera\u2019s Rosiland Jordan, reporting from Washington, DC, on Saturday evening, said the latest developments have raised new fears that Abrego Garcia will be quickly deported once he reports to ICE officials on Monday.\n\u201cHe and his lawyers argue there\u2019s a very real fear that the US will once again ignore a judge\u2019s order to basically leave him alone and put him on a plane and take him to another country \u2013 in this case, Uganda,\u201d she said.\nQuestions on due process\nAbrego Garcia had been living in the US under protected legal status since 2019, when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country.\nHe then became one of more than 200 people sent to El Salvador\u2019s CECOT mega-prison as part of Trump\u2019s crackdown on migrants and asylum seekers in the US.\nBut Department of Justice lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran citizen had been wrongly deported due to an \u201cadministrative error\u201d.\nAbrego Garcia \u2013 who denies any wrongdoing \u2013 now stands accused of involvement in smuggling undocumented migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and other countries into the US between 2016 and earlier this year.\nHis trial in his human smuggling case is set to begin in January 2027.\nAaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said in a social media post on Saturday that \u201cno matter what you think about Mr Abrego Garcia, if you believe in due process, you should be infuriated\u201d by the effort to send him to Uganda.\n\u201cThe Trump admin is threatening to dump him in Africa as punishment for not pleading guilty to criminal charges they brought to avoid complying with a court order,\u201d Reichlin-Melnick wrote on X.\nThe Trump administration has defended its policies, saying the US president was elected on a promise to carry out the \u201clargest deportation operation\u201d in the country\u2019s history.\nBut Washington\u2019s push to deport people has drawn widespread criticism, with removals to third countries, in particular, fuelling fears that those being sent abroad could face human rights abuses and other dangers.\nLast month, the Trump administration sent eight men to South Sudan, a country gripped by political instability and violence."

  "argos_summary": "President Trump has ordered National Guard troops to patrol Washington, DC, and has now authorized them to carry firearms, claiming the city is crime\u2011free, despite official data showing a 30\u2011year low in violent crime. The deployment has sparked protests, legal challenges, and criticism that it is a political stunt aimed at undermining local autonomy and diverting attention from broader issues. Republican governors from six states have sent hundreds of troops to the capital, while Democrats, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, have rejected the idea of federalizing other cities such as Chicago. Meanwhile, Congress has passed a symbolic vote for DC statehood, and the Trump administration continues to push aggressive law\u2011enforcement measures, including high\u2011profile deportation cases and a broader crackdown on immigration. The overall narrative frames the federal takeover as a response to a perceived crime crisis that, in reality, is largely a manufactured political crisis. ",
