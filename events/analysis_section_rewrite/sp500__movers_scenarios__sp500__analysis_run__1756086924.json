      "feedback": "This draft is close but can be world‑class with a regime‑centric, tightly structured rewrite and a disciplined formatting/validation check. Actionable edits: 1) Replace the Netflix/Hutchmed–centric scaffolding with four strictly regime‑driven items: two Up and two Down, each as a single sentence in the exact format: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %. 2) Bind horizons clearly to 0–6 months and 6–12 months (or 3–6 and 6–12 if you prefer a different split) and ensure every line covers only one sentence. 3) Anchor each line to first‑principles causal chains: tariff shocks and import prices feed inflation expectations, driving capital reallocation toward US chip fabs, EV/AI compute, and baseload energy; these shift margins, capex intensity, and governance signals into equity pricing. 4) Ground each line with explicit, source‑backed triggers and numeric anchors from the material (e.g., baseline tariffs at 10% with higher China tariffs; progress on US chip fabs; Wyoming‑scale power economics; Jackson Hole/semicapex cadence; AI compute demand), and attach the exact IDs after the facts (SGB2PAZGK, OGK8WLL69, 22PL3Q360, O4ZEED2EB, STBVARD8F, etc.) where used. 5) For each line specify a concrete invalidation or alternative path, so the Down lines reflect regime transitions (A→B→C) and the Up lines reflect regime strengthening, with explicit triggers (chip fab milestones, AI infra progress, adoptions of diversified supply chains) and probabilistic wedges: 65%, 50%, 40%, 35% respectively. 6) Eliminate extraneous cross‑references (Netflix, Costa Coffee, Disney) unless you map them to a regime impulse; if kept, reframe them as governance/valuation channels only and cite them sparingly with IDs. 7) Ensure full internal consistency across sources (SGB2PAZGK for regime mechanics; OGK8WLL69 for rate‑path cues; 22PL3Q360 for Ford exposure as a near‑term case, etc.) and reconcile any conflicts by preferring a single, auditable base‑case narrative anchored to tariff policy, chip/AI capex momentum, and energy economics. 8) Constrain the final output to exactly four lines with no fillers, and verify each line is a standalone sentence that can be read without external context.",
