      "summary": "Apple is set to unveil its iPhone 17 lineup on September 9, with rumors pointing to a new ultra‑thin iPhone 17 Air, a titanium‑framed Air, and a revamped Pro line featuring an all‑aluminum chassis and a larger camera island. Leaks suggest the Air will have a single 48‑MP camera, a 2.8‑Ah battery, and a 6.6‑inch display, while the Pro models may include a vapor‑chamber cooling system and a new A19 chip. Pricing is expected to rise by about $50 across the lineup to offset rising component costs and tariffs, and the event will also showcase iOS 26, Apple Watch updates, and new AirPods Pro 3. The event’s timing and details have been confirmed by Apple’s invitation and multiple leakers, setting the stage for a major hardware and software reveal.",
