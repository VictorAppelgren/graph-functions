  "description": "Toyota, Honda, and Nissan have been hesitant to blame tariffs.",
  "content": "Toyota, Honda, and Nissan have been hesitant to blame tariffs.\n\nToyota (TM) is the most successful Japanese auto brand in America.\n\nThe company is second in annual sales in the U.S., only behind General Motors. It is well ahead of hometown favorites Ford and Stellantis. Honda is also in the top five.\n\nOf the 2.4 million vehicles Toyota sold worldwide in the first quarter of FY 2026, nearly 800,000 of those sales came from North America, making it Toyota's most important region by far.\n\nNorth American new vehicle sales rose by 89,000 units to 794,000.\n\nHowever, thanks to President Donald Trump's tariffs, profitability in the U.S. also took a huge hit. Toyota's operating income in North America fell by $1.1 billion from a profit a year ago to a net loss of $438 million.\n\nNorth America was the only one of Toyota's six operating regions to lose money. However, due to a $4.4 billion profit in Japan and a $1.1 billion billion operating profit across Asia, Toyota was able to report an overall quarterly profit of $5.8 billion, down from the $8.5 billion it reported a year ago.\n\nThis week, Nikkei Asia reported that Japanese automakers are \"passing some of the expense of U.S. tariffs through to American car buyers, a change from their strategy of absorbing impact.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that President Trump told CEOs not to raise prices in the face of tariffs. He has denied telling them that, even though he went on social media in May to tell Walmart to \"EAT THE TARIFFS.\"\n\nAutomakers have been reticent to blame tariffs for any price increases this year, so the Nikkei's report was surprising.\n\nBut representatives from Toyota, Honda, and Nissan denied the report, telling CNBC that any price increases this year were seasonal and not the result of the tariffs.\n\nThe president has said, \u201cThe message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you\u2019re going to make a lot of money...because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\u201d\n\nBut Ford, a company that makes 77% of its vehicles in the U.S., still says tariffs on autos and auto parts will cost it more than $2 billion this year.\n\nThe Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) says its members have spent $4.6 billion on research and development in the U.S.\n\nBetween April 2024 and March 2025, Toyota alone built 1.96 million units in the U.S.\n\u2022 Car buyers beware, the market appears to be shifting gears\n\nFor comparison, General Motors, the country's largest automaker, says it needs to invest $4 billion over the next two years to increase its U.S. production to 2 million annually.\n\nLast month, the U.S. lowered auto tariffs on Japan to 15% from 27.5%, but the country is still feeling the pain.\n\nJapan's exports posted the largest monthly drop in about four years in July, falling 2.6% year over year in value terms.\n\nAccording to one estimate, Japan exported $40.76 billion worth of cars to the U.S. in 2024, representing nearly 19% of all auto imports.",
