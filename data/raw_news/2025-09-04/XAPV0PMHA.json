      "text": "Hunched and hideous digital model reveals what influencers could look like in 2050: \u2018Her lifestyle has left its mark\u2019\nNo amount of Instagram filters will fix this.\nInfluencers might seem glamorous on social media, but their smoldering looks apparently won\u2019t last. Experts at the gambling site Casino.org have devised a grotesque model of what these content creators will look like in 2050, complete with patchy skin, a hunchback and chronic neck pain.\n\u201cWhile the career can be glamorous, it can also bring significant changes to our lifestyle,\u201d the gambling experts wrote. They reportedly wanted to see how the \u201ctrendy profession\u201d \u2014 which boasts 30-50 million adherents worldwide and is growing by 10-20% each year \u2014 can impact appearances over time.\u201d\nThey deduced that \u201calgorithm-chasing, beauty standard pressures, and non-stop content creation can take a visible toll on both body and mind.\u201d\nTo illustrate this point, Casino.org devised Ava, a digitized representation of the complications of years of content creating, like Oscar Wilde\u2019s 1890 Gothic tale \u201cThe Picture Of Dorian Gray\u201d for the social media age.\n\u201cFrom endless brand trips to Las Vegas to the daily grind of filters and photo shoots, her lifestyle has left its mark,\u201d they cautioned. \u201cBacked by medical research, Ava\u2019s appearance is the sum of influencers habits.\u201d\nThe Hunchback of Instagram\nThe influencer\u2019s sedentary, screen-saturated lifestyles will literally backfire on them. To wit, Ava\u2019s prolonged social media and smartphone use, and hours of posing under ring lights have left her with rounded shoulders, a permanent forward head tilt, and chronic neck pain known as \u201ctech neck.\u201d\n\u201cSome researchers have suggested that frequent smartphone use can lead to the use of a non-neutral neck posture or the development of musculoskeletal disorders,\u201d experts wrote in the journal Interdisciplinary Neurosurgery.\n\u201cThis flexed neck posture can increase the pain of the cervical spine and induce muscle strain in adjacent portions of the cervical spine,\u201d they added.\nThis is particularly unsettling given that influencers work up to 90 hours per week, much of which is spent on their phones, according to the BBC.\nUnder the skinfluence\nMuch like in the prescient sci-fi thriller \u201cThe Substance,\u201d social media stars\u2019 pursuit of aesthetic perfection may have paradoxically destined them for ugliness.\nAva boasts skin irritation, inflammation and patchiness from \u201cdaily layers of makeup, frequent skincare product swaps, and constant cosmetic application, Casino.org wrote.\nThis comes amid a rise of people flocking to Turkey to undergo cheap beautification procedures, which can result in injury and even death in some instances.\nOf course, people don\u2019t need to go under the knife to destroy their dermis. Long-term exposure to LED lighting such as ring lights and screens can accelerate pigmentation changes, fine lines, and lasting inflammation, which is a condition known as \u201cdigital aging,\u201d per the site.\nNot easy on the eyes\nHours spent editing and livestreaming content can unsurprisingly take a toll on one\u2019s peepers.\nKnown in medical circles as digital eye strain or computer vision syndrome, the condition boasts symptoms ranging from constant redness and dryness to blurry vision and deep dark circles ringed by puffy under-eye bags, as the Ava model illustrates.\nTo mitigate this ocular side effect, remote workers should employ the 20-20-20 rule. For every 20 minutes spent staring at a screen, work-from-homers should look away at something that is 20 feet away from them for 20 seconds, per Healthline.\nConstantly checking content or interacting with fans can also result in a lack of sleep (influencer-somnia?) due to the heightened adrenaline and blue light emitted from screens that disrupts our circadian rhythm.\nLosing face and lock-blocking\nAva boasts an uneven and distorted face from years of facial filler use.\nInspired by trends like \u201cSnapchat Dysmorphia\u201d and \u201cPillow Face Syndrome,\u201d this cosmetic \u201covercorrection results in puffy cheeks, a pointed \u2018witch chin,\u2019 and an artificial facial texture,\u201d per the site.\nInfluencers\u2019 constant obsession with their hair through extensions and styling can also ironically cause \u201cbald spots, a receding hairline, and overall hair thinning that\u2019s hard to reverse,\u201d per the site.\n\u201cThe weight and constant tugging at the hair follicle can lead to a condition called traction alopecia,\u201d warned dermatologist and alopecia expert Aamna Adel in a reel, per Casino.org.\n\u201cOver time, it can be irreversible and it can lead to permanent hair loss,\u201d she noted.\n\u201cAva is more than a concept image \u2013 she\u2019s a reflection of the long-term effects these habits can have,\u201d Casino.org wrote. \u201cThe takeaway is simple: balance the ambition, set boundaries around your work, and remember that health and well-being will always outlast trends.\u201d"

Using news reports sourced from Google News, the study included cases where attempting a selfie directly led to injury or death.\nIndia emerged as the most dangerous country in the world, accounting for a staggering 42.1% of all selfie-related incidents globally. Out of 271 selfie-induced casualties reported in India, 214 were deaths and 57 were injuries.\nResearchers point to a combination of densely populated areas, easy access to risky environments \u2014 such as cliffs and train tracks \u2014 and a strong social media culture as contributing factors.\nFortunately, this time America is not leading the way.\nThe United States ranked second, with many fewer deaths. The US only recorded 45 total casualties \u2014 including 37 deaths and 8 injuries.\nRussia came in third with 19 casualties \u201418 deaths and 1 injury.\nWhile these numbers are significantly lower than India\u2019s, they still highlight a worrying pattern, especially in tourist-heavy locations where people are tempted to capture dangerous moments.\nPakistan ranked fourth \u2014 with 16 deaths and 0 injuries, and Australia rounded out the top 5 with 13 selfie deaths and only two injuries.\nAccording to the study, the most common cause of selfie-related fatalities worldwide is falling, making up 46% of all incidents. Whether it\u2019s from rooftops, cliffs, or tall structures \u2014 height-related accidents continue to be the most frequent and often the most fatal.\nAnything to get the perfect shot, right?\n\u201cOur research highlights a troubling trend where the pursuit of social media validation is literally costing lives. The perfect photo simply isn\u2019t worth the danger,\u201d Kris Barber, Founder and Principal Attorney at The Barber Law Firm, said in a statement.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s particularly concerning is that most of these tragedies could have been avoided by taking a few steps back or finding a safer vantage point.\u201d\nThe top 10 most dangerous countries to take a selfie\n1. India, 271 affected\n2. United States, 45\n3. Russia, 19\n4. Pakistan, 16\n5. Australia, 15\n6. Indonesia, 14\n7. Kenya, 13\n8. United Kingdom, 13\n9. Spain, 13\n10. Brazil, 13\nWith the continued popularity of platforms like Instagram and TikTok, the pressure to capture stunning, adventurous selfies is more intense than ever.\nExperts suggest that this desire for viral content often overrides basic safety, leading people to take unnecessary and sometimes fatal risks \u2014 which has been seen all too often with deadly TikTok challenges, as well.\nJust recently, a tourist in India who attempted to snap a photo with an elephant was subsequently severely injured after being trampled and stripped \u2014 revealing his bare behind for all manner of beasts to bear witness.\nIt was a reckless and embarrassing stunt that, fortunately, only ended with a shocking video and not his life.\n\u201cThere are always safer alternatives to capture beautiful moments without putting yourself at risk. No amount of likes or shares can justify endangering your life,\u201d Barber said of the risk of selfie stunts."

She even uploaded a video of the aftermath of the crash, showing herself dabbing at her wounds while wearing nothing but her skimpy red bikini.\nIn a second video, filmed when she was all bandaged up, Corbi is seen laughing and stripping of one of the wraps to reveal her expansive leg wound. \u201cThis is the result of the motorbike accident,\u201d she boasted..\nCorbi took the opportunity to plug the bikini brand she was wearing during the crash and even offered her followers 15 per cent off if they used her discount code, the Daily Mail reported.\n\u201cAt least I didn\u2019t lose my leg,\u201d she captioned the clip. \u201cThis happened three months ago, I\u2019m much better now.\u201d\nViewers didn\u2019t take kindly too her seemingly flippant attitude or choice of attire in Thailand, which is famously conservative and bans tourists from wearing skimpy clothes to their holy sites.\n\u201cFilming this in underwear in public, bleeding, adding music. Humans! Wow,\u201d said one critic.\nAnother wrote, \u201cMaybe next time you won\u2019t ride a motorcycle in your underwear. What are you trying to prove?\u201d\n\u201cSetting your camera up before addressing your wounds is so f\u2013ked up,\u201d exclaimed a third.\nMeanwhile, one local commented, \u201cHave some respect for the country you are in and dress decently when riding.\u201d\nWhile the influencer agreed that she \u201cdefinitely should\u2019ve worn more than a bikini,\u201d she claims she\u2019s \u201cforever grateful\u201d she was wearing her helmet.\n\u201cIt was cracked on the left side, and without it, I know I wouldn\u2019t be here to tell this story,\u201d the grateful globetrotter gushed.\nUltimately, the reality star has learned to see the humor in the disaster.\n\u201cThroughout it all, people would laugh when they saw my bandages, thinking, \u2018just another American who crashed a motorbike,'\u201d she said. \u201cAnd honestly, I found it kind of funny too.\u201d"
