  "description": "Texas A&M legend Johnny Manziel offered advice to Arch Manning while admitting he wants the Longhorns quarterback to struggle when he faces the Aggies in November.",
  "content": "Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel wishes \"nothing but the best\" for Arch Manning as Manning embarks on his first season as a full-time starter with the Texas Longhorns.\n\nBut Manziel's own college football allegiance has him hoping Manning has his worst game of the year during Rivalry Week in college football.\n\nManziel's Texas A&M Aggies take priority over any Longhorns player.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"Whenever [Texas] plays Texas A&M, I hope he throws five picks and no touchdowns and gives us an opportunity to win that ballgame we need to win,\" Manziel told Fox News Digital while discussing his partnership with Sling TV.\n\n\"The Lone Star Showdown\" is the moniker for Texas-Texas A&M week, which is commonly played during Rivalry Week. This year, the game will be played Nov. 28, the latest regular-season game for the Aggies and Longhorns.\n\nSo, Manziel will have other weeks before that matchup to watch what the Longhorns and Manning are doing while rooting on his Aggies.\n\nARCHIE MANNING SAYS GRANDSON ARCH 'ISN'T GOING' TO DECLARE FOR THE 2026 NFL DRAFT\n\nManning's expectations as the Longhorns' starter are through the roof with Quinn Ewers moving on to the NFL. Texas is atop The Associated Press' Top 25 preseason poll, and many are picking them to win this year's College Football Playoff.\n\nManziel isn't going to go that far, but he is excited to see what Manning can do with the spotlight on him in Austin.\n\n\"Texas is starting out very highly ranked,\" Manziel said. \"A lot of hype around them, and there\u2019s a lot of pressure in that situation. But, from what he\u2019s shown so far, you\u2019d think he\u2019d be able to handle it, and he\u2019s going to play well. The SEC, week in and week out, we\u2019ll find out exactly what he\u2019s made of.\n\n\"For me, from my perspective, I\u2019m wishing him nothing but the best. Seems like an amazing kid, has an amazing family. I want him to do amazing things outside of that one day.\"\n\nManziel got to know the Manning family well, having won the coveted \"Manning Award\" for the best college football quarterback during his Heisman-winning 2012 campaign at A&M.\n\nArch has a strong support system with his uncles, Peyton and Eli Manning; his father, Cooper Manning; and his grandfather, New Orleans Saints legend Archie Manning. But Manziel is curious, like the rest of the country, to see how Arch does when he's between the lines facing the reigning national champion Ohio State Buckeyes to kick off his 2025 campaign.\n\n\"When you\u2019re ranked that high going into the season, and you have the hype and the name and everything that comes along with it, you\u2019re going to get everybody\u2019s best shot week in and week out,\" Manziel said. \"Right out of the gate for them in their schedule, they get a real test playing a real team out of the gate.\n\n\"So, you\u2019re getting everybody\u2019s best shot. People are coming for you, and there\u2019s gonna be defenses you haven\u2019t seen before, looks you haven\u2019t seen before. They\u2019re really going to be gunning for you.\"\n\nManziel knows the expectations of leading a highly-touted SEC school.\n\n\"The main thing that he has to do is just continue to be a good leader, continue to run the offense the way he\u2019s taught, the way he needs to, and just keep things in a good perspective that not everything is going to go smooth every single drive, every single week,\" Manziel said of Manning.\n\n\"You\u2019re going to deal with some adversity. You\u2019re going to have some ballgames that are three-point games where you have to try to hold people out, and hopefully they go your way.\n\n\"The best thing that he can do is show up, be the guy, be the leader, and go out and play his best football week in and week out.\"\n\nA DIFFERENT WAY TO WATCH FOOTBALL\n\nManziel partnered with Sling TV, a subsidiary of DISH Network Corporation, to promote a different way of watching football this season, one that takes the consumer into consideration.\n\nSling TV is offering three new streaming subscription packages: Day Pass, Weekend Pass and Week Pass, which all give 24-hour access to the platform.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen it comes to football, especially at the college level, not all fans want to pay a premium for games they won\u2019t watch. Manziel loves that he can pick and choose the right streaming subscription with Sling TV.\n\n\"I get these notifications on my phone that say, \u2018You get charged X amount for this or that.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Man, I\u2019m just trying to watch ball.\u2019 To have something start at $4.99, and you pick which one you want \u2014 you want a day, a week, a weekend. Being an SEC guy through and through, I think, for me, it makes it easy for me to watch whatever I want whenever I want, and it\u2019s really easy. You don\u2019t have to sit there with overhead or anything else going on. For me, I don\u2019t think it can be any better.\"\n\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",
