  "content": "HealthStream's (NASDAQ:HSTM) stock up by 4.7% over the past week. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study HealthStream's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for HealthStream is:\n\n5.8% = US$20m \u00f7 US$351m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.06 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nWhen you first look at it, HealthStream's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 5.8%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Having said that, HealthStream has shown a modest net income growth of 14% over the past five years. Given the slightly low ROE, it is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\n\nWe then performed a comparison between HealthStream's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 16% in the same 5-year period.",
