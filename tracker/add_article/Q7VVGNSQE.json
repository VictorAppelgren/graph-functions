      "summary": "Small‑cap stocks are currently undervalued relative to large caps, with the Russell 2000 trading at its lowest valuation since 2008 and a high proportion of negative‑earning companies.  A shift in investor sentiment could come from a rebound in IPO activity, improving fundamentals, and a new market regime that moves beyond the current speculative focus on AI and meme stocks.  Cyclical sectors such as financials, industrials and materials offer valuation discounts despite strong free cash flow, while healthcare and consumer discretionary remain less attractive due to heightened downside risk.  If these conditions persist, a paradigm shift toward small‑caps could materialize, but the timing remains uncertain.",
