      "feedback": "This draft correctly frames a three-regime lens and pools concrete policy/event anchors (90‑day tariff truce, Nvidia licensing, AI productivity tailwinds) but it overflows into macro narration and fails the required four-line Swing Trade/Outlook format plus a concise 1–2 line Outlook when appropriate. Actionable edits: (1) reformat strictly to exactly four lines for Movers & Scenarios (2 Up, 2 Down) with the exact schema: Direction | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %; ground each probability to material evidence and attach only IDs from SOURCE MATERIAL after the numeric claims (e.g., 60% (NOTMRPS8C)(OATKNJQ0E); 58% (P3SY5CIWY)(A8QHO9CST)(MHTXPY45K); 65% (NOTMRPS8C)(ZCBJZ55IT)(WACQ58GJF); 50% (OATKNJQ0E)(40M82JY72)); prune all nonessential macro prose. (2) Ensure a single tradable asset is assumed for Swing Trades and fill the two Swing Trade lines with precise, numeric entry/stop/target figures and clear triggers, e.g., Long | 4–8 weeks | Entry: close above a defined multi‑day/high threshold on NVDA/SOXX | Stop: 1.5% below entry | Target: 4–6% | R/R: ~2.0–2.5x | Invalidation: hawkish CPI or adverse licensing news | Trigger: CPI or licensing updates | Probability: 60% | Confidence: 65; and Long | 8–24 weeks | Entry: breakout above multi‑month high | Stop: below key support | Target: 12–18% | R/R: ~2x | Invalidation/Trigger as above | Probability: 50% | Confidence: 60. (3) Tighten alignment to the four lines by removing the broad “Macro-to-market” narrative, the long “Base/Alt/Bull/Bear” sections, and any content not directly supporting the four lines or the two Swing Trades; keep all claims tied to the IDs present and reconcile any conflicting signals (e.g., Regime A timing vs. Regime C growth thrust) with a single, coherent mapping: 90‑day truce extends policy clarity (OATKNJQ0E)(NOTMRPS8C) → softer near‑term inflation path supports easing expectations; export‑controls risk channels (Regime B) and AI productivity uplift (Regime C) anchor the longer horizon (AMHSWFZZI)(40M82JY72). (4) Audit citations so every factual/number claim has a corresponding in‑text (ID) citation; ensure all critical sources are covered (NOTMRPS8C, OATKNJQ0E, P3SY5CIWY, A8QHO9CST, MHTXPY45K, ZCBJZ55IT, WACQ58GJF, 40M82JY72, AMHSWFZZI) and that any conflicts are reconciled in a single line per theme. (5) Sharpen the causal chain to a crisp first‑principles logic: tariffs/truces affect inflation pass‑through, which shapes capex/margins and thus equity/credit/FX pricing; Regime B’s export‑control risk constrains supply chains and capex, while Regime C’s AI‑driven productivity uplifts potential growth and can compress risk premia if inflation remains contained; tie each mover to a concrete, observable trigger. (6) Add a concise “Asset/Market context” note for the Swing Trades to confirm tradability and liquidity, and ensure the output strictly adheres to length/format constraints with no trailing sections or extraneous paragraphs.",
