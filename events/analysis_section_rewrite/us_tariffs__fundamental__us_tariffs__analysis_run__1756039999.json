      "feedback": "The draft correctly ties a multi‑year tariff/deregulation backdrop to market pricing, but it needs a sharper, mechanics‑driven structure to reach world‑class level. Specific, actionable edits: 1) embed a formal regime map (three to four states) anchored by first‑principles invariants (real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity, BoP/imputed net external position, policy reaction functions) and explicit transition conditions (tariff list updates, legal rulings, CRA/REINS actions, congressional action). State the regimes clearly (e.g., baseline tariff stability with selective exemptions; escalation/coordination risk; deregulation/delay‑regulation mix) and show how each regime would price risk premia and channels to asset prices. 2) deepen the causal chain with a quantified, multi‑step transmission: tariffs raise import costs (e.g., 15% across most EU goods; 18.6% average tariff) into consumer prices and inflation expectations; pass‑through varies by category (wine, autos, food) and by pass‑through speed; corporate investment and supply chains reallocate (Intel CHIPS subsidies and a possible equity stake alter risk/returns); cross‑border frictions and capex cycles (Adyen’s geographies, tariff headwinds) shift volatility and funding costs. Tie each link to a concrete data point (cite RHFWI02JT for the framework; 5M9M1KACF for Intel/CHIPS; QRX2HD4X0 for payments/headwinds; 2SJORBV6H for Japan steel) and, where possible, quantify ranges (e.g., short‑term price impact 0–2% per Yale Budget Lab/AP estimates; long‑run pass‑through risk). 3) Expand scenario depth beyond base case: specify plausible up/downside paths (e.g., tariff escalation to 20–30% on broad baskets; a full or partial reversal by CRA/REINS; successful EU exemptions on wine or steel quotas) and assign probability weights so the weighted price/volatility implications add up. 4) Make the base case explicitly contingent on political/legal milestones; specify invalidation triggers (court rulings blocking tariffs; failure to reach agreed exemptions; negative revenue/price pass‑through evidence) and how the model would re‑price risk if those occur. 5) Reconcile conflicts between Trump’s deregulation push and Biden/legacy competition rhetoric by presenting a tight, testable framework: what deregulation would mean for sector margins and R&D in the near term vs. what antitrust/regulatory signals could do to productivity and capital allocation over the horizon. 6) Strengthen linkages to “watch” signals and catalysts: Intel financing/production timing; momentum of CRA/REINS actions; Adyen’s regional expansion/embedded‑finance roadmap; Japan’s anti‑dumping probe outcomes; and the China tariff trajectory. 7) Tighten sourcing discipline: attach every substantive claim to a source ID (RHFWI02JT, 5M9M1KACF, 9W8ZUIBDY, QRX2HD4X0, 2SJORBV6H) and avoid aggregating disparate narratives without explicit cross‑source reconciliation. 8) Improve precision of language (replace generic “risk” phrasing with estimate‑orients like “near‑term inflation impulse of X–Y bps,” “CAPEX reallocation to Y,” or “$Z impact on earnings per share”) and maintain consistent monetary units. 9) Add an explicit multi‑year invariant: a single, defensible anchor (e.g., long‑run real rate differential or terms‑of‑trade stance) that governs price formation across regimes, plus a concise “base case, upside, downside, and most probable path” box. 10) Finally, trim repetition and strengthen executive summary cadence so the base case, key risks, and watch list are immediately apparent, with each claim tethered to a precise, cited data point.",
