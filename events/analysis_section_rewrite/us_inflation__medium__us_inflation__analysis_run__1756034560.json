      "feedback": "Strong multi‑source stitching, but the piece needs a tight, testable 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, invalidations, and quantified bets. Edit plan: 1) Rebuild as a scenario map (Base Case, Alt‑A, Alt‑B) anchored to a clear causal chain: AI/tech productivity lifts supply potential and nudges disinflation despite wage pressure (cite Range’s 6B AUM with 0% AUM, 21% US co‑ownership growth, 18.8% cash‑on‑cash on mogul; 32B ECG market; Pacaso 10 international destinations and >$1.8T vacation‑home market), with BoJ/Ueda and U.S. wage dynamics supplying policy risk signals; 2) specify timing windows: Pacaso/Mogul Range milestones within 0–3 months; HeartSciences FDA pathway and Medicare reimbursement momentum in 2025–26; UAS hiring/data tracking in 2025–26; 3) crisply lay out catalysts/triggers and invalidations: e.g., Pacaso expansion completed (trigger); Range onboarding metric surpasses a defined pace (trigger); HeartSciences FDA submission approved (trigger) or delayed (invalidation); Range/Mogul private‑market liquidity proves illiquid (invalidation); AI productivity undershoots (invalidation); 4) quantify, not describe: attach numeric ranges (e.g., AI productivity gains 0.5–1.5% real GDP lift; Pacaso international revenue share to 22% of past two years; Mogul 10–12% cash‑on‑cash, 18.8% including appreciation; Range 0% AUM but growing advisory share; HeartSciences market size ~$32B ECG by 2034 with Medicare reimbursement starting 2025); 5) structure the argument with explicit sources after each data point (IDs only: UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, FOM34PUWA, A7VLN74BK, V8TEZOR8R); 6) reconcile conflicts and caveats: address Range’s 0% AUM claim alongside typical AUM costs; flag regulatory/illiquidity risks in private markets (Pacaso, Mogul, Range) and FDA/regulatory risk for HeartSciences; 7) end with a clean decision slate: Base Case narrative, 1–2 clear Alts, the principal Risks, a concise Watch‑List (milestones and data prints to watch), and a stated Confidence level; 8) tighten first‑principles grounding by linking productivity, inflation, rates, and asset pricing to the transmission channels rather than relying on rhetorical statements; 9) remove loosely connected elements (e.g., tire reviews) or explicitly tie them as consumer‑spending price‑discipline checks if you keep them. This will yield a compact, 1–2 page, horizon‑aligned piece that meets the section focus and maximizes signal density.",
