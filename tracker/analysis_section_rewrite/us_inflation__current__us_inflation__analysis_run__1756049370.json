      "feedback": "This analysis has solid directional signals but needs a tighter, 0–3 week frame with a crisp causal chain, explicit thresholds, and stronger use of numbers; to upgrade, restructure into a single, tightly linked base-case with clear near-term catalysts and a concise monitoring map, anchoring every claim to the relevant IDs (S15934PBQ, 6OOEK8TUR, 6U8VYS7BA, XB5ZRN1VP, 4/5/6/7 for the Beasley/cap pieces). Specifically: (1) sharpen the causal chain by separating: immediate policy drivers (tariff roll-back from 27.5% to 15% and observed auto-price pass-through) with concrete anchors (S15934PBQ); near-term demand signals from Vegas pricing pressures (6OOEK8TUR) and the Labor Day promo cycle (6U8VYS7BA); and how these feed 0–3 week pricing and sentiment in consumer/discretionary equities. (2) quantify where possible: quote the price examples in Vegas (Diet Coke $15, water $26, nachos $40, chips $21, $34.50 nuts) and the 20%/discount pulls in Labor Day coverage (Pottery Barn 20% off; broader deals across Amazon/REI/etc. per 6U8VYS7BA); for Beasley, keep the contract math explicit (three-year, $42M vs max $7.2M with non-Bird, Early Bird rights, projected MLEs around $15.0M) with citations (4, 5, 6). (3) add a formal 3-week reaction function with explicit invalidate/invalidations: if CPI/PCE run hotter than a defined threshold or tariff pass-through persists into consumer prices beyond current estimates, tighten risk-off in discretionary/lodging names; if inflation cools or promo activity intensifies and Vegas indicators stabilize, tilt to a risk-on cue; invalidate on a tariff reversal or a material policy shift; (4) tighten the Section Focus by adding a precise “watch list” and clear levels/thresholds: e.g., watch tariff-driven price transmission in autos (anchor to S15934PBQ), Vegas ADR/visitors (qualitative margin if not numeric, but label as a proxy for consumer demand), and the Beasley cap/market signaling (4, 5, 6, 7) for team-budget dynamics; (5) reconcile conflicts: acknowledge that Toyota/Honda/Nissan and others deny tariff-driven price increases (S15934PBQ) while Nikkei data indicate pass-through, and present this as a conditional risk rather than a one-way outcome; phrase conservatively and triangulate with multiple sources rather than a single sensational takeaway (S15934PBQ, 6OOEK8TUR, 4, 5). (6) strengthen first-principles grounding by a concise paragraph on cost-push versus demand-pull inflation and how small-capital reallocation (MLE cap space in Detroit, Nets/Wizards trade-offs; see XB5ZRN1VP, 6) shapes near-term pricing and sentiment. (7) ensure density and correctness of citations: after every factual anchor (tariffs, auto-price pass-through, Vegas price levels, Labor Day markdowns, Beasley payoffs/constraints, cap-space mechanics), append the exact ID. (8) tighten prose to avoid hedging and generic statements; replace “risk is elevated” with specific, sourced pivots and explicit thresholds; (9) format as a compact 0–3 week scenario with a concise monitor list and a single, coherent causal chain tying policy, pricing, and market reaction together, rather than parallel threads. This will yield a world-class, testable 0–3 week brief with actionable levels, catalysts, invalidation criteria, and clearly reconciled source tensions.",
