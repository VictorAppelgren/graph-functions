  "title": "ADNOC L&S CFO on $317M Secondary Share Sale",
  "description": "Abu Dhabi\u2019s state energy company completed a  $317 million placement to institutional investors of approximately 222 million shares in ADNOC Logistics and Services. CFO Nicholas Gleeson speaks to Bloomberg's Horizons Middle East and Africa anchor Joumanna Bercetche about the share sale and a potential MSCI inclusion, investors' demand, the outlook for the company and signs of growth across the region. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Nick, thanks so much for joining us. A big, big day for Adnoc L.A. You've completed placement of 222 million shares with institutional investors. That represents about 3% of the total outstanding share capital. And with that, it increases the company's free float to around 22%. So first of all, let me just start off by asking you whether you were pleased with the book building process. I know it took about 4 hours in total for the books to close. Thanks very much for having me on. And yeah, we're absolutely thrilled with the outcome of the book building, which of course is done by the selling shareholder, our parent. But it was oversubscribed seven times on just a four hour bookbuild at a price which is very tightly adjusted to the pricing of the last few days. So it's a really good outcome and it demonstrates really strong demand for the stock. Now, it could eventually open the path for MSCI inclusion. What would that mean for your company? What does it offer to you in terms of extra markets or extra liquidity? Yeah, so MSCI inclusion is really important for us and in particular for our international shareholders. We've had a number of shareholders over the past year who've been signaling that they'd like to take a larger position in our stock because they understand our growth story and the tremendous opportunities that we have ahead of us. But their ability to participate in the stock is limited by daily liquidity in the shares. So MSCI inclusion will usually see a significant boost in liquidity and it will improve the number of international investor mandates that we sit on to participate in the stock. Are there any particular investors or a specific investor base that you're looking to target with a potential MSCI inclusion? Yeah. So I can't give any names, obviously, but there's a large number of, for example, long only funds that you see in the U.S. and in Western Europe that have demonstrated a strong appetite to participate. So, you know, after meeting with them over the past year, we've certainly had them in mind when the bulk bill was done. Yeah, well, I'm sure you had many conversations in the run up to this share sale and probably got a good feel for the market. What do you expect to see more of these types of share sales throughout the course of this year? Not necessarily from us, but but do you sense that things are about to pick up in the region in terms of activity as we head into Q4? I definitely think that's the case. So what I see when I meet with investors internationally is that most regard themselves as underweight the Gulf. In their current positions, they're looking for the right stocks to invest in. Liquidity is really important to accessing the stocks here, and we're seeing boosted liquidity. The ADX has done a great job in making its stocks known internationally and in boosting that liquidity of of stock turnover. So I do think we'll see more and more activity here on the ADX and more broadly in the region. Yeah, well, we weren't able to speak around your earnings, but the earnings did come in quite strong above market expectations. EBIDTA $744 million. You upgraded your full year guidance, you increased your dividends by 5%. So think things seem to be going well. What's next for the company? Yeah, so things are going really well, I think really important in our first half results this year as we delivered $604 million of operating free cash flow again ahead of expectations. So what we're showing the market now is we have the ability to fund all of the value accretive growth that we've promised to the market and much more. Our guidance is based on what we've already committed to the market and what we've already communicated, but we've got about $3 billion of capacity to deliver highly value accretive investments beyond what's included in our guidance to the market. So there's a lot of upside room for the company that free cash also positions us to relook at how we reward shareholders for participation in the stock. You know, so I think we'll see more discussion over time around how we look at dividend policy in relation to that very strong free cash generation by the company. And obviously you're the CFO of the company, so you have to be thinking about how are you going to be deploying the cash and the free cash flow that you're generating. You're saying that you're you know, it offers the opportunity to increase the amount of returns to your shareholders. But how do you also think about reinvesting in the business and on the capital expenditure side of things and possibly even going down the route of M & A? Yeah. So we've had a couple of really successful imitators in the last three years. We acquired Zack Marine in late 2022. That's outperformed expectations at the time of the investment substantially. We've grown the fleet from 27 jackup barges, which was already the world leading fleet to now 42 jackup barges. So it's been incredibly successful. They're operating at high utilization, delivering really strong returns. At the beginning of this year, we completed the navigate acquisition, $1,000,000,000 for 80% of navigate that extended outreach to 19 cities globally and has had a dramatic upside performance on our chartering capabilities in tankers in particular. So we're growing very rapidly and we've got two great platforms for future growth, that additional $3 billion of capacity I look at, that'll be applied between both organic and inorganic growth. But any M & A investment that we make is likely to be only in high quality platforms which extend our international reach and capabilities for energy, maritime logistics. Yeah. And maybe just to round up a macro question for you. Where are the strongest growth signals coming from geographically at this point in time? Yeah. So there's a lot I think where we're sitting right now is probably one of the strongest. I think the Gulf is doing extremely well in the UAE in particular is doing extremely well. There's so much growth which is coming out of the Adnoc platform here in the UAE, as well as through their international investments. We're seeing them growing in Africa. We see growth in the US and in China. So in the energy segment, we see strong growth signals across the board. Nick, we're going to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us and congratulations on a very successful book building process today.",
