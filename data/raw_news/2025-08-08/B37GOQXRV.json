      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nYou see a shocking number of ads daily \u2013 researchers estimate between 6,000 and 10,000 and 375 to 625 per waking hour. In the modern age, most of them come from social media apps whose entire business model revolves around constantly showing you ads and keeping 100% of the revenue. But what if users got a share? That company might just grow its revenue by 32,481% in three years, help users earn and save $325 million and be named Deloitte's fastest-growing software company in North America. That\u2019s what Mode Mobile did. You can still get in for just $0.30 per share.\nReaching Financial Stability One Tap at a Time\nMost Americans can\u2019t afford a $1,000 emergency bill. That means many are one car breakdown or ER visit away from serious financial trouble. There's no quick fix to such a big financial challenge that over 50% of Americans face. However, it's safe to bet that the masses will flock to any good solutions. Mode Mobile created one such solution years ago by allowing people to earn money doing what they already spend a third of their waking hours on \u2013 tapping, scrolling and looking at their smartphone screens.\nMode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. However, users can earn income on their existing devices as well. This extreme competitiveness has allowed Mode Mobile to attract over 50 million registered beta users. Launching the finalized version could bring in millions more, helping the company reach its goal of $150 million in annual revenue within three years.\n6,955,000,000 Users to Go\nCurrently, seven billion smartphones worldwide provide functionality or entertainment but take all the profits. Mode Mobile\u2019s disruption offers the same benefits but allows users to earn money at a time when the prices of goods are skyrocketing. Just like Airbnb lets users earn extra cash by renting out their bedrooms and Uber allows users to make money on their rides back home from work, Mode Mobile wants to enable its users to make money from their phones. However, its total addressable market is much larger than Airbnb\u2019s and Uber\u2019s \u2013 currently at over $1 trillion.\nYou can invest in Mode Mobile at $0.30 per share with a minimum investment of $4,950. Plus, the company is offering the chance to earn up to 120% in bonus shares, if you invest more. All funding rounds open to non-accredited investors, including Mode Mobile\u2019s, are limited in time. So, if you\u2019d like to be part of the future it's building, consider acting soon.\nDisclaimer:\nAN OFFERING STATEMENT REGARDING THIS OFFERING HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE SEC. THE SEC HAS QUALIFIED THAT OFFERING STATEMENT, WHICH ONLY MEANS THAT THE COMPANY MAY MAKE SALES OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED BY THE OFFERING STATEMENT. THE OFFERING CIRCULAR THAT IS PART OF THAT OFFERING STATEMENT IS AVAILABLE HERE.\nMode Mobile recently received their ticker reservation with Nasdaq ($MODE), indicating an intent to IPO in the next 24 months. An intent to IPO is no guarantee that an actual IPO will occur.\nThe Deloitte rankings are based on submitted applications and public company database research, with winners selected based on their fiscal-year revenue growth percentage over a three-year period.\nDisclaimer: Please be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nWhile many companies tout and claim AI capabilities, only one has developed a technology that\u2019s delivering triple-digit returns on investment for some of the largest Fortune 1000 companies.\nTake Hasbro for example. When the iconic toy company wanted to relaunch HeroQuest\u2014a beloved 1980s board game\u2014they faced a familiar marketing challenge\u2014how to reach both nostalgic fans and new audiences in a fragmented digital landscape.\nTheir solution came from a company most people have never heard of, despite its growing influence with major brands. Using RAD Intel's AI-powered platform, Hasbro achieved over 120% improved paid performance, nearly 90% higher engagement rates, and doubled content effectiveness \u2013 impressive results in today\u2019s highly competitive, noisy gaming market.\nNamed a \u201cgroundbreaking step for the creator economy\u201d by Fast Company, Rad Intel has already attracted the interest of more than 9,000 investors, including insiders from Adobe, Fidelity Ventures, Google, Meta, Amazon, and YouTube, and raised more than $41 million.\nHaving seen its valuation grow 1,600% in just four years, RAD Intel is now offering accredited investors an early opportunity to join a company that other investors have called their \u201cbest seed investment ever.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, RAD Intel has secured its official NASDAQ ticker\u2014RADI. It\u2019s locked in and marks a significant step toward the public markets, backed by real traction and accelerating scale.\nFrom A Fortune 1000 Secret to an $85M Valuation\nFounded by serial entrepreneur Jeremy Barnett and tech veteran Bradley Silver, RAD Intel has quietly built a strong client roster and boasts activations across the likes of Fortune 1000 brands, including Hasbro, Skechers, Home Depot, Sephora, Fenty, Sweetgreen, MGM, Omnicom, Since Tomorrow, Glossier, Athelta, and The North Face.\nThe company's rise hasn't gone completely unnoticed by institutional investors, either. RAD Intel has secured over $49 million in funding from venture capitalists, Fortune 1000 companies and tech industry insiders\u2014including Adobe, and insiders from Google, Amazon, YouTube, and Meta.\nThat traction is opening doors fast\u2014embedding Rad Intel in every critical moment where brands battle for consumer attention and measurable growth. Investors have seen the company\u2019s valuation grow from $5 million to $85 million in just four years, in large part due to being a leader in AI.\nAccording to Boston Consulting Group, companies that are already scaling AI\u2014like Rad Intel\u2014 expect a 60% higher revenue growth over the next three years than their peers. Additionally, AI leaders achieved 1.5 times higher revenue growth, 1.6 times greater shareholder returns, and 1.4 times higher ROIs.\nAI That Actually Works: 12+ Years of Research Behind the Tech\nAI is everywhere these days, but RAD Intel's technology stands apart. Built on more than a decade of research and development \u2014 and years of real-world client success.\n\"We've created an artificial intelligence that understands the language of the internet,\" CEO Jeremy Barnett told Forbes last year. The proprietary AI analyzes datasets from Reddit, Google, and social platforms to gauge real-time sentiments and trends, helping brands make data-driven decisions rather than relying on outdated assumptions or personal bias.\nThe platform's capabilities solve three marketing challenges:\n1. The Audience Problem\nRAD Intel's persona generator reveals exactly who a brand's customers are\u2014their topics, interests, and the triggers that drive them to action. It eliminates guesswork in customer targeting.\n2. The Influencer Problem\nThe platform's AI identifies the perfect personalities to deliver a brand's message for maximum ROI, ranking influencers based on expertise, audience demographics, and authentic engagement.\n3. The Content Problem\nBefore content creation begins, RAD Intel's technology reveals what customers care about, who's best to deliver the message, and the key ingredients for content that resonates\u2014and often goes viral.\nThe capabilities have delivered impressive results across industries:\n- For Sweetgreen: nearly 200% improved ad performance and 25%+ improved cost per acquisition\n- For The Black Tux: 40% cost savings and over 90% campaign lift\n- For Ro Health: nearly 4x ROI and 5x engagements\n- For MGM Resorts: nearly 3.3x ROI and 482,000 engagements\nGrowth Strategy: Doubling Down on Success\nRAD Intel isn't just adding clients\u2014it's deepening relationships with existing ones. Contracts for 2025 have already doubled from 2024, with expanded agreements from top clients like Hasbro and Omnicom added to the fold.\nThe company is also implementing a novel growth strategy called \"Artificial Intelligence Buyouts\" (AIBOs), which refers to acquiring small and medium-sized marketing agencies and integrating RAD Intel's AI technology to boost their capabilities and profitability.\nAccording to its website, the company \u201caims to acquire legacy marketing agencies and integrate RAD Intel's technology to deliver material revenue synergies and operational efficiencies.\" They're targeting agencies with $5 million to $30 million in revenue that are EBITDA positive with strong recurring client bases, established sales forces and experienced client success teams.\nThis strategy will allow RAD Intel to scale rapidly through acquisition while bringing AI capabilities to traditional agencies\u2014creating value for both the acquired businesses and RAD Intel investors.\nExpanding the AI Edge\nRad Intel recently raised $12 million through its Reg A funding round, which it will use to fuel several growth initiatives:\n- Further development of RAD Intel's technology to improve paid advertising across Google, TikTok, and Meta\n- Innovation of enterprise solutions with API partners like TikTok to enhance content insights\n- Recruitment of top-tier talent across AI, product development, operations, and sales\n- Implementation of additional self-serve features for enterprise clients\n- Continuous improvement of client success rates through AI-informed performance analytics\nEntrepreneur magazine recognized RAD Intel as \"positioned to influence the market\" in the AI revolution, noting that \"the true winners in the AI revolution will be those who can effectively leverage it to solve real-world problems.\"\nLimited-Time Investment Opportunity\nInterested accredited investors have an opportunity to join before it's too late. This pre-IPO high-growth startup is currently offering equity shares at $0.63 each, with a minimum investment of $4,999.68.\nAs Fast Company said, \"It's only a matter of time before RAD's platform is a household name.\" For accredited investors looking to participate in the AI transformation of marketing, this offering represents an opportunity to join over 9,000 others who have already recognized RAD Intel's potential to reshape how brands connect with consumers in the digital age.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "Looking into the current session, Micron Technology Inc. MU shares are trading at $105.45, after a 3.38% decrease. Over the past month, the stock fell by 12.06%, but over the past year, it actually went up by 16.63%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio.\nA Look at Micron Technology P/E Relative to Its Competitors\nThe P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.\nCompared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 73.24 in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry, Micron Technology Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 19.66. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.\nIn conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions.\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first. They can help you:\n- Create a tax-smart drawdown plan\n- Manage and grow a diversified investment portfolio\n- Maximize Social Security strategies\n- Protect assets for your spouse or heirs\n- The matching service is fast and free\u2014and designed specifically for individuals with significant investable assets who are looking for personalized, high-quality advice.\nTake the first step toward a more confident retirement. If you have at least $100,000 in investable assets, WiserAdvisor can match you with a pre-screened fiduciary financial advisor in your area.\nBook here to get started; no cost, no obligation.\nBenzinga Money is a reader-supported publication.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A.
