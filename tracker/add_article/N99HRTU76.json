      "summary": "On August 14, 2025, the S&P 500 closed slightly higher, marking its third consecutive record close, while major U.S. equity indexes remained mostly unchanged amid concerns over rising wholesale inflation indicated by the Producer Price Index (PPI) report. Intel's stock surged over 7% following news of potential government investment, while Tapestry's shares plummeted 15% due to a lowered profit outlook impacted by tariffs. The PPI rose 0.9% in July, exceeding expectations and raising doubts about a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September.",
