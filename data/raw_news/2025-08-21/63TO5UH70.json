  "title": "How to watch out-of-market NFL games: Do you need NFL Sunday Ticket?",
  "description": "It's expensive being a fan of a non-local team.",
  "content": "Figuring out how to watch the entire NFL season in 2025 is complicated. But it gets really frustrating when you live in a different region than your favorite team. Watching out-of-market games for any sport is no walk in the park, but for the NFL, it's an excruciating battle \u2014 particularly for your wallet.\n\nBefore you pull the trigger on any pay TV provider or streaming service, you may want to check to see what games are considered in-market and out-of-market for your region. You don't want to drop $60 on an annual Paramount+ plan or splurge on the new $199 Fox One streaming platform only to find out the games you want to watch are blacked out.\n\nWhat are in-market vs. out-of-market NFL games?\n\nIn-market games are basically your home team broadcasts, or the games geographically closest to you. These are the games you'll regularly find on CBS and Fox on Sunday afternoons. Out-of-market games are those only available outside of the designated broadcast region you are in. These games are blacked out (unless they are national broadcasts) in favor of in-market games. For instance, I am a Baltimore Ravens fan living in Nashville, Tenn. The Tennessee Titans are my local team, which means their games are in-market for me on Sundays. If both the Titans and Ravens are playing in the 1:00 p.m. time slot on Sunday, I will only be able to watch the Titans. The Ravens will be blacked out, as they are considered out-of-market.\n\nTo find out which games are in your local market each week, check out 506sports.com.\n\nSo, you live in a different region than the team(s) you want to watch. That means the usual streaming services that broadcast NFL games \u2014 ESPN, Paramount+, YouTube TV, etc. \u2014 aren't going to work for you. With those, you'll only be able to watch in-market teams and national broadcasts. Womp womp.\n\nIn this case, the only legal way you can watch out-of-market games is via NFL Sunday Ticket. Sure, there are plenty of bootleg broadcasts floating around the internet, but we can't in good conscience recommend those. NFL Sunday Ticket is the league's own premium sports package that broadcasts NFL regular season games that are unavailable on your local channels. It carries regional Sunday afternoon games on Fox and CBS, specifically. You can get NFL Sunday Ticket as an individual channel on YouTube or as an add-on to YouTube TV.\n\nHow much does NFL Sunday Ticket cost?\n\nI won't sugarcoat it for you: NFL Sunday ticket is outrageously expensive unless you're brand new to the service. Through Aug. 31, newbies can score NFL Sunday Ticket as an individual channel on YouTube or as a YouTube TV add-on for $276 total for the regular season (8 payments of $34.50 per month). For returning customers, it'll cost $480 total as an individual channel (8 payments of $60 per month) or $378 total as a YouTube TV add-on (8 payments of $47.25 per month). Students, military personnel, first responders, medical professionals, and teachers can all get discounted rates (see below).\n\nStarting in September, there will also be month-to-month plans available. For new users, it'll cost $85 per month on the monthly plan, while returning customers will pay $115 per month for the YouTube TV add-on and $145 per month for the individual channel.\n\u2022 None $119 for students who can verify their eligibility\n\u2022 None $198 for Military & Veterans, First Responders, Medical Community, and Teachers\n\u2022 None $85 per month for new users\n\u2022 None $115 per month for returning users bundled with YouTube TV\n\u2022 None $145 per month for returning users without YouTube TV\n\nHow to sign up for NFL Sunday Ticket\n\nTo get NFL Sunday Ticket, head over to YouTube.com/NFL and a prompt will pop up with the details to sign up. If you don't see the prompt, just click on \"get NFL Sunday Ticket\" to the right of the NFL logo. You'll see options to sign up for both YouTube TV and NFL Sunday Ticket, NFL Sunday Ticket only, or the Student Plan. If you want to sign up for the military, first responder, medical professional, or teacher rate, you'll have to go through id.me.",

      "text": "YouTube TV: Here's what you need to know\nIf you mainly watch television on streaming services like Netflix and Max, you might be missing the one great community aspect of cable \u2014 live TV.\nLaunched in 2017, YouTube TV brings you what you're missing without cable \u2014 kind of. You choose a plan that's right for you, and you've got entertainment, news, live sports, and more at your fingertips. It's similar to other live TV streaming services, like Hulu + Live TV. Now you don't have to mute dozens of words on social media before you can catch up on your favorite shows.\nIf you're thinking about subscribing to YouTube TV, here's what you need to know before signing up.\nHow much is YouTube TV?\nYouTube TV starts at $72.99 per month for the Base Plan (it's currently $57.99 for your first three months), and increases with each add on you choose. The price has more than doubled since launching \u2014 it was initially $35 per month in 2017 \u2014 and has been jacked up several times over the last few years with various licensing deals.\nWhat can you watch on YouTube TV?\nIt depends on what add-ons you choose, but YouTube TV lets you stream live and local sports, news, shows from more than 100 channels. The Base Plan includes major networks like NBC, CBS, ABC, and FOX, sports networks like ESPN, NBA, and MLB and NFL \u2014 YouTube TV was the exclusive home of the NFL Sunday Ticket in 2023. The Base Plan also includes some 100 plus more channels, including PBS, TNT, BET, TBS, Comedy Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon.\nAdd-on networks include AMC+, HBO's Max, Shudder, STARZ, Fox Soccer Plus, Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, and more \u2014 each with its own price point.\nEach area has a different list of local and regional programming, of course, but you can see which networks are provided in your area with YouTube TV by putting your zip code in on its site.\nYou also have unlimited space to store recorded shows, allowing you to rewind, fast forward, and pause whenever you want \u2014 your recordings are kept for nine months.\nHow many people can use YouTube TV?\nThe Base Plan includes three simultaneous streams, meaning one person can be watching a show on their phone while another is watching a show in the living room and a third person is watching a show on their laptop. And it's six accounts per household.\nWhat is the downside of YouTube TV?\nAdd-ons aren't included, so if you want to upgrade your TV experience by adding networks, sports, Spanish language TV, and 4K, you'll have to shell out some extra money. And, when your starting point is already $73 every month, those add-ons can really add up.\nYouTube has also recently made ads unskippable on YouTube TV.\nIf you want a first-hand account, Mashable's Alex Perry wrote about why he switched from Sling to YouTube TV. And if you're not into YouTube TV after subscribing, here's how to cancel it.\nTopics YouTube\nChristianna Silva is a senior culture reporter covering social platforms and the creator economy, with a focus on the intersection of social media, politics, and the economic systems that govern us.

      "text": "What's the best time of year to buy a TV? Yes, there's an answer.\nTable of Contents\nOn any given day, poking around for TVs on sale is all but guaranteed to turn up at least some decent steals.\nOf course, retailers don't casually offer their best TV prices year-round, and tariffs have made tech deals in general feel more scarce than usual this year. Though TVs weren't affected as overtly as the Nintendo Switch 2 or Xbox consoles, a majority of the best TV brands do their manufacturing in countries facing steep import rates.\nAside from Black Friday, NFL playoffs season, spring, and Amazon Prime Day are three other times that you'll find a lot of TVs on sale (and at lower-than-usual sale prices), including premium flagship models that don't get much action otherwise.\nIt's easiest to think about the strategy as a cycle: Whichever of these big sale windows is coming up next will probably match, or even beat, most of the deals seen during whichever sale window came right before it. For instance, Prime Day 2025 just out-priced most of the best TV deals we saw during football season in February, but will probably be out-priced by Prime Day 2 in October and Black Friday.\nAt any rate, knowing when TVs are cheaper than usual is a good adult shopping skill to have. The selection of live TV deals fluctuates depending on the month, and understanding the peaks of the TV calendar is a crucial chapter in the unofficial TV buyer's guide. (If your search is a more straightforward \"just tell me the best TV deals right now\" vibe, check out Mashable's dedicated TV tab. If we find a noteworthy deal on a specific TV on any given day, it'll pop up here.)\nThe #1 best time to buy a TV: Black Friday and Cyber Monday\nMonths: Late October, November, and early to mid-December\nPeople may not be throwing down in a Best Buy parking lot at the crack of dawn anymore, but Black Friday TV deals are still unmatched \u2014 they just don't require you to wake up at 2 a.m. anymore.\nBlack Friday is trending toward a month-long affair at this point, with retailers shifting into Black Friday mode online as early as October. The extended time frame raises the question of whether TV sale prices will drop even further closer to Black Friday. Thankfully, most of the big retailers aren't trying to trick you \u2014 in fact, Best Buy and Samsung will straight-up tag a certain deal as a Black Friday deal if they drop it ahead of time, confirming to buyers that there's no need to hold out until the week of Thanksgiving.\nThis is an especially auspicious time for budget shoppers looking for the cheapest possible version of a 4K TV at a certain size. During Black Friday, basic budget-friendly 4K TVs are typically the doorbusters that sell out soon after they drop \u2014 and are much less likely to return in the next few months.\nIn-store or not, Best Buy TV deals during Black Friday include elite prices on top 65-inch TVs (or larger). You can save hundreds on high-end QLEDs, OLEDs, and big-screen cheap QLEDs at shockingly low prices. Budget-friendly TVs get even more. Walmart also stays in the mix with a handful of wild doorbuster deals on the best cheap TVs. Amazon mostly dabbles in the affordable TV crowd and focuses on its own Fire TVs, which often drop to record-low prices.\nPost-holiday sales and New Year sales are absolutely a thing, but you can be confident that most TV prices are generally better before Christmas than after. We've seen firsthand how sale prices on TVs subtly go up by $100 or two (or three) during post-holiday sales. However, if you miss the Black Friday-Cyber Monday season, another chance to save soon follows...\nThe second-best time to find TV deals: NFL playoff season\nMonths: Mid-January to early February\nThe people want to know: Are TVs cheaper after the holidays? The answer is technically yes, but not in the \"after-Christmas sales slash New Year's sales\" way that you're thinking.\nIf you didn't snag your TV during Black Friday, your next best bet is to wait in the wings until the end of January for football-fueled deals, which kick off near the start of the NFL playoffs (sometime in mid to late January) and last until the big game (some in early to mid-February).\nThe month-long lead-up to the biggest football game of the year \u2014 one of the most-watched sporting events of the year \u2014 is prime time to find a TV on sale. In particular, these deals may focus more on TVs that are good for watching sports: i.e., big-screen QLEDs. The vibrant lighting supplied by a QLED panel is ideal for following small details like a ball or tiny score box, as well as the brightness of the team's colors and the field to make your experience feel as live and in-person as possible. It's not uncommon for most of these deals to be identical to what we saw during Black Friday, or in some cases, drop even lower in price due to proximity to CES. (See explanation below.)\nThere is one group of TVs that still may not be seeing their lowest possible sale price during football sales: If you're eyeing one of the most premium, most recent models from a certain brand and still aren't seeing a discount of more than $100 or two, you might consider pumping the breaks until spring.\nThe third-best time to find TV deals: Spring\nMonths: March and April\nFlagship TVs don't go on sale that often. And even when we get deals, the discounts hardly feel like a deal. (Oh, wow: $200 off a $2,000 TV? You shouldn't have.)\nUntil CES happens, that is. CES is a Las Vegas-based tech trade show where the latest and greatest consumer tech is unveiled to gadget enthusiasts. The annual TV release cycle mostly revolves around CES, as it's where brands like Samsung, LG, TCL, and Hisense show off their new TV designs for the year. While these fresh releases aren't the ones going on sale, those splashy new TV releases do force last year's models to go on sale.\nThe key here is that the best deals start not when the TVs are announced at the event in January, but once they're officially up for grabs to the public in the spring. As of May 2025, most highly-awaited flagship TVs for the year are out, or at least have prices announced. For example, LG released the OLED C5 OLED in March, TCL released the QM6K Mini LED in March, and Samsung released the Frame Pro and unveiled prices for its S95F OLED in April. Funny enough, we caught some small discounts on those new models in their first weeks on the market. But the real hack is to look for deals on the predecessors (like the LG C4 OLED or older Samsung Frame models) right after the new models drop.\nThe one outlier here is Sony, which has been sitting CES out for the past few years in favor of its own release schedule \u2014 a very Apple and iRobot-coded tactic. In 2023 and 2025, Sony announced its new TV lines for the year in March, though it deviated in 2024 with a June launch. Sony's slightly differing release calendar doesn't change the fact that Black Friday and football season are the main times for discounts. Then, Sony's discounts throughout the year will simply depend on when its annual TV lineup launches. Its 2025 Bravia 8 II OLED and Bravia 5 and 2 LCD models should be revealed any day now.\nHonorable mention: Prime Day\nMonth: July\nAmazon was historically pretty low on the list of best places to buy a TV. While it does sell most of the same brands of TVs as competing retailers do, its sale prices are more volatile and often plagued by inflated prices that make discounts look better than they are. (Pro tip: You can spot-check the prices of TVs at Amazon by pasting the listing URL into Camelcamelcamel, a free Amazon price tracking site.)\nHowever, Amazon stands out as a TV destination during the shopping holidays it made up for itself: Prime Day and Prime Big Deal Days (basically a second Prime Day). Naturally, Fire TVs are the focal point during Prime events, and these deals go hard. For example, we've seen a 43-inch Amazon Omni 4K Fire TV drop to $99.99 during Prime Big Deal Days. The week before Prime Day 2025, a 65-inch Insignia QLED Fire TV dropped to $329.99, and an 85-inch Panasonic OLED Fire TV dropped to $997.99. These are wild screen size to price ratios that can only be rivaled by similar Walmart doorbusters on its TV brand, onn.\nPast that, Amazon really upped its game on non-Fire TVs on sale during Prime Day 2025. The selection of cheap QLED TVs was massive, but more surprisingly, so was the selection of record-low prices on 2025 flagship TVs. That's usually Best Buy's forte. The timing for that makes sense: Prime Day is the first big sale event that strikes after the year's new TVs have had a few months on the market. Many were far too fresh to go on sale in the spring, but July? That's the sweet spot.\nBut Amazon isn't the only good place to buy a TV on sale during Prime Day. Amazon's self-titled events also trigger conveniently-timed competing sales from its biggest competitors, and as antithetical as it sounds, Best Buy and Walmart almost always beat Amazon at its own game during Prime Day \u2014 with TVs, at least. Unless Fire TV is already your comfort streaming platform, don't limit your TV search to Amazon during these events just because Amazon picked the dates.\nTopics Amazon Black Friday Prime Day\nFrequently Asked Questions\nYou can take your old TV to a Best Buy store to recycle. Best Buy recycles Best Buy brand TVs (like Insignia) under 50 inches for free and charges a $29.99 fee for all other TVs. Trashing an old TV or otherwise sending it to a landfill via junk pickup service should always be a last resort.\nPretty much, yeah. Any TV bought brand new since the late 2010s is almost guaranteed to be a smart TV, and smart TVs are so solidly the norm now that you'd probably only be able to find one at a yard sale or on eBay.\nHave a trusty older model that's still kicking? You can turn a normal TV into a smart TV by buying an external streaming device like an Amazon Fire TV Stick or Roku player. These WiFi-enabled devices plug into a TV's HDMI port and provide a makeshift smart TV platform to access streaming apps when the TV's input selection is that HDMI port.\nAll three refer to a TV's lighting situation behind the screen, which affects things like how bright the TV gets, how well HDR support is utilized, how contrasted shadows are and how legible dark content is, and how rich colors are. The tech you'll like the best depends on the type of content and the lighting of the room in which you'll be using the TV the most. Here's a quick TV lighting guide:\nLED (light-emitting diode) is the baseline. Despite their general affordability across the board, one LED TV can beat another out by incorporating full-array local dimming: a collection of lighting zones that adjust independently across the entire screen. Without those crucial in-between zones, the middle of the screen of many cheaper LED TVs can get a little hazy, falling victim to edge-lit dimming that just can't extend light across with the same oomph.\nQLED is a luminous spin on traditional LED. The \"Q\" refers to an extra layer of quantum dots sandwiched between the standard LED panel and the screen to make a wider range of colors pop off the screen with enhanced brightness. The juicier picture is ideal for viewing or gaming in bright rooms and for honing in on content with small details, like sports. (Not every brand refers to their quantum dot TVs as QLED. While Samsung and TCL refer to QLED as QLED, brands like LG, Sony, and Hisense use similar technology marketed under different names (QNED, Triluminos Pro, and ULED, respectively).\nMini LEDs have also entered the chat in recent years. These are about half the size of regular LEDs, allowing manufacturers to pack more LEDs into the same size panel, allowing for more local dimming zones and more precise tweaking of brightness in each area.\nOLED is its own thing, despite the negligible difference in the title letters itself. Unlike LED and QLED, OLED doesn't require an external backlight. That's because the pixels \u2014 the organic light-emitting diodes that represent the \"O\" in OLED \u2014 emit their own light instead. This comes in handy during dark scenes, when the TV screen needs to get as dark as possible to differentiate shadowy shades from each other. While backlit QLED pixels' forced dimming can cause a kind of halo effect around bright objects, OLED pixels can turn off completely. This makes OLED the gold standard for the stark contrast and black uniformity needed for viewing or gaming in dark rooms.\nAlso unlike QLEDs, OLED TVs are the least likely to come in budget-friendly options.\nLED, QLED, and OLED have nothing to do with the screen's resolution (that's what HD, 4K, and 8K are for). This means that the frequently asked question, whether 4K or QLED is better, isn't really a question at all, because the two aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, nearly every QLED TV is 4K (with some 8K options sprinkled in, but 8K is overkill for nearly any household situation right now). While any rendition of LED refers to the light source behind the TV, 4K refers to the screen's resolution, or how many pixels are squeezed across the screen horizontally (4,000-ish).\nSome 32-inch and 40-inch 4K TVs do exist, but 43 inches is the smallest that most 4K TVs run \u2014 and because 4K is the market standard now (over HD), most 43-inch TVs at any price point are going to be 4K anyway.\n43 inches is also the smallest size where 4K (3840 x 2160 pixels) is even worthwhile in a TV. While a 15-inch 4K laptop screen makes sense because you're looking at it from just a foot or two away, you're unlikely to notice the resolution benefits of 4K on a screen smaller than 43 inches when you're sitting several feet away. Once you get past 40 inches, the TV is large enough to really showcase the crisp details that 4K provides, making small details like a football score or subtitles more legible, especially if you're watching from several feet away.\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

      "text": "Fox *finally* launches its own streaming service just in time for football season\nTable of Contents\nFor years, there's been a noticeable Fox-shaped hole in the streaming universe. But that's about to change.\nCBS has Paramount+, NBCUniversal has Peacock, and now Fox Corp. is launching Fox One \u2014 its direct-to-consumer streaming service \u2014 on Aug. 21. The app is a one-stop shop for the entirety of the Fox TV portfolio, including all games, events, and programs that air on the Fox family of networks. You'll be able to watch live sports and events, as well as shows and movies on demand.\n\"In bringing together the full power of the FOX content portfolio in one service, we have created a great value proposition and user experience that will appeal to the cord-cutter and cord-never fans currently not served by conventional pay TV packages,\" Pete Distad, CEO, Fox's direct-to-consumer platform, said in a statement.\nIts arrival couldn't be timed more perfectly, with Big Noon Saturday (Fox's flagship college football show), the MLB playoffs, and the NFL season kickoff just around the corner.\nWhat is included in the Fox One streaming service?\nFox One is the new home to all of the major Fox channels: Fox News, Fox Sports, Fox Weather, FS1, FS2, Fox Business, Fox Deportes, Big Ten Network (B1G), local Fox stations, and Fox Network. It will also have on-demand content from Fox Entertainment, including movies, TV shows, and ad-supported channels like LiveNOW, TMZ, and Fox podcasts. Fox Nation and B1G+ will remain their own independent streaming services, but bundling options will be available.\nThat means you'll be able to watch live in-network NFL games on Sundays during the regular season, which kicks off Sept. 4. Not to mention, the MLB World Series in October and college football this fall.\nIn the past, cord-cutters had to sign up for a pay TV provider like YouTube TV ($82.99 per month) or Fubo ($84.99 per month) to watch Fox channels live. Fox One offers a much more affordable and streamlined option.\nOne notable difference about Fox One compared to other mainstream streaming services is that it won't offer any original content. For now, at least, it's mostly focused on giving cable-less folks access to live programming.\nHow much will Fox One cost?\nFox One on its own costs $19.99 per month or $199.99 per year, which will save you about 17%. There will also be options to bundle Fox One with Fox Nation for $24.99 per month or $239.88 per year (20% savings).\nESPN's new direct-to-consumer app is set to launch the same day as Fox One. You'll be able to bundle both apps for the ultimate live sports combo for a total of $39.99 per month starting on Oct. 2.\nNew subscribers (aka everyone) will also get a free seven-day trial of Fox One to kick things off.\nHow to sign up for Fox One\nFox One is officially available as of Aug. 21. Navigate to FoxOne.com or download the mobile app and follow the prompts to sign up for your free seven-day trial.\nTopics Streaming\nChristina Buff is a Nashville-based freelance writer for who covers shopping with a splash of entertainment. If you\u2019re ever wondering what streaming service you need to watch something (and the cheapest way to sign up for it), she\u2019s your girl.\nChristina received a B.S. in Business Communication (concentration in writing) from Stevenson University and began her professional journey writing and editing press releases. Since then, she\u2019s written content for a marketing agency, blogged for celebrities, and covered local news, politics, women\u2019s lifestyle, fashion, beauty, and just about everything in between for various publications.\nWhen she\u2019s not writing, she\u2019s probably enjoying live music, studying human design, or embroidering and upcycling clothes. You can follow her on Instagram at @touchinfinity."

RetailMeNot Receipt Scanning. You agree to at all times provide accurate and complete information to RetailMeNot. You agree not to: submit a Receipt that is false, inaccurate, fabricated, counterfeited, incomplete, tampered with, adjusted, or otherwise inauthentic for the purpose of seeking to claim a Reward; redeem, or attempt to redeem, a Reward for products that have not actually been purchased, or for products that have been returned; submit or attempt to submit a Receipt that has already been submitted or used by you or another user; or submit Receipts outside of a Promotion Period, or for a purchase that took place prior to or after the launch date of a Rewards O\ufb00er. RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards.

In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner.

Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

If, despite this request, you do send us any unsolicited ideas or materials, we make no assurances that such ideas or materials will be treated as confidential or proprietary. 14. Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20.
