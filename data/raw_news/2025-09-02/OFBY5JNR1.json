  "title": "Analysis: Trump is furious at China, but he\u2019s making US foes great again",
  "description": "China\u2019s pageant of authoritarian leaders is the kind of performative spectacle that President Donald Trump loves and is an obvious attempt to borrow his brand of big-splash diplomacy to show global power is shifting.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump is mad that China is palling around with his strongmen friends.\n\nTrump erupted on social media late Tuesday night \u2014 US time \u2014 as television footage aired of Chinese leader Xi Jinping hosting the authoritarian leaders of Russia and North Korea at a stunning military parade in Beijing.\n\n\u201cPlease give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America,\u201d Trump wrote in a message to Xi..\n\nThe Truth Social post heard around the world means one thing: If China\u2019s two big gatherings of authoritarian leaders, US adversaries and erstwhile allies this week was intended as a personal affront to the US president, it worked perfectly. And it underscored the futility of his attempts to subject the true global hard men to his art-of-the-deal charms and his claims that his supposedly close relationships with such leaders can be decisive.\n\nTrump met with Putin in Alaska last month, but his gushing red-carpet welcome has so far failed to unlock any progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. Putin has defied Trump\u2019s hopes by escalating attacks on civilians and is stalling on talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The US president\u2019s first-term summits with Kim were similarly unsuccessful. The North Korean leader has more nuclear weapons now than he did before taking part in Trump\u2019s photo-op diplomacy.\n\nThe president\u2019s online tirade went on to point out that Americans had suffered heavy losses in the struggle against a common enemy, imperial Japan, the 80th anniversary of whose defeat was marked in Beijing on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cMany Americans died in China\u2019s quest for Victory and Glory. I hope that they are rightfully Honored and Remembered for their Bravery and Sacrifice!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nChina\u2019s big celebration comes at a tense international moment as the new Asian superpower seeks to capitalize on Trump\u2019s erratic foreign policy, which has shattered America\u2019s reputation as a reliable great power.\n\nTrump\u2019s fury was ironic, since the last few days in China have seen the kind of performative spectacle that he loves.\n\nBut the gathering of anti-Western powers in Tianjin and Beijing is about more than trolling. It\u2019s an early warning that Trump\u2019s second-term policies based on tariff coercion, the bullying of lesser powers and \u201cAmerica First\u201d nationalism may be backfiring.\n\n\u201cChina is leveraging the missteps or mistakes that the US (is making),\u201d Jackie S.H. Wong, an assistant professor of international studies at the American University of Sharjah, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson on \u201cConnect the World\u201d Tuesday.\n\nSome of the alarmist talk about China and Russia building a new axis of resistance to the US is overblown. Nations represented at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin lack formal defense agreements or pooled economic sovereignty to compare to groups like NATO or the European Union.\n\nTerritorial tensions periodically spark between China and India. Moscow might need China\u2019s help in fighting its war in Ukraine, but the Kremlin is still getting used to being the junior superpower. And despite Communist Party iron rule, China suffers from internal political and economic pressures, demonstrated by Xi\u2019s regular purges of top officials and military brass.\n\nBut the festivities of recent days are part of China\u2019s wider effort to showcase its emerging might and to test out alternative global affiliations and systems as it seeks to eclipse the West. By gathering leaders from Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere, it was demonstrating the capacity of a bloc to frustrate US global power on multiple fronts.\n\nOne top US military leader on Tuesday downplayed the significance of events in China.\n\n\u201cNations like China and North Korea and Russia, and others do these kind of events. There\u2019s certainly a big focus on messaging,\u201d Gen. Kevin Schneider, commander of the US Pacific Air Forces, told an online talk Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBut I think the takeaway for this is we are not deterred,\u201d Schneider said.\n\nEight decades after the end of World War II, it\u2019s not surprising that institutions born in the aftermath of the horror need a reboot. The rise of populous developing nations was always going to threaten American hegemony and the global system built and dominated by the West. And as the last members of the Greatest Generation fade away, the triumph of the democracies in World War II is becoming history rather than a tangible human memory.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s choices in the first eight months of his second term are accelerating a shift of global power to the East. They\u2019re playing into Xi\u2019s quest to revive what he believes is China\u2019s rightful global prominence. Trump\u2019s attacks on allies and desecration of US foreign aid programs are brewing resentment among erstwhile American friends who are now hedging their bets with an alternative superpower.\n\nIncredibly, the force doing most to undermine the West is the president of the country \u2014 the United States \u2014 that guaranteed freedom and democracy for generations.\n\nHow Trump is undermining US power\n\nMany steps that Trump takes to demonstrate US power end up undermining it.\n\nBy taking on Beijing in a massive trade offensive, Trump picked on the one nation that would be ready to absorb economic pain to damage the US. Now, Trump has found that Beijing has, well, a trump card: control of a large share of rare earth metals that the US needs to run its tech industry and military applications. Trump\u2019s failure to force Beijing to back down is enhancing a sense that it\u2019s ready to challenge American might \u2014 and drawing foreign leaders to Beijing.\n\nTrump\u2019s capricious tariff attacks on US trading partners \u2014 based on his hunches rather than economic data \u2014 and attempts to throttle the independence of the Federal Reserve play into China\u2019s previously unconvincing claims that it, and not the United States, is the stable superpower on which partners can rely. Nations represented in Tianjin, for example, included many that looked to Washington rather than Beijing in recent years, including Vietnam \u2014 which is facing tough US tariffs \u2014Egypt, and NATO member Turkey.\n\nThe most startling example of Trump\u2019s clumsy, counterproductive behavior shone through the attention lavished throughout the summit in Tianjin on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow populist nationalist leader and erstwhile friend of Trump. Trump\u2019s claims to have solved a flare-up between India and Pakistan earlier this year and demands for the Nobel Peace Prize infuriated Modi. A 50% tariff on Indian imports to the US fractured nearly 30 years of efforts by Republican and Democratic presidents to prevent India and China \u2014 which are home to a billion people each \u2014 from moving closer together.\n\nLaughing and shaking hands, Xi and Modi both argued their two countries, long separated by mistrust, could be partners and not rivals.\n\nModi\u2019s interaction with a jovial Putin was even more overt. Last month, the Russian leader had a private chat in Trump\u2019s Beast limousine at their summit in Alaska. In China, Putin one-upped Trump, inviting Modi into his ride, and a photographer was on hand to capture the friendly hourlong chat inside.\n\nXi\u2019s welcome to Modi matched that of Putin.\n\nIndia is \u201csignaling to the US that \u2018we have alternatives, and China can be that alternative,\u2019\u201d Wong told Anderson on CNN International.\n\n\u201cI would say China is leveraging that opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s misstep is more surprising since he jelled with Modi during his first term. But India is a deeply proud nation whose colonial history makes it especially sensitive to being bullied. It is hyper-touchy about anything to do with its arch-rival Pakistan. Such subtleties seem to escape the White House. Perhaps Trump\u2019s purge of State Department experts is taking a toll.\n\nRussia is often portrayed in the West as a decrepit power; a shadow of the Soviet Union despite its vast nuclear arsenal. There\u2019s some truth to this after 25 years of Putin\u2019s corrupt rule. But the Russian leader buttressed his image in defying Trump.\n\nThis has left the US president expressing disappointment and resorting to his classic tactic of teasing apparently imminent announcements to spare his embarrassment. He told reporters Tuesday he\u2019d spoken to Putin and \u201clearned things that will be very interesting. I think in the next few days, you\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\nMany foreign policy experts thought a shrewd second term goal for Trump would be to push US adversaries like Russia, China and North Korea apart. Instead, he\u2019s driven them together, and driven India, a member of the US \u201cQuad\u201d grouping with Australia and Japan, closer into their orbit.\n\nTrump\u2019s performance is in the eye of the beholder\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters dispute any characterization of his foreign policy as anything but a roaring success. The White House argues that the United States has never been more respected in the world. It bills Trump as the \u201cPresident of Peace\u201d and claims he\u2019s ended seven global wars \u2014 even though some of the nations it names weren\u2019t fighting each other when Trump intervened.\n\nThe president told CNN contributor Scott Jennings on his radio show on Tuesday that he wasn\u2019t concerned at all by the diplomatic signaling coming from China.\n\nHe also implied in a conversation with reporters in the Oval Office that Xi would be forced to capitulate. \u201cChina needs us. And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, as you know. But China needs us much more than we need them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is making overt attempts to prove he\u2019s as tough as any global strongman.\n\nOn Monday, as superpower diplomacy played out across the Pacific, he announced a US strike that killed 11 people in the seas off Venezuela, which officials said targeted drug traffickers. The attack could herald a military campaign on questionable legal ground regarding congressional authorization.\n\nHe also re-upped threats to send National Guard reservists into Chicago as he methodically escalates his effort to normalize the use of the military in law enforcement despite constitutional curbs. But there was a reminder that despite his authoritarian instincts, the United States still has democratic safeguards that Russia and China lacks when a judge ruled that his dispatch of federal troops to Los Angeles earlier this year was illegal.\n\nThe president does have some significant second-term wins. His wielding of US might against smaller nations has tariff cash gushing into the Treasury. And despite his stumbling, he remains the only world leader with a chance to force all parties to the table in pursuit of peace in Ukraine. His relentless pressure on NATO allies led to significant pledges of increased defense spending.\n\nBut China\u2019s superpower coming-out party this week shows it\u2019s critical for US power that he somehow prevails over Beijing in the trade war.\n\nOodles of flattery that the president has enjoyed from foreign leaders seeking to dodge his wrath may be giving him a false impression of how the rest of the world sees him. \u201cOur country is the hottest country in the world right now,\u201d Trump said Tuesday. \u201cEverybody\u2019s talking about the USA.\u201d\n\nThe United States was likely on the lips of many of those gathered in China this week. But not quite in the way Trump thinks.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump is increasingly moving to deploy the military on US soil in extraordinary ways, including potentially in Chicago.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going in,\u201d he said on Tuesday, while adding: \u201cI didn\u2019t say when.\u201d\nA major new ruling in California earlier in the day doesn\u2019t stop him from doing that. But it does suggest there could be little actual utility in the president pressing forward with his longstanding push to militarize the homeland.\nUS District Judge Charles Breyer\u2019s ruling that Trump\u2019s use of the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles in June was illegal is a nuanced one.\nFor one, it doesn\u2019t prevent Trump from deploying the military or keeping troops in Los Angeles. It merely says they can\u2019t perform law enforcement functions, versus things like protecting federal property. Doing the former, Breyer ruled, violated the Posse Comitatus Act.\nSecondly, it only applies to California. So it doesn\u2019t prevent Trump from doing anything in Chicago or elsewhere. He could push forward with his plans and wait for other judges to rule on them. The administration is also likely to appeal Breyer\u2019s ruling, meaning this might not be the final word.\nBut the ruling reinforces that Trump might not be able to use the troops for the very thing he actually wants to use them for: cracking down on crime.\nTrump\u2019s idea for putting troops in Chicago is often lumped together with his efforts to use them in Los Angeles and Washington, DC. But it\u2019s also different in key ways.\nIn Los Angeles, the Guard and the Marines were deployed in response to immigration protests \u2013 what the administration claimed was a rebellion. (Breyer says there was no such actual rebellion.) In DC, the ostensible purpose was a broader effort to crack down on crime. But Trump has an unusual level of authority in the nation\u2019s capital because of its status as a federal district.\nIn Chicago, Trump has indicated he would be using the troops for the latter purpose, but without the same authorities at his disposal. It would be the first time he would use the military for broadscale, domestic law enforcement outside of DC. Breyer now indicates such a thing would be illegal.\nThe Posse Comitatus Act bars the use of the military \u201cto execute the laws,\u201d except when \u201cexpressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.\u201d\nBreyer ruled that the administration \u201cwillfully\u201d violated this act in Los Angeles because it \u201csystematically used armed soldiers \u2026 and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence.\u201d\nBreyer significantly limited what those troops are allowed to do. He said they could not engage in \u201carrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants,\u201d unless the administration can identify some kind of valid exception to the Posse Comitatus Act. But again, that\u2019s just in California.\nIf those limits were to apply to a situation like Chicago, it would really curtail the actual value of deploying the troops.\n\u201cThis is a setback for Trump\u2019s use of the military to engage in law enforcement operations that fall outside of protecting federal buildings and people,\u201d Emory University law professor Mark P. Nevitt said.\nSyracuse University law professor emeritus William C. Banks said the ruling \u201cprovides the frame for any other places Trump might want to deploy troops.\u201d\nAnd Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director of the liberal-leaning Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program, called Breyer\u2019s ruling a \u201cplace to start\u201d that could \u201ccertainly inform how other courts look at these questions.\u201d\n\u201cIn court, the president\u2019s going to have to use a different rationale\u201d than crime control, Goitein said of potential justification for using troops in Chicago. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be about protecting federal buildings and functions, or immigration enforcement.\u201d\nIndeed, after Breyer\u2019s ruling, the administration suggested it had actually respected the line between protecting federal property and personnel, and conducting law enforcement.\n\u201cThis is a false narrative and a misleading injunction,\u201d acting US attorney Bill Essayli said on X. \u201cThe military has never engaged in direct law enforcement operations here in LA.\u201d\nBut the word \u201cdirect\u201d is the operative word there.\nIn fact, Breyer noted that the administration told troops that they had the authority to engage in less-direct forms of law enforcement. He included an image of a slide that isolated \u201csecurity patrols,\u201d \u201ctraffic control,\u201d \u201ccrowd control\u201d and \u201criot control\u201d alongside other forms of prohibited law enforcement actions. He said troops were told these forms of law enforcement were subject to a constitutional exception, meaning troops could engage in them.\nThe administration is preparing to conduct a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago as soon as this week, CNN has reported, with the National Guard possibly helping in a peacekeeper capacity if needed, akin to Los Angeles following protests. But Trump has repeatedly indicated that sending troops to Chicago is about law enforcement \u2013 and White House officials have made clear those immigration plans are separate from that. Trump has often compared what he intends to do in Chicago to what he has done in DC. And he has repeatedly pointed to Chicago\u2019s crime problems \u2013 versus, say, a supposed rebellion in Los Angeles \u2013 to justify potentially sending in the troops.\nBreyer repeatedly pointed to Trump\u2019s designs on possibly expanding his use of troops to other cities like Chicago, apparently anticipating what could lie ahead.\nHe said this amounted to \u201ccreating a national police force with the President as its chief.\u201d\nTo the extent that\u2019s truly Trump\u2019s goal, the effort has suffered a significant early setback."

      "text": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping told India\u2019s Narendra Modi the \u201cright choice\u201d is for their countries to be friends as the two met in China for first time in seven years \u2013 a new milestone in a nascent rapprochement between the world\u2019s most populous nations accelerated by shared frictions with the United States.\nXi and Modi\u2019s highly-anticipated meeting Sunday, on the sidelines of a regional summit in the eastern port city of Tianjin, comes as both nations face stiff US tariffs under President Donald Trump\u2019s global trade war, as well as Western scrutiny over their relationships with Russia as the war in Ukraine grinds on.\n\u201cThe world today is swept by once-in-a-century transformations,\u201d Xi told Modi in opening remarks, as both leaders sat face-to-face flanked by their officials. \u201cThe international situation is both fluid and chaotic,\u201d he added.\n\u201cIt is the right choice for both sides to be friends who have good neighborly and amicable ties, partners who enable each other\u2019s success, and to have the dragon and the elephant dance together,\u201d Xi said, referring to traditional symbols of the two nations.\n\u201cAs long as they adhere to the overall direction of being partners rather than rivals \u2026 China-India relations can maintain stability and move forward over the long run,\u201d he said.\nModi said India was \u201ccommitted\u201d to taking their countries\u2019 relations forward \u201con the basis of mutual trust and respect,\u201d and referenced their bettering of ties, including an easing of tensions along their disputed Himalayan border \u2013 where the two fought a deadly skirmish in 2020.\n\u201cThe interests of 2.8 billion people in both our countries are tied to our cooperation,\u201d he added.\nThe positive signals are sure to be closely watched in Washington, where tensions with New Delhi threaten to derail what had been years of efforts from US diplomats to deepen ties with the country as a key counterweight to a rising and increasingly assertive China \u2013 a set of circumstances that makes the latest meeting all the more important and timely to Xi.\nTrump earlier this month levied significant economic penalties on India, initially placing its imports into the US under 25% tariffs and then slapping an additional 25% duties on the country as punishment for importing Russian oil and gas, which Washington sees as helping to fund Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. Both China and India are major purchasers of Russian oil, though China has yet to be targeted with such measures.\nModi said he spoke with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky Saturday and \u201cexchanged views on the ongoing conflict.\u201d India has previously said it does not take sides in the war.\nIn his daily address on Sunday, Zelensky said that \u201ceveryone in the world has said that the fighting must be ceased,\u201d including Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, who he noted were in China for the summit. \u201cAlmost everyone else in the world is also in favor of ending the war,\u201d he continued.\nIndia\u2019s oil purchases could be a point of discussion on Monday, when Modi is expected to hold bilateral talks with Putin, part of his wider diplomacy as he joins a two-day summit of the Beijing-and Moscow-backed regional security grouping known as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).\nIn addition to China, Russia, and India, the group includes Iran, Pakistan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, as well as partner and observer countries. Chinese officials ahead of the event said leaders from more than 20 countries from across Asia and Middle East would join the summit.\nXi hosted attending leaders for a welcome banquet on Sunday evening, where he appeared to put his warm and relaxed rapport with Putin on show. Footage released by Russia state news agency RIA showed the two leaders gesturing animatedly and smiling as they chatted at the event, showing a different side of the typically restrained Chinese leader.\nThe pair then walked shoulder to shoulder together after posing for a photo alongside other gathered leaders, with Xi gesturing for Putin to walk with him, footage released by the Kremlin showed.\nThe SCO is the two leaders\u2019 first opportunity to meet in person since Putin\u2019s summit with Trump in Alaska earlier this month \u2013 part of the US president\u2019s push to end the war in Ukraine. Xi and Putin \u201cdiscussed the latest contacts\u201d between the US and Russia during a \u201cdetailed conversation,\u201d Russian state media reported Sunday, citing Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov.\nPutin\u2019s war looms over the SCO gathering and the flurry of diplomacy around it, with the Russian president, who landed in Tianjin earlier Sunday, joining the gathering as Western leaders ramp up pressure on him\u2013 and his partners \u2013 to end the now more than three-and-half-year invasion.\nA warming relationship?\nBeijing is widely seen as eager for the newfound tensions between Trump and Modi to reduce what have been burgeoning security ties between the US and India. Chinese officials have watched with unease the elevation of the Quad security dialogue between India, the US and its allies Australia and Japan, widely seen as a bid to counter China.\nIn his remarks to Modi on Sunday, Xi sought to stress commonalities \u2013 framing the two countries as at \u201ccritical stages of development and rejuvenation,\u201d and calling for them to \u201cfocus on development as their greatest common denominator, supporting and advancing each other,\u201d according to a readout from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry.\nHe also referenced their shared stated aim to make the international order more \u201cmultipolar\u201d \u2013 a term used by countries, including those within the SCO, to call for international power to be more broadly shared \u2013 as opposed to dominated by the US and its allies, as they see it.\nThere has been a gradual normalization of ties between India and China after Modi and Xi met on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia last October, which came as the two sides reached an agreement on military disengagement along their disputed border.\nIn recent months, the countries agreed to restart direct flights cancelled since the Covid-19 pandemic. Beijing also recently agreed to reopen two pilgrimage sites in western Tibet to Indians for the first time in five years, and both started re-issuing tourist visas for each other\u2019s citizens.\nEarlier this month, following a visit from China\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi to New Delhi, the two announced \u201cten points of consensus\u201d on the issue to further reduce tensions.\nXi and Modi on Sunday also discussed what\u2019s \u201chappening on the international plain and the challenges it creates,\u201d India Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters on the SCO sidelines, when asked about whether Trump\u2019s tariffs were raised.\n\u201cThey tried to, in a sense, see how to leverage that for building greater understanding between themselves, and how to \u2026 take forward the economic and commercial relationship between India and China in the midst of these evolving challenges,\u201d Misri said.\nObservers say, however, that even as the two leaders seek stability in their relationship, both in terms of trade and security, it will be hard for Xi and Modi to overcome a longstanding lack of personal trust.\nUnderlying tensions between India and China spiked in 2020 following a deadly conflict along their disputed Himalayan border, in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed in hand-to-hand combat.\nThe two nations maintain a heavy military presence along their 2,100-mile (3,379-kilometer) de facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC) \u2013 a boundary that remains undefined and has been a persistent source of friction since their bloody 1962 war.\nBut both leaders on Sunday appeared keen to signal the welcome of a warmer chapter.\nAn Indian readout released following the meeting said they reaffirmed that \u201ctheir differences should not turn into disputes\u201d and their \u201cstable relationship and cooperation\u201d was necessary for the \u201cgrowth and development of the two countries, as well as for a multipolar world.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with developments.

      "text": "What we're covering\n\u2022 Presiding over a military parade in Tiananmen Square to commemorate the end of World War II, leader Xi Jinping said China\u2019s rise is \u201cunstoppable.\u201d\n\u2022 Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un flanked Xi at the start as the trio stood together publicly for the first time \u2014 a defiant challenge to the US-led world order.\n\u2022 Commenting on the parade, President Donald Trump accused China, Russia and North Korea of conspiring against the US.\n\u2022 The parade unveiled hundreds of advanced weapons and featured over 10,000 troops, showcasing China\u2019s growing military power under Xi\u2019s push to modernize the world\u2019s largest standing army.\nNOW: Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin are meeting in Beijing\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are sitting down in Beijing for formal talks after attending China\u2019s military parade.\nRussian pool footage showed the two leaders seated in chairs side by side, speaking through interpreters.\nThe leaders have drawn closer together since Russia invaded Ukraine, with Kim sending North Korean soldiers to fight for Moscow on the front lines.\nXi has staged more military parades than any Chinese leader since Mao\nToday is the third time Chinese leader Xi Jinping has presided over a military parade on Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square \u2013 equaling the combined total of his three immediate predecessors.\nDeng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao each oversaw just one Tiananmen parade, traditionally held on the decennial anniversaries of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nXi continued that custom but also forged his own tradition, designating September 3 a day of national commemoration of Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II and marking the 70th anniversary of that defeat with a massive parade in 2015. Today\u2019s event marks the 80th anniversary of the defeat.\nThe only Chinese leader who staged more military parades was Mao Zedong, who oversaw 11 consecutive National Day spectacles between 1949 and 1959.\nXi has also overseen two parades outside the capital: one in Inner Mongolia in 2017 marking the PLA\u2019s 90th anniversary, and another in Qingdao in 2019 celebrating the PLA Navy\u2019s 70th birthday.\nNorth Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un set for talks with Russia\u2019s Putin in Beijing\nRussia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin is set to meet North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un for formal talks in Beijing, according to Russian state media.\n\u201cThe venue for the bilateral meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is now prepared,\u201d state news agency TASS reported.\nThe pair will meet at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in western Beijing where Putin has been staying during his visit.\nThe flags of both Russia and North Korea are on display at the guesthouse, TASS reported.\nThe psychology of military parades\nWe\u2019ve just gotten a glimpse of how overwhelming China\u2019s parades can be. Tanks rolling past in endless columns, jets roaring overhead, soldiers marching in perfect lockstep. It\u2019s military theater designed to project unstoppable power.\nI\u2019ve previously covered one of these massive events in Beijing, and several in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. The experience of being there is unforgettable. The ground literally rumbles beneath your feet as gigantic mobile missile launchers and tanks thunder across the vast, echoing Kim Il Sung Square. Goose-stepping soldiers snap their salutes toward the podium from where the supreme leader watches. Tens of thousands erupt in perfectly timed cheers, amplifying the raw power on display.\nWhen you\u2019re there in person, it\u2019s overwhelming. When you watch it on TV, it\u2019s ominous. The message is clear: if you threaten this nation\u2019s sovereignty, here\u2019s what awaits.\nAnd now, in Beijing, the symbolism is even greater. Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un are Xi Jinping\u2019s top guests. Their unity on this stage isn\u2019t just about reassuring and energizing their own people. It\u2019s aimed at unsettling the US-led world order that has defined global power for decades. The images themselves are a propaganda weapon. A defiant display of hard power aimed at the world, and especially at the United States.\nIf China's parade was intended to irk Trump, it worked perfectly\nPresident Donald Trump is mad that China is palling around with his strongman friends.\nTrump erupted on social media as footage aired of Chinese leader Xi Jinping hosting the authoritarian leaders of Russia and North Korea in today\u2019s parade, accusing the trio of conspiring against the US..\nThe Truth Social post means one thing: If China\u2019s two big gatherings of authoritarian leaders, US adversaries and erstwhile allies this week was intended as a personal affront to the US president, it worked perfectly.\nAnd it underscored the futility of his attempts to subject the true global hard men to his art-of-the-deal charms and his claims that his supposedly close relationships with such leaders can be decisive.\nTrump met with Putin in Alaska last month, but his gushing red-carpet welcome has so far failed to unlock any progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. The US president\u2019s first-term summits with Kim were similarly unsuccessful.\nChina\u2019s big celebration comes at a tense international moment as the new Asian superpower seeks to capitalize on Trump\u2019s erratic foreign policy, which has shattered America\u2019s reputation as a reliable great power.\nTrump\u2019s fury was ironic, since the last few days in China have seen the kind of performative spectacle that he loves.\nBut the gathering of anti-Western powers in Beijing is about more than trolling. It\u2019s an early warning that Trump\u2019s second-term policies based on tariff coercion, the bullying of lesser powers and \u201cAmerica First\u201d nationalism may be backfiring.\nJapan says it has followed \u201cthe path of a peaceful nation\u201d since WWII\nIn response to China\u2019s military parade commemorating its defeat in WWII, Japan has reaffirmed its postwar commitment to peace, even as tensions rise again with Beijing.\nTokyo\u2019s wartime atrocities in Asia have left deep fissures in the region and continue to sour relations with many of its neighbors to this day.\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at his regular press briefing Wednesday that Japan has \u201cconsistently followed the path of a peaceful nation\u201d based on its determination never to repeat the tragedy of war.\nAs the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons, Japan has long portrayed itself as \u201cpeace-loving.\u201d But rising tensions with China, now labeled Japan\u2019s \u201cgreatest security challenge,\u201d are reshaping that stance.\nTokyo is rapidly expanding its defense capabilities, boosting spending to 2% of its GDP by 2027, buying US Tomahawk missiles, developing next-generation fighter jets and converting helicopter carriers to launch F-35s.\nJapan\u2019s military buildup reflects growing alarm over China\u2019s assertiveness, especially repeated incursions into Japanese waters and airspace.\nXi\u2019s gala menu for Kim, Putin and other foreign leaders includes lamb, lobster and salmon\nAs Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his fellow foreign leaders dig in for lunch in Beijing, they\u2019ve got a sumptuous menu prepared.\nThe menu, shared by Hong Kong-based state-linked newspaper Wen Wei Po, includes a host of dishes drawing from both Chinese tradition and more international flavors:\n- Chicken soup with conch meat and lily bulbs\n- Roasted lamb chops\n- Stir-fried lobster with crab meat, roe and egg white\n- Clear scallop consomm\u00e9 with assorted mushrooms\n- Roasted salt-marinated salmon with creamy mustard sauce\nOther items include fried rice, pea cake and a mango mouse cake, and two selections of red and white wine \u2013 both originating from China\u2019s Hebei province.\nFor Xi and Putin, commemorating World War II is more about the present\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin watched their first military parade together on Moscow\u2019s Red Square in 2015, on the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.\nFor Russia \u2013 and before it, the Soviet Union \u2013 parades have long been a tradition on major WWII anniversaries. Victory Day parade has become an annual event in Red Square since 1995.\nChina has its own tradition of grand military parades \u2013 staged to celebrate the regime\u2019s founding every 10 years \u2013 but it did not hold any WWII parades until 2015, after Xi designated September 3 as a national commemoration day to mark Japan\u2019s defeat.\nJoseph Torigian, an expert on Chinese and Russian politics, explains why Xi and Putin place such weight on WWII commemorations:\nTorigian said the leaders see World War II as a blow to those forces, \u201cYet, in the words of Putin, the Nazis were defeated, but not eliminated. So it\u2019s imperative for Xi and Putin to use World War II to remind their citizens about the need to continue the struggle.\u201d\nFor Xi and Putin, Torigian said, the end of World War II was a moment when their nations won the respect they believe China and Russia always deserved.\nBeijing parade a rare outing for Myanmar\u2019s embattled junta chief\nToday\u2019s military parade in Beijing is a welcome outing for the US-sanctioned chief of Myanmar\u2019s junta, who led a coup that has plunged his country into a brutal, years-long civil war.\nSenior General Min Aung Hlaing hasn\u2019t travelled abroad much since 2021, when he ended a decade-long experiment with democracy in Myanmar, locked up politicians and imposed military rule.\nSwathes of Myanmar are in armed revolt against the junta; its economy is in tatters and young people are fleeing in droves. Last year prosecutors at the International Criminal Court said they were seeking a warrant for Min Aung Hlaing for crimes against humanity.\nFor Beijing, Myanmar is a vital source of rare earths, natural gas and jade \u2013 the green gemstone revered in China, where it has a cultural significance that dates back thousands of years and an industry worth billions of dollars a year.\nFor Myanmar\u2019s military, Chinese aircraft, artillery and drones provide a technological edge over the rebel groups and pro-democracy fighters mounting a shoestring resistance against its rule.\nBut the relationship is complicated \u2013 Beijing also maintains close ties with rebels along their shared border, some of whom have humiliated the junta on the battlefield in recent months.\nThere\u2019s some awkward history too.\nThe Myanmar military can trace its origins to the Burma Independence Army, which rose up to fight against colonial ruler Britain in the 1940s. Their main ally and sponsor? The Imperial Japanese Army \u2013 whose surrender the Beijing parade is now celebrating.\nIn 1945, the BIA turned on the Japanese and joined the Allies.\nThe Myanmar military still commemorates that change of heart each year with its own parade of weaponry and pageantry in Naypyidaw, the isolated, sprawling capital it has built for itself.\nChinese social media users compare Trump\u2019s military parade to Beijing\u2019s show of force\nAs Chinese people watched the military parade live on state television, many social media users posted comparisons between today\u2019s show of force in Beijing and US President Donald Trump\u2019s parade over two months ago.\nIn June, Trump hosted the US military\u2019s largest parade in decades, marking 250 years of the army\u2019s founding. Dozens of tanks and fighting vehicles rolled through the streets of Washington, DC during the event, which coincided with Trump\u2019s 79th birthday.\nAt the time, he praised the army as the \u201cgreatest, fiercest and bravest fighting force,\u201d warning global enemies: \u201cIf you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you.\u201d\nToday, users of China\u2019s social media platforms, which are heavily censored, were adamant that their country\u2019s effort had come out on top.\nAnother Weibo user wrote that when compared to Trump\u2019s MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, \u201cwe have to admit that China\u2019s (parade) is just too handsome, and is embarrassing the United States.\u201d\nBoth countries are super powers, with sizable militaries boasting advanced technology and nuclear-capable weaponry.\nIndeed, the US Armed Forces is widely considered the world\u2019s most powerful in terms of technological superiority, global reach, and military budget, among other key metrics.\nBut the parades were markedly different \u2013 in purpose and messaging.\nParades like the one seen in Beijing today have historically been viewed by many as antithetical to US-style democracy. Trump had mooted holding such a parade during his first term, but it was scrapped at the time over concerns of cost and the optics of such a show of power.\nTrump\u2019s June parade leant towards pageantry, tracing the Army\u2019s 250-year history. It depicted different eras with vintage uniforms and equipment \u2013 going all the way back to the Revolutionary War.\nBy contrast, China\u2019s parade showed off its newest hardware, including laser weapons and undersea drones, rooting it firmly in the present \u2013 and depicting Xi Jinping\u2019s future vision for a new world order that can counter the West.\nBeijing claims full credit for China\u2019s WWII victory against Japan. Taiwan could not disagree more\nChina\u2019s resistance against Japan\u2019s full-scale invasion was a major front of World War II in Asia, where fighting only ended in September 1945 with Japan\u2019s surrender \u2013 months after Nazi Germany had been defeated.\nBut who led that resistance is hotly debated \u2013 and a battlefront between Beijing and Taipei over control of historical narratives and legitimacy.\nAfter Japan\u2019s invasion, Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists and Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) paused their years of fighting each other that had laid swathes of China to waste, and created a shaky alliance to fight the invaders.\nBut they resumed fighting after Japan\u2019s surrender, with Mao\u2019s Communists coming out on top in 1949, taking control of the Chinese mainland and forcing the KMT and the Republic of China leadership to flee to Taiwan, where they remain.\nMao then proclaimed the People\u2019s Republic of China that Xi now helms \u2013 and which has vowed to reunite with Taiwan one day, by force if necessary.\nAccording to a Council statement released before the parade, Mao\u2019s Communist party dedicated \u201c70% of efforts towards strengthening itself, 20% dealing with the Nationalist government, and 10% actually fighting Japan.\u201d\nTaiwan has banned all current and some former national security, military and diplomatic officials from attending the military parade, so as to not endorse Beijing\u2019s historical account.\nWorld leaders sit down for lunch reception\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and the world leaders attending today\u2019s events are sitting down for lunch following this morning\u2019s military parade.\nThe large banquet hall has round tables set with white tablecloths, wine glasses, name cards, flowers \u2013 and chopstick rests shaped like little pandas.\nThe defining image of the parade? Xi, Putin and Kim\u2019s show of unity\nFor many in the West, the defining image of Beijing\u2019s grand show of military might on Wednesday is not the parade of stealth fighter jets, hypersonic weapons or nuclear missiles \u2013 but the sight of Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un standing side by side in an unprecedented show of solidarity against the West.\nFrom atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace, Xi presided over a 70-minute parade to mark the end of World War II.\nOn his right was a strongman who\u2019s waging Europe\u2019s bloodiest conflict since 1945.\nAnd on his left, an Asian leader funneling troops and weapons to the battlefield.\nTo Xi, their strategic alignment with his vision for a new world order has earned them a prime seat at his big event celebrating the dawn of peace \u2013 seemingly outweighing their roles in launching and sustaining a war that has killed tens of thousands of people.\nAt various moments throughout the parade, the three autocrats \u2013 who had never appeared together in public before \u2013 are seen leaning toward one another, exchanging a few words or sharing a smile.\nThe deliberate display of unity is a pointed rebuke to US President Donald Trump\u2019s faltering attempt to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, and an open challenge to America\u2019s waning global leadership under Trump.\nThat message has seemingly been received by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social as the parade was underway: \u201cMay President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.\u201d\nQuick take: China\u2019s military display shows it has the might to back up Xi\u2019s vision of a new world order\nToday\u2019s parade was a startling display of weaponry designed to send a message that Xi Jinping\u2019s vision of a new world order with China at the apex will be backed up with high-tech arms that would seem, in many cases, to be ahead of Beijing\u2019s rivals.\nWhile much post-parade attention will be focused on new long-range nuclear-armed weapons \u2013 like the DF-61 intercontinental ballistic missile \u2013 what may be even more important in the long run are weapons like the new mobile truck- and ship-mounted laser air defense weapons.\nIf these are already deployed in numbers in the People\u2019s Liberation Army forces, as China has indicated in pre-parade press conferences, they could present real problems for any adversary\u2019s ability to blunt Chinese military movements around the region.\nThe huge volume of military hardware exhibited also shows that China has the industrial might to back up its words, and perhaps eventually enforce Xi\u2019s vision of the world.\nIt\u2019s the kind of industrial capacity the US put together to win World War II, the end of which Wednesday\u2019s parade was designed to commemorate.\nBut while US industry spelled the end of the Axis powers 80 years ago \u2013 a conflict China\u2019s communist forces fought alongside western powers \u2013 America now doesn\u2019t have the capacity to turn out weaponry in the numbers that China can.\n\u201cAnd also do it in larger volume in terms of sheer numbers of weapons deployed, so that is a real concern as well.\u201d\nStrongmen, weaponry and spectacle: These are the parade highlights\nChina\u2019s military parade has ended, though the day\u2019s events continue with a reception and extravagant gala.\nAlready, it\u2019s been an intentionally muscular show of force \u2013 attended by strongmen, several of whom are actively waging war \u2013 in a pointed message to the US-led world order.\nThis is the first time Xi, Putin and Kim have stood together \u2013 and it comes just days after Xi hosted a carefully choreographed summit of leaders from across Asia and the Middle East.\nThe events and attendance list send a clear message: China is ready to rebalance global power and has the military to back itself. Plus it has partners interested in the same vision, including the Russia-friendly European leaders of Serbia, Slovakia and Belarus.\nHere are the main takeaways:\n- The three strongmen: In one of the day\u2019s most striking moments, Chinese leader Xi Jinping led a select group of world leaders toward the Tiananmen rostrum \u2013 flanked by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was a clear message of unity between the three autocrats, who share a vision for an alternative world order to counter the longstanding dominance of the US and its Western allies.\n- Xi says China is \u201cunstoppable\u201d: Speaking before the parade, Xi emphasized Chinese nationalism and strength, telling his military that China\u2019s rise was \u201cunstoppable.\u201d He also warned that the world needed to \u201cchoose between peace and war\u201d and that China \u201cis never intimidated by any bullies.\u201d\n- The weapons: China\u2019s powerful military was on full display, with equipment shown including air-defense lasers for land and sea use, stealth fighter jets and nuclear-capable bombers, anti-ship missiles, its newest intercontinental ballistic missile, and two new extra-large undersea drones.\n- The spectacle: More than 50,000 spectators gathered in Beijing for the parade, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Videos showed people cheering, singing the national anthem, and waving small Chinese flags as tanks rolled past Tiananmen Square. Online users on China\u2019s heavily censored social media platforms described feeling a sense of patriotic pride.\nNorth Korea\u2019s Kim plays painstaking attention to optics at public events\nHaving travelled to North Korea 19 times since 2014, I\u2019ve seen how carefully Kim Jong Un curates his image. His appearances are never spontaneous. The applause is always rapturous. And behind much of that image-making is his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, who has helped shape him into a \u2018man of the people.\u2019\nThat obsession with optics is why his presence at Beijing\u2019s military parade will be of personal significance to Kim.\nFor him, it isn\u2019t just about watching China\u2019s tanks roll through Tiananmen Square. It\u2019s about being photographed alongside his counterparts Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Back in his capital Pyongyang, those images send a powerful message: your leader stands with some of the world\u2019s most powerful men.\nI also saw how Kim understood the power of optics when he travelled to Singapore for his first summit with US President Donald Trump in 2018.\nThe summit was enormously high stakes. But hours before he met Trump, Kim still found time to go for a nighttime walk through Singapore. Accompanied by a phalanx of bodyguards, his face lit up occasionally by the flashes of cameras, he was cheered on by thousands as he visited local landmarks and posed for smiling selfies with local political leaders.\nAll of it would have been a deliberate, calibrated choice.\nWhy Modi skipped Xi's military parade\nAs Chinese leader Xi Jinping paraded his vast arsenal on the streets of Beijing, conspicuously absent from the guest list was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who just days ago discussed the two leaders\u2019 growing friendship and bettering of ties.\nModi\u2019s decision to skip today\u2019s grand show is a calculated diplomatic statement. Attending the parade would be seen as a tacit endorsement of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, the very military engaged in a tense standoff with Indian troops in the Himalayas since a deadly clash in 2020.\nModi\u2019s stance was hardened by Beijing\u2019s role in India\u2019s brief, but deadly, conflict with Pakistan this year.\nChina has supplied 81% of Pakistan\u2019s imported weapons over the past five years, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute \u2013 some of which were used by Islamabad during its four-day deadly skirmish with New Delhi.\nBy abstaining from the parade, Modi sends a message: a return to normal relations is not possible while China simultaneously engages in border aggression and strategically props up India\u2019s primary adversary, Pakistan \u2013 a nation long hailed by Beijing as its \u201cironclad brother.\u201d\nFurthermore, Modi attending a parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, following Japan\u2019s formal surrender, would be viewed negatively in Tokyo, a critical economic and strategic partner for New Delhi.\nModi\u2019s absence makes a crucial distinction. While India can engage with China in multilateral forums, it will not separate this symbolic diplomacy from the realities of its national security concerns.\nRussia launches combined drone and missile assault on Ukraine as Xi\u2019s parade ends\nAs Xi hosted his military parade in Beijing, air raid sirens were going off across western Ukraine as the country\u2019s air defenses worked to repel a fresh Russian aerial assault, according to local authorities.\nResidents of the capital Kyiv were told to stay in shelters, with officials warning of a combined missile and drone attack.\n\u201cAir defense is operating in Kyiv! Stay in shelters until the all-clear is given!\u201d Timur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv\u2019s military administration, said on Telegram in a stark reminder of the conflict raging in Europe as Xi hosted two leaders waging that war.\nFor Context: While China claims neutrality in the war, the parade in Beijing delivered a striking image of Xi flanked by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose countries both have troops fighting Ukraine.\nChina has, however, supported Russia economically during the war and provided it with dual-use goods believed to have supported its war effort.\nThe devastation of Japan\u2019s wartime atrocities is still felt in Asia, 80 years later\nToday\u2019s massive military parade in Beijing marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, during which China was a crucial partner of the Allied powers.\nChina\u2019s fight against Japan\u2019s full-scale invasion became a major front of the war in Asia, ending only with Japan\u2019s formal surrender in 1945.\nTokyo\u2019s wartime atrocities during that period left deep fissures in the region and continue to sour relations with many of its neighbors to this day.\nInvasion of China: Many in Asia believe WWII broke out long before Nazi Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland in 1939 \u2014 as far back as 1931 when Imperial Japan invaded China, with all-out war between the two countries breaking out six years later.\nJapanese Imperial forces committed one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century in 1937: the Nanjing Massacre. Troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed men and civilians. They also raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, according to a post-war tribunal.\nChina puts the death toll at over 300,000.\nSexual slavery: South Korea has also had a fraught relationship with Japan for decades, strained by their painful colonial and wartime history.\nExperts estimate up to 200,000 girls and women from South Korea and other Asian countries were forced into Japanese sexual slavery during the war. The Japanese army used deception, coercion and force to bring what they called \u201ccomfort women\u201d into its brothels, according to a United Nations report.\n\u201cA large number of the women victims speak of violence used on family members who tried to prevent the abduction of their daughters and, in some cases, of being raped by soldiers in front of their parents before being forcibly taken off,\u201d the report said.\nThe topic remains a bitter point. In 2017, a memorial statue in a South Korean city became the center of a diplomatic spat, with Japan recalling two diplomats from Seoul.\nTaiwan closely watching China\u2019s military parade with fears it could one day be the target\nAmong those who watched China show off its newest military hardware, few paid closer attention than the government of Taiwan \u2014 the self-ruled, democratic island that Beijing views as its own territory and has vowed to seize by force, if necessary.\nUnder leader Xi Jinping, China has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan, sending fighter jets and warships around the island on an almost daily basis and looking to squeeze its presence on the world stage.\nTaipei will keep close tabs on the weaponry displayed, the foreign dignitaries in attendance, and the language used to describe Taiwan that might shed light on Beijing\u2019s sentiment, strategy and timeline for a potential invasion, analysts told CNN before the parade.\n\u201cTaiwan does not commemorate peace with guns,\u201d Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Wednesday, in a swipe at Beijing.\n\u201cWe believe that military hardware in our hands are for defense of our homeland, not for invasion or expansionism.\u201d\nIn the face of the China threat \u2013 and prodded by US President Donald Trump \u2013 Lai recently announced that the island will raise its defense spending to 5% of its GDP \u201cbefore 2030.\u201d\nBut on Taiwanese social media, few people appeared to be paying attention to the parade ahead of time, which analysts attribute to the fallout from recent domestic political rows and a general disconnect from China\u2019s World War II history."

      "text": "Officials in Chicago are bracing for a major federal immigration enforcement operation that could begin as soon as this week, with the city\u2019s mayor signing an order over the weekend aimed at resisting the Trump administration\u2019s planned crackdown.\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday such a move would be an \u201cinvasion\u201d and that he has had no communication with the Trump administration about reported plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago.\n\u201cNo one in the administration \u2013 the president or anybody under him \u2013 has called anyone in my administration, or me. So, it\u2019s clear that in secret they\u2019re planning this \u2013 well, it\u2019s an invasion with US troops, if they in fact do that,\u201d Pritzker said Sunday.\nThe operation is expected to kick off in Chicago by this Friday and could involve agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and potentially be backed by guard forces in a peacekeeping role, according to multiple sources familiar with the planning.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we\u2019re upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday.\nAn immigration operation in the city would further escalate a clash between the White House and Democratic-led cities and comes as President Donald Trump and his aides have repeatedly slammed Chicago over policies that limit cooperation between local authorities and federal immigration enforcement.\nAsked about expanding these operations beyond Chicago, Noem said that the Trump administration has \u201cnot taken anything off the table,\u201d and specifically named San Francisco and Boston in addition to Chicago. She suggested that Republican-led cities with crime problems were \u201cabsolutely\u201d also being evaluated.\nChicago has been preparing to try to resist Trump\u2019s planned immigration crackdown with Mayor Brandon Johnson signing an executive order Saturday providing guidance and directives to the city\u2019s agencies and law enforcement \u201cin the midst of escalating threats from the federal government.\u201d\nThe mayor\u2019s order \u201caffirms\u201d that Chicago police will not \u201ccollaborate with federal agents on joint law enforcement patrols, arrest operations, or other law enforcement duties including civil immigration enforcement.\u201d It also \u201curges\u201d federal law enforcement officers to use body cameras and refrain from wearing masks.\n\u201cWe may see militarized immigration enforcement. We may also see National Guard troops. We may even see active duty military and armed vehicles in our streets. We have not called for this. Our people have not asked for this, but nevertheless, we find ourselves having to respond to this,\u201d Johnson said before signing the executive order on Saturday.\nWhite House officials have made clear that these immigration enforcement plans are distinct from the idea the president has floated over the past week to use federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to carry out a broader crime crackdown in Chicago, similar to the current surge in Washington, DC.\nTrump took to social media Monday morning with a post celebrating what he called a massive victory over crime in the nation\u2019s capital and taking sharp aim at Democratic leaders across the country for refusing his floated plans for an aggressive federal anti-crime strategy in their states as well.\nHe contrasted politicians who are resisting his plans with what he sees as a more welcoming stance from Washington DC\u2019s leadership. In the Truth Social post, Trump said DC Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s \u201cstatements and actions were positive, instead of others like Pritzker, Wes Moore, Newscum, and the 5% approval rated Mayor of Chicago, who spend all of their time trying to justify violent Crime, instead of working with us to completely ELIMINATE it.\u201d\nTrump officials have been quick to criticize the Illinois governor and defend potential federal policing in the state by pointing to crime statistics.\nNoem pointed to homicide statistics in Chicago on Sunday in a dig to the governor, saying Pritzker \u201ccan talk about what a great job he\u2019s doing as governor, but he\u2019s failing these families. \u2026 This seems like it\u2019s more about Gov. Pritzker\u2019s ego now rather than actually protecting his people.\u201d\nIn a warning to Pritzker on Saturday, Trump told the governor to quickly \u201cstraighten\u201d out crime in Chicago or the federal government will intervene.\n\u201cSix people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn\u2019t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we\u2019re coming!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social.\nAt least 56 people were shot \u2013 seven of them fatally \u2013 in Chicago over the holiday weekend. Roughly 34 shootings have been reported since Friday at 10:32 p.m., with victims ranging in age from 14 to 48, according to incident notifications published by the Chicago Police Department.\nMeanwhile, the Chicago mayor\u2019s office last week touted a 21.6% decrease in overall violent crime and a 32.3% decrease in homicides so far this year.\nCNN\u2019s Ang\u00e9lica Franganillo D\u00edaz, Betsy Klein, Priscilla Alvarez, Alayna Treene, Hannah Rabinowitz, Haley Britzky, Alejandra Jaramillo and Dakin Andone contributed to this report."

      "text": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping made a veiled swipe at the United States on Monday as he criticized \u201cbullying practices\u201d and cast his country as a new leader of world governance, at a time when President Donald Trump\u2019s America First foreign policy is upending the globe.\n\u201cThe house rules of a few countries should not be imposed on others,\u201d Xi told more than 20 world leaders gathering at a two-day summit orchestrated to play-up China\u2019s global leadership and its close and enduring partnership with Russia, as the two neighbors seek to rebalance global power in their favor at the expense of the US and its allies.\nThe meeting of the Beijing- and Moscow- backed Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in the northern port city of Tianjin is China\u2019s biggest diplomatic event of the year, drawing political heavyweights including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\nAt the summit, Xi pledged 2 billion yuan ($280 million) in grants to SCO member states this year, and an additional 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in loans to an SCO banking consortium over the next three years.\n\u201cWe should leverage the strength of our mega-sized markets and economic complementarity between member states and improve trade and investment facilitation,\u201d the Chinese leader told his guests during opening remarks.\nLater in the day, Xi unveiled a brand new Global Governance Initiative, a sequel to his three earlier \u201cinitiatives\u201d on security, development and civilization that together serve as a loose outline for his vision of a reshaped international order.\n\u201cI look forward to working with all countries for a more just and equitable global governance system,\u201d Xi said, pledging to increase the representation and voice of developing countries and practice multilateralism \u2013 echoing longstanding calls from the Global South.\n\u201cWe should continue to dismantle walls, not erect them; seek integration, not decoupling,\u201d he added.\nXi\u2019s vision pushes back against what Beijing sees as the foundations of a US-led world order, opposing alliances like NATO \u2013 which in his view exist to enforce the West\u2019s rules-based system \u2013 and calling into question the concept of universal human rights, while seeking to reshape power at the United Nations and other bodies it sees as unfairly dominated by the West.\nWithout naming the United States directly, Xi vowed to oppose \u201chegemonism,\u201d \u201cCold War mentality\u201d and \u201cbullying practices\u201d \u2013 phrases often deployed by Beijing to criticize Washington.\nAs Trump alarms nations with his global trade war, withdrawals from international organizations, slashing of foreign aid and threats on social media, Beijing views the US as undermining the international order it worked to build \u2013 and sees an opportunity to ramp its own vision as an alternative.\n\u201cWe should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar of the world, and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization and make the global governance system more just and equitable,\u201d Xi said in his opening remarks.\nEchoing Xi\u2019s remarks, Putin said the SCO laid the groundwork for a \u201cnew system\u201d of security in Eurasia, positioning it as an alternative to Western-led alliances that he has long railed against.\nThe new system \u201cwould replace the outdated Eurocentric and Euro-Atlantic models, take into account the interests of the broadest possible range of countries, be truly balanced, and would not allow attempts by some states to ensure their security at the expense of others,\u201d Putin said.\nClose rapport\nThe summit is a showcase for closer ties between China and Russia, as well as the friendship struck up over the years by their two autocratic leaders.\nThe deep personal rapport between the two men was on show Sunday evening, when Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan hosted a welcome banquet for attending leaders.\nFootage released by Russian state news agency RIA showed Xi and Putin gesturing animatedly and smiling as they chatted at the event, showing a different side of the typically restrained Chinese leader \u2013 and his warm and relaxed demeanor with his Russian counterpart.\nThe SCO summit is also the leaders\u2019 first opportunity to meet since Putin\u2019s summit with Trump in Alaska in August \u2013 and comes as Putin resists Western pressure to end his onslaught in Ukraine.\nJust last week, Moscow\u2019s forces carried out their second largest aerial attack to date on Ukraine.\nOn Monday, Putin used his speech at the SCO summit to reiterate his talking points on the war in Ukraine, saying the crisis \u201cdid not arise as a result of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, but rather as a consequence of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Ukraine, which was supported and provoked by the West.\u201d\nMoscow launched a full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after Russia\u2019s troops previously seized the Crimea and swathes of eastern Ukraine.\nThe Russian leader praised efforts by China and India at facilitating the resolution of the crisis, and described the \u201cunderstanding\u201d reached with Trump at the Alaska meeting as \u201copening the way to peace in Ukraine.\u201d\n\u201cDuring the bilateral meetings scheduled for today and tomorrow, I will, of course, inform my colleagues in more detail and thoroughly about the results of the negotiations in Alaska,\u201d Putin said, adding that he had already informed Xi \u201cin detail\u201d during a lunch on Sunday.\nKremlin aide Yury Ushakov told Russian state media that Putin discussed Ukraine with world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, including Xi and Modi.\nUshakov downplayed the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, which was teased by Trump after he met the two leaders last month.\n\u201cEveryone is talking about a trilateral meeting, (or) about a meeting between Putin and Zelensky \u2026 But, as far as I know, there was no specific agreement between Putin and Trump about this,\u201d Ushakov told Russian state media journalist Pavel Zarubin on Monday.\nObservers said the Russian leader would have used the gathering to show that he\u2019s not alone on the global stage.\n\u201c(Putin) will seek to frame Russia\u2019s resilience and China\u2019s backing as evidence that Western sanctions and isolation have not worked,\u201d Li Mingjiang, an associate professor at Singapore\u2019s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said ahead of the gathering.\n\u201cAt the same time, he will try to deepen strategic alignment with Beijing, in particular to ensure Chinese supply of dual-use goods and equipment to Russia (and) to show that Moscow has strong partners even as Washington ramps up its push to end the war.\u201d\nUkraine war looms over summit\nChina has emerged as a key pillar of diplomatic and economic support for Putin\u2019s regime since the early days of the Ukraine invasion, even as it claims neutrality in the conflict.\nChinese firms have bought up swaths of discounted Russian oil and provided it with critical trade, including dual use goods that Western leaders say have powered Russia\u2019s defense industrial base. Beijing defends its \u201cnormal trade\u201d with Russia.\nTrump earlier this summer threatened to take aim at that partnership, saying China could face major tariffs on its goods if it continued to purchase fuel from Russia as it wages war.\nBut even as the US imposed such penalties on India last week, it has so far slow-rolled that threat as it seeks a broader trade agreement with Beijing.\nWhite House senior counselor for trade Peter Navarro said Monday that the show of unity between Russia, China and India is \u201ctroublesome.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the Modi to step up. I have great respect Modi. I love the Indian people,\u201d Navarro told reporters at the White House on Monday. \u201cIt was a shame to see Modi getting in bed, as the leader of the biggest democracy in the world, with the two biggest authoritarian dictators in the world, in Putin and Xi Jinping. That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s whopping 50% tariff on India has soured ties with Modi \u2013 and accelerated a nascent and cautious rapprochement between New Delhi and Beijing.\nThe Indian leader met with Xi on Sunday in his first trip to China in seven years, as both countries face stiff US tariffs and Western scrutiny over their relationships with Russia.\nOn Monday, Modi highlighted his ties with both his host and the Russian leader at the SCO summit, embracing Putin before the two walked over hand in hand to greet Xi. The three leaders then shared a conversation marked by smiles and laughter.\nModi and Putin also held a nearly hour-long private meeting in the Russian presidential limousine, the Aurus, while en route to their formal talks, according to Russian state media.\n\u201cIndia and Russia have always stood shoulder to shoulder even in the most difficult times,\u201d Modi said at the start of the meeting. \u201cWe have been in constant dialogue on the situation in Ukraine. We welcome all the recent efforts for peace.\u201d\nA readout from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said the two leaders discussed the latest developments concerning Ukraine. \u201c(Modi) reiterated his support for the recent initiatives that have been taken to address the conflict in Ukraine, and emphasized the need to expedite a cessation of the conflict, and find a durable peace settlement,\u201d the ministry said.\nObservers say that Xi sees the gathering \u2013 and a massive military parade that he\u2019ll host on Wednesday in Beijing, expected to be attended by Putin, North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un as well as some two dozen other leaders \u2013 as a critically timed diplomatic push.\nChinese officials touted this year\u2019s SCO as the largest yet, saying ahead of the event that 20 leaders from across Asia and the Middle East would join. In addition to Russia, China and India, SCO members include Iran, Pakistan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.\nCNN\u2019s Kit Maher and Darya Tarasova contributed reporting."

      "text": "President Donald Trump is not just trying to end the vicious war in Ukraine.\nHe\u2019s claiming he\u2019s already ended almost one war for each month of his second term \u2014 spanning the Middle East; Africa; and Central, South and Southeast Asia.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done six wars \u2014 I\u2019ve ended six wars,\u201d Trump said in his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders on Monday. \u201cLook, India-Pakistan, we\u2019re talking about big places, you just take a look at some of these wars. You go to Africa and take a look at them.\u201d\nThe White House proclaimed in a statement this month that \u201cPresident Trump is the President of Peace,\u201d listing a total of seven claimed bilateral agreements between Armenia and Azerbaijan; Cambodia and Thailand; Israel and Iran; India and Pakistan; Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Egypt and Ethiopia; and Serbia and Kosovo, as well as the Abraham Accords, a normalization pact signed in Trump\u2019s first term between Israel and some Arab states.\nOn Tuesday, the president told \u201cFox and Friends\u201d that \u201cwe ended seven wars.\u201d\nSome of this is classic Trumpian hyperbole. And the president\u2019s team is scanning the globe looking for fires to extinguish to claim quick wins for his transparent campaign for a Nobel Peace Prize.\nTrump hasn\u2019t suddenly reinvented American foreign policy. Every administration works to halt wars and to advance US interests. Most don\u2019t take constant victory laps \u2014 indeed, such triumphalism can often destroy quiet diplomacy.\nYet Trump has saved lives. In some cases, he\u2019s used presidential power in novel ways to stop sudden conflicts from escalating into full-scale wars.\nBut his success raises new questions that also apply to Ukraine. Is Trump in it for the long haul or just for deals he can hype, much as he licensed products as a businessman and stamped his name on them?\nAnd will Trump\u2019s evisceration of the US Agency for International Development and downsizing of the State Department deprive him of the tools the US needs to turn breakthroughs into lasting peace agreements that solve underlying causes of wars?\nThe blind spots in Trump\u2019s peacemaking record\nTrump kept insisting Monday \u2014 as he tried finesse his adoption of Russia\u2019s opposition to an immediate Ukraine ceasefire \u2014 that he was more interested in final deals.\nIronically however, some of his \u201csix wars\u201d deals are closer to ceasefires than peace agreements that permanently end generational disputes. And in the case of Iran and Israel, Trump\u2019s claims to have made peace after their 12-day conflict are complicated by US involvement in strikes against Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. While an informal truce is in place, there\u2019s no sign a slow-boiling state of war involving all three nations since Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolution in 1979 will end.\nTrump is also conveniently forgetting his failed attempt to end the war between Israel and Hamas. And global outrage over reports of widespread starvation in Gaza and the president\u2019s staunch support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could thwart his hopes for a Nobel Prize \u2014 whatever happens with Ukraine.\nHis record is also blotted by the failure of his first-term peace efforts with North Korea. Leader Kim Jong Un now has more nuclear weapons than before Trump offered him fruitless, photo-op summits.\nSome of Trump\u2019s biggest successes have been behind the scenes.\n\u201cI\u2019m struck by the fact that the ones that were helpful, especially India-Pakistan, were conducted in a professional way, quietly, diplomatically \u2026 laying the ground and finding common ground between the parties,\u201d said Celeste Wallander, a former assistant secretary of defense who is now with the Center for a New American Security.\nThe most recent triumph was a joint peace declaration signed by Armenia and Azerbaijan on their long-running conflict in the Caucasus.\nThe agreement, inked at a lavish White House ceremony, commits the two former Soviet republics to recognizing each other\u2019s borders and to renouncing violence against the other. But complex negotiations loom on knotty constitutional and territorial issues before a full peace agreement.\nThis deal is notable for two things \u2014 the way foreign states flatter Trump to get what they want, and an imperialistic streak in much of his peacemaking. The rivals, for instance, agreed to open a transportation corridor to which the US will have full development rights and to call it the \u201cTrump Route for Peace and Prosperity.\u201d\nAzerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev declared, \u201cPresident Trump, in six months, did a miracle.\u201d\nThis is smart deal for the US as it counters the influence of rival powers Russia and Iran in the region. But it will need Trump\u2019s constant attention. \u201cWishes and verbal declarations are not enough,\u201d two former US ambassadors to Azerbaijan, Robert Cekuta and Richard Morningstar, wrote in a recent Atlantic Council commentary. They called on Trump to deploy officials from the State Department, the Commerce Department and other agencies to lock in the agreement.\nAnother of Trump\u2019s recent triumphs came in Southeast Asia, where he threatened to shelve trade deals with both Thailand and Cambodia to halt a border war last month that killed at least 38 people. The leverage pressed home in calls to leaders of each country was effective, and it might not have occurred to another president. But Trump didn\u2019t work alone. The agreement was brokered by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet knew the drill, however. He nominated Trump for the Nobel Prize for \u201cextraordinary statesmanship.\u201d\nPakistan took a similar step, as part of a successful diplomatic offensive to win over Trump and to disadvantage its nuclear-armed rival India after the president intervened in a border clash in May. But the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, an erstwhile Trump buddy, dismissed Washington\u2019s claims of a pivotal role. And other states, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Britain, were also involved. Trump\u2019s claims to have ended a war are selective. The agreement is fragile and doesn\u2019t solve the territorial dispute that sparked the fighting \u2014 over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which has caused three full-scale wars.\nTrump has proclaimed a \u201cglorious triumph for the cause of peace\u201d in a deal brokered between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. This contains important first steps on recognizing borders, renouncing war and disarming militia groups. However, no one expects the conflict to end soon, since the main Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group has rejected the agreement. Some analysts see the initiative, also brokered by Qatar, as a US attempt to secure mineral rights as part of an African \u201cgreat game\u201d against China.\nTrump\u2019s claim to have brokered peace between Egypt and Ethiopia is a stretch. He\u2019s referring to a dispute over a Nile dam in the latter nation that Egypt fears will reduce the flow in its share of the key strategic waterway. He has called for a deal over the dam, but no binding agreement has been reached.\nThe White House claims on Serbia and Kosovo originate in Trump\u2019s first term, when the rivals agreed to economic normalization steps. But they still don\u2019t have diplomatic relations, 17 years after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia. And recent normalization efforts have involved the EU more than the Trump team.\nIn many ways, Trump\u2019s claims to have ended six or seven wars are typical of a presidency that claims massive wins that often add up to less than what they seem. But there are real achievements in his record, and the possibility of genuine long-term breakthroughs if Trump can maintain application and patience.\nThat\u2019s a good lesson for his nascent Ukraine peace drive.\nThis article and headline have been updated with additional reporting."

      "text": "It was not the applause, or the red carpet, or the ride in the Beast, or speaking first on the podium, that were the biggest gifts offered up to Vladimir Putin at the Alaska summit. President Donald Trump\u2019s greatest favor to his Russian counterpart was time.\nEven as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky heads to Washington on Monday with a phalanx of European leaders to hold hurried talks with Trump, the war grinds on.\nRussian success or failure on the front line will be measured in a matter of weeks. Putin has until mid-October until the weather cools, ground softens, and advances become harder. That is a full two months. His forces are on the brink of turning painfully incremental and costly micro-advances into \u201cnowhere\u201d villages in eastern Ukraine into a more strategic gain.\nAlmost every day, another settlement falls. The secondary sanctions Trump has threatened \u2013 which would penalize those buying Russian oil and gas \u2013 and has now twice backed away, would not stop Putin\u2019s war effort this year. But it has already clearly piled pressure on him, in the forms of calls from the leaders of India and China, and may have led him to accept the invitation to meet with Trump in Alaska, where he was welcomed so graciously.\nPutin does not want to maintain a lengthy war effort under economic pressure from his two main energy customers and effective sponsors, themselves having to endure tariff pain from the United States. And so, he is in a rush on the battlefield, but agonizingly slow at the negotiating table.\nTrump\u2019s instincts correctly assessed that reality in Anchorage, his pained expression belying the positive claims from Russian and American staffers of how well the meeting had gone. Getting on well with another president you have welcomed with clapping and a limousine is not real diplomatic progress. And he perhaps knew that.\nIn truth, Alaska did not go as awfully as it could have for Kyiv. Ukrainians had to endure a relatively brief revisionist history lesson from Putin at the podium, and the distasteful repetition of how Ukraine and Russia are \u201cbrotherly\u201d nations, despite Moscow\u2019s nightly murder of Ukrainian civilians in air assaults. But there were two positive notes for Kyiv.\nFirstly, Trump and Putin did not cook up a madcap, real-estate, Sharpie-map peace deal in a hurry, that was short on detail and heavy on wins for Moscow, as some had feared they might. The opposite happened - no deal emerged.\nThe second gain for Ukraine is that the intransigent nature of Putin \u2013 despite all of Trump\u2019s fawning \u2013 was widely on display. Trump appeared sullen: no lunch, no questions from the press, no return invitation to Moscow unequivocally accepted, and even the suggestion, in an interview with Fox News, that \u2013 of all things \u2013 he wished he hadn\u2019t agreed to talk to network host Sean Hannity. At the end, Trump apparently did not want to be there, and Putin may be in error to have made him feel that way.\nBut the evolution of Trump\u2019s thinking is not all a win for Zelensky. Paramount is the overnight evaporation of a demand for a ceasefire. It was the bedrock of European and Ukrainian thinking last week, and even crept into Trump\u2019s talking points ahead of Alaska. But Putin has never wanted one, as it would stop his military advances.\nAnd so, as of Saturday morning, the demand has vanished and the focus shifted to a quick, enduring peace deal. There is no such thing; a lasting deal could take weeks to formulate, if not much longer. But European leaders stepped back from their ceasefire demand in their Saturday joint statement and Zelensky even said the \u201ckilling must stop as soon as possible\u201d rather than preconditioning further talks on a ceasefire.\nTrump also took whatever the bad deal was that Putin proposed, and turned it into pressure on the resilient victim \u2013 Kyiv. It would be Zelensky\u2019s decision what to do next, and Trump urged him to take the deal.\nThe proposed deal, from what we know, seems potentially quite bad for Ukraine. One European official told CNN that Putin had persisted with his demands for control of all of the Donbas region - something politically and practically impossible for Zelensky to concede, and which he\u2019s already rejected. This part-maximalist demand emerged after US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff\u2019s meeting in the Kremlin earlier this month, with added confusion over whether this demand meant Putin had given up on claiming the rest of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, now partially occupied by Russian forces.\nBut Putin is a studied, patient pragmatist. He can take what he can now and then come back for the rest later. He has no electoral cycles to worry about, given his grip on the country, although likely knows his overheated and hyper-militarized economy cannot keep going like this indefinitely.\nIn his post-talks remarks, Putin remained set on what he considers the \u201croot causes\u201d of the conflict being fixed \u2014 which have previously included Ukraine\u2019s existence as a sovereign state and NATO\u2019s eastward expansion since the end of the Cold War \u2013 and on \u201cpeace\u201d for Ukraine, which effectively means its surrender and more dead civilians. He even ominously urged Europeans and Ukraine to not get in the way of whatever proposal he had floated at Trump.\nTrump has not fully fallen for this play. His Monday meeting in the Oval Office with Zelensky will likely reveal an evolution in their relationship, and Trump\u2019s view of Putin, since their ghastly February blowout. It will be another moment when, whatever Zelensky hears, he will have travelled with only one option available to him, and that is to nod along and play nice. But this time, Zelensky will be flanked by more than half a dozen key European leaders, and Trump perhaps is mindful they are better buddies to him than Putin has been.\nWhether this united front can persuade Trump remains to be seen. While standing next to Zelensky at a press conference, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen affirmed that Ukraine must become a \u201csteel porcupine\u201d to deter future invasions.\nThe problem for Ukraine is not how the circus of diplomacy plays out, but the horrors outside of the tent. The time it would likely take to bring the parties together for further talks could be all Putin needs on the battlefield to effect real change.\nThe coming weeks are the slow limp forwards that Putin wants: Tension between Trump and Zelensky first, followed by European pressure on Trump to ease off on Zelensky, followed by awkward and technical stalling over a three-way meeting between Trump, Putin and Zelensky.\nPutin only has to claim scheduling or location conflicts for a week to buy yet more time.\nThen a trilateral meeting, if there is one, only risks repeating the cycle again; Putin makes unreasonable demands he knows Ukraine cannot accept, Trump pressures Zelensky to accept them to get quick points on the board, and European leaders lean on Trump to recall that Ukraine\u2019s security is also theirs. And rinse and repeat.\nTime. Putin needs it to conquer. Trump hates wasting it without points on the board. Zelensky\u2019s forces do not have it. European leaders hope it erodes Russia\u2019s economic ability to fight.\nMuch of it has passed since Trump came to power promising to end the war in 24 hours, and while he is clearly wiser to Putin than in February, little in terms of the hard dynamics and demands of this war have changed."

      "text": "The mass firing of State Department employees could significantly impact the Trump administration\u2019s ability to address the priorities it has said it values, multiple former and current department officials told CNN.\nScores of personnel focused on issues the administration has said are no longer priorities were cut last week, including teams dealing with climate change, global women\u2019s issues, educational exchanges, refugees and Afghan resettlement.\nBut Friday\u2019s reductions in force (RIFS) also impacted offices working on issues prioritized by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, including counterterrorism, stopping drug trafficking, energy diplomacy and mitigating passport and visa fraud.\nPolitical leadership has said the functions will be carried out by other parts of the State Department and were \u201ccarefully tailored\u201d to avoid impacting core functions. However, officials warn that a lack of continuity and loss of expertise could be dangerous.\n\u201cThe loss of so much experience will make it harder for the United States to stop terrorists from successfully launching a major terrorist attack on American soil,\u201d one former State Department official said.\nThere was also a sense of chaos as the cuts were implemented. Although some of the Washington, DC, offices hit by layoffs had been identified for elimination under the State Department\u2019s reorganization plan, sources who spoke with CNN said many of the firings came as a surprise to even managers.\nOthers said they had been given little to no guidance from political leadership on how to transition the work of the more than 1,300 fired personnel. A few people received notices they were being fired, only to have those notices rescinded hours later.\nThe office that assists the families of US citizen employees who die overseas had its entire staff fired, sources told CNN, leaving at least one grieving family in limbo.\nEven some personnel from the office that helped to plan the logistics for collecting electronic devices from fired employees \u2013 and were doing so on Friday \u2013 got notices that they were being laid off.\nNumerous personnel who were fired had worked at the agency for decades. Nearly 250 were foreign service officers, including some who already were set to serve in other offices.\n\u201cI had one friend who found out while she was midair\u201d and checking something on the airplane Wifi, one former State Department official told CNN.\nA senior State Department official said last week that the reorganization \u201clooked at the functions that were being performed, not at individuals.\u201d\nIn a memo Friday announcing the start of the firings, the State Department said the cuts had been \u201ccarefully tailored to affect non-core functions, duplicative or redundant offices, and offices where considerable efficiencies may be found from centralization or consolidation of functions and responsibilities.\u201d\nHowever, sources say it is impossible to isolate the cuts to \u201cnon-core functions.\u201d\nImpact on issues crucial to administration\nOn issues like consular affairs, personnel processing visas and passports were not fired. However, cuts to other offices may have an impact, sources said.\nRubio had previously said that the State Department might expand the Bureau of Consular Affairs, which is responsible for visas and passports and helping citizens overseas, in order to meet demand for upcoming events in the US like the Olympics and the World Cup.\nTop State Department official Michael Rigas on Wednesday told lawmakers that people who \u201care adjudicating passports, who are doing the customer service work that we want to see continue were not reduced or eliminated.\u201d\nHowever, there were offices within the Consular Affairs bureau that had people fired on Friday.\nThe cuts come as the administration has applied new levels of scrutiny for those seeking student and exchange visas to the US.\nThe Bureau of Consular Affairs\u2019 Office of Fraud Prevention Programs saw significant cuts, sources said. That unit works \u201cto protect the integrity of all consular services from fraud,\u201d according to a State Department article from October 2023.\n\u201cEffective fraud detection and prevention contributes to U.S. border security, facilitates legitimate travel, and protects U.S. citizens,\u201d the article said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to square any of this with what the administration has been saying,\u201d another former State Department official said.\nThey questioned how the bureau would be able to meet demand \u201cwhen you\u2019re cutting all of the support elements,\u201d like cutting staff on the fraud prevention unit and contract management, as well as canceling assignments for people on their way to fill key posts.\nThey fear that if the remaining workforce is able to meet the increased demands in the short term by doing multiple jobs, \u201cit\u2019ll just reinforce the idea that we didn\u2019t need any of these positions,\u201d they said, \u201cbut in the long term, the amount of damage it\u2019s going to do is real concern to me.\u201d\n\u201cThe disconnect between what they\u2019re saying and what they\u2019re doing \u2013 it\u2019s a gulf,\u201d they said.\nCounterrorism impact\nAnother bureau handling counterterrorism was significantly impacted by the reorganization. Some of its functions are being moved to other parts of the State Department, like bureaus that focus on regional or multilateral issues. Those bureaus may not prioritize counterterrorism, officials warn. Other functions are being eliminated entirely.\nThe office that focused on countering violent extremism had all of its workforce fired. This included those working to reintegrate foreign terrorist fighters in places like Syria or targeting racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism, such as White supremacist groups.\n\u201cGiven how this administration loves designating new groups as terrorist organizations, you\u2019d think that counterterrorism would\u2019ve been relatively safe, but it was instead gutted,\u201d another former State Department official said, noting that what remains will be a \u201cwatered down\u201d version without the ability to develop strategic plans.\nThe first former State Department official said that although terrorist designations will continue, the pivot to naming Latin American drug cartels as terrorist groups will increase the workload of those who make such designations.\nOn energy diplomacy, former officials say there is another disconnect.\nRubio earlier this year testified before Congress that energy will \u201cbe at the forefront of policy for the next 100 years.\u201d He said one of the reasons for that is that artificial intelligence requires tremendous energy, which means there will be \u201cstrategic opportunities\u201d for nations.\n\u201cWe need to be at the table to have conversations about not just what our role in energy is but how we help invest or partner with countries that have a supply of energy,\u201d Rubio said.\nRubio acknowledged that the Bureau of Energy Resources would be rolled into the economic bureau at the department as part of the restructuring.\nHowever, another former State Department official who was fired from that office said that the number of people working on energy diplomacy at the department will decrease from about 100 people to 35 people and handicap the department\u2019s ability to deliver on an administration priority.\n\u201cNot showing up at international energy conferences will be one repercussion. That means losing out on real business deals. At those meetings we bring the asks of US companies to raise with senior officials from other countries. And at these conferences there is major Chinese participation. If the countries don\u2019t talk to us, they talk to China,\u201d the former official said.\nAnger mounting within department\nMeanwhile, anger is mounting within the department over the cuts and the way they were handled.\nAt one employee town hall for one of the impacted bureaus Tuesday, hundreds of anonymous \u2013 and angry \u2013 questions and comments poured in.\n\u201cColleagues were RIF\u2019d based solely on the position held on a certain day, merit played no role. How do you plan to regain our trust going forward?\u201d one asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to hear you ask for patience and team effort, when you decimated our teams and it does NOT sound like there was any advocacy involved to protect us,\u201d another said.\nDuring the town hall those questions from anonymous State Department employees were public for participants to see, but the leadership answering questions largely ignored them before ending the session, officials explained.\nA number of townhalls for various branches of the State Department have been held in the days since Friday\u2019s mass firings."

      "text": "Two weeks after his high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of tangible progress he\u2019s made to end the war in Ukraine and is contemplating how involved he should be personally in brokering a meeting between Kremlin and Ukrainian leaders, administration officials tell CNN.\nThe president, the officials say, is particularly irritated with the pace of negotiations and lack of progress following his meeting with the Russian leader.\nJust 72 hours after the face-to-face with Putin in Alaska, Trump gathered seven European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, stepping away to call his Russian counterpart as he sought to broker peace. But since then, progress has slowed dramatically. And in public, Trump has sometimes downplayed the role he would have to play in bringing about an end to the war \u2014 or even bringing the Russians and Ukrainians to the bargaining table.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta be up to them. It takes two to tango,\u201d Trump said Monday in response to questions about whether Russia has committed to a meeting with Zelensky.\nAs Trump has privately stewed, Putin has shown no signs of ending his country\u2019s relentless bombing campaign on Ukraine. This week saw one of the deadliest attacks on Ukraine since the start of the war, with at least 25 people killed, including four children, according to Zelensky.\nTrump \u201cwas not happy about this news, but he was also not surprised,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters after the assault, adding that Trump was watching the developments \u201cintently.\u201d\nNormally not one to hold back his condemnation, Trump himself was notably silent \u2014 even as European leaders expressed outrage over Russia\u2019s actions, which damaged buildings belonging to the European Union and the British Council. Both the EU and the United Kingdom summoned top Russian diplomats in their capitals as a result.\nTrump has in the past threatened \u201csevere consequences\u201d on Putin if he did not end the war. Last week, he said he would know within \u201ctwo weeks\u201d whether Russia was serious about entering negotiations \u2014 invoking a deadline he has frequently cited, only it see it come and go without actions. But in those same comments, he floated the possibility of walking away altogether, a possibility he has yet to rule out, officials said.\nAfter those two weeks are up, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m going to make a decision as to what we do. \u2026 it\u2019s going to be a very important decision, and that\u2019s whether or not it\u2019s massive sanctions or massive tariffs, or both, or do we do nothing and say, \u2018It\u2019s your fight.\u2019\u201d\nPressed by CNN on whether he\u2019s seriously considering doing nothing, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019ll see who\u2019s fault it is. If there are reasons why, I\u2019ll understand that. I know exactly what I\u2019m doing. We\u2019re going to see whether or not they have a meeting, that will be interesting to see, and if they don\u2019t, why didn\u2019t they have a meeting because I told them to have a meeting. But I\u2019ll know in two weeks what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\nWhile the Trump administration continues to weigh its options, Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s foreign envoy, met on Friday with Ukrainian officials in New York City ahead of Kyiv\u2019s emergency UN Security Council meeting. Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine\u2019s office of the president and chief of staff, and Sergiy Kyslytsya, first deputy foreign minister, were among those in attendance. The meeting came a day after the Trump administration approved a $825 million sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles to Ukraine.\nThe major question is whether the administration can successfully broker a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelensky, which Trump has aggressively pushed for both in public and private conversations. Top Trump officials, including Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have said that such a meeting was a necessary next step to negotiating an end to the war.\n\u201cWorld leaders have affirmed that President Trump made more progress towards peace in two weeks than Joe Biden did in three-and-a-half years,\u201d White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CNN in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukrainian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war.\u201d\nWhile Zelensky has agreed to a face-to-face meeting with Putin, the Kremlin has so far thrown cold water on the idea, leaving broader talks about how to move forward at a stalemate."

      "text": "As US tariffs on China surged over the past decade, South and Southeast Asia became key destinations for foreign and Chinese companies to diversify their supply chains.\nBut with US President Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist swing going truly global in his second administration, these nations now find themselves caught in the crossfire \u2013 facing some of the highest tariffs in the world and a rapidly shifting global trade order that could pinch American consumers.\nMany regional leaders publicly celebrated the new US tariff figures when they were released last week, keen to remind domestic audiences that they were lower than those initially threatened by Trump.\nBut analysts and economists warn the new levies are still historically steep and should not be shrugged off.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gut punch to these countries and they need to try to negotiate it lower,\u201d said Dan Ives, global head of research at financial services firm Wedbush Securities. \u201cThe worry is US is trying to cut off China\u2019s export routes and it speaks to the high tariffs facing these nations.\u201d\nCountry-specific tariffs aren\u2019t the only concern for nations and businesses in the region.\nThe Trump administration has announced a separate extra 40% tariff on so-called \u201ctransshipments,\u201d goods shipped from a high-tariff country to a low-tariff country before being re-exported to the US.\nThe China factor\nThanks to its geographic positioning, large youth populations, burgeoning middle classes and growing infrastructure, South and Southeast Asia are regions of competing interest and competition for the US and China.\nEarly in the 2.0 trade war between the US and China, Chinese leader Xi Jinping boarded an Air China jumbo jet bound for Southeast Asia, marking his first foreign trip of the year.\nAs the Trump administration was lobbing tariffs and demands in April, Xi was meeting with trade partners in Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia, positioning China as a reliable partner and defender of global trade.\nOver the recent decades, many countries in the region built themselves up with global and Chinese investors looking to diversify away from China, transforming them into export-driven economies.\nUS-China tensions that flared during Trump\u2019s first term and the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the Southbound shift. Labor-intensive industries \u2014 from garments to footwear and lower-end electronics manufacturing and assembly \u2014 became pillars of economic growth.\nBut now, with Trump\u2019s global tariff blitz and sweeping levies on transshipments, that momentum is facing serious headwinds, as companies are being forced to rethink whether maintaining operations in the region still makes commercial sense.\n\u2018It\u2019s really lose-lose\u2019\nWhen Trump initially threatened his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d reciprocal tariffs on April 2, South and Southeast Asia shuddered. Cambodia faced 49%, Laos 48% and Bangladesh 37%.\nThe new levies unveiled continued to impose steep rates on several nations in the region. Among the highest levies were 40% on Laos and Myanmar, the second-highest behind only 41% on Syria, however neither have a particularly large trade relationship with the US.\nThe rates on places like Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand \u2013 all of which have become key low-cost manufacturing hubs for US consumers \u2013 were lowered to 19 or 20%.\nPublicly, regional leaders reacted positively to their final tariff rate with the US.\nCambodia (19%) described it as good news for the people and its economy, Malaysia (19%) called its final rate a \u201csignificant achievement\u201d and Bangladesh (20%) praised the result of its trade negotiations as a \u201cdecisive diplomatic victory\u201d.\nBut for Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation, an organization that focuses on trade, the idea that the lower tariff rates are a win is \u201cmisguided.\u201d\n\u201cThese rates are very high, and they only look less high because the US used this nonsense formula in April, and the way that the formula was designed really punished firms located in countries where they export a lot to the US, but they import relatively little, mostly because they\u2019re much poorer than the United States,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really lose-lose,\u201d she added, explaining that it\u2019s a setback for American consumers and companies, as well as export-reliant Asian economies.\nOne silver lining for these countries, however, is that most received relatively similar tariff rates of around 20% \u2013 meaning garment powerhouses like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka are not significantly worse off than their competitors.\nTransshipment tariffs\nThe threat of further transhipment tariffs adds an extra layer of bureaucracy for both businesses both globally and in the US.\nThe US already imposes penalties and fines on transshipped goods that undergo minimal or no substantial transformation in a third country after leaving their country of origin. The new 40% tariff will be applied on top of those existing penalties, a senior administration official told CNN.\nBut Trump\u2019s definition of transshipment in his latest tariff announcement has appeared to take on a much broader meaning \u2013 with China as the unmistakable target.\n\u201cWhat Trump seems to be using when he talks about transshipment is Chinese content. So that\u2019s a very different definition of transshipment, as in, anything that comes from Asia is suspect for transshipment,\u201d Elms said.\nUncertainty remains for countries and businesses in the region as White House officials have yet to clarify how the tariff will be defined, which goods will be targeted, and how their contents will be evaluated.\nThis is not the first time Trump has sought to impose tariffs on these indirect shipments. In a deal with Vietnam, one of the earliest deals he struck since April, he also included 40% tariffs on transhipped goods, in additions to 20% on the Southeast Asian country\u2019s exports to the US.\nThough not explicitly named in the deal, China vehemently protested at the time and said it would take \u201cstrong measures\u201d to protect its rights.\nLast week, after Trump\u2019s announcement of the transshipment tariffs, China reiterated its view that \u201ctariff and trade wars have no winners.\u201d\n\u201cProtectionism harms the common interests of all countries,\u201d said foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.\nReshaping supply chains\nFor South and Southeast Asian countries, Trump\u2019s tariffs are poised to reshape supply chains in the region over the medium to longer term, while driving down overall trade with the US, according to Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at research firm Oxford Economics.\n\u201cWe are already seeing some moderation in what we think are rerouted trade in the recent monthly trade figures out from various economies in Asia,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, the years-long trend of companies diversifying their productions from China to South and Southeast Asia may come under mounting pressure because of the transshipment tariffs.\n\u201cThe new punitive treatment would either short-circuit this Southbound shift in manufacturing we\u2019d seen over the past decade, or incentivise more creative ways of rerouting by Chinese manufacturers,\u201d Loo said.\nWhat could happen is that manufacturers of low-margin, labour-intensive sectors such as furniture and toys could reshore back to China given the shrinking cost advantages and potential to benefit from greater economies of scale, she said. And for products that rely heavily on US market access like household appliances, nearshoring may become a more attractive option, she added.\nBut other experts were less convinced that Trump\u2019s tariff would halt or even reverse the offshoring of manufacturing from China.\n\u201cChina\u2019s labor costs have been rising and it is gradually losing competitiveness in some more labor intensive lower end manufacturing,\u201d said Lynn Song, chief Greater China economist at Dutch bank group ING.\nHe added that with most countries still facing lower tariff rates than China, tariffs alone are unlikely to derail the broader trend of investment.\nOn the contrary, the new measures could even accelerate Chinese manufacturing expansion abroad, Song said.\n\u201cIf transshipment tariffs are targeting Chinese made goods making a stop with minimal value added in Vietnam before being sent to the US, it could make sense to relocate part of the manufacturing process to Vietnam so that it still qualifies as a Made in Vietnam product,\u201d he said.\nCNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly contributed reporting."

      "text": "President Donald Trump just enacted a new wave of tariffs on dozens of America\u2019s trading partners, marking a substantial escalation in ongoing trade tensions that could constitute the biggest change to the global economy in nearly a century.\nThe historic new trade policy follows months of false starts to Trump\u2019s so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff rollout and countless bilateral trade negotiations, a handful of which resulted in agreements that fended off even higher tariffs.\nTrump and his economic advisers have celebrated the considerably higher tariffs that have already gone into effect, correctly noting that they have raised more than $100 billion in tax revenue without leading to catastrophic inflation or a recession, as some economists had feared.\nThe president is moving forward with new, significantly more aggressive tariffs that economists fear could exacerbate budding economic problems, including rising inflation and slowing job growth, that are just now becoming more apparent.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the tariffs:\nWhat are the new rates?\nBefore Thursday, virtually every country\u2019s goods were subject to a minimum 10% tariff. Now rates vary substantially from country to country.\nThe highest rates imposed are on goods from Brazil (50%), Laos (40%), Myanmar (40%), Switzerland (39%), Iraq (35%) and Serbia (35%).\nAn additional 21 countries also face levies greater than 15%. That includes several countries the US relies heavily on for a variety of goods, such as Vietnam (20%), India (25%), Taiwan (20%) and Thailand (19%).\nGoods from India could also be subject to an additional 25% tariff stacked on top of that because of an executive order Trump signed Wednesday that seeks to penalize India for purchasing oil from Russia. That second tariff is slated to take effect on August 27.\nThirty-nine countries\u2019 goods, as well as members of the European Union, are subject to 15% tariffs, according to a list the White House published last week.\nBesides Canada and Mexico, all other countries the US imports goods from will continue to face a minimum 10% tariff, albeit with a few exemptions.\nGoods from Mexico and Canada are exempt from tariffs if they\u2019re compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement. If not, goods from Mexico are subject to 25% tariffs, while goods from Canada are subject to 35% tariffs, up from 25% previously.\nWhat\u2019s the deal with the trade deals?\nIn most cases, they\u2019re not exactly trade deals, per se, but rather rough sketches of ones that could take months, or even years, to finalize \u2014 assuming they don\u2019t fall apart.\nOver the past five months, Trump announced eight trade agreements. Of those, only two \u2014 with the United Kingdom and China \u2014 have been formalized. The agreement with China, which significantly lowered tariff rates both countries imposed on one another\u2019s goods, expires on August 12. If both countries fail to act, rates could spike again.\nMost agreements Trump announced involve trading partners committing to purchasing more American products, like oil, cars, Boeing airplanes, defense equipment and agricultural goods. They also involve hundreds of billions of dollars worth of investments in American businesses.\nBut it\u2019s unclear if the United States and other trading partners involved in agreements are on the same page about many of the proposed terms. For instance, Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and a lead Japanese trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, both recently said many key details are still being worked out and are telling a vastly different story from Trump, who earlier this week said the country agreed to buy Ford F-150s.\nAre any goods exempt from the new tariffs?\nYes, plenty.\nOne notable exemption is smartphones, which aren\u2019t subject to any of the new rates. Additionally, goods for which Trump imposed separate sectoral tariffs or ordered investigations that could result in higher rates won\u2019t be stacked on top of country-specific \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.\nFor the time being, that means pharmaceuticals, for instance, could be imported from countries duty-free. However, Trump is warning they could soon face significantly higher rates.\nThe EU sought to preempt those tariffs by negotiating a 15% tax on pharma exports to the US as part of the agreement announced with Trump. Other countries involved in trade agreements similarly are getting more favorable rates on certain sectoral tariffs.\nThere\u2019s also a partial exemption for certain goods manufactured abroad where at least 20% of their value comes from American materials and labor.\nWhen are these tariffs effective?\nTechnically they\u2019re already in effect, but there\u2019s a caveat.\nThe executive order Trump signed last week essentially states that most goods that were loaded on ships and in transit to the US before 12:01 am on Thursday will face whatever the prior tariff rates were until October 5.\nThis isn\u2019t the end\nIn addition to pharma tariffs, Trump has threatened to impose across-the-board tariffs on semiconductors and lumber. At an Oval Office event on Wednesday, for example, Trump said he would soon place a 100% tariff on chips and semiconductors, although he didn\u2019t give a timeline.\nAnd while the tariffs Trump just enacted could ultimately be rendered illegal, pending an ongoing court challenge, the president has plenty of levers he can pull to keep pushing his agenda for higher tariffs."

      "text": "Donald Trump did exactly what he said he\u2019d do.\nThere was no weekslong debate in the West Wing, no careful coordination with congressional allies, no intensive staff presentations detailing arcane legal authorities. There was just a social media post from the president suggesting a Federal Reserve governor should resign and then, a few days later, another one announcing she\u2019d been fired.\nIn interviews with more than a dozen Trump administration officials across Washington and Republican lawmakers back home in the final days of their August recess, they all shared a similar refrain in the hours after Trump moved to terminate a Federal Reserve governor for the first time in history: They had no idea it was coming.\nBut several Trump officials suggested the signs were obvious. Just days earlier, the president had pledged to reporters that he\u2019d fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she didn\u2019t resign over allegations of mortgage fraud.\n\u201cThe president said he\u2019d do this if she didn\u2019t resign,\u201d said a Trump administration official. \u201cWell, she didn\u2019t resign.\u201d\n\u201cThe president is a man who sticks to his word,\u201d a second Trump official told CNN.\nCook has denied the fraud allegations and on Thursday morning sued to keep her job, asking a judge to rule that Trump\u2019s attempt to remove her is unlawful. Minutes after Cook filed her lawsuit, she asked the court to step in on an emergency basis to keep her on the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors while her case plays out. That request is likely to move quickly through court.\nThe White House, however, argues Trump was well within his legal bounds to oust her.\n\u201cThe president absolutely has the authority to fire a fed governor for cause, and I think the accusations are serious,\u201d White House Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett told reporters Wednesday morning. He added that Cook should be placed on leave until the accusations are resolved.\n\u201cThe fact that she is not doing that suggests that she is partisan and is trying to make a partisan stance, which is contrary to the independence of the Fed.\u201d\nA unique series of events\nTrump\u2019s Truth Social post just after 8 p.m. Monday night announcing he\u2019d fired Cook set the stage for a historic legal showdown that could determine whether the century-old central bank retains its independence from the White House.\nIt also capped what multiple Trump officials have described as a remarkable sequence of events that led to the moment, beginning on August 1 with the arrival of a resignation letter addressed to Trump from another Biden-appointee to the Federal Reserve Board nearly six months before the end of her term.\nAdriana Kugler\u2019s decision to leave the Fed, which was announced publicly a few hours later that Friday afternoon, came as a surprise within the Fed and inside the West Wing, three people familiar with the matter said. Trump was thrilled, one said.\nThe open seat created an immediate chance for Trump to add an ally to the Fed\u2019s seven-member board ahead of a critical meeting next month in which the board will vote on whether to lower interest rates \u2014 a move Trump has made plain he wants.\nWithin a week, Trump selected Stephen Miran, his chief economist and the intellectual architect of his tariff strategy who has echoed his view that the Fed should cut rates.\nMeanwhile, a Trump official at an obscure federal housing agency began sharing directly with the president accusations that Cook had committed mortgage fraud, a source familiar with the move told CNN \u2014 creating a potential legal basis to justify Cook\u2019s removal.\nSuddenly, Trump had the chance to fill not one but two extra seats on the board, giving him a potential 4-3 majority and a path to do to the Fed what he\u2019s done to other government institutions over the past several months \u2014 bend it to his will. And all of this without firing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, a consistent target of Trump\u2019s ire in recent months.\nDiscussions with a small group of his closest advisors, some of whom made the case that the legal authority was clear, as were the allegations against Cook, created an opportunity for Trump to take action.\nHe decided to fire Cook, just like he said publicly he would.\nTrump\u2019s consultations included Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, widely viewed as the most powerful of Trump\u2019s economic advisors and, at least so far, as a stabilizing influence in a White House bent on disruption. Bessent has long sought to reassure markets about the administration\u2019s belief in the importance of Fed independence \u2014 despite Trump\u2019s long-running pressure campaign.\nTrump has told advisors he wants to move quickly to appoint a replacement for Cook, Trump administration officials told CNN, and at a lengthy Cabinet meeting on Tuesday proceeded to publicly acknowledge the primary reason for his decision to fire Cook.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a majority very shortly, so that\u2019ll be great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOnce we have a majority, housing is going to swing and it\u2019s going to be great. People are paying too high an interest rate.\u201d\nSeated around the large table on Tuesday was Bessent, who, without naming Cook, made an unsolicited attempt to justify the decision to fire her.\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s independence comes from a political arrangement between itself and the American public. Having the public\u2019s trust is the only thing that gives it credibility,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cAnd you sir, are restoring trust to government.\u201d\n\u201cThe President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNN in a statement.\nMeanwhile, Senate Republicans, many of whom have spoken publicly and often about their belief in an independent Fed, can blow up Trump\u2019s entire plan if they don\u2019t confirm his nominees and, should the courts side with the administration, the seat held by Cook.\nThe first test will play out as soon as next week, when Miran is likely to have his confirmation hearing.\nTrump\u2019s aides have quietly been laying the groundwork for weeks to ensure an accelerated confirmation process in an effort to get Miran in place before the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s next policy meeting begins on September 16.\nClearing another roadblock\nPeople close to Trump told CNN that, unlike during his first term when he was surrounded by advisers who held him back, he is more emboldened than ever to push the bounds of his executive authority \u2014 especially on issues where he views the end result to be worth it.\nForcing out a high-ranking member of the Federal Reserve, specifically one facing allegations of mortgage fraud, meets that requirement, they argued, even if the allegations are still unproven. In conversations with multiple Trump administration officials and allies of the president, they said the underlying reason for Trump\u2019s fixation with the Federal Reserve boils down to a key point: he views their decisions as being a roadblock to achieving his broader vision of success. And the fact that the independent bank operates wholly out of his control only adds fuel to that fire.\nBut the controversial decision did not happen in a vacuum. It came after months of Trump\u2019s dissatisfaction with his inability to address an issue he views as core to fulfilling a key campaign promise: ensuring a thriving economy.\nTrump\u2019s fixation on ousting Cook also grew out of the work of Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has spent weeks fueling Trump\u2019s exasperation with the Fed.\nAlong with taking his mortgage fraud accusations about Cook directly to Trump, Pulte also made the allegations public on social media and television \u2014 creating a potential legal basis to justify Trump\u2019s eventual decision to fire her.\nThe accusations mirror similar allegations lobbed by Pulte at other perceived political foes. He has called for mortgage fraud investigations into Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\nIn a statement, Schiff\u2019s attorney, Preet Bharara, called the mortgage fraud investigation \u201cthe very definition of weaponization of the justice process.\u201d Lowell, who also represents James, said the investigation against her was \u201cthe most blatant and desperate example of this administration\u2019s carrying out the president\u2019s political retribution campaign.\u201d\nThose investigations have been led by Ed Martin, a Justice Department lawyer who was recently named the special attorney for mortgage fraud. Like Pulte, Martin has been a reliable attack dog for the Trump administration.\nThe latest probe is less than a week old and hasn\u2019t resulted in charges, let alone a conviction. But that was enough for Trump to trigger a court battle his administration has long taken pains to avoid and rupture the exceedingly fragile view that Fed independence may escape Trump\u2019s unyielding drive to bend institutions to his will.\nHe did it because he said he would, on the advice of advisors who long believed he could, and with little clarity on what will happen next.\n\u201cHonestly, what the hell happens now,\u201d a longtime senior Senate Republican aide asked in an unsolicited late-night message to CNN. \u201cWe just jumped into the unknown.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with news of Cook\u2019s lawsuit filed Thursday morning."

      "text": "For the last three days, Xi Jinping has played host in one of China\u2019s busiest port cities, welcoming leaders from across Asia and the Middle East for a carefully choreographed summit designed to showcase his vision of a new world order.\nNow, the Chinese leader is set to exhibit a very different image with an ostentatious show of military might.\nOn Wednesday he will commandeer Beijing\u2019s main artery \u2013 the Avenue of Eternal Peace \u2013 for a major military parade showing off the country\u2019s cutting-edge hypersonic weapons, nuclear-capable missiles, and undersea drones, alongside thousands of goose-stepping soldiers.\nXi\u2019s message with his multi-day exercise of soft and hard power, is clear: China is a force that wants to reset global rules \u2013 and it\u2019s not afraid to challenge those of the West.\nHitting that message home is Xi\u2019s guest list for the gathering, a cohort of more than two dozen China-friendly world leaders topped by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which also includes Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.\nThat also makes the first time that the leaders of a quartet of nations Washington strategists warn are converging to form an anti-American \u201caxis of upheaval\u201d will be together in one event.\nFor the Western leaders desperately trying to ramp up pressure on Putin to end his war in Ukraine, those optics will appear stark.\nIran, North Korea, China and Russia are seen as an emerging anti-American axis by some observers in the West precisely because Tehran and Pyongyang have fed Moscow weapons and \u2013 in the case of Pyongyang \u2013 troops, while China has aided its war-torn economy and industry.\nAs Xi gives them seats by his side on a symbolic day for China, he is showing himself as the one global heavyweight who could stand a real chance to pressure Putin to end his war \u2013 and that he\u2019s not going to use that pull to play by the West\u2019s rules.\nFor Xi, China\u2019s longest-serving and most powerful leader in decades, the symbolism \u2013 and its timing \u2013 will be purposeful.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the US is shaking up its alliances and causing economic pain for countries around the world, including among friends and allies, with his global trade war. Xi sees an opportune moment to make what might be his most dramatic showing yet of his challenge to a world based on Western rules and sensibilities.\nAlready the optics are paying off for the Chinese leader.\nGlimpses of the leaders\u2019 activities in recent days have shown a powerful camaraderie among those gathered, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Putin greeting Xi animatedly, Modi embracing Putin, and leaders reaching out to greet the Russian leader as he walked shoulder to shoulder with Xi.\nThese moments are arguably as powerful outcomes as the statements made, signaling a convergence of leaders without the West.\n\u201cWhat Xi is trying to convey is certainty about China\u2019s role in international affairs. This is clearly signaling to people throughout the region that China has arrived as a great power and it\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d said Jonathan Czin, the Michael H. Armacost Chair in Foreign Policy Studies at Brookings.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a US ally or partner, sitting in a capital somewhere in the region, and you have real doubts about whether or not you can rely on the United States as a partner, that\u2019s an uncomfortable split screen to be viewing,\u201d he added.\n\u2018The time is now\u2019\nThroughout his pageantry and diplomacy of recent days, Xi has appeared well aware of the opening the shake-up of American foreign policy has given him.\nIn his speeches and meeting with leaders gathered for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on Sunday and Monday \u2013 a cohort of leaders from as far afield as the Maldives to Mongolia \u2013 Xi played up a message that world is in a state of flux and chaos, and China is the responsible, stable power to guide it into the future.\n\u201c(We must) oppose the cold war mentality, block confrontation and bullying practices,\u201d Xi declared as he spoke to a room of gathered leaders Monday, using language that\u2019s long been China\u2019s code to describe what it sees as the US\u2019 behavior. He also pledged hundreds of millions in grants to SCO member states this year \u2013 and launched a push to reform the international system.\nThe message is not new, but Beijing is betting it lands differently after the leading global superpower has cut off its vast network of foreign aid, slapped crippling tariffs on developing countries, and raised questions among its allies and partners about whether it really has their backs.\nAs China\u2019s leader put it in a speech late Monday: \u201cThe house rules of a few countries should not be imposed upon others.\u201d\nAnd Xi has already seen benefits from the American shift.\nLook no further than India, whose Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seen smiling and laughing as he spoke with Xi beside Putin on Monday \u2013 a significant show of warmth from a leader long wooed by US as an Asian counterweight to China.\nJust last month India was slapped with up 50% tariffs on its exports to the US, half of those due as a penalty for its purchases of Russian oil, which the US sees as helping to fund Putin\u2019s war.\nAnd even for countries, like those in Southeast Asia, who have long looked warily at China\u2019s growing military power and assertiveness when it comes to its territorial claims in the South China Sea and over Taiwan, the shifting global dynamics could have an effect, observers say.\nIf there\u2019s a time to woo leaders that have long tried to hedge between the US and China, said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore, \u201cthe time is now.\u201d\n\u2018A credible alternative\u2019\nBut as much as Xi is using his highly choreographed itinerary this week to pitch his leadership to a broad cohort of nations, he\u2019s also using it to push back on Western criticism of his longstanding ties with partners like North Korea, Russia and Iran \u2013 all seen as rogue actors by the West.\nIn the wake of Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, voices in Washington have warned of an emerging coordination between what\u2019s been alternatively dubbed an \u201caxis of upheaval\u201d or an \u201caxis of growing malign partnerships\u201d \u2013 though experts say so far there\u2019s been few signs of four-way coordination.\nAt least until now.\n\u201c(China\u2019s military parade) will be the first time that the leaders of China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran are all present in the same place,\u201d said Brian Hart, a fellow of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \u201cThere have been little or no quadrilateral engagements between the four countries, so this is a distinctive moment.\u201d\nChina has been careful to not be seen as explicitly endorsing these countries\u2019 aggression \u2013 for example it\u2019s widely seen to have sent large quantities of dual-use goods but not lethal weapons to Russia as it wages its war.\nBut as Xi gathers these players together, he wants to signal that he can set the rules around who \u201cshould be deemed acceptable by the international community, regardless of what the democratic West or the US may think,\u201d according to Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London.\nEven still, the optics may also appear less stark with Trump in the White House. Last month, he hosted Putin for an apparently friendly summit where he said he\u2019d \u201calways had a fantastic relationship\u201d with the warring leader and greeted him personally on the tarmac.\nThe American president also used a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung last month to discuss meeting again with Kim. Both would be peace efforts \u2013 but Trump is well known to praise these autocrats.\nBut Xi\u2019s message is part of a more sweeping vision for the Chinese leader, who may see no more fitting a moment to signal his alignments than the upcoming military parade, which commemorates the 80th anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender in World War II and China\u2019s role fighting the imperial power that waged a years-long and brutal invasion of its lands.\nLike Putin, Xi has looked to pull from that history to reshape a narrative that positions China and Russia, which fought in World War II as the Soviet Union, as guardians of a \u201cpost-war\u201d international order, distinct from the US-one they see as dominant now.\nIn Xi and Putin\u2019s eyes, a key cause of the war in Ukraine today \u2013 or even North Korea\u2019s bid to develop nuclear weapons \u2013 is not those countries\u2019 aggressions, but the US and its allies ignoring their \u201clegitimate security concerns.\u201d\nAnd more broadly, their rhetoric blames the US and the alliances and value systems it formed in the wake of World War II for global crises, confrontation and disparity in the world today.\nThis week, Xi is \u201cunapologetically defending a post\u2013World War II order that he sees as under assault by Western powers determined to block China\u2019s rise,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace in the US.\nAnd as he surveys the global landscape and calls leaders from near and far to his side, Zhao added, \u201cXi is pressing ahead with a campaign to delegitimize US leadership, weaken Western solidarity, and elevate China as a credible alternative.\u201d"

      "text": "Their relationship is defined by a bloody border dispute, a vast power imbalance and a fierce contest for influence across Asia. Yet, President Donald Trump\u2019s latest trade war may be achieving the unthinkable: pushing India and China into a wary but tactical embrace.\nTrump\u2019s announcement of a new base tariff rate of 25% in India \u2013 later set to rise to a staggering 50% as additional punishment for purchasing Russian oil \u2013 in some ways mirrors the long pressure campaign he\u2019s waged against China and creates a shared interest between New Delhi and Beijing.\nWhile a thaw in India and China\u2019s fractious relationship was already underway, analysts say Trump\u2019s actions have added to this shift.\nNew Delhi and Beijing now find themselves navigating a volatile and unpredictable Washington that treats strategic partners and geopolitical rivals with the same transactional disdain, be they in Europe or Asia.\nBut in chastising India for not having a more open economy and its energy ties to Russia, the Trump administration is punishing the very nation the US has spent years cultivating as a democratic counterweight to China\u2019s power \u2013 creating an opening for Beijing.\nThis tactical realignment is underscored by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s reported plans to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit later this month, which would be his first trip to China in seven years.\nWhen asked to confirm Indian media reports about Modi\u2019s attendance, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Beijing \u201cwelcomes\u201d Modi for the meeting. \u201cWe believe that with the concerted effort of all parties, the Tianjin summit will be a gathering of solidarity, friendship and fruitful results,\u201d said spokesperson Guo Jiakun.\nYet, as the niceties play out in public, analysts say this is an alliance of convenience, not conviction.\nThe deep-seated strategic distrust between Asia\u2019s two giants, born from their border conflict and struggle for regional dominance, remains firmly in place. For now, they are aligned partly not by a shared vision, but by a shared antagonist in the White House.\n\u201cWe may see a greater thaw in India-China ties in face of a tough United States,\u201d said Farwa Aamer, Director of South Asia Initiatives, Asia Society Policy Institute.\nBut she warned that New Delhi must not lose sight of Washington and \u201crisk reversing the growth in relations it has long worked hard on to achieve.\u201d\nMassive trust deficit\nIndia\u2019s relationship with the US has undergone a dramatic transformation, from Cold War estrangement to crucial partners in the 21st Century.\nSince Modi, a right-wing Hindu nationalist, swept to power in 2014, the relationship reached new heights, partly driven by the personal rapport he developed with Trump during his first term, during which the Indian leader cast aside staid diplomatic protocol to campaign for his counterpart\u2019s second term during a rally in Houston.\nNew Delhi\u2019s growing alignment with Washington became even more critical as its own relationship with Beijing cratered after deadly border clashes in 2020 pushed the two Asian giants further apart than at any time in decades.\nThe US\u2019 commitment to India deepened under the Biden administration, which identified New Delhi as a vital counterweight to Beijing\u2019s growing influence. President Joe Biden often lavished praise on Modi, while largely setting aside sharp criticism from rights groups over the Modi administration\u2019s alleged democratic backsliding at home.\nBut then came Trump\u2019s re-election, with a turbocharged \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy that looked far beyond confronting just China on trade.\nIn a move that threatens to shatter this two-decade consensus, the US president publicly reprimanded New Delhi earlier this month over its Russian oil imports, calling the Indian economy \u201cdead\u201d and singling out India for Washington\u2019s highest global tariff rate.\nWith his new tariffs, Trump is punishing a country that currently imports 36% of its crude oil from Russia, much of it used to support its booming economy and growing 1.4 billion-strong population.\nBut by treating New Delhi as a transactional adversary to be punished, Washington risks shattering a cornerstone of its Indo-Pacific strategy, said Milan Vaishnav, director and senior fellow, South Asia Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nTrump\u2019s latest actions, \u201ctake us right back to that era of estrangement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US-India relationship is robust enough that it won\u2019t be undone overnight, but these moves have created a massive trust deficit on the Indian side.\u201d\nWhile many nations have rushed to strike trade deals with Trump to lower tariffs, India under Modi has been less willing to cave.\nIndia shot back, calling the tariffs \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cunjustified,\u201d pointing out the hypocrisy of Trump\u2019s move and noting that the US and Europe still buy Russian fertilizers and chemicals.\nTrump has repeatedly called India a \u201ctariff king,\u201d but a senior Indian official said the country is \u201cfar from\u201d it, noting that India imposes \u201czero to low duties on many key US exports\u201d including coal, pharmaceuticals, aircraft parts and machinery.\nIndia imposes some higher tariffs on the US than vice versa, particularly on agricultural imports that attract a simple average tariff of 39% compared to the US\u2019s 5%, according to a report from the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.\nThe \u201cmood (toward the US) is hardening in India, partly because of the way Mr. Trump has gone about and played his cards,\u201d said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of foreign policy at the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank. \u201cThe way he does diplomacy through public channels, and the way he seems intent on reducing the space for the Modi government to maneuver.\u201d\nModi, who was under pressure by opposition politicians to stand up to his long-term friend, defended his country at an event last week.\n\u201cIndia will never compromise on the interests of farmers, fishermen and dairy farmers,\u201d he said. \u201cI know personally, I will have to pay a heavy price for it, but I am ready for it.\u201d\nA common cause\nThe unintended consequences of Trump\u2019s policies, analysts say, have the potential to push historic rivals New Delhi and Beijing into a strategic embrace.\nThere has been a gradual normalization of ties between India and China after Modi met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia last October. India and China agreed to resume direct commercial flights, Beijing recently agreed to reopen two pilgrimage sites in western Tibet to Indians for the first time in five years, and both started re-issuing tourist visas for each other\u2019s citizens.\n\u201cFor its own economic reasons, namely a slowdown in growth and a slump in foreign direct investment, India has signaled a greater willingness to entertain warmer trade and investment linkages with China,\u201d said Vaishnav, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nBut this convergence remains limited by the deep-seated mistrust between them, rooted in their deadly border clashes in the Himalayas and China\u2019s strategic entrenchment in Pakistan.\nVaishnav predicted the future would be one of duality: \u201cI expect we will see increasing economic cooperation coupled with strategic rivalry,\u201d he said of the relationship between India and China.\nWashington\u2019s willingness to antagonize a key partner like India has also baffled observers.\nOne view is that the Trump administration lacks a clear, overarching strategy, diminishing India\u2019s crucial role as a democratic counterweight to China.\n\u201cThere is no coherent China policy in this administration,\u201d said Vaishnav. \u201cWhich means India\u2019s role as a bulwark against China is under-emphasized.\u201d\nHe added that as Trump\u2019s mood on Russia soured, \u201cIndia\u2019s Russian oil imports became an easy target.\u201d\nA more personal motivation may also be at play.\nAnalysts suggest Trump\u2019s hostility could have been triggered by a bruised ego after India downplayed his alleged role in defusing a major crisis with Pakistan. Trump announced he had brokered a ceasefire following a military escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbors in May.\nWhile Islamabad publicly praised the claim and even nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize, Indian officials refused to credit Washington\u2019s apparent intervention.\n\u201cAfter that, things went belly up,\u201d Pant said. \u201cThe (trade) deal which at one point seemed very doable, kept on going. And the more frustrated Mr. Trump has become, the more voluble he has become in terms of his public threats to India.\u201d\nCritics say Trump\u2019s policies could be leading to the very outcome some US strategists have long sought to avoid.\n\u201cIt could be the worst outcome for the United States,\u201d Trump\u2019s former National Security Adviser John Bolton told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins.\n\u201cThe irony here is that while the secondary tariffs against India are intended to hurt Russia, it could push India back closer to Russia and, ironically, closer to China, perhaps negotiating together against the US tariff efforts.\u201d"

      "text": "President Donald Trump is making sure to share \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 a recent government analysis that shows his sweeping array of tariffs is expected to reduce the federal debt by $4 trillion over the next decade, more than forecast only a few months ago.\nThe president has referenced the Congressional Budget Office report in multiple remarks and on Truth Social since it was released on Friday, saying it shows the success of one of his key, but controversial, policy platforms.\n\u201cThe tariffs came in at $4 trillion,\u201d Trump said at an Oval Office event on Monday afternoon, the second time he mentioned the report that day. \u201cThe CBO, they just announced it. I told them that was going to happen, but they refused to give us credit for it. Now they\u2019re giving us credit because the money is flowing in.\u201d\nHowever, how much revenue the US actually realizes depends on several important factors, including whether the current levies remain in place into 2035 and how the nation reacts to the higher tariffs. The tariffs are expected to increase inflation and potentially weaken the economy, which could in turn reduce federal revenue. (The CBO\u2019s analysis did not take the economic impact into account.)\nAlready, the president has announced some recent changes not incorporated into the analysis, including the coming suspension of tariff-free entry for products under $800. On the flip side, a federal appeals court is considering whether Trump overstepped his legal authority to impose many of the tariffs, which may lead to at least some of them being undone.\nAlso, the president hasn\u2019t mentioned that the One Big Beautiful Bill, his domestic policy agenda that he signed into law last month, is expected to increase the federal debt by an estimated $4.1 trillion or so between 2025 and 2034, more than his tariffs are forecast to bring in.\nImposing sweeping tariffs\nSince taking office in January, Trump has slapped tariffs on a wide range of goods and countries, including increasing tariffs on most Chinese goods by 30%, on automobiles and car parts by up to 25%, and on most imports of steel and aluminum by 50%, among other examples. The levies are expected to increase the price consumers pay for computers and other electronics, clothing, toys, furniture and more, even as the president insists that foreign governments will pick up the tab.\nThe beefed-up tariffs are projected to lower the federal deficit by $3.3 trillion over the 2025 to 2035 period, plus reduce interest costs by an additional roughly $700 billion, for a total impact of $4 trillion, according to the CBO\u2019s latest estimate. It looked at tariffs imposed as of August 19.\nThe CBO had estimated in early June that the tariffs implemented through May 13 would reduce the federal debt by a total of roughly $3 trillion.\nHowever, Trump has also modified the rates on countries and sectors numerous times.\nFor instance, Trump slapped a minimum 20% tariff on most Chinese goods in April. But within days, he increased rates to 145% in response to China imposing higher tariffs on American goods. In May, following bilateral trade negotiations, both countries agreed to lower rates on one another\u2019s goods, with the US charging a minimum of 30%. Rates are set to stay at the previously agreed upon levels through November. However, Trump said Monday that he\u2019s prepared to hike tariffs on Chinese goods as high as 200% if it doesn\u2019t ship more rare-earth minerals to the US.\nThe president also recently said he would consider distributing at least some of the tariff revenue to Americans in the form of rebate checks, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on CNBC last week that the money would go to paying down the national debt.\nTariffs and other customs duties have generated nearly $156 billion in revenue so far this year, through August 22, according to Treasury Department data.\nThe revenue is more than most people expected, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a watchdog group. And it could be difficult to pull back, though it would depend on the economic consequences.\n\u201cIf we see a significant increase in inflation and a recession or something, it\u2019s more likely that these get reversed, either wholesale or piece-wise through trade deals,\u201d he said, noting that a prior CBO estimate that took economic impact into account showed tariffs would likely decrease revenue somewhat. \u201cWhereas, if you just see a one-time, small price shift and some mild economic weakness, we may learn to live with these.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report."

      "text": "What we're covering\n\u2022 Presiding over a military parade in Tiananmen Square to commemorate the end of World War II, leader Xi Jinping said China\u2019s rise is \u201cunstoppable.\u201d\n\u2022 Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un flanked Xi at the start as the trio stood together publicly for the first time \u2014 a defiant challenge to the US-led world order.\n\u2022 Commenting on the parade, President Donald Trump accused China, Russia and North Korea of conspiring against the US.\n\u2022 The parade unveiled hundreds of advanced weapons and featured over 10,000 troops, showcasing China\u2019s growing military power under Xi\u2019s push to modernize the world\u2019s largest standing army.\nNOW: Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin are meeting in Beijing\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are sitting down in Beijing for formal talks after attending China\u2019s military parade.\nRussian pool footage showed the two leaders seated in chairs side by side, speaking through interpreters.\nThe leaders have drawn closer together since Russia invaded Ukraine, with Kim sending North Korean soldiers to fight for Moscow on the front lines.\nXi has staged more military parades than any Chinese leader since Mao\nToday is the third time Chinese leader Xi Jinping has presided over a military parade on Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square \u2013 equaling the combined total of his three immediate predecessors.\nDeng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao each oversaw just one Tiananmen parade, traditionally held on the decennial anniversaries of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nXi continued that custom but also forged his own tradition, designating September 3 a day of national commemoration of Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II and marking the 70th anniversary of that defeat with a massive parade in 2015. Today\u2019s event marks the 80th anniversary of the defeat.\nThe only Chinese leader who staged more military parades was Mao Zedong, who oversaw 11 consecutive National Day spectacles between 1949 and 1959.\nXi has also overseen two parades outside the capital: one in Inner Mongolia in 2017 marking the PLA\u2019s 90th anniversary, and another in Qingdao in 2019 celebrating the PLA Navy\u2019s 70th birthday.\nNorth Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un set for talks with Russia\u2019s Putin in Beijing\nRussia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin is set to meet North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un for formal talks in Beijing, according to Russian state media.\n\u201cThe venue for the bilateral meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is now prepared,\u201d state news agency TASS reported.\nThe pair will meet at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in western Beijing where Putin has been staying during his visit.\nThe flags of both Russia and North Korea are on display at the guesthouse, TASS reported.\nThe psychology of military parades\nWe\u2019ve just gotten a glimpse of how overwhelming China\u2019s parades can be. Tanks rolling past in endless columns, jets roaring overhead, soldiers marching in perfect lockstep. It\u2019s military theater designed to project unstoppable power.\nI\u2019ve previously covered one of these massive events in Beijing, and several in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. The experience of being there is unforgettable. The ground literally rumbles beneath your feet as gigantic mobile missile launchers and tanks thunder across the vast, echoing Kim Il Sung Square. Goose-stepping soldiers snap their salutes toward the podium from where the supreme leader watches. Tens of thousands erupt in perfectly timed cheers, amplifying the raw power on display.\nWhen you\u2019re there in person, it\u2019s overwhelming. When you watch it on TV, it\u2019s ominous. The message is clear: if you threaten this nation\u2019s sovereignty, here\u2019s what awaits.\nAnd now, in Beijing, the symbolism is even greater. Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un are Xi Jinping\u2019s top guests. Their unity on this stage isn\u2019t just about reassuring and energizing their own people. It\u2019s aimed at unsettling the US-led world order that has defined global power for decades. The images themselves are a propaganda weapon. A defiant display of hard power aimed at the world, and especially at the United States.\nIf China's parade was intended to irk Trump, it worked perfectly\nPresident Donald Trump is mad that China is palling around with his strongman friends.\nTrump erupted on social media as footage aired of Chinese leader Xi Jinping hosting the authoritarian leaders of Russia and North Korea in today\u2019s parade, accusing the trio of conspiring against the US..\nThe Truth Social post means one thing: If China\u2019s two big gatherings of authoritarian leaders, US adversaries and erstwhile allies this week was intended as a personal affront to the US president, it worked perfectly.\nAnd it underscored the futility of his attempts to subject the true global hard men to his art-of-the-deal charms and his claims that his supposedly close relationships with such leaders can be decisive.\nTrump met with Putin in Alaska last month, but his gushing red-carpet welcome has so far failed to unlock any progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. The US president\u2019s first-term summits with Kim were similarly unsuccessful.\nChina\u2019s big celebration comes at a tense international moment as the new Asian superpower seeks to capitalize on Trump\u2019s erratic foreign policy, which has shattered America\u2019s reputation as a reliable great power.\nTrump\u2019s fury was ironic, since the last few days in China have seen the kind of performative spectacle that he loves.\nBut the gathering of anti-Western powers in Beijing is about more than trolling. It\u2019s an early warning that Trump\u2019s second-term policies based on tariff coercion, the bullying of lesser powers and \u201cAmerica First\u201d nationalism may be backfiring.\nJapan says it has followed \u201cthe path of a peaceful nation\u201d since WWII\nIn response to China\u2019s military parade commemorating its defeat in WWII, Japan has reaffirmed its postwar commitment to peace, even as tensions rise again with Beijing.\nTokyo\u2019s wartime atrocities in Asia have left deep fissures in the region and continue to sour relations with many of its neighbors to this day.\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at his regular press briefing Wednesday that Japan has \u201cconsistently followed the path of a peaceful nation\u201d based on its determination never to repeat the tragedy of war.\nAs the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons, Japan has long portrayed itself as \u201cpeace-loving.\u201d But rising tensions with China, now labeled Japan\u2019s \u201cgreatest security challenge,\u201d are reshaping that stance.\nTokyo is rapidly expanding its defense capabilities, boosting spending to 2% of its GDP by 2027, buying US Tomahawk missiles, developing next-generation fighter jets and converting helicopter carriers to launch F-35s.\nJapan\u2019s military buildup reflects growing alarm over China\u2019s assertiveness, especially repeated incursions into Japanese waters and airspace.\nXi\u2019s gala menu for Kim, Putin and other foreign leaders includes lamb, lobster and salmon\nAs Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his fellow foreign leaders dig in for lunch in Beijing, they\u2019ve got a sumptuous menu prepared.\nThe menu, shared by Hong Kong-based state-linked newspaper Wen Wei Po, includes a host of dishes drawing from both Chinese tradition and more international flavors:\n- Chicken soup with conch meat and lily bulbs\n- Roasted lamb chops\n- Stir-fried lobster with crab meat, roe and egg white\n- Clear scallop consomm\u00e9 with assorted mushrooms\n- Roasted salt-marinated salmon with creamy mustard sauce\nOther items include fried rice, pea cake and a mango mouse cake, and two selections of red and white wine \u2013 both originating from China\u2019s Hebei province.\nFor Xi and Putin, commemorating World War II is more about the present\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin watched their first military parade together on Moscow\u2019s Red Square in 2015, on the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.\nFor Russia \u2013 and before it, the Soviet Union \u2013 parades have long been a tradition on major WWII anniversaries. Victory Day parade has become an annual event in Red Square since 1995.\nChina has its own tradition of grand military parades \u2013 staged to celebrate the regime\u2019s founding every 10 years \u2013 but it did not hold any WWII parades until 2015, after Xi designated September 3 as a national commemoration day to mark Japan\u2019s defeat.\nJoseph Torigian, an expert on Chinese and Russian politics, explains why Xi and Putin place such weight on WWII commemorations:\nTorigian said the leaders see World War II as a blow to those forces, \u201cYet, in the words of Putin, the Nazis were defeated, but not eliminated. So it\u2019s imperative for Xi and Putin to use World War II to remind their citizens about the need to continue the struggle.\u201d\nFor Xi and Putin, Torigian said, the end of World War II was a moment when their nations won the respect they believe China and Russia always deserved.\nBeijing parade a rare outing for Myanmar\u2019s embattled junta chief\nToday\u2019s military parade in Beijing is a welcome outing for the US-sanctioned chief of Myanmar\u2019s junta, who led a coup that has plunged his country into a brutal, years-long civil war.\nSenior General Min Aung Hlaing hasn\u2019t travelled abroad much since 2021, when he ended a decade-long experiment with democracy in Myanmar, locked up politicians and imposed military rule.\nSwathes of Myanmar are in armed revolt against the junta; its economy is in tatters and young people are fleeing in droves. Last year prosecutors at the International Criminal Court said they were seeking a warrant for Min Aung Hlaing for crimes against humanity.\nFor Beijing, Myanmar is a vital source of rare earths, natural gas and jade \u2013 the green gemstone revered in China, where it has a cultural significance that dates back thousands of years and an industry worth billions of dollars a year.\nFor Myanmar\u2019s military, Chinese aircraft, artillery and drones provide a technological edge over the rebel groups and pro-democracy fighters mounting a shoestring resistance against its rule.\nBut the relationship is complicated \u2013 Beijing also maintains close ties with rebels along their shared border, some of whom have humiliated the junta on the battlefield in recent months.\nThere\u2019s some awkward history too.\nThe Myanmar military can trace its origins to the Burma Independence Army, which rose up to fight against colonial ruler Britain in the 1940s. Their main ally and sponsor? The Imperial Japanese Army \u2013 whose surrender the Beijing parade is now celebrating.\nIn 1945, the BIA turned on the Japanese and joined the Allies.\nThe Myanmar military still commemorates that change of heart each year with its own parade of weaponry and pageantry in Naypyidaw, the isolated, sprawling capital it has built for itself.\nChinese social media users compare Trump\u2019s military parade to Beijing\u2019s show of force\nAs Chinese people watched the military parade live on state television, many social media users posted comparisons between today\u2019s show of force in Beijing and US President Donald Trump\u2019s parade over two months ago.\nIn June, Trump hosted the US military\u2019s largest parade in decades, marking 250 years of the army\u2019s founding. Dozens of tanks and fighting vehicles rolled through the streets of Washington, DC during the event, which coincided with Trump\u2019s 79th birthday.\nAt the time, he praised the army as the \u201cgreatest, fiercest and bravest fighting force,\u201d warning global enemies: \u201cIf you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you.\u201d\nToday, users of China\u2019s social media platforms, which are heavily censored, were adamant that their country\u2019s effort had come out on top.\nAnother Weibo user wrote that when compared to Trump\u2019s MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, \u201cwe have to admit that China\u2019s (parade) is just too handsome, and is embarrassing the United States.\u201d\nBoth countries are super powers, with sizable militaries boasting advanced technology and nuclear-capable weaponry.\nIndeed, the US Armed Forces is widely considered the world\u2019s most powerful in terms of technological superiority, global reach, and military budget, among other key metrics.\nBut the parades were markedly different \u2013 in purpose and messaging.\nParades like the one seen in Beijing today have historically been viewed by many as antithetical to US-style democracy. Trump had mooted holding such a parade during his first term, but it was scrapped at the time over concerns of cost and the optics of such a show of power.\nTrump\u2019s June parade leant towards pageantry, tracing the Army\u2019s 250-year history. It depicted different eras with vintage uniforms and equipment \u2013 going all the way back to the Revolutionary War.\nBy contrast, China\u2019s parade showed off its newest hardware, including laser weapons and undersea drones, rooting it firmly in the present \u2013 and depicting Xi Jinping\u2019s future vision for a new world order that can counter the West.\nBeijing claims full credit for China\u2019s WWII victory against Japan. Taiwan could not disagree more\nChina\u2019s resistance against Japan\u2019s full-scale invasion was a major front of World War II in Asia, where fighting only ended in September 1945 with Japan\u2019s surrender \u2013 months after Nazi Germany had been defeated.\nBut who led that resistance is hotly debated \u2013 and a battlefront between Beijing and Taipei over control of historical narratives and legitimacy.\nAfter Japan\u2019s invasion, Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists and Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) paused their years of fighting each other that had laid swathes of China to waste, and created a shaky alliance to fight the invaders.\nBut they resumed fighting after Japan\u2019s surrender, with Mao\u2019s Communists coming out on top in 1949, taking control of the Chinese mainland and forcing the KMT and the Republic of China leadership to flee to Taiwan, where they remain.\nMao then proclaimed the People\u2019s Republic of China that Xi now helms \u2013 and which has vowed to reunite with Taiwan one day, by force if necessary.\nAccording to a Council statement released before the parade, Mao\u2019s Communist party dedicated \u201c70% of efforts towards strengthening itself, 20% dealing with the Nationalist government, and 10% actually fighting Japan.\u201d\nTaiwan has banned all current and some former national security, military and diplomatic officials from attending the military parade, so as to not endorse Beijing\u2019s historical account.\nWorld leaders sit down for lunch reception\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and the world leaders attending today\u2019s events are sitting down for lunch following this morning\u2019s military parade.\nThe large banquet hall has round tables set with white tablecloths, wine glasses, name cards, flowers \u2013 and chopstick rests shaped like little pandas.\nThe defining image of the parade? Xi, Putin and Kim\u2019s show of unity\nFor many in the West, the defining image of Beijing\u2019s grand show of military might on Wednesday is not the parade of stealth fighter jets, hypersonic weapons or nuclear missiles \u2013 but the sight of Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un standing side by side in an unprecedented show of solidarity against the West.\nFrom atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace, Xi presided over a 70-minute parade to mark the end of World War II.\nOn his right was a strongman who\u2019s waging Europe\u2019s bloodiest conflict since 1945.\nAnd on his left, an Asian leader funneling troops and weapons to the battlefield.\nTo Xi, their strategic alignment with his vision for a new world order has earned them a prime seat at his big event celebrating the dawn of peace \u2013 seemingly outweighing their roles in launching and sustaining a war that has killed tens of thousands of people.\nAt various moments throughout the parade, the three autocrats \u2013 who had never appeared together in public before \u2013 are seen leaning toward one another, exchanging a few words or sharing a smile.\nThe deliberate display of unity is a pointed rebuke to US President Donald Trump\u2019s faltering attempt to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, and an open challenge to America\u2019s waning global leadership under Trump.\nThat message has seemingly been received by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social as the parade was underway: \u201cMay President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.\u201d\nQuick take: China\u2019s military display shows it has the might to back up Xi\u2019s vision of a new world order\nToday\u2019s parade was a startling display of weaponry designed to send a message that Xi Jinping\u2019s vision of a new world order with China at the apex will be backed up with high-tech arms that would seem, in many cases, to be ahead of Beijing\u2019s rivals.\nWhile much post-parade attention will be focused on new long-range nuclear-armed weapons \u2013 like the DF-61 intercontinental ballistic missile \u2013 what may be even more important in the long run are weapons like the new mobile truck- and ship-mounted laser air defense weapons.\nIf these are already deployed in numbers in the People\u2019s Liberation Army forces, as China has indicated in pre-parade press conferences, they could present real problems for any adversary\u2019s ability to blunt Chinese military movements around the region.\nThe huge volume of military hardware exhibited also shows that China has the industrial might to back up its words, and perhaps eventually enforce Xi\u2019s vision of the world.\nIt\u2019s the kind of industrial capacity the US put together to win World War II, the end of which Wednesday\u2019s parade was designed to commemorate.\nBut while US industry spelled the end of the Axis powers 80 years ago \u2013 a conflict China\u2019s communist forces fought alongside western powers \u2013 America now doesn\u2019t have the capacity to turn out weaponry in the numbers that China can.\n\u201cAnd also do it in larger volume in terms of sheer numbers of weapons deployed, so that is a real concern as well.\u201d\nStrongmen, weaponry and spectacle: These are the parade highlights\nChina\u2019s military parade has ended, though the day\u2019s events continue with a reception and extravagant gala.\nAlready, it\u2019s been an intentionally muscular show of force \u2013 attended by strongmen, several of whom are actively waging war \u2013 in a pointed message to the US-led world order.\nThis is the first time Xi, Putin and Kim have stood together \u2013 and it comes just days after Xi hosted a carefully choreographed summit of leaders from across Asia and the Middle East.\nThe events and attendance list send a clear message: China is ready to rebalance global power and has the military to back itself. Plus it has partners interested in the same vision, including the Russia-friendly European leaders of Serbia, Slovakia and Belarus.\nHere are the main takeaways:\n- The three strongmen: In one of the day\u2019s most striking moments, Chinese leader Xi Jinping led a select group of world leaders toward the Tiananmen rostrum \u2013 flanked by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was a clear message of unity between the three autocrats, who share a vision for an alternative world order to counter the longstanding dominance of the US and its Western allies.\n- Xi says China is \u201cunstoppable\u201d: Speaking before the parade, Xi emphasized Chinese nationalism and strength, telling his military that China\u2019s rise was \u201cunstoppable.\u201d He also warned that the world needed to \u201cchoose between peace and war\u201d and that China \u201cis never intimidated by any bullies.\u201d\n- The weapons: China\u2019s powerful military was on full display, with equipment shown including air-defense lasers for land and sea use, stealth fighter jets and nuclear-capable bombers, anti-ship missiles, its newest intercontinental ballistic missile, and two new extra-large undersea drones.\n- The spectacle: More than 50,000 spectators gathered in Beijing for the parade, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Videos showed people cheering, singing the national anthem, and waving small Chinese flags as tanks rolled past Tiananmen Square. Online users on China\u2019s heavily censored social media platforms described feeling a sense of patriotic pride.\nNorth Korea\u2019s Kim plays painstaking attention to optics at public events\nHaving travelled to North Korea 19 times since 2014, I\u2019ve seen how carefully Kim Jong Un curates his image. His appearances are never spontaneous. The applause is always rapturous. And behind much of that image-making is his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, who has helped shape him into a \u2018man of the people.\u2019\nThat obsession with optics is why his presence at Beijing\u2019s military parade will be of personal significance to Kim.\nFor him, it isn\u2019t just about watching China\u2019s tanks roll through Tiananmen Square. It\u2019s about being photographed alongside his counterparts Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Back in his capital Pyongyang, those images send a powerful message: your leader stands with some of the world\u2019s most powerful men.\nI also saw how Kim understood the power of optics when he travelled to Singapore for his first summit with US President Donald Trump in 2018.\nThe summit was enormously high stakes. But hours before he met Trump, Kim still found time to go for a nighttime walk through Singapore. Accompanied by a phalanx of bodyguards, his face lit up occasionally by the flashes of cameras, he was cheered on by thousands as he visited local landmarks and posed for smiling selfies with local political leaders.\nAll of it would have been a deliberate, calibrated choice.\nWhy Modi skipped Xi's military parade\nAs Chinese leader Xi Jinping paraded his vast arsenal on the streets of Beijing, conspicuously absent from the guest list was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who just days ago discussed the two leaders\u2019 growing friendship and bettering of ties.\nModi\u2019s decision to skip today\u2019s grand show is a calculated diplomatic statement. Attending the parade would be seen as a tacit endorsement of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, the very military engaged in a tense standoff with Indian troops in the Himalayas since a deadly clash in 2020.\nModi\u2019s stance was hardened by Beijing\u2019s role in India\u2019s brief, but deadly, conflict with Pakistan this year.\nChina has supplied 81% of Pakistan\u2019s imported weapons over the past five years, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute \u2013 some of which were used by Islamabad during its four-day deadly skirmish with New Delhi.\nBy abstaining from the parade, Modi sends a message: a return to normal relations is not possible while China simultaneously engages in border aggression and strategically props up India\u2019s primary adversary, Pakistan \u2013 a nation long hailed by Beijing as its \u201cironclad brother.\u201d\nFurthermore, Modi attending a parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, following Japan\u2019s formal surrender, would be viewed negatively in Tokyo, a critical economic and strategic partner for New Delhi.\nModi\u2019s absence makes a crucial distinction. While India can engage with China in multilateral forums, it will not separate this symbolic diplomacy from the realities of its national security concerns.\nRussia launches combined drone and missile assault on Ukraine as Xi\u2019s parade ends\nAs Xi hosted his military parade in Beijing, air raid sirens were going off across western Ukraine as the country\u2019s air defenses worked to repel a fresh Russian aerial assault, according to local authorities.\nResidents of the capital Kyiv were told to stay in shelters, with officials warning of a combined missile and drone attack.\n\u201cAir defense is operating in Kyiv! Stay in shelters until the all-clear is given!\u201d Timur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv\u2019s military administration, said on Telegram in a stark reminder of the conflict raging in Europe as Xi hosted two leaders waging that war.\nFor Context: While China claims neutrality in the war, the parade in Beijing delivered a striking image of Xi flanked by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose countries both have troops fighting Ukraine.\nChina has, however, supported Russia economically during the war and provided it with dual-use goods believed to have supported its war effort.\nThe devastation of Japan\u2019s wartime atrocities is still felt in Asia, 80 years later\nToday\u2019s massive military parade in Beijing marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, during which China was a crucial partner of the Allied powers.\nChina\u2019s fight against Japan\u2019s full-scale invasion became a major front of the war in Asia, ending only with Japan\u2019s formal surrender in 1945.\nTokyo\u2019s wartime atrocities during that period left deep fissures in the region and continue to sour relations with many of its neighbors to this day.\nInvasion of China: Many in Asia believe WWII broke out long before Nazi Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland in 1939 \u2014 as far back as 1931 when Imperial Japan invaded China, with all-out war between the two countries breaking out six years later.\nJapanese Imperial forces committed one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century in 1937: the Nanjing Massacre. Troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed men and civilians. They also raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, according to a post-war tribunal.\nChina puts the death toll at over 300,000.\nSexual slavery: South Korea has also had a fraught relationship with Japan for decades, strained by their painful colonial and wartime history.\nExperts estimate up to 200,000 girls and women from South Korea and other Asian countries were forced into Japanese sexual slavery during the war. The Japanese army used deception, coercion and force to bring what they called \u201ccomfort women\u201d into its brothels, according to a United Nations report.\n\u201cA large number of the women victims speak of violence used on family members who tried to prevent the abduction of their daughters and, in some cases, of being raped by soldiers in front of their parents before being forcibly taken off,\u201d the report said.\nThe topic remains a bitter point. In 2017, a memorial statue in a South Korean city became the center of a diplomatic spat, with Japan recalling two diplomats from Seoul.\nTaiwan closely watching China\u2019s military parade with fears it could one day be the target\nAmong those who watched China show off its newest military hardware, few paid closer attention than the government of Taiwan \u2014 the self-ruled, democratic island that Beijing views as its own territory and has vowed to seize by force, if necessary.\nUnder leader Xi Jinping, China has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan, sending fighter jets and warships around the island on an almost daily basis and looking to squeeze its presence on the world stage.\nTaipei will keep close tabs on the weaponry displayed, the foreign dignitaries in attendance, and the language used to describe Taiwan that might shed light on Beijing\u2019s sentiment, strategy and timeline for a potential invasion, analysts told CNN before the parade.\n\u201cTaiwan does not commemorate peace with guns,\u201d Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Wednesday, in a swipe at Beijing.\n\u201cWe believe that military hardware in our hands are for defense of our homeland, not for invasion or expansionism.\u201d\nIn the face of the China threat \u2013 and prodded by US President Donald Trump \u2013 Lai recently announced that the island will raise its defense spending to 5% of its GDP \u201cbefore 2030.\u201d\nBut on Taiwanese social media, few people appeared to be paying attention to the parade ahead of time, which analysts attribute to the fallout from recent domestic political rows and a general disconnect from China\u2019s World War II history."

BEWARE!\u201d he wrote.\nThe State Department designated Tren de Aragua, which originated in Venezuela, as a foreign terrorist organization and specially designated global terrorists in February.\nThe US has amassed a large number of military assets around the Caribbean and Latin America, drawing the ire of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.\nCNN has asked the Venezuelan government for comment.\nIn remarks before he departed on a trip to Mexico and Ecuador on Tuesday, Rubio said the \u201ccounter-drug mission\u201d would continue.\n\u201cWe are going to wage combat against drug cartels that are flooding American streets and killing Americans,\u201d Rubio said. He said the route from Venezuela was a \u201ccommon\u201d one.\nAsked by CNN about the legal authority for militarily targeting the cartels, Rubio said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer for the White House counsel, suffice it to say that all of those steps were taken in advance.\u201d\n\u201cThe president has designated these as terrorist organizations, which is what they are,\u201d he said.\nTrump on Tuesday afternoon said the US military \u201cjust over the last few minutes, literally shot out a boat, a drug carrying boat.\u201d\n\u201cIt just happened moments ago, and our great general, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \u2026 he gave us a little bit of a briefing,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more where that came from,\u201d he said, noting that \u201ca lot of drugs\u201d are \u201cpouring into\u201d the US from Venezuela.\nA senior defense official confirmed a \u201cprecision strike\u201d against an alleged drug vessel in the southern Caribbean, but did not offer further details about the operation.\nCNN previously reported that the US military was deploying more than 4,000 Marines and sailors to the waters around Latin America and the Caribbean as part of a ramped-up effort to combat drug cartels, according to two US defense officials \u2014 a show of force that has given the president a broad range of military options should he want to target drug cartels.\nThe Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach to combating Latin American drug cartels, designating many of them as foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists.\nTom Karako, a senior fellow of the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said while he didn\u2019t know of an instance of such action being taken against a drug cartel in the past, \u201con the other hand I\u2019m not sure that we would (know).\u201d\n\u201cIt would not surprise me in the slightest if there were a dozen instances that we don\u2019t talk about,\u201d he said.\nOn Friday, Rubio visited the headquarters of US Southern Command, which has responsibility for the deployed assets. The top US diplomat had previously suggested that military action against the cartels was a possibility.\nThe robust military presence in the region has drawn heated remarks from Maduro. The Trump administration has increased the bounty for the Venezuelan president to $50 million for drug trafficking.\n\u201cIt is an extravagant threat\u2026 absolutely criminal, bloody. They have wanted to move forward with what they call maximum pressure, and in the face of maximum military pressure, we have prepared maximum readiness,\u201d Maduro said Monday, adding that he will not \u201cbow to threats.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Kylie Atwood, Natasha Bertrand, Haley Britzky, Stefano Pozzebon, Ivonne Valdes Garay, Sol Amaya and Lauren Kent contributed to this report.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional details."

      "text": "What we're covering\n\u2022 Presiding over a military parade in Tiananmen Square to commemorate the end of World War II, leader Xi Jinping said China\u2019s rise is \u201cunstoppable.\u201d\n\u2022 Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un flanked Xi at the start as the trio stood together publicly for the first time \u2014 a defiant challenge to the US-led world order.\n\u2022 Commenting on the parade, President Donald Trump accused China, Russia and North Korea of conspiring against the US.\n\u2022 The parade unveiled hundreds of advanced weapons and featured over 10,000 troops, showcasing China\u2019s growing military power under Xi\u2019s push to modernize the world\u2019s largest standing army.\nNOW: Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin are meeting in Beijing\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are sitting down in Beijing for formal talks after attending China\u2019s military parade.\nRussian pool footage showed the two leaders seated in chairs side by side, speaking through interpreters.\nThe leaders have drawn closer together since Russia invaded Ukraine, with Kim sending North Korean soldiers to fight for Moscow on the front lines.\nXi has staged more military parades than any Chinese leader since Mao\nToday is the third time Chinese leader Xi Jinping has presided over a military parade on Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square \u2013 equaling the combined total of his three immediate predecessors.\nDeng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao each oversaw just one Tiananmen parade, traditionally held on the decennial anniversaries of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nXi continued that custom but also forged his own tradition, designating September 3 a day of national commemoration of Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II and marking the 70th anniversary of that defeat with a massive parade in 2015. Today\u2019s event marks the 80th anniversary of the defeat.\nThe only Chinese leader who staged more military parades was Mao Zedong, who oversaw 11 consecutive National Day spectacles between 1949 and 1959.\nXi has also overseen two parades outside the capital: one in Inner Mongolia in 2017 marking the PLA\u2019s 90th anniversary, and another in Qingdao in 2019 celebrating the PLA Navy\u2019s 70th birthday.\nNorth Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un set for talks with Russia\u2019s Putin in Beijing\nRussia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin is set to meet North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un for formal talks in Beijing, according to Russian state media.\n\u201cThe venue for the bilateral meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is now prepared,\u201d state news agency TASS reported.\nThe pair will meet at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in western Beijing where Putin has been staying during his visit.\nThe flags of both Russia and North Korea are on display at the guesthouse, TASS reported.\nThe psychology of military parades\nWe\u2019ve just gotten a glimpse of how overwhelming China\u2019s parades can be. Tanks rolling past in endless columns, jets roaring overhead, soldiers marching in perfect lockstep. It\u2019s military theater designed to project unstoppable power.\nI\u2019ve previously covered one of these massive events in Beijing, and several in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. The experience of being there is unforgettable. The ground literally rumbles beneath your feet as gigantic mobile missile launchers and tanks thunder across the vast, echoing Kim Il Sung Square. Goose-stepping soldiers snap their salutes toward the podium from where the supreme leader watches. Tens of thousands erupt in perfectly timed cheers, amplifying the raw power on display.\nWhen you\u2019re there in person, it\u2019s overwhelming. When you watch it on TV, it\u2019s ominous. The message is clear: if you threaten this nation\u2019s sovereignty, here\u2019s what awaits.\nAnd now, in Beijing, the symbolism is even greater. Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un are Xi Jinping\u2019s top guests. Their unity on this stage isn\u2019t just about reassuring and energizing their own people. It\u2019s aimed at unsettling the US-led world order that has defined global power for decades. The images themselves are a propaganda weapon. A defiant display of hard power aimed at the world, and especially at the United States.\nIf China's parade was intended to irk Trump, it worked perfectly\nPresident Donald Trump is mad that China is palling around with his strongman friends.\nTrump erupted on social media as footage aired of Chinese leader Xi Jinping hosting the authoritarian leaders of Russia and North Korea in today\u2019s parade, accusing the trio of conspiring against the US..\nThe Truth Social post means one thing: If China\u2019s two big gatherings of authoritarian leaders, US adversaries and erstwhile allies this week was intended as a personal affront to the US president, it worked perfectly.\nAnd it underscored the futility of his attempts to subject the true global hard men to his art-of-the-deal charms and his claims that his supposedly close relationships with such leaders can be decisive.\nTrump met with Putin in Alaska last month, but his gushing red-carpet welcome has so far failed to unlock any progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. The US president\u2019s first-term summits with Kim were similarly unsuccessful.\nChina\u2019s big celebration comes at a tense international moment as the new Asian superpower seeks to capitalize on Trump\u2019s erratic foreign policy, which has shattered America\u2019s reputation as a reliable great power.\nTrump\u2019s fury was ironic, since the last few days in China have seen the kind of performative spectacle that he loves.\nBut the gathering of anti-Western powers in Beijing is about more than trolling. It\u2019s an early warning that Trump\u2019s second-term policies based on tariff coercion, the bullying of lesser powers and \u201cAmerica First\u201d nationalism may be backfiring.\nJapan says it has followed \u201cthe path of a peaceful nation\u201d since WWII\nIn response to China\u2019s military parade commemorating its defeat in WWII, Japan has reaffirmed its postwar commitment to peace, even as tensions rise again with Beijing.\nTokyo\u2019s wartime atrocities in Asia have left deep fissures in the region and continue to sour relations with many of its neighbors to this day.\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at his regular press briefing Wednesday that Japan has \u201cconsistently followed the path of a peaceful nation\u201d based on its determination never to repeat the tragedy of war.\nAs the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons, Japan has long portrayed itself as \u201cpeace-loving.\u201d But rising tensions with China, now labeled Japan\u2019s \u201cgreatest security challenge,\u201d are reshaping that stance.\nTokyo is rapidly expanding its defense capabilities, boosting spending to 2% of its GDP by 2027, buying US Tomahawk missiles, developing next-generation fighter jets and converting helicopter carriers to launch F-35s.\nJapan\u2019s military buildup reflects growing alarm over China\u2019s assertiveness, especially repeated incursions into Japanese waters and airspace.\nXi\u2019s gala menu for Kim, Putin and other foreign leaders includes lamb, lobster and salmon\nAs Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his fellow foreign leaders dig in for lunch in Beijing, they\u2019ve got a sumptuous menu prepared.\nThe menu, shared by Hong Kong-based state-linked newspaper Wen Wei Po, includes a host of dishes drawing from both Chinese tradition and more international flavors:\n- Chicken soup with conch meat and lily bulbs\n- Roasted lamb chops\n- Stir-fried lobster with crab meat, roe and egg white\n- Clear scallop consomm\u00e9 with assorted mushrooms\n- Roasted salt-marinated salmon with creamy mustard sauce\nOther items include fried rice, pea cake and a mango mouse cake, and two selections of red and white wine \u2013 both originating from China\u2019s Hebei province.\nFor Xi and Putin, commemorating World War II is more about the present\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin watched their first military parade together on Moscow\u2019s Red Square in 2015, on the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.\nFor Russia \u2013 and before it, the Soviet Union \u2013 parades have long been a tradition on major WWII anniversaries. Victory Day parade has become an annual event in Red Square since 1995.\nChina has its own tradition of grand military parades \u2013 staged to celebrate the regime\u2019s founding every 10 years \u2013 but it did not hold any WWII parades until 2015, after Xi designated September 3 as a national commemoration day to mark Japan\u2019s defeat.\nJoseph Torigian, an expert on Chinese and Russian politics, explains why Xi and Putin place such weight on WWII commemorations:\nTorigian said the leaders see World War II as a blow to those forces, \u201cYet, in the words of Putin, the Nazis were defeated, but not eliminated. So it\u2019s imperative for Xi and Putin to use World War II to remind their citizens about the need to continue the struggle.\u201d\nFor Xi and Putin, Torigian said, the end of World War II was a moment when their nations won the respect they believe China and Russia always deserved.\nBeijing parade a rare outing for Myanmar\u2019s embattled junta chief\nToday\u2019s military parade in Beijing is a welcome outing for the US-sanctioned chief of Myanmar\u2019s junta, who led a coup that has plunged his country into a brutal, years-long civil war.\nSenior General Min Aung Hlaing hasn\u2019t travelled abroad much since 2021, when he ended a decade-long experiment with democracy in Myanmar, locked up politicians and imposed military rule.\nSwathes of Myanmar are in armed revolt against the junta; its economy is in tatters and young people are fleeing in droves. Last year prosecutors at the International Criminal Court said they were seeking a warrant for Min Aung Hlaing for crimes against humanity.\nFor Beijing, Myanmar is a vital source of rare earths, natural gas and jade \u2013 the green gemstone revered in China, where it has a cultural significance that dates back thousands of years and an industry worth billions of dollars a year.\nFor Myanmar\u2019s military, Chinese aircraft, artillery and drones provide a technological edge over the rebel groups and pro-democracy fighters mounting a shoestring resistance against its rule.\nBut the relationship is complicated \u2013 Beijing also maintains close ties with rebels along their shared border, some of whom have humiliated the junta on the battlefield in recent months.\nThere\u2019s some awkward history too.\nThe Myanmar military can trace its origins to the Burma Independence Army, which rose up to fight against colonial ruler Britain in the 1940s. Their main ally and sponsor? The Imperial Japanese Army \u2013 whose surrender the Beijing parade is now celebrating.\nIn 1945, the BIA turned on the Japanese and joined the Allies.\nThe Myanmar military still commemorates that change of heart each year with its own parade of weaponry and pageantry in Naypyidaw, the isolated, sprawling capital it has built for itself.\nChinese social media users compare Trump\u2019s military parade to Beijing\u2019s show of force\nAs Chinese people watched the military parade live on state television, many social media users posted comparisons between today\u2019s show of force in Beijing and US President Donald Trump\u2019s parade over two months ago.\nIn June, Trump hosted the US military\u2019s largest parade in decades, marking 250 years of the army\u2019s founding. Dozens of tanks and fighting vehicles rolled through the streets of Washington, DC during the event, which coincided with Trump\u2019s 79th birthday.\nAt the time, he praised the army as the \u201cgreatest, fiercest and bravest fighting force,\u201d warning global enemies: \u201cIf you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you.\u201d\nToday, users of China\u2019s social media platforms, which are heavily censored, were adamant that their country\u2019s effort had come out on top.\nAnother Weibo user wrote that when compared to Trump\u2019s MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, \u201cwe have to admit that China\u2019s (parade) is just too handsome, and is embarrassing the United States.\u201d\nBoth countries are super powers, with sizable militaries boasting advanced technology and nuclear-capable weaponry.\nIndeed, the US Armed Forces is widely considered the world\u2019s most powerful in terms of technological superiority, global reach, and military budget, among other key metrics.\nBut the parades were markedly different \u2013 in purpose and messaging.\nParades like the one seen in Beijing today have historically been viewed by many as antithetical to US-style democracy. Trump had mooted holding such a parade during his first term, but it was scrapped at the time over concerns of cost and the optics of such a show of power.\nTrump\u2019s June parade leant towards pageantry, tracing the Army\u2019s 250-year history. It depicted different eras with vintage uniforms and equipment \u2013 going all the way back to the Revolutionary War.\nBy contrast, China\u2019s parade showed off its newest hardware, including laser weapons and undersea drones, rooting it firmly in the present \u2013 and depicting Xi Jinping\u2019s future vision for a new world order that can counter the West.\nBeijing claims full credit for China\u2019s WWII victory against Japan. Taiwan could not disagree more\nChina\u2019s resistance against Japan\u2019s full-scale invasion was a major front of World War II in Asia, where fighting only ended in September 1945 with Japan\u2019s surrender \u2013 months after Nazi Germany had been defeated.\nBut who led that resistance is hotly debated \u2013 and a battlefront between Beijing and Taipei over control of historical narratives and legitimacy.\nAfter Japan\u2019s invasion, Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists and Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) paused their years of fighting each other that had laid swathes of China to waste, and created a shaky alliance to fight the invaders.\nBut they resumed fighting after Japan\u2019s surrender, with Mao\u2019s Communists coming out on top in 1949, taking control of the Chinese mainland and forcing the KMT and the Republic of China leadership to flee to Taiwan, where they remain.\nMao then proclaimed the People\u2019s Republic of China that Xi now helms \u2013 and which has vowed to reunite with Taiwan one day, by force if necessary.\nAccording to a Council statement released before the parade, Mao\u2019s Communist party dedicated \u201c70% of efforts towards strengthening itself, 20% dealing with the Nationalist government, and 10% actually fighting Japan.\u201d\nTaiwan has banned all current and some former national security, military and diplomatic officials from attending the military parade, so as to not endorse Beijing\u2019s historical account.\nWorld leaders sit down for lunch reception\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and the world leaders attending today\u2019s events are sitting down for lunch following this morning\u2019s military parade.\nThe large banquet hall has round tables set with white tablecloths, wine glasses, name cards, flowers \u2013 and chopstick rests shaped like little pandas.\nThe defining image of the parade? Xi, Putin and Kim\u2019s show of unity\nFor many in the West, the defining image of Beijing\u2019s grand show of military might on Wednesday is not the parade of stealth fighter jets, hypersonic weapons or nuclear missiles \u2013 but the sight of Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un standing side by side in an unprecedented show of solidarity against the West.\nFrom atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace, Xi presided over a 70-minute parade to mark the end of World War II.\nOn his right was a strongman who\u2019s waging Europe\u2019s bloodiest conflict since 1945.\nAnd on his left, an Asian leader funneling troops and weapons to the battlefield.\nTo Xi, their strategic alignment with his vision for a new world order has earned them a prime seat at his big event celebrating the dawn of peace \u2013 seemingly outweighing their roles in launching and sustaining a war that has killed tens of thousands of people.\nAt various moments throughout the parade, the three autocrats \u2013 who had never appeared together in public before \u2013 are seen leaning toward one another, exchanging a few words or sharing a smile.\nThe deliberate display of unity is a pointed rebuke to US President Donald Trump\u2019s faltering attempt to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, and an open challenge to America\u2019s waning global leadership under Trump.\nThat message has seemingly been received by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social as the parade was underway: \u201cMay President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.\u201d\nQuick take: China\u2019s military display shows it has the might to back up Xi\u2019s vision of a new world order\nToday\u2019s parade was a startling display of weaponry designed to send a message that Xi Jinping\u2019s vision of a new world order with China at the apex will be backed up with high-tech arms that would seem, in many cases, to be ahead of Beijing\u2019s rivals.\nWhile much post-parade attention will be focused on new long-range nuclear-armed weapons \u2013 like the DF-61 intercontinental ballistic missile \u2013 what may be even more important in the long run are weapons like the new mobile truck- and ship-mounted laser air defense weapons.\nIf these are already deployed in numbers in the People\u2019s Liberation Army forces, as China has indicated in pre-parade press conferences, they could present real problems for any adversary\u2019s ability to blunt Chinese military movements around the region.\nThe huge volume of military hardware exhibited also shows that China has the industrial might to back up its words, and perhaps eventually enforce Xi\u2019s vision of the world.\nIt\u2019s the kind of industrial capacity the US put together to win World War II, the end of which Wednesday\u2019s parade was designed to commemorate.\nBut while US industry spelled the end of the Axis powers 80 years ago \u2013 a conflict China\u2019s communist forces fought alongside western powers \u2013 America now doesn\u2019t have the capacity to turn out weaponry in the numbers that China can.\n\u201cAnd also do it in larger volume in terms of sheer numbers of weapons deployed, so that is a real concern as well.\u201d\nStrongmen, weaponry and spectacle: These are the parade highlights\nChina\u2019s military parade has ended, though the day\u2019s events continue with a reception and extravagant gala.\nAlready, it\u2019s been an intentionally muscular show of force \u2013 attended by strongmen, several of whom are actively waging war \u2013 in a pointed message to the US-led world order.\nThis is the first time Xi, Putin and Kim have stood together \u2013 and it comes just days after Xi hosted a carefully choreographed summit of leaders from across Asia and the Middle East.\nThe events and attendance list send a clear message: China is ready to rebalance global power and has the military to back itself. Plus it has partners interested in the same vision, including the Russia-friendly European leaders of Serbia, Slovakia and Belarus.\nHere are the main takeaways:\n- The three strongmen: In one of the day\u2019s most striking moments, Chinese leader Xi Jinping led a select group of world leaders toward the Tiananmen rostrum \u2013 flanked by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was a clear message of unity between the three autocrats, who share a vision for an alternative world order to counter the longstanding dominance of the US and its Western allies.\n- Xi says China is \u201cunstoppable\u201d: Speaking before the parade, Xi emphasized Chinese nationalism and strength, telling his military that China\u2019s rise was \u201cunstoppable.\u201d He also warned that the world needed to \u201cchoose between peace and war\u201d and that China \u201cis never intimidated by any bullies.\u201d\n- The weapons: China\u2019s powerful military was on full display, with equipment shown including air-defense lasers for land and sea use, stealth fighter jets and nuclear-capable bombers, anti-ship missiles, its newest intercontinental ballistic missile, and two new extra-large undersea drones.\n- The spectacle: More than 50,000 spectators gathered in Beijing for the parade, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Videos showed people cheering, singing the national anthem, and waving small Chinese flags as tanks rolled past Tiananmen Square. Online users on China\u2019s heavily censored social media platforms described feeling a sense of patriotic pride.\nNorth Korea\u2019s Kim plays painstaking attention to optics at public events\nHaving travelled to North Korea 19 times since 2014, I\u2019ve seen how carefully Kim Jong Un curates his image. His appearances are never spontaneous. The applause is always rapturous. And behind much of that image-making is his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, who has helped shape him into a \u2018man of the people.\u2019\nThat obsession with optics is why his presence at Beijing\u2019s military parade will be of personal significance to Kim.\nFor him, it isn\u2019t just about watching China\u2019s tanks roll through Tiananmen Square. It\u2019s about being photographed alongside his counterparts Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Back in his capital Pyongyang, those images send a powerful message: your leader stands with some of the world\u2019s most powerful men.\nI also saw how Kim understood the power of optics when he travelled to Singapore for his first summit with US President Donald Trump in 2018.\nThe summit was enormously high stakes. But hours before he met Trump, Kim still found time to go for a nighttime walk through Singapore. Accompanied by a phalanx of bodyguards, his face lit up occasionally by the flashes of cameras, he was cheered on by thousands as he visited local landmarks and posed for smiling selfies with local political leaders.\nAll of it would have been a deliberate, calibrated choice.\nWhy Modi skipped Xi's military parade\nAs Chinese leader Xi Jinping paraded his vast arsenal on the streets of Beijing, conspicuously absent from the guest list was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who just days ago discussed the two leaders\u2019 growing friendship and bettering of ties.\nModi\u2019s decision to skip today\u2019s grand show is a calculated diplomatic statement. Attending the parade would be seen as a tacit endorsement of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, the very military engaged in a tense standoff with Indian troops in the Himalayas since a deadly clash in 2020.\nModi\u2019s stance was hardened by Beijing\u2019s role in India\u2019s brief, but deadly, conflict with Pakistan this year.\nChina has supplied 81% of Pakistan\u2019s imported weapons over the past five years, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute \u2013 some of which were used by Islamabad during its four-day deadly skirmish with New Delhi.\nBy abstaining from the parade, Modi sends a message: a return to normal relations is not possible while China simultaneously engages in border aggression and strategically props up India\u2019s primary adversary, Pakistan \u2013 a nation long hailed by Beijing as its \u201cironclad brother.\u201d\nFurthermore, Modi attending a parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, following Japan\u2019s formal surrender, would be viewed negatively in Tokyo, a critical economic and strategic partner for New Delhi.\nModi\u2019s absence makes a crucial distinction. While India can engage with China in multilateral forums, it will not separate this symbolic diplomacy from the realities of its national security concerns.\nRussia launches combined drone and missile assault on Ukraine as Xi\u2019s parade ends\nAs Xi hosted his military parade in Beijing, air raid sirens were going off across western Ukraine as the country\u2019s air defenses worked to repel a fresh Russian aerial assault, according to local authorities.\nResidents of the capital Kyiv were told to stay in shelters, with officials warning of a combined missile and drone attack.\n\u201cAir defense is operating in Kyiv! Stay in shelters until the all-clear is given!\u201d Timur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv\u2019s military administration, said on Telegram in a stark reminder of the conflict raging in Europe as Xi hosted two leaders waging that war.\nFor Context: While China claims neutrality in the war, the parade in Beijing delivered a striking image of Xi flanked by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose countries both have troops fighting Ukraine.\nChina has, however, supported Russia economically during the war and provided it with dual-use goods believed to have supported its war effort.\nThe devastation of Japan\u2019s wartime atrocities is still felt in Asia, 80 years later\nToday\u2019s massive military parade in Beijing marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, during which China was a crucial partner of the Allied powers.\nChina\u2019s fight against Japan\u2019s full-scale invasion became a major front of the war in Asia, ending only with Japan\u2019s formal surrender in 1945.\nTokyo\u2019s wartime atrocities during that period left deep fissures in the region and continue to sour relations with many of its neighbors to this day.\nInvasion of China: Many in Asia believe WWII broke out long before Nazi Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland in 1939 \u2014 as far back as 1931 when Imperial Japan invaded China, with all-out war between the two countries breaking out six years later.\nJapanese Imperial forces committed one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century in 1937: the Nanjing Massacre. Troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed men and civilians. They also raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, according to a post-war tribunal.\nChina puts the death toll at over 300,000.\nSexual slavery: South Korea has also had a fraught relationship with Japan for decades, strained by their painful colonial and wartime history.\nExperts estimate up to 200,000 girls and women from South Korea and other Asian countries were forced into Japanese sexual slavery during the war. The Japanese army used deception, coercion and force to bring what they called \u201ccomfort women\u201d into its brothels, according to a United Nations report.\n\u201cA large number of the women victims speak of violence used on family members who tried to prevent the abduction of their daughters and, in some cases, of being raped by soldiers in front of their parents before being forcibly taken off,\u201d the report said.\nThe topic remains a bitter point. In 2017, a memorial statue in a South Korean city became the center of a diplomatic spat, with Japan recalling two diplomats from Seoul.\nTaiwan closely watching China\u2019s military parade with fears it could one day be the target\nAmong those who watched China show off its newest military hardware, few paid closer attention than the government of Taiwan \u2014 the self-ruled, democratic island that Beijing views as its own territory and has vowed to seize by force, if necessary.\nUnder leader Xi Jinping, China has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan, sending fighter jets and warships around the island on an almost daily basis and looking to squeeze its presence on the world stage.\nTaipei will keep close tabs on the weaponry displayed, the foreign dignitaries in attendance, and the language used to describe Taiwan that might shed light on Beijing\u2019s sentiment, strategy and timeline for a potential invasion, analysts told CNN before the parade.\n\u201cTaiwan does not commemorate peace with guns,\u201d Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Wednesday, in a swipe at Beijing.\n\u201cWe believe that military hardware in our hands are for defense of our homeland, not for invasion or expansionism.\u201d\nIn the face of the China threat \u2013 and prodded by US President Donald Trump \u2013 Lai recently announced that the island will raise its defense spending to 5% of its GDP \u201cbefore 2030.\u201d\nBut on Taiwanese social media, few people appeared to be paying attention to the parade ahead of time, which analysts attribute to the fallout from recent domestic political rows and a general disconnect from China\u2019s World War II history."
