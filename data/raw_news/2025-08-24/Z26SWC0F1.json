  "description": "Kevin O'Leary predicts U.S. mortgage rates will remain above 5% for the foreseeable future, calling pandemic-era low rates an \"aberration\" and urging homebuyers to adjust expectations amid a strong economy and AI-driven productivity growth.",
  "content": "\"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary says U.S. mortgage rates are unlikely to fall back below 5% anytime soon, arguing that America's strong economy and AI-fueled productivity growth mean the era of ultra-low borrowing costs is over.\n\nO'Leary Says Past Lower Rates Were An \u2018Aberration'\n\nIn a video posted on social media over the weekend, O'Leary dismissed hopes of a return to historically low mortgage rates.\n\n\"No, I don't think so,\" he said, referring to the mortgage rate dipping below 5% again.\"I think it\u2019s going to take a very, very, very long time for that to happen if ever. I think the days of free money are over.\"\n\nThe investor, worth $400 million according to Celebrity Net Worth, pointed to record-high stock indexes, fueled by advances in artificial intelligence, as evidence of a more productive economic phase.\n\n\"The economy is stronger than people think. The tariff issues will be gone by the end of the year and then we settle into a 10 to 15% range,\" he said, adding that 7% mortgage rates are not uncommon historically.\n\nSee Also: Short Seller Slams Jim Cramer Over Palantir, Accuses Him Of Hyping \u2018High-Multiple, Hype-Driven Narrative' After $200 Price Target Call\n\nO'Leary urged homebuyers to adjust expectations rather than overextend financially.\n\n\"All that it means, though, is you\u2019re going to buy a house 30% smaller. That\u2019s all,\" he said, warning against spending more than one-third of after-tax cash flow on a mortgage.\n\n\"Many people break that rule to their detriment. That really nice home eats them alive because there's a cost of maintaining a home you have to deal with.\"\n\nHe called past mortgage rates near 3% an anomaly, saying those who secured them were \"very fortunate.\"\n\n\"That aberration of three-and-a-half percent mortgages\u2026 was just a drop in the bucket. That's over.\"\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac's FMCC latest Primary Mortgage Market Survey, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.58%, the lowest level since October 2024. The 15-year fixed rate also declined to 5.69%.\n\nAnalysts say the drop offers some relief to buyers but is unlikely to reignite a frenzy in housing demand.\n\nInvestors anticipate a potential Federal Reserve rate cut as early as September, but analysts warn that significant reductions could fuel home price inflation.\n\nThe TurboHome-ResiClub Housing Sentiment Survey from July shows growing acceptance of mortgage rates of about 6%, reflecting a market adjusting to prolonged higher borrowing costs.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

      "text": "After three years of mortgage rates stuck above 6%, American homebuyers are showing signs of impatience with current borrowing costs as they anxiously await a shift in interest rates that will enable them to move forward with home purchases.\n- XLRE ETF is underperforming. Track live prices here.\nThe latest TurboHome-ResiClub Housing Sentiment Survey, conducted between July 2 and July 23, 2025, revealed that homeowners\u2019 attitudes toward interest rates and home prices are shifting noticeably.\nHomeowners Slowly Adjust To Higher Rates\nEarlier this year, the idea of locking in a 6% mortgage rate was a nonstarter for most buyers. But now, many are adjusting their expectations.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, just 41% of homeowners surveyed said they would accept a 6% mortgage rate on their next home purchase. That figure rose to 52% in the most recent survey, showing a growing willingness to engage the market, even if rates don't drop as much as hoped.\nThis doesn't mean buyers are enthusiastic about current borrowing costs. When asked about the highest mortgage rate they'd be willing to accept, 92% of respondents said they'd go for 4.5%, while 85% were open to 5%, and 66% to 5.5%.\nData points to a strong reservoir of pent-up demand, with buyers clearly more comfortable in the mid-5% range, suggesting that if rates dip closer to that level, the housing market could see a noticeable pickup in activity.\nAccording to the latest Mortgage Bankers Association report, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages only slightly eased from 6.84% to 6.77% in the week ending Aug. 1.\nExpectations For Home Price Gains Remain Dire\nBeyond rates, home price expectations reflect a more cautious mood.\nAccording to the survey, 55% of homeowners expect housing prices in their local market to either stay flat or decline over the next 12 months. That's a sharp increase from 35% in the first quarter 2025 and shows a softening in near-term optimism.\nYet only 16% of respondents believe prices will drop significantly\u2014by 4% or more\u2014suggesting the market isn't bracing for a crash, but rather a plateau.\nThis moderation in sentiment aligns with broader economic signals, indicating a cooling labor market and rising inflation in July.\nREM ETF Still Reflects Caution\nThe real estate sector itself hasn't yet priced in a rebound from potentially lower interest rates.\niShares Mortgage Real Estate ETF REM is still 50% below its pre-COVID highs and has traded mostly flat over the last three years.\nThe broader Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund XLRE is showing a similar three-year performance, sharply lagging gains made by tech-heavy sectors.\nBut if mortgage rates drop closer to 5%, a pickup in transaction volume could follow, potentially reviving housing stocks and REITs along the way.\nMarkets now assign a 93% chance of a 25-basis-point cut in September, according to CME FedWatch data. A back-to-back cut in October is currently priced at a 65% chance.\nRead now:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

      "text": "Mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest level in 10 months, a development that provides fresh ammunition to President Donald Trump to intensify calls for more aggressive interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\nLower Mortgage Rates Good For Homebuyers?\nAccording to the Primary Mortgage Market Survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac FMCC, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) now stands at 6.58%, down from 6.63% the previous week.\nThe 15-year FRM also retreated to 5.71%. These figures represent the lowest point for mortgage rates since October 2024, signaling a potential easing in borrowing costs that have kept the housing market constrained.\nThe decline offers some relief to prospective homebuyers, though it also fuels debate over the potential for reigniting housing price inflation.\nWhile the recent dip is notable, Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, provided broader context in a post on X. She pointed out that while the 30-year rate \u201chas fallen to 6.67%\u2026 it is almost unchanged year/year,\u201d highlighting the prolonged period of elevated rates that homeowners have faced.\nTrump To Increase Pressure Following Low Mortgage Rates\nThe downward trend in rates is closely tied to investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue its rate-cutting cycle, with a potential cut anticipated as early as September.\nIn a post on X, The Kobeissi Letter suggested the current environment is \u201cclearing a path for Trump to get rate cuts, even as inflation re-accelerates.\u201d\nKobeissi forecasted the potential impact if such calls for deeper cuts were realized, stating that if the Fed\u2019s target rate fell to around 1%, mortgage rates could drop to around 3%.\nIn that scenario, they predict \u201calready record high housing prices will explode,\u201d with a potential surge of 10%+ in the first year.

      "text": "What is Kevin O'Leary's Net Worth and Salary?\nKevin O'Leary is a Canadian businessman, author, politician, and television personality who has a net worth of $400 million. Kevin O'Leary, also known as \"Mr. Wonderful,\" earned his first fortune thanks to the software company SoftKey International. He became famous thanks to his appearances on reality television shows \"Dragons' Den\" and \"Shark Tank.\" As we detail later in this article, Kevin was one of a slew of celebrities who promoted the failed crypto exchange FTX. O'Leary had been a vocal opponent of crypto prior to his endorsement.\nEarly Life\nTerence Thomas Kevin O'Leary was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on July 9, 1954. His mother is of Lebanese descent, and his father is of Irish descent. Due to his paternal heritage, O'Leary also holds an Irish passport and citizenship.\nFollowing his parents' divorce and his father's death soon after, O'Leary's mother married economist Gorge Kanawaty. Due to his stepfather's work with the UN's International Labour Organization, O'Leary grew up moving around the globe, living in places including Cambodia, Tunisia, and Cyprus. His mother was a skilled investor and taught him much of what she knew, including the lesson always to save one-third of his money.\nOn the advice of his stepfather, O'Leary attended university instead of pursuing his initial aspirations to be a photographer. It was at school that he continued to develop his interest in business and investing. He graduated from the University of Waterloo with a bachelor's degree in 1977 and an MBA from the Ivey Business School at the University of Western Ontario in 1980.\nBusiness Career\nWhile studying for his MBA, O'Leary completed an internship at Nabisco and worked as an assistant brand manager for the company's cat food brand. He credits this experience as helping him develop skills that aided his later success. After leaving Nabisco, O'Leary embarked on a brief career as a television producer, co-founding the independent television production company Special Event Television (SET) with two former MBA classmates. O'Leary's share of the venture was eventually bought out by one of his partners for $25,000.\nAfter selling his share of SET, O'Leary started the software company SoftKey in 1986 in a Toronto basement with business partners John Freeman and Gary Babcock. After a major financial backer withdrew their $250,000 commitment, O'Leary used his $25,000 SET share money and a $10,000 investment loan from his mother to establish the company, which was a publisher and distributor of CD-ROM-based personal computer software for Windows and Macintosh computers.\nThe company developed a number of educational software products and, by 1993, had become a major consolidator in the educational software market after acquiring rival companies such as WordStar and Spinnaker Software. In 1995, after acquiring The Learning Company (TLC) for $606 million, Softkey adopted the TLC name. In 1999 TLC was bought by Mattel for $4.2 billion. Following a drop in sales and earnings for Mattel, O'Leary departed the company. Mattel executives and O'Leary were sued by Mattel shareholders for misleading investors about the health of TLC, but O'Leary disputed all charges, blaming the failure of the acquisition on the technology meltdown and the culture clash of management of the two companies.\nIn 2003, O'Leary became a co-investor and a director of the company Storage Now in 2003. They are a developer of climate-controlled storage facilities. After a string of development projects and acquisitions, Storage Now has become Canada's third-largest owner/operator of storage services. Storage Now had facilities located in eleven cities serving such major companies as Merck and Pfizer. The company was acquired for $110 million in March 2007.\nShark Tank And Other Ventures\nIn September 2011, O'Leary released his first book \"Cold Hard Truth: On Business, Money & Life.\" He released two follow-ups in 2012 and 2013. O'Leary's first television appearance came in 2006 as one of the five venture capitalists on the CBC show \"Dragons' Den.\" He developed an on-screen persona as a blunt, bullying investor, something encouraged by the show's producers. In 2009, O'Leary was invited to join \"Shark Tank,\" the American version of \"Dragons' Den.\" He remained on both shows until leaving \"Dragons' Den\" in 2014.\nThrough his appearances on the two shows, he gained the nickname \"Mr. Wonderful,\" both a tongue-in-cheek reference to his reputation for being mean but also that his blunt feedback is helpful to misguided entrepreneurs appearing on the show. He has a holding company, Something Wonderful, for managing his investments on the show. Some of his notable deals from \"Shark Tank\" include investments in Talbott Teas (later acquired by Jamba Juice) and GrooveBook (later acquired by Shutterfly). Kevin's fellow Sharks on the show include Daymond John, Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, Lori Greiner, and Robert Herjavec.\nOther television and media pursuits by O'Leary include co-hosting Discovery Channel's \"Discovery Project Earth\" in 2008; a segment on CBC News Network with journalist Amanda Lang, \"The Lang and O'Leary Exchange,\" in 2009; and producing and hosting his own reality show in 2012, \"Redemption Inc.\", in which he tried to help ex-convicts start their own businesses.\nFTX Endorsement\nKevin O'Leary was a vocal skeptic of cryptocurrency for much of its existence. His tune changed in August 2021 when he announced what was meant to be a \"long-term\" investment and spokesperson relationship.\" He took an equity stake and crypto as payment. As we all know now, FTX collapsed in November 2022. Fielding a wave of criticism for promoting the company that ultimately wiped billions of dollars from over a million investors, in December 2022, Kevin attempted some PR cleanup by admitting on a CNBC appearance that all of the $15 million in value he received for the partnership went to zero. Ironically, when he first announced his investment/partnership, Kevin claimed it was FTX's focus on compliance systems that finally changed his mind about crypto.\nPolitics\nOn January 18, 2017, O'Leary officially entered the Conservative leadership race following months of public speculation. During his campaign, he was often compared by the press to U.S. President Donald Trump: both were wealthy businessmen who gained wider recognition through reality television and ran on platforms that included lowering taxes and regulations. O'Leary has dismissed comparisons, noting, in particular, his difference from Trump on the subject of immigration, pointing out that he is descended from Irish and Lebanese immigrants and \"wouldn't exist if Canada had walls.\" He officially left the leadership race on April 26, 2017, noting that although he believed he could win the leadership election, it would be \"selfish\" of him to continue because a lack of support for him in Quebec meant it would be difficult for him to beat Justin Trudeau in 2019.\nPersonal Life\nKevin O'Leary has been married to his wife Linda since 1990, with a brief two-year separation in 2011. She serves as the VP of Marketing for O'Leary Wines. The couple has two children.\nHis primary residence is in Toronto, although he maintains a cottage in Muskoka, Ontario, as well as properties in Boston and Geneva, Switzerland. O'Leary obtained UAE citizenship in order to be able to partner with Emiratis on investments."

Won\u2019t have to wait too long!!!\u201d\nCitron Research responded directly the next day, questioning Cramer\u2019s pivot from market commentator to \u201cfull-blown stock promoter.\u201d\nThe firm argued that his post was irresponsible to his audience, stating, \u201cPalantir at these levels isn\u2019t an \u2018easy money\u2019 story; it\u2019s a high-multiple, hype-driven narrative. If it falls back to $150, will we suddenly see him \u2018ringing the register' and telling everyone it was obvious all along?\u201d\nAndrew Left Short Palantir Technologies\nThe X post reinforces a short position, Left announced on Wednesday on Fox Business. During the appearance, Left called Palantir \u201cbeyond overvalued,\u201d noting that its forward price-to-earnings ratio exceeded 200x.\nWhile stating he respects Palantir CEO Alex Karp, Left argued that investors cannot be told to ignore \u201cbig data\u201d like valuation metrics. \u201cIt\u2019s become so absurd,\u201d Left said, arguing the stock would not be reasonably priced until it fell to the \u201c$40, $50\u201d range.\nPrice Action\nPalantir stock has been a retail favorite, surging 145.21% year-to-date. The public disagreement between Left, known for his battle with retail traders over GameStop Corp. GME, and Cramer, a champion of individual investors, puts a spotlight on the stock\u2019s polarizing valuation.\nOn Thursday, PLTR was up 0.33% in premarket. It was the top gainer within the S&P 500 index in 2024, and it was up 494.74% over the past year.\nBenzinga's Edge Stock Rankings indicate that PLTR maintains a stronger price trend in the short, medium, and long terms. However, the stock scores poorly on value rankings. Additional performance details are available here.\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ, which track the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 index, respectively, were down in premarket on Thursday.The SPY was up 0.037% at $645.13, while the QQQ advanced 0.062% to $580.70, according to Benzinga Pro data.\nRead Next:\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto courtesy: katz / Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

  "argos_summary": "Kevin O'Leary warns that U.S. mortgage rates are unlikely to fall below 5% soon, citing a stronger economy and AI-driven productivity as reasons the era of ultra\u2011low borrowing is over. He advises buyers to expect smaller homes and cautions against overextending financially, noting that past 3% rates were an anomaly. Recent data shows mortgage rates hovering around 6\u20136.6%, with some buyers gradually accepting higher rates, but overall sentiment remains cautious, and analysts predict only modest Fed rate cuts in the near term. The article also references broader market trends, including a housing sentiment survey, Freddie Mac rate data, and the potential impact of future Fed cuts on home prices and investment activity.",
