      "feedback": "The draft shows strong depth in a three-regime, first-principles framing and solid tie‑ins to auto capex, semis/data-center spend, and policy/inflation dynamics, but it sag suggests too much micro-signal noise, inconsistent horizons, and under‑tight quantification; to reach world-class, convert this into a crisp, 4–6 sentence executive brief with a single, decision-ready house view and explicit triggers. Actionable edits: (1) replace the long nexus of micro anecdotes (Las Vegas pricing, Bethel 8–30g, Finland UBI) with a concise near‑term catalyst set and macro watch items, anchored to observable data; (2) present a single base case (Regime A) with two explicit alternate scenarios (Regime B and Regime C), each with definable triggers and probability weights, rather than a long stream of hedged statements; (3) tie every assertion to a source ID from the material (NL5YYTLF2, SGB2PAZGK, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, S15934PBQ, CDBMWIUTB, F8GF45MEU, U6HXAJR4J, GM, WTNT85IPR, EPJYXB7DX, 6OOEK8TUR, YVQU6QCY4, etc.), and ensure no claim floats without a cited source; (4) quantify the core dynamics: specify margins/ROIC paths, capex magnitudes (e.g., Ford/GM capex and EV spend, 50B+ EV capex through 2026, 10–12B GM capex through 2027), oil/energy bands and their implied discount-rate impact, and auto-loan-rate thresholds (e.g., 6.2–6.8% range) with explicit ranges rather than single numbers; (5) make the causal chain explicit: AI-driven productivity uplift → capital allocation in semis/data centers → margin and ROIC outcomes → asset prices, with policy and external-price shocks feeding inflation and BoP/FX channels; (6) compress the structure into one concise paragraph with a tight base-case sentence, two short scenario bullets, a short catalysts/watch-list, and explicit invalidation points (e.g., tariff pass-through failing within 1–2 weeks, or policy-driven BoP shift that materially alters discount rates); (7) ensure horizon discipline: 0–3 weeks for testable tariff/pricing signals, 0–3 months for capex/volume momentum, and 3–6 months for broader AI/real-estate optionality, all tied to sources; (8) harmonize the oil/energy regime discussion with the tech-capex narrative to avoid conflicting priors, and state how each regime shifts risk premia and cyclicals versus defensives; (9) in the GM/Cadillac section, keep the tone decision‑useful: state a clear house view on whether elevated capex/EV cadence supports mid‑single-digit earnings trajectory and margins, and mark explicit invalidation if near-term demand signals or tariff trajectories deviate; and (10) deliver the final piece as a compact, 4–6 sentence executive brief with a one-line watch-list and two explicit invalidation points, preserving only IDs that appear in SOURCE MATERIAL to satisfy citation discipline.",
