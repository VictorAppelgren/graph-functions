      "text": "Welcome to the TechRadar best VPN buying guide. Our aim is to give you the information to buy the best VPN for your needs as quickly as possible.\nWith that in mind, NordVPN (which is giving away $50 Amazon gift cards in the US, UK, Canada and Australia at the moment) is the best VPN for most people and we'll explain why just below. Surfshark (don't miss 7-day free trial) and ExpressVPN are also excellent. You're unlikely to go wrong with any of them. We know this because we regularly perform in-depth and rigorous VPN testing which you can also read about further down.\nWe've been writing about and reviewing VPNs at TechRadar for over 11 years and we know more about them than any other website. When it comes to guiding our readers to the right choice, we think that's worth something.\n5 best VPNs: a quick overview\nEXCLUSIVE DEAL: 1. NordVPN \u2013 The best VPN overall\nThe best VPN just got better because we have an exclusive deal on NordVPN just for TechRadar readers:\n- 76% off 2-year NordVPN plans\n- Get 4 extra months FREE!\n- And an Amazon Gift Card up to $50 in value.\nChoose the Pro, Complete, Ultimate or Prime plans to get the deal. It's available to people in US, UK, Canada and Australia and comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Read about why NordVPN is the best VPN in our full debrief below \u25bc.\n2. Surfshark \u2013 get the 7-day free trial\nSurfshark beats NordVPN on price and speed \u2013 although both services are so blisteringly fast you won\u2019t notice the difference. It's excellent for unblocking global streaming services and has servers in more countries than NordVPN, which may be beneficial if you travel a lot. The trade-off is a busier app interface, and a slightly lower score than NordVPN in our malware, phishing, and ad-blocking tests. ExpressVPN (below) edges Surfshark on security, too. Its two-year Starter plan (paid upfront) is $1.99 per month plus tax. Best of all, there's currently a 7-day free trial of Surfshark available for the very first time. That's something that none of the other top VPN services offer. Read our full Surfshark debrief below \u25bc\n3. ExpressVPN \u2013 The best VPN for beginners\nExpressVPN is the easiest VPN to use on our list. You\u2019re connected in one click and the interface is very user-friendly, making it a great option for anyone less tech-savvy. It\u2019s also the most secure VPN we\u2019ve tested, with many extra features to keep you safe online, and it\u2019s seriously fast too \u2013 though not quite to the level of Surfshark and NordVPN. The main drawback is the price. At $4.99 per month on the two-year plan (again, all needs to be paid upfront), it\u2019s more than double Surfshark\u2019s monthly cost, and well above average. So for most people, we\u2019d recommend one of the two options above. As with the others, there\u2019s a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can give it a go without committing. Read our full ExpressVPN debrief below \u25bc\n4. Proton VPN \u2013 The best VPN for privacy\nIf you want extreme privacy above all else, choose Proton. Based in Switzerland, this extremely capable VPN offers good speeds and has servers in 117 countries around the world \u2013 including across Africa and Asia where other providers tend to struggle \u2013 which makes it excellent for streaming and torrenting too. It's privacy that's the big differentiator for Proton VPN, though. Proton VPN offers tools for protecting your browsing and connecting data. That\u2019s not to say that the options above have weak privacy credentials: they don\u2019t. But Proton gives that extra layer of protection. Proton VPN's recent improvements in app user-interfaces also make it a good choice for beginners, with explainer pop-ups for most functions. Read our full Proton VPN debrief below \u25bc\n5. PrivadoVPN Free \u2013 The best free VPN\nWe don\u2019t advise using a free VPN for most purposes but, if you do need one \u2013 as a one-off, say, or to do something that doesn\u2019t require privacy credentials \u2013 Privado\u2019s free version is the best of the free services we\u2019ve tested. Its speed rivals the services above. But of course, you don\u2019t get the same features or guarantees of privacy and security. There are also just 13 server locations and a 10 GB data cap, so it isn\u2019t suitable for heavy streaming or downloading lots of files. Our tests revealed it\u2019s also nowhere near as good at unblocking, so if you\u2019re trying to unblock something from another territory it\u2019s worth paying for NordVPN or Surfshark. Of the free options, though, it\u2019s the best. (You'll find the 'Try free plan' button in light grey below Privado's paid options.) Read our full PrivadoVPN debrief below \u25bc\nThe best VPN services 2025\n1. NordVPN\nFor streaming, security and everyday use, this is the best VPN you can buy.\nNordVPN is more than enough for most people: it's fast, cheap, and relatively easy to use \u2013 but with plenty of tools for even the biggest technophiles. There are some niche cases where you may be better off with another service (ExpressVPN is a better choice for countries with extreme censorship, for example).\nBut if you just want a VPN for streaming your favorite shows, gaming, and keeping safe on public WiFi, NordVPN is the best VPN for the job. Plus, we have an exclusive NordVPN deal underway. Get a 2-year subscription and, in addition to the 76% saving, and the Amazon gift card worth up to $50, you'll get an extra 4 free months of service. You've got until 31 July, 2025, to claim it, now that NordVPN has extended the deal.\nRead more about NordVPN \u25bc\nEase of Use \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nGetting started with NordVPN is easy thanks to the onboarding wizard that springs to life when you fire up the Mac or Windows version for the very first time. It'll walk you through Nord's features and make sure you understand what's going on.\nSo, why just four stars for ease of use? NordVPN has users well covered for apps but the browser extension isn't great. Also, Surfshark and ExpressVPN are just a little bit more obvious when it comes to basic use.\nWe are delighted, however, to see the recent addition of a NordVPN Linux app complete with a GUI.\nRead more details on NordVPN apps.\nStreaming \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWe rate NordVPN as the best streaming VPN that money can buy. It boasts over 7600 ultra-fast servers covering over 120 countries, all of which are optimised for streaming.\nIt unblocks all major streaming services \u2013 including international Netflix libraries, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney Plus \u2013 as well as a host of other regional streamers such as BBC iPlayer, 9Now, SBS On Demand, ITVX, Sling, FuboTV, Max, and many, many more. In fact, it's not often we find a streaming service that NordVPN can't get around the back of.\nSpeeds are easily enough to handle 4K HDR video. The only streaming-related caveat is that NordVPN isn't the best torrenting VPN. That accolade goes to ExpressVPN. That's because there are only a handful of NordVPN servers optimised for P2P use.\nRead more details on NordVPN unblocking.\nPrivacy & Security \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nNordVPN comes with cutting-edge security and privacy features, including its recently launched NordWhisper protocol for VPN obfuscation and censorship avoidance. It also runs both OpenVPN and its own proprietary WireGuard-based Nordlynx protocol with super-secure, recently audited, zero-trust AES-256 encryption, meaning you can be confident that nobody has access to your data but you.\nIf someone ever did manage to pilfer it, it would take them millions of years to crack the encryption, particularly as NordVPN's quantum-safe encryption is theoretically future-proofed. In fact, NordVPN has just extended its post-quantum encryption (PQE) across all of its apps, making the service theoretically invulnerable to so-called \"store now, decrypt later (SNDL)\" attacks, which await the availability of quantum computers and their increased code-cracking powers.\nThe company has a strict no-logs policy \u2013 which was successfully audited for the fifth time earlier this year \u2013 meaning that not even NordVPN itself has a record of your browsing data.\nIt's also legally headquartered in Panama \u2013 a country with strong data protection laws \u2013 meaning that it would be very difficult for any third parties to have any successful claims to NordVPN's customer base, even if it did log anything significant.\nFinally, there's also a kill switch for further assurances and DNS leak protection to prevent your ISP from getting even a whiff of what you're up to.\nRead more details on NordVPN privacy and security.\nSpeed & Performance \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nThe NordLynx proprietary protocol performed brilliantly in our speed tests. It clocked consistent speeds upwards of 950 Mbps in servers to the UK as well as when heading across the Atlantic to the US. The latter of these is where many other VPNs struggle to perform. That's worth considering given that plenty of people will be looking to access streaming services and other content across The Pond.\nOpenVPN speeds are much slower, as with all VPNs. It's only Surfshark that stands out in this area but, again, it shouldn't put you off unless you insist on using OpenVPN over NordLynx.\nNordVPN has a great deal of pride in its server network and has recently looked to change the conversation from server count to server quality. From our results of putting its network performance to the test, NordVPN has a good point.\nIn fact, NordVPN has just undergone a third-party audit of its performance speed and connection time, as well as its functionality and security. West Coast Labs determined that every was satisfactory.\nRead more details on NordVPN speed and performance.\nNordVPN price plan comparison\nThere are four NordVPN price plans to choose from if you're based in the US \u2013 three if you live anywhere else in the world. NordVPN Basic is just the VPN software. It's available everywhere. If you want to add some anti-virus functionality (Nord Threat Protection Pro), then go for NordVPN Plus. For a password manager (NordPass), cloud storage (NordLocker), and up to $5000 of cyber insurance on top, go for NordVPN Ultimate.\nNordVPN Ultimate also recently extended its ID theft recovery insurance to UK Ultimate users up to a value of \u00a35000 \u2013 useful in light of the recent UK big retail cyber attacks.\nNordVPN has a slightly different pricing structure in the US with its NordProtect program which includes up to $1M in identity theft insurance and $100K in cyber extortion insurance. There's confidence for you!\nSo, instead of the Plus and Ultimate tiers, the USA gets Basic, Plus, Complete, and Prime.\nFor our money, the Basic plan is the best value, but if you really need the extras on offer in Plus, Complete, Ultimate, or Prime, then go for it. Each plan type comes with a different possible contract length: 1-month, 1-year, or 2-year.\nThe best value, by a long shot, is the 2-year plan and, right now, NordVPN is giving away Amazon gift cards to new subscribers on these plans, in the States and Canada, up to the value of $50 \u2013 and also now in the UK and Australia too. Sign up through our links and you'll get 4 extra months of VPN service free too. The Plus plan comes with $20, the Complete plan with $40, and Prime or Ultimate gets you the full $50.\nDo remember that you need to pay the full amount upfront, though, and that, along with Surfshark, NordVPN adds local tax at checkout. That means that its quoted monthly prices might well be a little higher depending on where you live. In some parts of the United States, that could mean another 8% or so added on. For those in the UK, it's a full 20% extra.\nThe other major warning \u2013 and this is true for most VPNs \u2013 do not let your subscription auto-renew or you'll end up with a pretty sharp price hike. Currently, NordVPN auto-renews for $139, for just one year, for those on the Basic plan.\nThat's around 50% more than you might have paid for the original 2-year plan you subscribed to. In fact, a US law firm is taking NordVPN to Court over what it has deemed to be \"deceptive\" auto-renewal pricing. Our advice is to make sure you switch off auto-renew in your subscription settings as soon as you sign up and install.\nWhichever subscription you choose, though, you get 30 days to change your mind and ask for a full refund.\nBelow is a comparison table of the NordVPN plans and what each one offers. Just be careful not to fall for a fake NordVPN ad scam when you come to buy.\nAlso, it's well worth noting that NordVPN appears to be running a pricing test at the moment (see picture above). The prices below are the standard ones but we've seen the two-year plans go down to $2.79 per month, $3.76 per month, $4.62 per month and $6.33 per month on the Basic, Plus, Complete and Prime plans for some lucky users in the States.\nThat's some huge savings on the standard prices, and we suggested snapping up the deal if you see it.\nTry using your browser's incognito mode, or even a VPN, if you have one, and going back and forth to the NordVPN site to see if you can get discounted offers. They all still come with our exclusive Amazon Gift Card and 4 extra months deal if you go through the links on this page.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | |||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n1-month plan price | $12.99/month | $13.99/month | $14.99/month | \u00a312.89/month | $17.99/month |\n1-year plan price | $4.99/month | $5.99/month | $6.99/month | \u00a36.69/month | $8.99/month |\n2-year plan price | $3.39/month | $4.39/month | $5.39/month | \u00a35.39/month | $7.39/month |\nVPN | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nThreat protection | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nPassword manager | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\n1TB cloud storage | \u274c | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nCyber Insurance | \u274c | \u274c | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 (NordProtect) |\nSurfshark \u2013 the best low cost VPN\n2. Surfshark\nThe cheapest and fastest VPN \u2013 an excellent choice on a budget.\nFor a straight-up VPN with all the basics of privacy, security, and streaming included, Surfshark really is excellent value. It costs less than NordVPN, it's half the price of ExpressVPN and there are no limits to the number of devices you can install it on with just a single, simple account.\nSurfshark has some brilliant web browsing anonymity features that every casual user will love. You should be rightly tempted to choose it over NordVPN even though it loses out to the top dog on usability, connection consistency, and security but only by a shade.\nREAD MORE ABOUT SURFSHARK \u25bc\nEase of Use \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nSurfshark has an app for pretty much every platform and is one of the few to have a proper GUI for Linux. It's got you covered for routers, browsers, Fire Stick, and Apple TV, as well as all the regulars. It's also recently added macOS to the list of platforms which support its Surfshark Bypasser feature. That means that you can now choose to route some traffic through your normal connection, while still using the VPN for other functions, on a Mac computer.\nIt's pretty straightforward to use \u2013 we love the QR code log-in for your secondary devices \u2013 but, with the location guide and quick access feature buttons all competing for screen real estate, there's a fair bit going on at a glance. That makes the interface a little tougher on the eye than NordVPN or ExpressVPN but not so much that it should put off any beginners.\nIf you do need help, the built-in AI chatbot will spit out some solid how-to type articles and there aren't many layers between you and a real, live customer support operative if that doesn't do the trick.\nRead more details on Surshark's ease of use.\nStreaming \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nSurfshark is great for streaming. It had no problems unblocking all the major streaming services in all kinds of geos, and, with 140 server locations across 100 countries, you won't be short of options of places to pretend to be.\nAll of Surfshark's servers are optimized for streaming and torrenting but we did have a couple of issues of jitter which meant that video streams dropped out once or twice in our tests. Obviously, just reconnect the VPN and press play again should that occur.\nA problem, you say? Well, maybe but balance that against Surfshark's unlimited connections policy. That's right, you can use Surfshark on as many devices as you like simultaneously, all from just one account!\nRead more details on Surfshark's unblocking and content.\nPrivacy & Security \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nSurfshark's AES-256 encryption tech puts it at the top table for security. Its CleanWeb browser add-on blocks ads from appearing on websites and denies cookie requests without you having to bother which we really, really like.\nIt also has a rather wonderful Alternative ID tool that effectively creates a fake persona \u2013 complete with name, email address, and phone number \u2013 to autofill into online forms when you'd rather not give your real details. Emails, calls, and messages get forwarded to your real versions until you pull the plug.\nSurfshark's Camouflage Mode obfuscation technology helps you bypass VPN blocks by hiding the fact you're using a VPN. Its No Borders feature, meanwhile, detects if your current network is facing any restrictions and automatically recommends servers that perform best under those restrictions. There's no post-quantum protection future-proofing, like NordVPN or ExpressVPN, to prevent possible \"store now, decrypt later\" attacks but you can't expect everything for a bargain price.\nLastly, it's worth noting that Surfshark's headquarters, for legal purposes, is the Netherlands which is a member of the 14 eyes intelligence sharing community along with the United States, UK, Canada and Australia among others. If privacy is your top reason for using a VPN, for this reason alone, Surfshark is probably not the best choice.\nRead more details on Surshark privacy and security.\nSpeed & Performance \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nYou want speed? You got speed. Surfshark is the No.1 fastest VPN, maxing out beyond 950 Mbps for local and trans-Atlantic servers. As we said above, though, it can be prone to jitter which might make you suffer during gaming and streaming. If you're looking at pure up/download speeds, though, then Surfshark is hard to beat.\nRead more details on Surfshark's speed and performance.\nSurfshark price plan comparison\nThe Surfshark Starter plan is where to go to keep costs at rock bottom. That's your VPN use, including ad and cookie pop-up blockers, plus the Alternate ID personal detail mask and masked email generator. The price has just gone down to its bargain basement $1.99 per month on the two-year plan which makes it a really good moment to buy. It doesn't ever get cheaper.\nBut it's very hard to turn down the upgrade to the Surfshark One plan given that it's only about $9 more over 2 years and only about a $3 difference on the 12-month plan. That adds a built-in anti-virus, webcam protection, and real-time credit card, ID, and email breach alerts.\nSurfshark's premium plan, One+ is a tougher sell. It's around double the price of Starter at $3.99. The most noticeable benefit of One+ is that you get the Incogni data removal tool into the mix. It's a decent service but it's probably only worth opting for Surfshark One+ if you were considering Icogni anyway.\nAs with NordVPN, do beware that Surfshark's prices may not be quite as good as they look, depending on where you're based. The company adds local tax at checkout unlike the other VPN providers below whose prices already include tax.\nAlso, like most VPNs, auto-renewal prices are steep. There's a handy article here on how to make sure your Surfshark subscription doesn't auto-renew without having to set yourself a calendar reminder.\nIf you'd like to get a taste of one of Surfshark's features for nothing, then you can try out its recently announced free private DNS service. It's a way of routing your internet traffic without allowing your ISP to block certain domains, log traffic or create targeted adverts based on your browsing.\nBetter still, Surfshark has introduced a 7-day free trial for the first time. It's the only one of the best VPNs to offer that which makes taking it for a spin something of a no-brainer. Our bet: you'll probably stick with it.\nHere's a comparison table of the Surfshark plans and what each one offers and a direct comparison of NordVPN vs Surfshark:\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | |||\n|---|---|---|---|\n1-month plan price | $15.45/month | $17.95/month | $20.65/month |\n1-year plan price | $3.19/month | $3.39/month | $6.09/month |\n2-year plan price | $1.99/month | $2.29/month | $3.99/month |\nVPN | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nAd blocker | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nCookie pop-up blocker | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nAlternative ID | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nID breach alerts | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nAntivirus | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nIncogni data removal | \u274c | \u274c | \u2705 |\nExpressVPN \u2013 the best VPN for usability\n3. ExpressVPN\nJust choose your location and switch it on; it's pricey but ExpressVPN makes VPNs easy.\nPrice is the main reason ExpressVPN sits behind NordVPN and Surfshark in our best VPN list. It costs a lot of money and there are no cheaper price plans to fit lower budgets. Regarding what you get, it's more in line with the upper tiers of the two above, NordVPN Ultimate and Surfshark One+, but the lack of flexibility is frustrating.\nWhat's more, ExpressVPN had a few gaps in streaming during our most recent testing, and, while it's the best VPN for beginners, neither of the others above are so complicated that they should put you off spending half as much on your VPN.\nIt's also worth noting that ExpressVPN reduced its workforce back in March, 2025, in big enough numbers that it felt it needed to release a statement. So far, it's doesn't seem to have affected the product, although getting dragged into a class action over auto-renew fees will not be helping the situation back at HQ.\nREAD MORE ABOUT EXPRESSVPN \u25bc\nEase of Use \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nThe ExpressVPN user interface is just great. There's nothing glitzy about the look of its apps but there's a simplicity that belies a lot of very clever design. It's red when it's off, it's green when it's on and the first two sections that draw your eyes are the massive Connect button and the server location option which opens up a list of countries either recommended or by continent. The casual user needs to go no further and get everything they need right there.\nThere are apps for every platform. ExpressVPN even has its own Aircove router if you want the VPN working at the heart of your home network, and, in fact a recent software update for Aircove and Aircove Go has improved their core infrastructure to make the user experience more stable and easier.\nLikewise, ExpressVPN has also just updated its iOS and Android apps. They now include built-in speed testing tools, access to more VPN protocols and a Smart Location connection for an automated link to the best server at any given moment. Only those on Linux should feel irked with just command line access to work with.\nThe other place your money goes is the 24/7 live chat in the help section of the app. Waiting times to get connected to human support can be as little as 30 seconds. We were never left hanging for more than 5 minutes in our tests. There is just no better VPN for usability.\nRead more details on ExpressVPN's ease of use.\nStreaming \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWith over 148 locations in 105 countries, ExpressVPN will have you covered for most of your streaming needs \u2013 certainly when accessing streaming services across the States, UK, and Europe. It has the most Oceania server locations in our top three although we did run into some trouble with Netflix and 10Play in Australia. Use the 24/7 live chat for advice on the best server choice if you find similar issues and that should sort it.\nIn fact, ExpressVPN has just expanded its server network so that it now has a server location in every single one of the 50 US states. That's great news in terms of both speed for folks in the US and for ensuring you get the correct online state laws when you connect to your nearest server.\nExpressVPN is a bit short across the Middle East with just two countries to choose from. Not great for BeIn sports content in that part of the world, or watching Ronaldo in the Saudi Pro League or any other local content from Saudi, UAE, and the like.\nIn terms of stream stability, ExpressVPN does pretty well, although it does feel like NordVPN has the edge here with fewer instances of dropping out when viewing trans-Atlantic content \u2013 another reason why you might want to make a different choice if streaming is your no.1 VPN use case.\nRead more details on ExpressVPN unblocking and content.\nPrivacy & Security \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nYou might pay more \u2013 pretty much double the cost of all the other VPNs here \u2013 but you do get a lot of security features with ExpressVPN. You just need to decide whether you need them or not.\nThese include the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, parental controls to stop access to adult sites, a tracker and malware threat manager, and one of the best built-in ad blockers on this list. The only disappointment was the fake website warning system which let far too many slip the net to really trust in our tests.\nFortunately, ExpressVPN gets the basics of security bang on. It uses top-end, rotating key, AES-256 encryption as well as a 1000-dimension secure ML-KEM key designed to future-proof your data for the quantum computing age too. We're also big fans of the randomly allocating Shuffle IP system which ensures there's no correlation between your identity and your online activity.\nCombine that with the provider's TrustedServer technology, its commitment to post-quantum encryption, and the fact that data requests are made very difficult thanks to its British Virgin Islands choice of jurisdiction, and it's full marks here.\nIn fact, ExpressVPN has just passed its 23rd successful security audit (courtesy of KPMG) confirming that it never stores user data as indicated in its privacy policy.\nThe company is so confident in its security that it offers a $1 million bug bounty should you ever get inside an ExpressVPN server. Sadly, you've just missed a shot at that jackpot after a bug was spotted in the Windows app in April and patched in July.\nGood luck finding the next one first!\nRead more details on ExpressVPN privacy and security.\nSpeed & Performance \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nLightway is the name of ExpressVPN's bespoke VPN protocol. It's not quite as fast as NordLynx or WireGuard, as used by Surfshark, but it's easily enough for the needs of the casual user. It's optimized for mobile use \u2013 certainly no bad thing in the modern age \u2013 and outperforms OpenVPN by a long shot.\nIt's slightly disappointing that Lightway's 898 Mbps speeds dropped to more like 396 Mbps once we connected to the US from the UK but it's worth remembering that you only need a fraction of that to stream 4K video.\nLightway's performance may be about to change, though, with the roll out of Lightway Turbo and DCO on Windows apps and with the recently launched Lightway 2.0. and its more streamlined coding in Rust. Lightway in Rust is already on Aircove devices and is expected to land elsewhere over 2025.\nAs it turns out, Opera VPN has been so impressed by ExpressVPN's protocol technology that it's decided to switch to Lightway itself \u2013 quite the vote of confidence when it comes from a third party, and a bit of a slight to NordVPN and NordLynx too.\nRead more details on ExpressVPN speed and performance.\nExpressVPN price plan\nThere's only one price plan for ExpressVPN which makes things a lot more straightforward. Granted, it's an expensive price plan but that's because you get the kind of optional extras found in NordVPN and Surfshark's top-tier packages included as standard.\nOn the plus side, ExpressVPN's auto-renewal prices (subject to change) are a lot better than Surfshark and NordVPN. All the same, here's an article on how to cancel your ExpressVPN subscription before your subscription ends, which we recommend doing. That will stop the auto-renewal and still allow you to use ExpressVPN right up until the last day of your agreement.\nRight now, all ExpressVPN plans come with the bonus of a free eSIM through its Holiday.com platform. You'll get 1, 3 or 5 GB of free data to use anywhere in the world, depending on how long you sign up for.\nHere's a table showing ExpressVPN's main features and a direct comparison of ExpressVPN vs NordVPN:\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | |||\n|---|---|---|---|\nPrice | $12.95/month | $6.67/month | $4.99/month |\nVPN | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nAd blocker | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nTracker blocker | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nPassword manager | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nID Alerts | US-only | US-only | US-only |\n$1M ID theft insurance | US-only | US-only | US-only |\nData Removal | US-only | US-only | US-only |\nProton VPN \u2013 the best VPN for privacy\n4. Proton VPN\nProton VPN is the best choice if privacy features and widespread server access are top of your wishlist.\nProton VPN is one of many privacy-centric products built by Proton. It's a CERN-scientist-founded, Swiss company committed to the \"societal problem of surveillance capitalism\" rather than a Silicon Valley venture capitalism get-rich-quick machine.\nSo long as Proton sticks to that mission, that makes it quite an ethical VPN choice and one that works pretty much as well as all the others on this best VPN list. It was certainly a good sign to see a strong reaction from Proton's CEO on the possible change in Swiss data protection laws \u2013 and very interesting to see that Proton has joined a US lawsuit against Apple over anti-competitive practices.\nWhat's more, Proton recently saw a 1400% increase in hourly signups after the introduction of age verification laws in the UK, as Brits looked for a way to secure their data when presented with the new measures\nThe big reason to choose Proton VPN is if privacy is of paramount importance to you \u2013 or if you need a good range of server locations across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia \u2013 but don't let that fool you.\nWith over 12,000 servers across 117 countries, Proton VPN is every bit the right tool for those looking for some serious streaming and torrenting fun too.\nREAD MORE ABOUT PROTON VPN \u25bc\nEase of Use \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nProton VPN is easy to use, thanks to a recent UI refresh of its Windows, iOS and Android apps. It may not have a Chrome browser extension that's as reliable as others but it does boast a Linux application with a decent graphic interface and those new-look mobile and desktop apps. We really like the added home screen widgets for mobile and upgrades to the Profile feature which allowed us to switch protocol and server by use cases like streaming, anti-censorship and gaming, really quickly.\nProton also recently partnered with privacy-focused browser Vivaldi. So, if you really do want a VPN browser extension for Proton, you might consider Vivaldi instead of Chrome. Best of all, though, is that Proton is finally bringing the split tunneling feature to macOS and Linux users this summer along with a host of other upgrades that we saw when the other major platform apps were upgraded in April. That's a terrific result.\nProton VPN also loses marks in this category for customer service. Like the others in this list, the live chat isn't 24/7. It's only available during Swiss work hours \u2013 not great if you're based on Pacific Time in the States or live in Australia or New Zealand. That said, we're assured that this is an area where Proton VPN is soon to improve.\nRead more details on Proton VPN's apps and ease of use.\nStreaming \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nProton VPN is a good choice for both streaming and torrenting. It's one of the few VPNs where port forwarding is still available and there are dedicated, P2P-optimized servers, which, again, is great for torrenting.\nProton VPN also has more country locations than any other VPN. If you're looking to connect to a regional service in Africa (22 countries) or the Middle East (14 countries) then it should be high on your list. It also has more Asia locations covered than any other provider on this page.\nThe trade-off is that there aren't so many server locations in the US or across Europe, but most countries are covered in those places, even if there's not much at the city/region level. More to the point, Proton VPN had no trouble with any local or international streaming services we tried. We managed to access the desired Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney Plus libraries with every server we tried.\nRead more details on Proton VPN's unblocking and content.\nPrivacy & Security \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nProton VPN has been built from the ground up as a privacy-first product and plenty of features show that off. Proton's Secure Core sends your VPN traffic through an extra secure server in a privacy-friendly location (Switzerland, Iceland, or Sweden) and then onto the endpoint VPN server. Similar to NordVPN's Double VPN system, that means your traffic is secured twice, reducing the risk of your IP getting exposed if the endpoint server is hacked.\nAs well as OpenVPN and WireGuard, Proton uses its own Stealth protocol which hides the fact you're even using a VPN which could be very important if you're in a region where VPN use is banned.\nEqually, you can opt to use the Alternate Routing feature instead which sends your IP-relocated internet traffic through a third-party server, like Amazon's, for example. That helps to get around sites that don't play nice with VPNs.\nYou can also connect directly to the Tor network through some Proton VPN servers which might be handy if you're in a line of work that requires extra anonymity.\nProton VPN Plus also brings the use of the NetShield Ad-blocker feature. It did a decent job with ads and trackers, although the malware-blocking end wasn't particularly comprehensive. Get a decent AV for that instead.\nLastly, and by no means least, Proton has a tight no-logging policy and an excellent system of handling customer data which has just received a 'SOC2 Type II\" audit to prove its worth.\nRead more details on Proton VPN privacy and security.\nSpeed & Performance \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nProton VPN plays second fiddle when compared to the speeds on offer with other VPNs on this list. The VPN Accelerator feature does a good job of automatically finding the routes with better speeds when connecting to long-distance servers but if a fast VPN is your no.1 feature, then Proton won't be the best choice.\nDo bear in mind, though, that for streaming purposes, Proton VPN still has plenty under the hood. Indeed, its latency and jitter scores were nice and low, which arguably, is more important for some use cases.\nRead more details on Proton VPN speed and performance.\nProton VPN price plan comparison\nThe free version of Proton VPN is one of the best free VPNs available, and worth your consideration, depending on your needs. The paid version of Proton VPN is the one to go for if you want to use the streaming functionality, though. Upgrade to Proton Unlimited if you want all of that plus access to the full suite of Proton web products including Proton Mail, Proton Drive, Proton Pass and more.\nSoon you'll be able to do that direct from Apple's App Store and still get the best online price after a US ruling found against \"the Apple Tax\".\nProton VPN's two-year plan is the best value. You only need to subscribe to the full Proton Unlimited package for a year if you want the best monthly price for all the Proton products, though. Here's a comparison table of the Proton VPN plans so you can see for yourself:\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | |||\n|---|---|---|---|\n1-month price | Free | $9.99/month | $12.99/month |\n12-month price | Free | $3.99/month | $9.99/month |\n24-month price | Free | $3.59/month | $9.99/month |\nVPN | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nStreaming | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nServer choice | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nMalware protection | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nTracker blocking | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nAd-blocker | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nTor over VPN | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nProton Mail, Calendar, Drive, and Pass | Free features only | Free features only | \u2705 |\nPrivadoVPN Free \u2013 Best Free VPN\n5. PrivadoVPN Free\nFor occasional use, including some worldwide TV show streaming, it's hard to beat the best free VPN.\nIt's not all about money. The best things in life are free. Well, the fifth-best thing, at least. A paid VPN is a better choice for anyone serious about using a VPN regularly but, if you\u2019re looking to dip your toes in the VPN waters and see whether you like the feel, PrivadoVPN Free is a good choice.\nWhy? Because you get to play with most of the important features that a paid VPN offers and that\u2019s not the case for many of the other best free VPN services. You can do things like unblocking access to trans-Atlantic Netflix libraries (in a limited way) and you also get the peace of mind that PrivadoVPN won\u2019t sell your data to make up for the fact you\u2019re using its service for free.\nREAD MORE ABOUT PRIVADOVPN FREE \u25bc\nEase of Use \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nPrivadoVPN Free doesn't come with as much customization and functionality as a paid VPN, the upside of which is that it\u2019s certainly easy to use. There are apps for Windows, MacOS, Android, Android TV, iOS, Apple TV, and FireTV and there\u2019s a Chrome extension too. If you're struggling to install them, then the online knowledge base is good but live chat access is limited.\nBy default, the layout is a lot simpler than many, and the user interface is uncluttered. There\u2019s the location manager, where you choose which server you wish to connect to; the recently revamped and stabilized kill switch; the connect button; and a handy reminder of how much data you have left; and that\u2019s pretty much it. Hit \u2018Click to Connect\u2019 and away you go!\nRead more details on PrivadoVPN Free apps and ease of use.\nStreaming \u2605\u2605\u2605\nStreaming is where PrivadoVPN Free stands head and shoulders above other free VPNs. There\u2019s not really much streaming on offer elsewhere, without paying, because of very low data allowances and limited, or often no, server choice.\nPrivdoVPN Free allows you to access its 13 servers across 10 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Netherlands, UK, and the USA. You also get 10 GB of data to use each month. That\u2019s about 10, hour-long, TV shows at standard definition. If you need more than that, then maybe it\u2019s time to pay for your VPN.\nThe split tunneling feature is handy for minimizing your data use but, if you do bust the limit of your allowance, then PrivadoVPN Free will let you connect still but only on the 1 Mbps server. With no servers in Australia, New Zealand or Italy, there are a lot of great free streaming services that you miss out on here but it did still manage to unblock Disney Plus, BBC iPlayer, Channel 4, and ITV in our recent tests.\nRead more details on PrivadoVPN's Free streaming performance.\nPrivacy & Security \u2605\u2605\u2605\nPrivadoVPN Free brings access to its VPN but not much else in the way of privacy and security features, aside from the kill switch. It uses AES-256 encryption and offers OpenVPN, WireGuard protocols as well as the usually slower IKEv2, if you need.\nWe love that PrivadoVPN doesn\u2019t sell its free users\u2019 data to fund the gratis access. We love its strict no-logs policy. We love that it\u2019s based in Switzerland too, where data protection laws are super tight. But the fact that PrivadoVPN has never had a third-party audit to check all this? Not so much. But then audits cost money and the users aren\u2019t paying, so, you know.\nRead more details on PrivadoVPN's Free privacy and security.\nSpeed & Performance \u2605\u2605\u2605\nYou might expect a free VPN to be significantly slower than the paid options on this page but that\u2019s not the case with PrivadoVPN Free. It maxed out our 950 Mbps VPN speed testing rig using WireGuard, like many of the others on this page. As we say, you get a lot more than the other best free VPNs with PrivadoVPN Free. What you don\u2019t get is the unlimited ability to use it.\nRead more details on PrivadoVPN's speed and performance.\nPrivadoVPN price plan comparison\nPrivadoVPN would much rather you sign up for its paid VPN service. The free version is not easy to find on its website. It's usually a greyed-out button buried pretty deep on the sign-up page.\nIn many ways, it has a point, though. PrivadoVPN Free is a good service but if you need a VPN on the regular, you're better off reaching into your pocket. We even have a special $10 discount through our link which is how you get the prices below.\nHere's a feature comparison table of the PrivadoVPN Free and paid plans and you can see if you agree:\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | ||\n|---|---|---|\n1-month plan price | Free | $10.99/month |\n12-month plan price | Free | $1.33/month |\n24-month plan price | Free | $1.11/month |\nVPN | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nServer countries | 10 | 48 |\nData Limit | 10GB/30 days | Unlimited |\nSimultaneous connections | 1 | 10 |\nAd blocker | \u274c | \u2705 |\nParental controls | \u274c | \u2705 |\nOther VPNs we've tested\nWe rate the five VPNs above as the best available right now but there are plenty of other VPNs that we've reviewed.

VPNs ensure privacy and security online by masking your IP address \u2013 and therefore your location \u2013 and encrypting data that's transmitted to and from your device, making it impossible for third parties to intercept or track your activities.\nWithout a VPN, your ISP can monitor and track which websites you access and the data you're transferring. Governments and legal bodies can then request to access that information or hackers may expose it. Install a VPN and no one can see your data or what you're doing online.\nWhat does a VPN do?\nA VPN provides security, privacy (the most popular reason for using a VPN, in fact), and a degree of anonymity (not total anonymity, despite what many people think) to you and your devices when using the internet. VPNs can also unblock your favorite streaming services from abroad, help you get cheaper prices when shopping online, assist with torrenting and online gaming connections, and they're a terrific tool for protecting yourself on public Wi-Fi.\nMost good VPNs have ad-blockers and will deal with those annoying cookie-consent pop-ups too. You can read more about the benefits of using a VPN.\nHow to buy a VPN\nThere are two important things to note when buying a VPN: you have to pay the full amount up-front BUT most come with 30-day money-back guarantees, so you can change your mind for a full refund.\nSo, for example, if NordVPN's Basic plan is advertised at $3.39 per month for 24 months, that means you'll need to pay the whole $81.36 when you sign up. (You may also have tax to pay on that, region depending.) You'll then receive 24 months of service before you get the choice to pay again for another term.\nAs for the money-back guarantee, we've tried it, and it works. Most of our top picks also have 24-hour live customer support which makes it all the easier.\nFinally, once you've bought and installed your chosen VPN, we'd advise deactivating any auto-renew settings. Some auto-renew prices can be eye-watering compared to the initial fee. Take a look at more things to consider when buying a VPN.\nWhat to look for in a VPN\nNordVPN, Surfshark, ExpressVPN and Proton VPN are probably going to fit most people's needs but if you've some specific use cases or have some key criteria, then you should probably consider the following. You can read more about each in our article on choosing a VPN.\nPrice\nAnything under $2.50/\u00a32.50 per month is a cheap VPN; up to $4.50/\u00a34.50 per month is about average; and anything over $5/\u00a35 per month is on the expensive side. There are also free VPNs but they usually come with limited usage and features. They're not great for streaming, torrenting or gaming. The longer the term of your agreement, the cheaper the price. Anything less than a year tends not to be great value.\nApps\nMost VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android but do check. Linux users and anyone looking to install a VPN on an Amazon Fire Stick, a router, or a smart TV should definitely read the small print on this one.\nSecurity & Privacy\nIs it meeting industry standards for encryption? Is there a kill switch? Does it have a no-logs policy, and has it been audited? Look out for nifty security features that ensure no patterns to link you and your given IPs, and for anything that will help prevent encrypted data from getting cracked either now or in the future. And check the company's track record to make sure they have kept customers safe in the past.\nServer locations\nDoes the VPN you're interested in have physical servers in the countries you need or just virtual VPN servers? That might be one where you live or one in a country with a geo-blocked streaming service that you're trying to access.\nPerformance\nCan you trust VPN speed tests? Well, you can certainly trust performance. Consistency and quality are critical. You'll suffer poor performance if the VPN you've chosen has issues with latency or jitter. The end result will be packet loss during data transfer which you'll experience as buffering or a stream dropping when using video-based applications eg: video calls, online gaming, and watching Netflix.\nExtras\nMany providers include more than just the VPN. There are ad-blockers, password managers, antivirus software, and even cyber insurance bundled in sometimes. Are these things you'd like too, or are you better off keeping costs down? Picking the right price plan is usually the key here.\nCustomer support\nMost of our top VPN providers have excellent, 24/7 live customer support. They're there to help you with any issues from solving your streaming problems to arranging the refund from your money-back guarantee. If the service you're looking at doesn't offer something similar, then you might want to think again.\nAre VPN's legal?\nYes. VPNs are legal to use in most places around the world. The exceptions are North Korea, Belarus, Oman, Iraq, and Turkmenistan, where VPNs are illegal, and China, Russia, Turkey, UAE, India, Iran, Egypt, and Uganda where you can only use a state-approved VPN, the actual privacy of which would be questionable at best.\nBut, as far as everyone in the US, UK, Europe, and most other places go, yes, VPNs are perfectly legal to use. Go get one!\nDo you need a VPN?\nGood question. No. Not everyone needs a VPN. But they can be useful depending on who you are, what you do, and how you like to use the internet and online services.\nIf you want to access streaming services from all around the world \u2013 BBC iPlayer, ITV, SBS On Demand, 9Now, RAIPlay, Max, ESPN+, Sling, Hulu, etc \u2013 then a VPN is the best way to do that. Equally, a VPN is perfect for making sure you can access the right libraries for Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney Plus.\nPrimarily, though, VPNs are about online security. For the everyday user, that might mean staying safe while using public Wi-Fi, or minimizing the cookies and trackers that harvest your details as you browse the web and other connected services. That should lead to less email spam and less chances of cybercrime attack too because you're far less likely to have your details stolen in any online database hacks.\nSome VPNs can offer a more ad-free online experience too while others have built-in tools to help steer you away from fraudulent websites and malware.\nThe only group for whom we'd say VPNs are a must are journalists, political activists, and people around the world who need to protect themselves from oppressive governments, access foreign media, and learn and report on global truths. If you want to make sure you're able to evade censorship and propaganda while maintaining anonymity and privacy online, a VPN is non-negotiable.\nFor any of those reasons above, or if you just want peace of mind that you're more in control of your personal data in a rapidly progressing digital age, then a VPN is probably a good idea. Give one a go and try it for yourself. Most have a 30-day money-back guarantee if you decide a VPN is not for you.\nAre free VPNs as good as paid VPNs?\nA free VPN might be enough if you don't intend to use it much or don't need to use it for streaming, gaming or torrenting. There are some bad free ones out there but if you choose one of the best free VPNs then you won't come unstuck.\nA free VPN is usually limited in the amount of data it offers each month or by the number of server locations it offers. That's why streaming on a free VPN isn't usually going to work. You can certainly expect far fewer features on a free VPN too.\nTake a look at our free vs paid VPNs page for a better idea, and do check out these free VPN trials of paid services. All those listed will offer a refund within 30 days if you're not happy with the service.\nHow we test VPN services\nWe've been testing VPNs for longer than almost any other online publication and feel very confident about our methodology.\nEach VPN is tested twice per year on TechRadar. That way, we can be sure that this guide is as up-to-date as possible whenever you happen to be reading it. Every recommended VPN on this page has been fully reviewed.\nWe test all the VPNs on the following categories:\nFeature analysis: Technical details, network size, server locations, and supported protocols.\nPrivacy and security: Privacy policies, encryption methods, independent security audits, data leak protections.\nPerformance testing: Connection speeds, connection times, video streaming performance, web browsing performance, gaming performance, torrenting performance.\nUnblocking abilities: VPNs are tested against over 20 of the most common streaming services including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, and many more.\nSupport and reliability: Customer support facilities, such as live chat and email support and help sections on provider websites.\nYou can read more about our full VPN testing methodology here.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example: 1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service). 2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad. We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nNordVPN remains the top contender in the VPN space, offering excellent security features, an extensive server network, and reliable performance. Even beyond the strong performance of the core VPN, NordVPN\u2019s extra features are noteworthy all on their own.\nPros\n- +\nExtensive server network with coverage in 144 locations across 111 countries\n- +\nStrong security features, including Threat Protection Pro\n- +\nFast speeds\n- +\nRegular updates and improvements across apps and extensions\nCons\n- -\nThreat Protection Pro now requires an upgraded plan\n- -\nBrowser extension less impressive than others\n- -\nHigher renewal costs after the initial subscription period\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nNordVPN is currently the best VPN we\u2019ve tested. It has long been known for its features, high speeds, and extensive server network, and our tests not only proved that this is true, but arguably truer than ever.\nDespite this, NordVPN isn't perfect. It\u2019s not the best cheap VPN we test, its apps could use some TLC on platforms like Fire Stick, and, although it's not NordVPN's main purpose, its antivirus and antimalware tools could be improved significantly. So, let\u2019s dive into why all that still doesn\u2019t stop NordVPN from ranking as the top VPN provider currently available.\nFeatures\nWhile NordVPN\u2019s vast feature array isn\u2019t instantly apparent when loading it up on any device, it doesn't mean the tools aren't there. Clicking through the left-hand panel on computers, both MacOS and Windows, or tapping along the bottom of your Android or iOS phone reveals the breadth of offerings NordVPN provides.\nFor a start, if you want to add an extra layer of protection to your standard VPN connection, NordVPN offers both Double VPN, which acts as NordVPN\u2019s multihop solution, and Onion over VPN, which combines your NordVPN connection with the Tor network for improved online anonymity.\nOnion over VPN proved to be the more temperamental of the two in testing. Still, given its immense security, this is understandable. We found the Netherlands-based entry point was a more effective way to access the network without massively impacting speeds than the alternative in Switzerland. In fact, the route was only slightly slower than a standard NordVPN connection.\nDouble VPN was more reliable with only minimal load time delays, regardless of which server we connected to.\nOne of NordVPN\u2019s biggest selling points outside the core VPN product is Threat Protection Pro, an additional security suite available on Plus plans and above. Included in this is malicious and phishing domain blocking, ad and tracker blocking, malware and vulnerability scanning, scam and fraud alerts, and URL cleaning \u2013 and there are even more tools listed in the fine print.\nIn daily use, we found it to be reasonably effective, though it did, somewhat humerously, try and block certain assets and links from loading on competitor VPN sites.\nOutside of this, while it thankfully didn\u2019t find any risks on our test machines, it did a good job of tracking any files we downloaded and scanning links to ensure safety, though the tool as a whole did seem to use a tad more processing capacity on our Windows 11 desktop machine than we\u2019d have liked.\nMeshnet is the final unique tool in NordVPN\u2019s arsenal. By creating a secure local area network (LAN), Meshnet enables easy, secure access to other devices added to the network from wherever you are. This means you can retrieve and share files or images, and even play games with friends, with up to 60 devices able to connect at a time.\nIn testing, Meshnet proved simple to set up, especially since it can be downloaded for free on any compatible device, and we were able to use it quickly to transfer images and files between our Windows testing desktop, an iPad, and an Android phone.\nFeatures score: 10/10\nServer network\nNordVPN\u2019s server network is broad, but not massively superior to its closest competition. It currently boasts over 7,000 servers across 118 countries, which puts it comfortably among the best VPNs in terms of country coverage.\nDespite this, it falls short in certain regions like the Middle East and Africa. Here, Proton VPN's coverage is more extensive despite spanning fewer countries overall \u2013 even if only by one at the time of writing.\nAs with most VPNs, NordVPN doesn\u2019t have servers in high-censorship regions such as Russia and China, so we can\u2019t dock points for that.\nServer network score: 9/10\nApps\nNordVPN\u2019s apps are among the best available, though that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re flawless. In terms of coverage, NordVPN is available across everything from major platforms such as Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android to smaller platforms such as Fire TV Stick and Apple TV.\nYou can also access NordVPN directly in your browser with extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.\nAcross the majority of platforms, NordVPN's apps are well-designed and intuitive. We found that layout to be simple enough for any beginner to understand without feeling overwhelmed, although they're not as straightforward as ExpressVPN's apps.\nPlus, as we will detail later, many apps share similar user experiences, allowing for easy transitions between devices.\nThe biggest letdown for NordVPN is its Linux client. NordVPN for Linux still lacks a GUI, meaning you\u2019re left using command lines to use the VPN rather than experiencing the much simpler systems accessible elsewhere.\nAlongside this, depending on your generation of Fire Stick, you may encounter a more rudimentary version of NordVPN, which, while entirely functional and effective, looks nowhere near as clean.\nNordVPN\u2019s latest improvement to its apps came to its Firefox extension. We were pleased to see the update give the extension a complete overhaul, adding extra features, such as location spoofing, to its functionality, as well as improving overall security.\nDespite this, you\u2019ll likely find, as we did, that the experience is still a tad slower than you\u2019d get across mobile or desktop devices.\nApps score: 8/10\nEase of use\nAs mentioned, NordVPN\u2019s apps are simple enough, though they're not our top choice for VPN newbies.\nOn our Windows 11 test desktop, we found the setup process impressively simple, thanks to NordVPN\u2019s setup wizard. This was, usefully, replicated on macOS.\nOnce loaded, NordVPN greets you with several key features: the VPN, Threat Protection, and Meshnet. Navigating to other features is done via the icons on the left-hand side of the app, and we had no difficulty checking out the kill switch, split tunneling, and VPN protocols.\nMobile presents a similarly balanced experience; setup is as simple as downloading NordVPN from the respective app store and either signing in or signing up. The majority of what you see will directly correlate with the experience on a computer, be that Windows or Mac, with a quick connect option and the option to scroll through specific servers.\nHowever, Meshnet is presented in a much smaller fashion among the server list, and Threat Protection doesn\u2019t appear at all on your initial menu.\nNordVPN's browser extension experience mirrored the experience we had when testing its mobile apps: quick to connect, reactive, and clutter-free.\nPlus, despite missing out on some features, as we\u2019ve already mentioned, it works similarly enough to mobile that we had no issues switching between platforms without feeling confused.\nUsing NordVPN on your TV, be that via the TV app store or a Fire Stick, Apple TV, or similar device, presents a slightly different layout. Opting for something simpler and closer to that of ExpressVPN, which is a definite win, and we found it to be impressively effective and easy to navigate, even when finding features outside the basic VPN.\nWe encountered some stumbling blocks when using the older Fire Stick interface, which, perhaps understandably, presents a more convoluted interface than its more modern counterparts.\nEase of use score: 8/10\nSpeed and performance\nNordVPN has long been among the fastest VPNs we\u2019ve tested, and our latest round proved no different. Using NordLynx, NordVPN\u2019s WireGuard-based VPN protocol, we comfortably achieved speeds over 950 Mbps throughout our testing.\nThese speeds remained consistent even when we connected to servers across Europe and the US on our test machine. It\u2019s a big win, especially since other top providers struggled to maintain their speed over longer distances.\nOpenVPN speeds were much slower across the board during our most recent round of testing. NordVPN achieved just 173 Mbps, which is less than half the OpenVPN speeds that Surfshark recorded. Still, NordVPN's performance puts it at the upper end of the 100-200 Mbps range we saw from most providers.\nWe test from two different virtual PCs, one in the UK and one in the US. We\u2019re expecting big things out of NordVPN, as both of these servers have a 1 Gbs connection. You can find out more in our VPN testing methodology.\nWhat\u2019s more, during our afternoon OpenVPN testing session, we saw some interesting increases in latency, which at times crept up to around 100 ms.\nThis isn't hugely impactful to day-to-day browsing, but you'll want to stick with the WireGuard protocol for any online gaming or torrenting. Still, despite the latency concerns, we had no issue with buffering or low-quality pictures when conducting our streaming tests.\nOur main concerns stemmed from NordVPN's consistency. While the provider frequently tops our speed rankings, we saw drops in performance between 200-500 Mbps when trialing the service in the morning.\nDuring the evening, we noticed jitter spikes, which, while mostly harmless, may cause concern to gamers. If that's the case, ExpressVPN may be a better option, as we recorded much less jitter when testing its performance.\nSpeed and performance score: 9/10\nUnblocking\nPutting NordVPN to the test in unblocking scenarios was, as ever, successful. We used NordVPN with Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video, 10Play, 9Now, iPlayer, and Channel 4. We even stretched our testing across Netflix libraries in the US, Japan, Canada, the UK, and Australia.\nNordVPN performed flawlessly across all our tests. Regardless of the device we used, including our Windows 11 test desktop, Fire Stick, iOS, and Android, we had no issues accessing any streaming services, nor did we encounter any sudden VPN detection warnings. Full marks there, then.\nPlus, as we\u2019ve already mentioned, NordVPN\u2019s speeds were superb. This meant we never encountered slow loading times or buffering, even when connecting across different countries.\nUnfortunately, NordVPN only offers a handful of server locations that are P2P-friendly. Plus, while speeds are impressive, the lack of port forwarding capability means you can't make the most of any torrents you're seeding. If that's a problem, it's worth checking out Proton VPN.\nUnblocking score: 10/10\nPrivacy and Security\nNordVPN\u2019s security capabilities are built from the ground up. It supports two protocols, OpenVPN and NordLynx, NordVPN\u2019s proprietary protocol built on WireGuard.\nOpenVPN is the industry standard for a high-security connection, while WireGuard, and specifically NordLynx, is built for speed and usability with mobile devices, but is also impressively secure.\nThe encryption methods partnered with these protocols are AES-256 on OpenVPN and ChaCha20 on NordLynx. Against current technologies, these methods are some of the most trustworthy and secure available.\nIf you're worried about quantum computing, NordVPN is already on the case. Post-quantum encryption was introduced to the NordLynx protocol in September 2024, and NordVPN continues to secure itself further in preparation.\nAlongside its secure protocols and encryption methods, NordVPN employs a strict no-logs policy, meaning no browsing data is logged by its servers.\nThis policy was most recently audited by Deloitte at the end of 2024, and the results, as always, were positive. Deloitte did not find any issues or concerns. As NordVPN's fifth overall no-logs audit, the provider is clearly committed to transparency, proving that you can trust it not to keep logs.\nWhat\u2019s more, being headquartered in Panama means NordVPN isn't subject to data retention laws, meaning it wouldn\u2019t have any data to hand over should it face an unavoidable warrant.\nWithin NordVPN itself are several additional security features. Firstly, the provider offers a kill switch and DNS leak protection. Thankfully, finding the killswitch takes a matter of seconds within the apps, and should you have any concerns surrounding DNS leaks, you can use NordVPN\u2019s free DNS Leak Checker to settle doubts.\nWe\u2019ve mentioned NordVPN\u2019s Onion Over and Double VPN capabilities already, and, while our testing environment isn\u2019t exactly the environment they\u2019re intended for, we were successful in using both connections to access data in a timely manner.\nThreat Protection and Threat Protection Pro are the final security functions NordVPN has up its sleeve. Both aim to provide the same added layer of protection; however, standard Threat Protection works via DNS blocking and requires a VPN connection, while Threat Protection Pro is a standalone system with more advanced capabilities.\nThis differentiation manifested in testing, as Threat Protection only managed to block 24% of malware links and 34% of phishing links, whereas Pro blocked 79% of malware links and 87% of phishing links.\nIn practice, we\u2019d always recommend you use a dedicated antivirus software alongside anything a VPN provides, but either way, Threat Protection Pro\u2019s results are a solid foundation to build upon.\nAs mentioned already, when we put it to the test, we were pleasantly surprised with how it performed, despite a couple of interesting site block attempts and an unusually high demand on our processing power. It was simple to set up and forget about.\nPrivacy and security score: 10/10\nTrack record\nNordVPN\u2019s track record is nearly flawless. Its most recent misstep came in 2018 when it was discovered that one of its Finnish servers was compromised through an undisclosed remote access management system.\nDespite being left by the data centre providers rather than NordVPN, it prompted a complete overhaul of how NordVPN approached security.\nSince this overhaul, no further issues have occurred, with NordVPN continuing to invest in improving the core service, server network, and security. As already mentioned, NordVPN has undergone numerous security and no-logs audits, both before and since the incident.\nThis, therefore, serves as strong evidence of the work NordVPN has put in and provides reassurance that no such issue might recur.\nTrack record score: 8/10\nCustomer support\nNordVPN offers a whole host of ways to get in touch if you run into roadblocks. The first port of call is typically the 24/7 live chat manned by an AI chatbot.\nThis live chat was useful to a degree, but is only really capable of directing you to relevant support articles or escalating your case to a human support agent.\nThe limitations of the chatbot were apparent during testing while trying to troubleshoot issues we encountered with our connection, but thankfully, human support agents were quick to identify and resolve the problem.\nShould you require a different avenue of support, NordVPN also offers an email ticketing system, though, as you\u2019d expect, replies tend to be slower.\nIf you'd rather do your own problem-solving, you can sprawl through a wide array of support articles, video guides, and FAQs, all of which we found pretty helpful throughout testing, to find the answers you need.\nCustomer support score: 9/10\nPricing and plans\n- 1-month plans: $12.99/month (Basic) $13.99/month (Plus) $14.99/month (Complete \u2013 US-only) \u00a312.09/month (Ultimate \u2013 non-US) $17.99/Prime (US-only)\n- 12-month plans: $4.99/month (Basic) $5.99/month (Plus) $6.99/month (Complete \u2013 US-only) \u00a36.69/month (Ultimate \u2013 non-US) $8.99/Prime (US-only)\n- 24-month plans: $3.09/month (Basic) $3.99/month (Plus) $4.99/month (Complete \u2013 US-only) \u00a35.09/month (Ultimate \u2013 non-US) $6.99/Prime (US-only)\nNordVPN is one of the best cheap VPNs available, though it doesn\u2019t quite beat Surfshark when it comes to value for money.\nPlans start from $3.09/month, but as with most VPNs, the cheapest plans are billed upfront, so you'll pay $83.43 immediately. This does include three months free as a bonus right now, however. If you\u2019re in the UK, this deal is \u00a32.39/month, or \u00a364.53 upfront.\nThe issue NordVPN's plan have is that they vary by country \u2013 an issue shared by ExpressVPN. If you're in the US (or elsewhere in the world), your plan options differ from those available in the UK.\nSo, in the US, the best subscription you can buy is the NordVPN Prime plan, costing $6.99/month ($188.73 upfront). Whereas in the UK, your best choice is the Ultimate plan, costing \u00a35.09/month (\u00a3137.43 upfront).\nThe difference between these plans is that while the Prime plan in the US gives you everything NordVPN offers, plus the full NordProtect suite, the Ultimate plan gives you Cyber insurance covering scam loss and ID theft.\nLuckily, its best-value plan, the Plus plan, is available on any side of the pond. Costing $3.99/month ($107.73 upfront) in the US and \u00a33.19/month (\u00a386.13 upfront) in the UK, which includes all of NordVPN\u2019s VPN features, Threat Protection Pro, and NordPass with data breach scanning. So if you\u2019re looking for the best subscription to start your NordVPN journey with, this is the one we\u2019d recommend.\nPricing and plans score: 8/10\nShould you use NordVPN?\nYes, you should use NordVPN. It ranks as our best VPN for a reason - it doesn\u2019t have any major weak points that dent its armour or give us reason to be concerned about its security or capabilities. Its speeds are superb, its unblocking capabilities are flawless, and it\u2019s got a full suite of airtight security measures.\nThat said, in some specific circumstances, you might look elsewhere. Want the absolute best speeds out there? Check out Surfshark. Want security that no one comes close to matching? Look for ExpressVPN. Want server coverage in underserved locations? Proton VPN is your bet.\nWhat makes NordVPN special, however, is that if we couldn\u2019t recommend these providers, for whatever reason, NordVPN would provide a near-identical experience that, to most, would leave you wondering what the difference truly is.\nOverall score 89/100\n1. NordVPN \u2013 from $3.39 per month\nThe best VPN overall\nOur latest testing proves that NordVPN continues to lead the pack in terms of providing the best VPN experience possible. Offering a superbly quick and secure VPN, alongside privacy tools designed to safeguard your sensitive data, NordVPN offers an impressive package for a surprisingly low cost.\nNordVPN alternatives\n1. Surfshark \u2013 from $2.19 per month\nThe best cheap VPN (and also the fastest)\nSurfshark is a more budget-friendly option, offering unlimited simultaneous connections and similar speeds to NordVPN. There\u2019s also a security suite called Surfshark One, which offers features you won\u2019t get anywhere else, such as an identity generator and Surfshark\u2019s private search engine. Try it risk-free with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n2. ExpressVPN \u2013 from $4.99 per month\nThe best VPN for beginners and the most secure\nExpressVPN offers comparable speeds and security features to NordVPN, with a slightly higher price tag. In return, you get access to a worldwide network of VPN servers powered by an in-house VPN protocol designed to obfuscate your connection so ISPs can\u2019t disconnect you from the internet. ExpressVPN\u2019s unblocking capabilities are practically unparalleled, and you can trial them yourself with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n3. Proton VPN \u2013 from $2.99 per month\nA superb all-round VPN and online security alternative\nProton continues to provide one of the most widely known (and respected) security suites available. Offering features such as secure emailing, a password manager, and, of course, a VPN, Proton offers a solution for almost any online security dilemma you may have.\nNordVPN FAQs\nIs there a NordVPN free trial?\nNo, currently NordVPN doesn\u2019t offer a free trial. Instead, you can take advantage of a 30-day money-back guarantee should you want to give NordVPN a trial before committing to it long term.\nIs NordVPN good for streaming?\nYes, NordVPN is currently the best VPN for streaming. In our testing, it successfully unblocked services, including Netflix (In the UK, US, Australia, Canada, Japan), Prime Video, Disney+, BBC iPlayer, 9Now, 10Play, and more.\nCan I use NordVPN on multiple devices?\nYou can use NordVPN on up to 10 devices simultaneously. Should you need more devices than this, we\u2019d recommend looking at Surfshark, which offers unlimited simultaneous connections.\nRob is TechRadar's VPN Editor.

      "text": "The most private VPN: 2025's best no log VPNs to stay anonymous online\nThese VPNs put the 'private' into virtual private network\nFinding the most private VPN can be challenging, and figuring out which ones don't keep logs only makes things more difficult. Luckily, the TechRadar team has done the hard work for you.\nWe've tested today's biggest and best VPNs, analyzing their security tools, speed, unblocking power, and value for money.\nKeep reading, and I'll guide you through my top no-log services, and explain why they edged out their competitors in today's crowded VPN market.\nThe best no log VPNs in 2025: my top three\n1. Private Internet Access\nThe best no-logs VPN\nPrivate Internet Access(PIA) has carved out an impressive niche in the industry as one of the most secure services available. The provider has proven its no-logs claims in court\u2014not once, but twice\u2014and secures your browsing sessions with top-notch encryption. PIA is a budget-friendly pick, too, meaning you don't have to sacrifice security to bag a bargain. Check out PIA for yourself, risk-free, with a 30-day money-back guarantee, and see how it stacks up against NordVPN and ExpressVPN.\n2. NordVPN\nThe best fast VPN\nNordVPN is sitting pretty at the top of our overall rankings\u2014and for good reason. It's a reliable (and inexpensive) choice that's jam-packed with features designed to keep your personal data safe from snoopers. A no-logs policy is the cherry on top, and NordVPN works like a charm on pretty much every device out there. Take NordVPN for a test drive in your own time with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n3. ExpressVPN\nThe best pick for beginners\nExpressVPN makes using a VPN nice and easy\u2014even if you're totally new to the tech. A quick connect feature automatically pairs you up with a speedy server, you won't have to worry about manual configuration, and a proven no-logs policy has you covered. The caveat here is that ExpressVPN is pretty pricey. However, you're getting a premium, luxe service with stylish apps for all platforms. Be sure to put its 30-day money-back guarantee to good use before committing to a long-term plan.\nThe best no log VPN services in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe most private VPN overall\n1. Private Internet Access (PIA)\nA proven and privacy-focused no logs VPN\nAudited no log policy: Yes | Based in: United States | Available on: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux (GUI), routers and more | Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Refund period: 30 days\nPrivate Internet Access (or PIA to its friends) is a long-standing favorite of privacy-conscious folks everywhere. It has a long list of features that'll keep your browsing sessions secure, but its calling card is the proven no-logs policy, which has stood up to scrutiny in court on two separate occasions. When the American authorities presented PIA with a warrant for information, PIA had no data to hand over because it hadn't gathered any in the first place.\nIf you want to check out PIA's transparency for yourself, you'll be glad to learn that all of the provider\u2019s apps are open-source, meaning anyone can take a peek at the source code to check for vulnerabilities, verify its privacy claims, and otherwise audit it themselves. It\u2019s great to see a popular VPN taking this extra step to prove its commitment to user security (on top of its audits).\n\u25b6 Try Private Internet Access on unlimited devices.\nRead more about PIA \u25bc\nPIA pushes the boat out when it comes to servers, too, with tens of thousands of options to choose from. So, if you're trying to access geo-restricted streaming content that isn\u2019t available in your country, you can spoof your location in just a few clicks. Oh, and PIA's dedicated streaming servers are another nice bonus, too.\nIt is worth noting that PIA's apps aren't exactly newbie-friendly. They're jam-packed with tools, which is great for VPN veterans who want to get stuck into the nitty gritty but less so for first-time users who prefer a more streamlined experience. Overall, PIA just isn't as intuitive as ExpressVPN and Surfshark. On the plus side, however, PIA is one of a handful of providers to offer a full Linux GUI (visual app) rather than a command-line interface.\nI also like that PIA comes with built-in tools designed to keep your browsing sessions free from third-party snooping and annoying invasive ads. It's all thanks to the MACE feature, which banishes ads, trackers, and malware, and our most recent testing found that the tool was pretty effective, too, blocking 81% of ads and 96% of trackers. It's great to have this peace of mind as you go about your day-to-day web surfing.\nIt's well worth taking PIA for a test spin, especially since you'll get unlimited simultaneous connections to play with. So, whether you have a ton of gadgets you want to protect or a whole household of folks with mobiles and laptops who need coverage, PIA has your back. See for yourself with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Slightly cluttered, but otherwise straightforward | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Not ideal for VPN newbies, given the amount of features, but great for techy types | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Decent speeds, but can't compete with today's quickest providers | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nUnblocking | Unblocks a wide spread of content with the help of dedicated streaming servers | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nSecurity and privacy | An audited no logs provider with battle-tested encryption | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Awesome support is available in a flash, and plenty of knowledge online for solo troubleshooting | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPrice | Modest prices bag you lots of functionality | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nThe best fast VPN\n2. NordVPN\nA tried and tested titan of the VPN sphere\nAudited no log policy: Yes | Based in: Panama | Available on: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux (CLI), routers and more | Simultaneous connections: 10 | Refund period: 30 days\nNordVPN is a big-name provider with an impressive commitment to user privacy, and even invests in third-party audits to prove it. In 2022, NordVPN asked Deloitte to put its no logs policy under the microscope, with the firm stating that there were no violations. This wasn't NordVPN\u2019s first time at the security rodeo, either, as the service previously underwent two additional audits targeting other areas of the VPN.\nOver the years, NordVPN has become a go-to service thanks to its robust privacy package. All of your day-to-day browsing is secured by industry-standard AES-256 encryption, ensuring nobody (not your workplace, government, or Internet Service Provider) can monitor your activity. This is reinforced by NordVPN's private DNS and Double VPN tool, which routes your traffic through two servers for twice the protection.\n\u25b6 Try NordVPN with a 30-day money-back guarantee\nRead more about NordVPN \u25bc\nNordVPN is, quite frankly, the best streaming VPN out there. It's super fast, maxing out my connection at 950 Mbps, which is way more than you need to enjoy HD content without constant buffering interruptions. Plus, it can unblock the likes of Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Prime Video, and more, so you can keep up with your favorite shows regardless of whether they're available natively in your neck of the woods.\nThere are NordVPN apps for pretty much every gadget, and while the design is modern and user-friendly, there's a touch too much clutter for them to feel truly intuitive. If you're after a mobile VPN, it\u2019s worth noting that NordVPN's interactive map gets a little tricky to use on smaller screens\u2014especially if you're trying to pinpoint an exact location. Surfshark has NordVPN beat when it comes to sheer simplicity.\nOn the other hand, it's hard to overstate just how many features you get with NordVPN in return for incredibly fair prices. Plus, the provider is constantly cooking up awesome VPN deals that'll save you even more cash, so keep an eye out around holidays if you want to bag a bargain. Finally, ten simultaneous connections is pretty generous for a VPN, and give you plenty of leeway to share your subscription with friends or cover all of your gadgets.\nIf you'd rather not take my word for it, you don\u2019t have to\u2014NordVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee you can use to trial the service before picking up a long-term subscription.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Fresh and modern, but slightly on the cluttered side | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Tools are easy to find and use, but digging deeper into advanced configurations can be tricky | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | One of the quickest VPNs we\u2019ve tested in a long time | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nUnblocking | Unblocks Netflix like a charm, and tons of other services, too | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nSecurity and privacy | NordVPN\u2019s no logs policy has been audited, and the provider secures connections with rock-solid encryption | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | 24/7 live chat support is always around to help troubleshoot issues | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPrice | Great value for money and customizable prices | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nThe best VPN for beginners\n3. ExpressVPN\nPremium protection ideal for newbies\nAudited no log policy: Yes | Based in: British Virgin Islands | Available on: Windows, Android, iOS, Mac, Linux (command-line only), Routers, almost everything else | Simultaneous connections: 8 | Refund period: 30 days\nExpressVPN isn't interested in beating around the bush when disclosing its attitude to logging. There's a clear-cut policy you can check out that explains, in plain English, what the company does with the minimal logs it collects, and ExpressVPN has undergone a whopping 19 third-party audits (conducted by well-known firms like Cure53 and KPMG).\nI like that ExpressVPN is the total package. Your browsing habits will be kept under lock and key thanks to AES-256 encryption, and secure DNS even keeps your ISP from keeping tabs on what you get up to. The result is digital peace of mind\u2014and the kill switch (which kicks in if the VPN connection drops, cutting your internet access and preventing data leaks) is an extra layer of protection.\n\u25ba Try ExpressVPN with a 30-day money-back guarantee\nRead more about ExpressVPN \u25bc\nAlthough ExpressVPN isn\u2019t the quickest service on the block, it's no slouch. Its proprietary protocol, Lightway, clocked in at 898 Mbps\u2014which will keep your HD streams running smooth, your downloads short and snappy, and your overall browsing experience speedy. ExpressVPN is also a great Netflix VPN, unblocking the UK, US, Australian, Canadian, and Japanese libraries.\nOkay, so the elephant in the room is that ExpressVPN is wickedly pricey compared to the competition. If you're a real bargain hunter, you might want to stick with PIA and Surfshark, but if you're willing to splash more cash, ExpressVPN does provide a long list of reliable features\u2014like split tunneling, a password manager, and a malware blocker.\nWhere ExpressVPN shines is usability, making it my recommendation to VPN newcomers who have never toyed with an app before. Whether using it on PC or mobile, ExpressVPN\u2019s interface is arty and sleek, and hopping from server to server only takes a tap. Plus, the auto-connect feature pairs you up with the best server for you (based on your location).\nIf you're tempted by ExpressVPN's impressive security tools and luxe apps, but are wary of those steep prices, it\u2019s worth making good use of its 30-day money-back guarantee to try the service in your own time, risk-free, and get every cent back if you're less than impressed.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Fantastically intuitive apps where all features have a place\u2014and they\u2019re easy to find | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | ExpressVPN handles configurations for you, can automatically pair you up with a speedy server, and is generally a dream to use | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Speeds are fairly average and can handle streaming, gaming, and torrenting | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nUnblocking | Offers reliable access to all of today\u2019s top streaming services (and smaller regional ones) | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nSecurity and privacy | ExpressVPN undergoes regular audits to prove that its no logs policy isn\u2019t telling fibs | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | 24/7 live chat support has your back if you run into any obstacles | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPrice | Undeniably expensive, but worth every penny if you want a premium provider with premium privacy | \u2b50\u2b50 |\nOther VPNs I've tested and recommend\n4. Surfshark\nAffordable, secure, and super-speedy\nAudited no log policy: Yes | Based in: British Virgin Islands | Available on: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux (GUI), routers and more | Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Refund period: 30 days\nSurfshark makes privacy affordable for everyone\u2014which is why it's one of my favorite secure VPNs. It has put its no-logs policy through four independent security audits, so you don't have to take its promises on blind faith alone. These audits sniffed out a few vulnerabilities in the past, which isn't totally unusual, but Surfshark wasted no time setting them straight\u2014it's the kind of proactive response I like to see.\nOn the security side of things, you can pick from some of the industry's most trustworthy protocols\u2014WireGuard and OpenVPN included. This gives you the power to prioritize speed or pure privacy, respectively, and Surfshark covers all of your browsing sessions with solid AES-256 encryption. So, whether you're at home, at work, or using notoriously insecure public Wi-Fi hotspots, you won't have to worry about nosy third parties.\n\u25b6 Try Surfshark with a 30-day money-back guarantee\nRead more about Surfshark \u25bc\nSurfshark is wickedly quick. It's my #1 fast VPN, seeing as it maxed out my connection line with WireGuard speeds of over 950 Mbps. That's great news if you're looking for a gaming VPN that can keep up with your online matches (and help you link up with friends overseas), or a service that'll hop over those pesky geo-restrictions so you can tune in to your TV favorites.\nI\u2019m constantly blown away by the fact that Surfshark offers unlimited simultaneous connections. It's great value for money because you'll be able to connect all of the devices you own (and let friends and family get in on the fun) at no extra cost. The revamped Windows app looks pretty snazzy, too, and makes connecting to any of the Surfshark servers (in 100 countries) a breeze.\nYou can't go wrong with a Surfshark subscription\u2014the prices are minuscule, they're packed with features, and you'll get a 30-day money-back guarantee in case you change your mind later.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Simple and clean across all devices | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Quick Connect feature helps newbies pair up with speedy servers in a flash | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | The quickest VPN on our books | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nUnblocking | Unblocks Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Prime Video, and many (many) more | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nSecurity and privacy | Kill switch has issues under extreme stress testing | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | 24/7 live support is fantastic, and extensive FAQs are also available | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPrice | An inexpensive option with a ton of value for money | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\n5. Mullvad\nA speedy service that's security-first\nAudited no log policy: Yes | Based in: Sweden | Available on: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux (GUI), routers and more | Simultaneous connections: 5 | Refund period: 30 days\nUnlike some VPNs, Mullvad doesn't require you to work to figure out its logging policy. All you need to do is head over to the provider's policy page, and you'll see everything laid out for you, jargon-free. Best of all, the VPN has undergone two separate independent audits in 2021 and 2022, which is great to hear. I'd like to see Mullvad continue this trend with a new audit, however, so we can be sure nothing has changed in the intervening years.\nOn the surface, Mullvad might not look as feature-rich as its competitors, but you might be surprised by how many handy tools are packed into its plan. For a start, the ad-blocking functionality works like a charm and stops annoying pop-ups and trackers. Plus, you can add adult sites, gambling pages, or anything else that (doesn't) take your fancy to a block list.\n\u25b6 Try Mullvad with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nRead more about Mullvad \u25bc\nSpeaking of surprises, I was blown away by just how quick Mullvad is. I tested its WireGuard speeds and recorded a whopping 850+ Mbps. So, if you plan on torrenting or online gaming, Mullvad won't slow you down. If you'd rather stick to the tried and tested OpenVPN option, you'll also be glad to know that Mullvad is quicker than most of its peers, clocking in at 450+ Mbps.\nUnfortunately, where Mullvad falls short is in its streaming capability. I wasn't able to tune in to any Netflix libraries while I was putting the service to the test, which is going to be disappointing to a lot of folks. The lack of live chat support is a significant downside, too, as problems can and do pop up at any time of the day.\nIf streaming isn't your thing, and you want a VPN that focuses on privacy, Mullvad does deliver. You'll have access to a reliable kill switch and leak protection that ensure you don't leave an identifiable trial across the web, and all of the Mullvad apps are nice and intuitive, even if you're new to VPNs.\nIf you're interested in taking Mullvad for a test drive, you'll want to take advantage of the 30-day money-back guarantee\u2014though this won't apply to cash-only payments.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Not overly complicated, not totally drab\u2014a solid middle-ground | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Decent for VPN newbies | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | WireGuard and OpenVPN speeds are incredibly quick | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nUnblocking | Disappointing unblocking power means you\u2019ll struggle to access any geo-restricted content on Netflix | \u2b50 |\nSecurity and privacy | An audited no-logs service that pays attention to the details | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | The lack of live chat isn\u2019t great, but email responses from the team are always speedy | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPrice | On the pricey side, for sure | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nHow to choose a VPN\nWhen shopping around for a VPN, there are a few key criteria to keep in mind\u2014but everything hinges on what you'll be using your VPN for. Is security the be-all and end-all? Or do you want to check out international streaming content, too?\nEither way, here's what you should look for in the best no logs VPN.\n- Proven policy: a no logs policy is a must-have for the privacy-conscious, and the best services undergo regular third-party audits to keep users in the know.\n- Security tools: most VPNs offer a kill switch and a handful of VPN protocols, but some services really push the boat out when it comes to extras. NordVPN, for example, has built-in ad-blocking tools.\n- Speed: nobody wants to be stuck waiting for a webpage to load or a video to buffer, so you'll want to stick with speedy VPNs that can handle data-intensive tasks like HD streaming and gaming.\n- Ease of use: VPNs have never been more consumer-friendly - but some are more intuitive than others. Look for intuitive apps, compatibility with all of your gadgets, and 24/7 customer support.\n- Price: this is a big one (especially since we're still feeling the cost of living crunch). Luckily, there are reliable VPNs to suit all budgets, ranging from the luxe and lavish to the budget-friendly - so there's no reason to break the bank.\nThe best no log VPN FAQs\nWhat makes a good private VPN?\nIn addition to a regularly audited no logs policy, a good private VPN has a plethora of security tools that'll boost your overall privacy. Today's top VPN encryption protocols, reliable kill switch, DNS leak protection, and obfuscation tech are great examples.\nCan you get hacked while using a VPN?\nIt is possible to be hacked while using a VPN\u2014however, the chances of this happening are pretty low. A VPN adds an extra layer of security to your internet connection, safeguarding your data and detecting unusual online behavior.\nCan you be tracked with a no-log VPN?\nUsing one of my top-rated no log VPNs ensures that your online activity can't be tracked. This is thanks to the VPN's encryption, IP spoofing ability, and aversion to keeping user logs. Be careful about what you share online, however, as your VPN can't prevent tracking if you willingly hand over information to apps or webpages.\nAre there free no log VPNs?\nThere are a handful of reliable free no log VPNs, but I'd avoid using free services if you're truly concerned about your digital privacy. These services come with pretty serious drawbacks, like bandwidth caps and monthly data allowances, that can sour your overall browsing experience.\nWorse still, some free providers are little more than scams designed to collect your data, sell it to third parties, and turn a profit. If you're looking for an inexpensive way to trial a robust and super-secure VPN, I'd recommend making good use of one of my top picks' 30-day money-back guarantees.\nWhat is a no-logs policy?\nIn a nutshell, a no logs policy is a VPN's promise not to collect or share your information while you're connected to one of its servers. The VPN is stating that it won't track information, like your search queries, the websites you visit, the amount of time you spend on them, or your downloads.\nNowadays, it'd be unusual for a VPN not to provide a no logs policy. A VPN is all about protecting your online activities, after all, so squirreling away your personal data is a major red flag. A lot of VPNs take their no log policies so seriously that they invite third-party organizations to independently audit them. This ensures that the policies are effective and don't put users at risk\u2014and are a good indication of the provider's transparency, too.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example: 1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service). 2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad. We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services. Consuming pirated content that is paid-for is neither endorsed nor approved by Future Publishing.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRob is TechRadar's VPN Editor.

      "text": "What does a VPN money-back guarantee really mean?\nBeware: it might not give you the refund rights you might expect\nYou've read our guide to the best VPNs, and spent time doing your own research, but there's no getting away from it... signing up for most providers means handing over money for a service before you've really been able to try it.\nYes, there are exceptions: those free VPNs that rely on a freemium model to eventually get you to upgrade to a premium tier, for example. And then there are the companies that try to reassure you by plastering their websites with 'MONEY BACK GUARANTEE!!' banners, and that seems to make sense.\nIt should be safe to assume that when a website tells you there's a 30-day guarantee, that's a month of testing time and you'll get your money back if you're unhappy. Right?\nWell, not necessarily. We've dug into the detail, and it turns out many of these guarantees don't offer the protection you might think.\nWhat is a VPN money-back guarantee?\nIn the cybersecurity world, the concept of VPNs with free trials can be something of a misnomer. Yes, they do exist - most likely if you're downloading a mobile VPN app for your Android or iPhone - but it's much more common that it will actually be in the form of a money-back guarantee, usually of around 30 or 45 days.\nBut while that concept of a money-back guarantee seems clear and obvious, there are often somewhat sneaky catches tucked away in the small print. For example...\nRestrictive condition - We've seen some providers place conditions on the refund. You might not be eligible if you've used a set amount of data, for instance, or connected 'too many times'.\nPro-rata refunds - Even when you qualify to get your money back, it might not be all of it. A few companies only refund you for the period you've not used, so if it takes you 90% of your money-back period to decide, you'll only get 10% back.\nAvailable on selected plans - Providers who offer full refunds, won't necessarily offer it for all plans. Many guarantees apply only to annual or longer schemes. And this kind of makes sense - it would be rather odd to have a 30-day money back guarantee on a one month subscription!\nPrevious refunds - If you've ever had a refund from your chosen provider, then be careful: some companies limit the number of refunds you can claim, or say there must a minimum period of time between requests.\nMoney-back guarantees: what do VPN companies offer?\nMoney-back guarantees aren't just about catching you out; sometimes they'll give you rights you didn't expect. For example, refund periods don't always apply to the number of days since your initial purchase. A few generous providers cover you for renewal payments, too.\nYou'll generally find this information in a provider's terms and conditions.
