  "title": "L.A. police reserve officer took part in home invasion, kidnapped man for ransom, prosecutors say",
  "description": "Eric Halem and another suspect are accused of kidnapping a man in a Koreatown home invasion and forcing him to turn over $200,000 in cryptocurrency.",
  "content": "A former Los Angeles police officer has been charged in a kidnap for ransom.\n\nProsecutors have charged a former Los Angeles police officer in a kidnapping for ransom that occurred when he was still an active reserve officer.\n\nThe December incident, which authorities said involved the former officer and three other men, began with a Koreatown home invasion. Eric Halem and another man are accused of then kidnapping a man and forcing him to turn over $200,000 in cryptocurrency.\n\nHalem, 37, was arrested Thursday afternoon by members of the LAPD\u2019s Robbery-Homicide Division and held without bail. Halem served about 13 years as an officer before becoming a reserve officer. In addition to kidnapping for ransom, which carries a potential life sentence, he is charged with a separate count of kidnapping, along with four counts of robbery in connection with the home invasion.\n\n\u201cWhether you once wore a badge and served in law enforcement or not, if you take part in violent crimes, you will be held fully accountable,\u201d Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Nathan J. Hochman said in a statement.\n\nOn Dec. 28, 2024, at about 2:30 a.m., Halem and L.A. resident Mishael Mann, 20, allegedly entered an apartment in Koreatown, where they handcuffed two victims, transferred money from a victim\u2019s cryptocurrency account and stole cash and jewelry before fleeing, prosecutors say. Luis Banuelos, 28, of Jurupa Valley and 26-year-old Pierre Louis of Attleboro, Mass., are accused of waiting outside the apartment to serve as getaway drivers, according to prosecutors.\n\nHalem and Mann both pleaded not guilty at their arraignment Monday. Banuelos and Louis pleaded not guilty at a June 11 arraignment. A preliminary hearing for all four defendants is scheduled for Sept. 24 in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nHalem, of Porter Ranch, and Mann are being held without bail; the other two are being held in lieu of $1.3 million bail. LAPD investigators arrested the alleged getaway drivers in May.\n\nAfter Halem\u2019s arrest, LAPD investigators obtained warrants for the search of his home and said they recovered several firearms he owned.\n\nIn an unattributed statement sent Friday afternoon in response to questions from The Times, the LAPD confirmed Halem\u2019s arrest but said it was \u201cnot related to the department\u2019s investigation into residential burglaries in the west valley.\u201d\n\nHalem opted to join the department\u2019s reserve officer program in 2022, where he remained until March, after he was charged in February in a separate case involving alleged insurance fraud. Halem was stripped of his reserve police powers after the criminal case against him was announced.\n\nDuring his LAPD career, Halem worked on the side as a security consultant and also rented out luxury cars to music artists and celebrities.\n\nIn 2019, he was hired to provide security for Randall Emmett, an action movie producer. Emmett was the subject of a 2022 Times investigation and subsequent Hulu documentary that surfaced allegations of abuse against women and assistants as well as mistreatment of business partners. Emmett has denied the allegations.\n\nAround the same time, Halem landed small roles in TV shows including \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d and \u201cMidnight in the Switchgrass.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, he and his brother were charged with insurance fraud over what prosecutors alleged was an elaborate scheme related to a Bentley crash in January 2023.\n\nEric Halem ran the Kaypr and Drive L.A. car rental companies, which boasted a fleet of rare luxury vehicles, including a 2020 Bentley Continental GT and a neon green Lamborghini Urus.\n\nProsecutors allege Halem told his insurance company that his brother borrowed the Bentley and crashed it on Jan. 5, 2023.\n\nBut a police investigation found that the Bentley had been rented by a Drive L.A. client who wrecked it three days prior. After the rental driver\u2019s insurance claim was denied because of a lack of proper coverage, Eric Halem filed a fraudulent claim for more than $200,000 with his insurance company on his personal policy, misrepresenting details of the accident, authorities allege.\n\nHalem has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of insurance fraud. His brother Jacob Halem, 32, also pleaded not guilty to a count of insurance fraud.\n\nCourt records show that LAPD internal affairs investigators were looking into similar allegations against Halem near the end of his department career.",

His brother Jacob Halem, 32, also pleaded not guilty to a count of insurance fraud, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney\u2019s office.\nEric Halem\u2019s car rental company, Drive LA, boasts a fleet of rare, luxury vehicles, including a 2020 Bentley Continental GT. The California Department of Insurance said in a news release on Friday that Eric Halem told his insurance company that his brother had borrowed the vehicle and crashed it on Jan. 5, 2023.\nFour Los Angeles residents are accused of creating videos of a fake bear ravaging pricey automobiles to cash in on the insurance money.\nBut the department\u2019s investigation revealed that the Bentley had been rented by a Drive LA client and that the renter crashed the vehicle three days before the brothers claimed Jacob crashed it.\nLos Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department deputies responded to the accident scene involving the rental driver and documented the vehicle\u2019s damage with body camera footage, the insurance department said in its release.\nAfter the rental driver\u2019s insurance claim was denied because of a lack of proper coverage, Eric Halem filed a fraudulent claim with his insurance company on his personal policy, misrepresenting details of the accident, authorities allege.\nAn attorney representing Jacob Halem did not immediately return a request for comment. It is not clear if Eric Halem has an attorney.\nFifteen people, including a California Highway Patrol employee, were charged this month with participating in a scheme to defraud insurance companies.\nThe department of insurance alleges that Eric Halem claimed his brother had been driving the vehicle at the time of the crash, which they said was on Jan. 5, 2023. They submitted what the department called \u201cstaged photographs\u201d of the damaged Bentley on a tow truck.\nInsurance department investigators said the damage in the photos the brothers submitted was identical to the damage captured on body camera footage from the renter\u2019s crash three days earlier.\nAuthorities allege Jacob Halem provided a false statement to the insurance company investigator to corroborate his brother\u2019s claim.\nThe department of insurance confirmed Friday that the insurance company didn\u2019t pay out anything for the claim. The agency said the \u201ctotal potential loss\u201d from the claim would have been $229,283.\nEric Halem was removed as a reserve officer with LAPD in March, according to a department spokesperson."

      "text": "- Share via\nRandall Emmett was fuming.\nIt was the producer\u2019s first time in the director\u2019s chair, and things weren\u2019t going well. For the last half-hour on the set of \u201cMidnight in the Switchgrass,\u201d the filmmaker and his colleagues had been trying to persuade Bruce Willis to kick open a door.\nA voice coming through the actor\u2019s earpiece coached him through his lines. A stunt coordinator gently attempted to guide him. Yet, take after take, Willis did not seem to understand, according to seven crew members who were present for the late-night shoot. Emmett rose from behind the video monitor and mimed the actions, urging Willis to emulate him. When the effort failed, the director left the set in frustration, three of the crew members said.\n\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d Willis asked, searching the concerned faces of the below-the-line team.\nThat night, Emmett\u2019s then-fiancee, Lala Kent, said Emmett called her crying.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d Kent recalled him saying in a call overheard by two other people. \u201cIt\u2019s just so sad. Bruce can\u2019t remember any of his lines. He doesn\u2019t know where he is.\u201d\n\u2018Die Hard\u2019 and \u2018Pulp Fiction\u2019 actor Bruce Willis ends his acting career after being diagnosed with aphasia, his family announces.\nBut in the 15 months after filming \u201cMidnight in the Switchgrass,\u201d Emmett made five more movies with Willis.\nEmmett, in a statement to The Times, denied the conversation with Kent occurred or that he was aware \u201cof any decline in Mr. Willis\u2019 health.\u201d\nOn that day in September 2020, few people outside the insular world of low-budget action filmmaking knew Willis was battling a condition that made it difficult for him to understand or express speech. But as The Times previously reported, it was an open secret on movie sets.\n\u201cOur stunt coordinator mentioned he was struggling,\u201d said Alicia Haverland, a property master on \u201cMidnight in the Switchgrass. \u201cOur first [assistant director] saw he was struggling. You would have to be blind to not see him struggling.\u201d\nIn March, his family announced he had been diagnosed with aphasia and was ending his career.\nWillis\u2019 enduring appeal had helped propel Emmett\u2019s production company, Emmett/Furla Oasis, to success; the 51-year-old producer used the Willis name and face to sell his films around the world. Since 2006, the actor has appeared in two dozen of the firm\u2019s projects \u2014 and the pace of the output heightened as Willis\u2019 health declined.\nFor years, Emmett had flourished on the margins of Hollywood, producing films that featured cameos from big-name stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone and often went straight to DVD. But by 2019, he was flirting with Hollywood glory. He\u2019d produced a couple of genuine blockbusters, and was in line to claim an Academy Award as one of the producers of Martin Scorsese\u2019s Oscar contender \u201cThe Irishman.\u201d He had easy access to private jets, friendly contacts at gossip site TMZ, and a Los Angeles Police Department officer who described himself as Emmett\u2019s \u201cbusiness and security manager.\u201d\nA year later, the walls were closing in.\nSubscribers get exclusive access to this story\nWe\u2019re offering L.A. Times subscribers special access to our best journalism. Thank you for your support.\nExplore more Subscriber Exclusive content.\nA review of hundreds of court filings and internal company records, as well as interviews with three dozen former associates, depicts an empire that is crumbling. The once-high-flying producer faces lawsuits and mounting debts, as well as allegations of abuse against women, assistants and business partners. He is accused of inappropriate behavior with women, including offering acting work in exchange for sexual favors, and of forcing assistants to conduct dangerous and illegal activity on his behalf. Through his spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, Emmett denied these allegations.\nEmmett used an array of tactics to try to keep these allegations secret, including entering into nondisclosure agreements and allegedly promising a payment of about $200,000 to a female accuser, which Emmett has denied.\nEmmett and his company now are confronting nearly a dozen lawsuits, including several from former financiers, an insurance company and a prior landlord, all clamoring to be repaid their portion of more than $25 million in outstanding loans and disputed payments. Several lawsuits accuse Emmett\u2019s company of misrepresentation and civil fraud.\nThe Writers Guild of America West won a $541,464 judgment against EFO last year after it filed a claim on behalf of writers who alleged they were shortchanged for their work on an Emmett project.\n\u201cHis normal mode of business is being sketchy,\u201d said Teresa Huang, a writer on that project. \u201cHe just spins all these plates in the air and doesn\u2019t care how they crash.\u201d\nTimes reporting has played a starring role in \u2018The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u2019 this season. Here\u2019s our guide to Erika Jayne and Tom Girardi.\nIn a statement, Emmett rejected Huang\u2019s assessment and blamed the allegations contained in this story on Kent, a reality TV star with whom he has a child. \u201cThese allegations are false and part of a now-familiar smear campaign orchestrated by Randall\u2019s ex-fiancee to sway their custody dispute,\u201d said Hofmeister. Emmett and Kent, a cast member on Bravo\u2019s \u201cVanderpump Rules,\u201d currently share custody of their child.\nWillis\u2019 attorney, Martin Singer, declined an interview request on the actor\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cMy client continued working after his medical diagnosis because he wanted to work and was able to do so, just like many others diagnosed with aphasia who are capable of continuing to work,\u201d Singer wrote. \u201cBecause Mr. Willis appeared in those films, they could get financed. That resulted in literally thousands of people having jobs, many during the COVID-19 Pandemic.\u201d\nA wheeler-dealer\nIn a town that is home to creative geniuses as well as quick-buck hustlers, Emmett occupies a lucrative niche in between. He\u2019s made more than 120 movies, most of which have been critically panned. His specialty is cranking out low-budget, high-testosterone, assault-gun-and-explosions films and recruiting stars such as Willis, Stallone, Mel Gibson and other older white men whose enduring cachet has lured investors and generated overseas sales. Although he isn\u2019t among the few movie producers who are recognizable by name \u2014 Kevin Feige, Jerry Bruckheimer, Megan Ellison \u2014 Emmett had just enough success to attract young women, aspiring actors, ambitious assistants, deep-pocketed investors and even big-name stars seduced by the promise of fame, fortune or both.\nWith his trademark five o\u2019clock shadow, black T-shirt, cargo shorts and white shell-toe Adidas sneakers, Emmett has worked overtime to hone his image as a Hollywood tough guy \u2014 a wheeler-dealer, high-stakes poker player who beats the house.\nHis parents sold insurance in his native Miami, but as a child, Emmett yearned to be in entertainment. In eighth grade, he began acting in TV commercials but was mocked for being a goofy kid who was interested in the arts.\nAfter graduating from Miami\u2019s prestigious New World School of the Arts, he went to college in New York on an acting scholarship.\n\u201cEveryone else at film school wanted to be a writer or director or actor,\u201d Emmett told The Times in 2012. \u201cI was the only one who wanted to be a producer.\u201d\nAfter graduation in 1994, he moved to Los Angeles. He landed a coveted internship with his distant cousin, Bruckheimer, the blockbuster movie producer behind \u201cTop Gun\u201d and \u201cPirates of the Caribbean,\u201d and then became an assistant at International Creative Management talent agency.\nAt 24, he got a job as Mark Wahlberg\u2019s assistant, a gig that became central to Emmett\u2019s origin story and the foundation of his career. In the actor-producer, he had a role model and a foil. In 2012, Wahlberg told The Times that Emmett once challenged him to a wrestling match. \u201cI had to body-slam him. Then he wanted it again.\u201d\n(Wahlberg\u2019s manager said he could not be reached for comment.)\nIt was as Wahlberg\u2019s assistant that Emmett began cultivating the kind of cool that HBO\u2019s \u201cEntourage\u201d \u2014 a show produced by Wahlberg and based loosely on his rise \u2014 showcased more than a decade ago. Indeed, Emmett claims to have helped inspire the show\u2019s weed-dealing driver, Turtle. (Multiple reports have noted that the character was actually based on another of Wahlberg\u2019s assistants.) Throughout his decades in Hollywood, Emmett, like the guys on that series, would flaunt luxury cars and expensive real estate, date a bevy of much younger women and party at roped-off clubs.\nEmmett found his first loyal investor in George Furla, a former stock trader and hedge fund manager who\u2019d put some money into a modeling agency and surprised Emmett by backing his 1999 buddy drama \u201cSpeedway Junky\u201d with $30,000.\nThe pair founded Emmett/Furla Films. Furla, who declined interview requests, handled the finances, while Emmett became the self-described \u201cloud and obnoxious\u201d frontman.\n\u201cIf you throw Randy out the door, he comes in the window,\u201d Emmett\u2019s film producing mentor, Avi Lerner, told The Times in 2012. \u201cIf you throw him from the window, he comes down the chimney.\u201d\nEmmett\u2019s trademark films, dubbed \u201cgeezer teasers\u201d in a 2021 New York magazine article that called Emmett \u201cHollywood\u2019s worst filmmaker,\u201d mined the box office appeal of Hollywood heroes of an earlier era. On a recent YouTube broadcast, he kidded that he isn\u2019t a B- or C-level producer: \u201cmore like H-level.\u201d)\n\u201cFor a lot of people in Hollywood, Randall is the person who can help you get the movie done,\u201d said Michael Polish, who has directed three Emmett films. \u201cHe gives people their chance, and not a lot of people in Hollywood will do that.\u201d\nEmmett\u2019s drive, and results, attracted a large investment from Dubai-based Oasis Ventures, which in 2013 acquired a one-third stake, renaming it Emmett/Furla Oasis.\nHollywood took notice of Emmett and Furla that year. Universal Pictures released their film \u201cLone Survivor,\u201d which was written and directed by Pete Berg and based on a real-life story of Navy SEALs conducting a failed military operation in Afghanistan. The film, which starred Wahlberg, was praised by critics and raked in $155 million worldwide. It gave Emmett newfound credibility after years of producing mediocre fare like \u201cMercenary for Justice\u201d with Steven Seagal.\nSuddenly, Emmett could attract big stars and hungry investors. His Instagram account shouted his ambition: @randallmogul.\nEmmett also became an unlikely savior that year for one of the industry\u2019s greatest filmmakers. Martin Scorsese had tried for 15 years to secure financing for a project about Portuguese Jesuit priests in the 17th century investigating Catholic persecution. None of the studios would touch \u201cSilence,\u201d but after a call from Scorsese\u2019s super-agent Ari Emanuel of WME, Emmett jumped at the chance.\nDuring his first meeting with Scorsese, he \u201cwas perspiring and hyperventilating,\u201d Emmett recalled during a 2014 conversation with students at New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts. \u201cAnd I just went in the room and he said: \u2018Why should I make these movies with you?\u2019 I said: \u2018Cause you\u2019re the man and I\u2019ll do whatever you f\u2014 say, basically.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018I love this kid. All right, give him the movie.\u2019\u201d\nEmmett and Furla reportedly raised half of the $46.5-million budget for the film featuring Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield, which The Times described as a \u201cmasterwork of spiritual inquiry.\u201d In exchange for backing \u201cSilence,\u201d Emmett earned a producing credit \u2014 and eventually, an Oscar nomination \u2014 on Scorsese\u2019s next film, the brooding 2019 mob epic \u201cThe Irishman\u201d for Netflix.\nScorsese\u2019s publicist said the director was unavailable for comment.\n\u2018I\u2019m not a creep, I promise\u2019\nDespite his prolific film resume, Emmett may be best known for appearing on reality television as Kent\u2019s fiance (and then ex-fiance) on the last two seasons of \u201cVanderpump Rules.\u201d\nOn the Bravo show, Emmett projected the image of a Hollywood power broker who drove a Rolls-Royce convertible and lived on Mulholland Drive. Kent told friends that he\u2019d offered to give her a Range Rover the morning after she \u201clet him hit it\u201d for the first time in 2015.\nThe couple were together for nearly six years and had a daughter before their relationship imploded. Last fall, one of Kent\u2019s fellow cast members alerted her that pictures of Emmett exiting an elevator with two young women, taken by an onlooker in Nashville, were circulating online. (Asked about the images, Hofmeister said: \u201cRandall enjoys socializing with friends. In Nashville he was hanging out with a large group of people, men and women.\u201d)\nWithin hours of the photo leak, Emmett was back in L.A, where Kent demanded that he share the contents of his phone. When he refused, she said she grabbed it away from him.\nNatasha Henstridge was watching a movie on Brett Ratner\u2019s couch when she fell asleep.\n\u201cHe ran after me, tackled me and knocked me to the ground,\u201d Kent said, echoing claims she made in her request for custody of their daughter. \u201cI used every ounce of strength to get him off of me as he was trying to pry it from my hands. \u2026 That was when I knew, for sure, that there was a lot he was hiding.\u201d\nThe Times spoke with five people who confirmed Kent told them about Emmett tackling her to the ground within days or weeks of the altercation. Emmett, however, denied a physical fight occurred. His team provided The Times with a declaration from his longtime nanny, Isabelle Morales, who said that \u201cneither was on the ground.\u201d\n\u201cI witnessed Randall and Lala fighting over his phone,\u201d Morales said. \u201cThe only physical interaction I saw was Randall taking back his phone from Lala.\u201d\nKent sought \u201cto keep her name in the press, and remain relevant in reality television,\u201d Hofmeister said in the statement.\nEmmett had good reason to protect the iPhone. It was the keeper of his secrets \u2014 the tool he is accused of using to send lewd text messages to women, hunt for sexual prospects on Instagram and email his lawyer about wiring money to women in exchange for their silence.\nThrough interviews and reviewing previously confidential documents, The Times has learned that several women have accused Emmett of pursuing them in inappropriate ways \u2014 one alleged she was offered acting work in exchange for sex \u2014 even as Hollywood began to reconsider the way its powerful men treated women.\n\u201cI used every ounce of strength to get him off of me as he was trying to pry [his phone] from my hands. \u2026 That was when I knew, for sure, that there was a lot he was hiding.\u201d\n\u2014 Lala Kent, echoing claims she made in her request for custody of their daughter\nOne woman, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, said that she was leaving a bar around midnight in 2014 when a Rolls-Royce pulled up beside her on Ventura Boulevard and a man she had never met rolled down the window. It was Emmett.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a creep, I promise. I\u2019m a movie producer, you can Google me \u2014 please Google me,\u201d she said he implored. The Times spoke with a friend of the woman who said her friend shared this account, but Emmett denied the incident occurred.\nAnother aspiring performer was just 23, with a few minor TV credits to her name, when she met Emmett. The producer, then making a string of movies with rap star Curtis \u201c50 Cent\u201d Jackson, introduced himself to her as a \u201cwell-known and established movie producer,\u201d according to a letter written to Emmett by attorney Gloria Allred.\nAllred\u2019s letter, which The Times reviewed, was dated Oct. 5, 2021, and sent to Emmett via FedEx and email. In it Allred alleges that the producer explicitly told the woman, who declined to make her name public, \u201cthat to receive acting work from [him], she would have to perform sexual favors.\u201d The letter then cites a text exchange in which Allred\u2019s client asked Emmett if she\u2019d won an acting role she\u2019d auditioned for in one of his projects.\n\u201cYes. one day of work and u need to fuckme hun,\u201d Emmett responded, according to the letter.\nHofmeister confirmed that Emmett did receive the letter but said he \u201cadamantly denies\u201d the allegations in it. Allred declined requests for comment.\nOver the next three years, Allred\u2019s client had minor roles in two more of Emmett\u2019s films.\nDuring this period, Allred\u2019s letter alleges, the woman gave Emmett massages and oral sex, allowed him to digitally penetrate her and stood nude in his office while he masturbated.\nShe complied with Emmett\u2019s requests, the letter says, because she was \u201cseeking to further her career\u201d and did not want to \u201canger an important producer in the industry.\u201d\nInterviews with multiple members of the \u201cRust\u201d crew paint an hour- by-hour picture of a cascade of bad decisions that created a chaotic set on which a lead bullet was put into a prop gun.\nWhenever Allred\u2019s client rebuffed Emmett\u2019s advances, she said, he told her he would not give her the roles they had discussed.\nThe incidents caused her to feel a \u201cdeep sense of self-loathing and self-hatred\u201d that led her to seek weekly therapy beginning in 2016, Allred said. The lawyer went on to invite Emmett to engage in \u201can expeditious confidential mediation process\u201d to avoid civil litigation.\nOn Jan. 2, 2022, Emmett was sent a settlement agreement that stipulated he would pay Allred\u2019s client about $200,000 over the course of two years. A person familiar with the situation said Emmett printed, signed and scanned that agreement, although he denied doing so.\nJust two months after finalizing the settlement, Emmett sent an unsolicited Instagram message to a 30-year-old woman in Las Vegas whose feed featured dozens of photos of herself and her boyfriend. This woman told The Times that Emmett \u2014 whom she\u2019d never met \u2014 messaged her from his account using the social media platform\u2019s \u201cvanish mode\u201d setting, which permanently deletes any text or pictures after they are seen by both users.\nAccording to a declaration filed in the custody proceedings and reviewed by The Times, Emmett asked her to \u201cf\u2014 on the dl\u201d and \u201cdo heroin and meth,\u201d among other things. She did not respond and was so alarmed, she recounted, that she used the camera from her laptop to capture the Instagram messages on her phone. She included screenshots of those images with her declaration.\nHofmeister provided proof of negative drug tests Emmett has taken as part of the ongoing custody dispute.\n\u201cHe is working hard on his sobriety and very proud that he has stayed clean for almost a year,\u201d she said.\nA person close to Emmett said there was no forensic proof Emmett sent the messages to the Las Vegas woman.\nDespite being unanswered, Emmett\u2019s DMs continued for two weeks, the Las Vegas woman said. Then she received a string of similar WhatsApp messages from an unknown number.\nShe reached out to a friend who knew a \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d cast member and confirmed that the unknown number matched Emmett\u2019s. She said she blocked his number.\n\u201cI was shocked, concerned, and afraid because Randall is a stranger to me,\u201d the woman wrote of Emmett\u2019s behavior in the court document. \u201cHis persistence despite my never responding to a single message from him is frightening.\u201d\nOffers of payment\nEmmett paid women to sign nondisclosure agreements, or NDAs, requiring them to keep mum about his intimate relationships.\nHe tried to get Kent to sign one early in their relationship, his ex-fiancee told The Times.\nIn the summer of 2016, she was about to start filming the fifth season of \u201cVanderpump Rules,\u201d and producers wanted to include her new boyfriend on the show. But their romance was a delicate subject: Emmett was still legally married to actress Ambyr Childers, though he told Kent that they were separated.\nTo figure out how to handle the subject on television, Kent said Emmett suggested that she meet with one of his attorneys, Keith Davidson, who once represented Stormy Daniels in her legal battle against Donald Trump. Kent brought her mother, Lisa Burningham, along to the attorney\u2019s Wilshire Boulevard office for one of their meetings.\nInside, Kent said Davidson put a stack of papers in front of the women: an agreement stating that Kent would receive $14,000 in exchange for keeping her relationship with Emmett a secret.\n\u201cI said: \u2018We\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d Burningham recalled, and she and her daughter left the office.\nDavidson, in a response to The Times, said attorney-client privilege prevented him from discussing the matter. A person close to Emmett said the account was inaccurate but did not provide any details.\nKent and her mother said she did not take the $14,000 offer, and Kent ended her relationship with the producer. But after his divorce with Childers was finalized in December 2017, Emmett and Kent reentered a serious relationship. They remained a couple until she learned of his alleged infidelity following the Nashville incident in October 2021.\nAfter those photos of Emmett with other women surfaced, Kent said she was suddenly bombarded with messages. Several individuals claimed that a Florida model had been having an affair with Emmett, and Kent checked out the Florida woman\u2019s social accounts.\nWhen the woman noticed that Kent had viewed her Instagram story, she called Emmett on Nov. 28 and recorded the conversation without his knowledge. The Times reviewed the recording, in which the woman fretted that Kent \u201cobviously has a lot of details if she knows my Instagram account.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of us ever having hooked up,\u201d Emmett responded. \u201cI want you to say \u2014 if she ever tries to get to you, you can say, \u2018Hey, I dated [his assistant].\u2019\u201d\nLater that day, the Florida woman texted a friend, saying she was \u201ctrying to figure out a way to leverage the whole situation to get money\u201d in exchange for \u201cmy silence.\u201d (The Times reviewed the messages.) \u201cI should say some thing like a tabloid came to me with a certain amount of money and they found proof of some sort.\u201d\nA year after an HBO documentary shed new light on sexual abuse allegations against Woody Allen, the director is releasing an essay collection.\nWithin hours, the Florida woman texted her friend that Emmett had offered her as much as $20,000 and said she would be reviewing a \u201clegal document\u201d from him regarding the payment the following day. He had already sent her \u201c$3K for no reason a few minutes ago,\u201d the Florida woman texted.\nThe Times could not determine whether Emmett or his associates made the payments to the Florida woman.\nHofmeister declined to answer The Times\u2019 inquiries about this woman, who did not return requests for comment.\nAfter this story was published, Hofmeister told Page Six: \u201cAs the Times acknowledged, there is zero proof that Randall paid her any money to sign an NDA. In fact, she said just the opposite.\u201d\nRoughly a week later, Kent subpoenaed the Florida woman in her custody battle with Emmett, requesting all text messages between the two. But, according to a Dec. 22 text to her friend, the Florida woman had \u201csigned a[n] agreement\u201d with Emmett saying she wouldn\u2019t show any of her messages, in exchange for \u201ca bunch of stuff from Randal,\u201d she wrote.\nA woman named Grace McCarthy also signed nondisclosure agreements with Emmett.\nIn May, The Times reviewed emails referencing payments from Emmett to McCarthy. She made various allegations about Emmett in an interview and said she had signed several NDAs at Emmett\u2019s behest between 2015 and 2019. She sent two of these purported agreements to The Times, one for $2,700 and another for $7,500.\nAsked to respond to McCarthy\u2019s allegations, Emmett\u2019s lawyer provided a declaration in which McCarthy retracted her statements to The Times, saying that she\u2019d told \u201ca bunch of lies to paint the worst possible picture of Randall.\u201d\nEmmett\u2019s team also provided a sworn statement from one of McCarthy\u2019s friends, Samantha Rakell, claiming that she too had lied to a Times reporter.\nIn McCarthy\u2019s initial interview with The Times, she\u2019d alleged that Emmett had mistreated Rakell.\n\u201cI want to tell the truth before my statements are published in the paper,\u201d Rakell wrote in the declaration sent by Emmett\u2019s team. \u201cBecause I allowed myself to be manipulated by Lala, I lied to Amy Kaufman to make Randall look abusive.\u201d\nBut neither Kaufman nor any Times reporter had ever interviewed Rakell.\n\u2018The Tasmanian devil\u2019\nWithin his inner circle, Emmett commanded grudging respect. Some former subordinates marveled at his hustle and salesmanship. His partner, Furla, once described Emmett as \u201cthe Tasmanian devil.\u201d\nWorking for Emmett had a certain Hollywood appeal \u2014 at first. The producer appeared to relish the role of the demanding boss who shouts to a harried assistant: \u201cGet Ari Emanuel on the phone.\u201d\nBut Emmett\u2019s subordinates also found his behavior alarming. Former employees described him as emotional and volatile. Anna Szymanska, who worked as Emmett\u2019s assistant for about a year before resigning in February, recalled an incident last year after she beat Emmett in a game of pingpong. Emmett threw the paddle so hard at a door in the office that the glass cracked.\n\u201cI was terrified, but I felt like I couldn\u2019t show my fear because I had to be better than that,\u201d said Szymanska, now 24. She provided The Times with a photo of the broken glass as well as a June 2021 invoice documenting a nearly $800 charge to replace it.\nHofmeister told The Times that \u201cRandall never threw a paddle,\u201d but then provided a sworn declaration from one of Emmett\u2019s employees acknowledging the incident occurred. \u201cRandall lost to Anna and threw a paddle. We were all laughing about it, including her,\u201d Sean Stone, Emmett\u2019s assistant-turned-executive, said in the document.\nHollywood assistants have launched a push against low pay. With the hashtag #PayUpHollywood, they are tweeting horror stories. But will the industry notice?\nNumerous former assistants said Emmett demanded 24/7 assistance, frequently called them disparaging names and asked them to transport drugs, deliver payments to women and put large expenses on their personal credit cards.\nMost of Emmett\u2019s staff were men. Several assistants said they were instructed by Emmett\u2019s former lieutenants to avoid selecting women for internships and other positions; one said the reason was \u201cto protect them from Randall.\u201d In the Wilshire Boulevard office, where framed photos of a nude Marilyn Monroe decorated the walls, \u201cbro\u201d culture prevailed, several assistants said.\nSzymanska said in an interview that her boss told her he didn\u2019t like working with women because he felt they weren\u2019t \u201cemotionally strong.\u201d (Emmett denied the allegation.)\nOne night in July 2021, she said he summoned her to his house for an urgent errand around 10 p.m. His blood pressure was low, he said, and he needed coconut water and Muscle Milk to raise his sodium levels.\nDrinks in tow, Szymanska arrived at Emmett\u2019s house about an hour later to find her boss, fully visible through the glass entryway of his home, \u201clying naked on a couch.\u201d\n\u201cI became extremely uncomfortable and disturbed,\u201d she wrote in a declaration filed in the custody proceeding. \u201cWhen I entered, Randall nonchalantly grabbed a pillow to cover his penis.\u201d\nThree months later, she recounted the experience over Facebook Messenger while venting about her job to a friend from her native Poland.\nIn the messages \u2014 which The Times translated from Polish \u2014 Szymanska wrote she had been harassed \u201csexually, mentally, physically and psychologically\u201d during her six months on the job \u2014 including when she saw Emmett \u201clying on the couch naked.\u201d She had also been subjected to seeing him urinate \u201cwith the door open\u201d and \u201che has his back hair shaved in the office on the carpet,\u201d she wrote in the message.\nHofmeister denied these allegations and said Emmett only urinated with the door open when taking a drug test, a requirement in the custody dispute, and \u201cnever intended anyone other than the drug tester to witness him in the bathroom.\u201d She also questioned Szymanska\u2019s credibility, citing a declaration the former assistant gave in support of Emmett\u2019s custody request in January. Szymanska said she made the earlier declaration because Emmett was hounding her about it for months.\n\u201cI was scared about my immigration status, because I needed the job to keep my visa. So I felt obligated,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gave me a talk where he told me what to say about what a good dad he was.\u201d (Hofmeister said Emmett \u201cdid not pressure Anna or suggest topics to cover in her declaration.\u201d)\nNearly three months later, after she left EFO, Szymanska provided a second declaration \u2014 this one in support of Kent \u2014 because she felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to share her \u201cconcerns about what his children are exposed to when left with him for long periods of time.\u201d\nSeveral of Emmett\u2019s former subordinates said they went into debt trying to placate the producer. He asked interns and assistants to cover his expenses \u2014 thousands of dollars in charges \u2014 with their own personal credit cards. (A person close to Emmett said that expenses incurred by assistants \u201cfor Randall\u2019s personal life, in addition to corporate expenses,\u201d were reimbursed.)\nAbout a month into his job at EFO, Martin G\u2019Blae was directed by an EFO executive to send Emmett\u2019s poker chips and his custom poker table to Puerto Rico the following day, according to a text exchange reviewed by The Times. The table weighed 100 pounds, so G\u2019Blae and an intern called FedEx Freight, and G\u2019Blae put the $1,250 charge on his personal card. (The Times reviewed the receipt, bank charge and a photo of the package. A person close to Emmett said G\u2019Blae was reimbursed.)\nThe former assistant said he then hopped on a flight to Puerto Rico to set up the table. Shortly after his arrival, Emmett sent G\u2019Blae and another assistant to his $1,300-a-night suite at the Dorado Beach Ritz-Carlton to retrieve an item from the room\u2019s safe. When the combination didn\u2019t work, G\u2019Blae said he summoned the hotel staff.\n\u201cA security team comes in and they open the safe and then they all just turn away,\u201d G\u2019Blae said. \u201cI look in and see a big bag of cocaine.\u201d\nG\u2019Blae was petrified by the prospect of being caught with drugs.\n\u201cI was in shock \u2014 and disbelief,\u201d he said, noting that, as a Black man, he felt he was being put at an unacceptable risk. \u201cWe had a 30-minute car ride where I was constantly paranoid about getting pulled over by the cops.\u201d\nA second former assistant who accompanied G\u2019Blae that night corroborated the account, saying the drugs looked \u201cbricked up, like they were off a cocaine kilo.\u201d\n\u201cI had seen Randall do lines off a poker table at Sundance [Film Festival] the month before,\u201d this assistant said. \u201cAnd while we were in Puerto Rico, Randall had me carry his drugs around in my sock during a night out and pull them out for him whenever we got to a casino. He offered me some, but I said no.\u201d\nHofmeister declined to comment on the 2020 allegation or discuss alleged past drug use, but emphasized that Emmett has been sober since October 2021.\nEntertainment industry assistants, who for decades have worked long hours with little pay, have in recent years demanded improved working conditions, inspiring a Twitter hashtag #PayUpHollywood.\nThe Times spoke with 10 former assistants; several said they were grappling with the lingering emotional toll of working for Emmett. Some said they\u2019d experienced severe depression, prescription drug abuse and bouts of heavy drinking.\n\u201cRandall was different from being just a mean boss. He made people do dangerous things \u2014 and illegal things,\u201d G\u2019Blae said in May. \u201cYou had to be his punching bag \u2014 and his mule.\u201d\nG\u2019Blae joined EFO in February 2020, when he was 26. He figured he would work hard for a year and earn a few movie credits, boosting his fledgling entertainment career.\nInstead, throughout his nearly eight-month tenure, he said he was excoriated when Emmett\u2019s 2018 Rolls-Royce got stolen, even though Emmett had instructed G\u2019Blae to park the car on Mulholland Drive rather than in his driveway, according to text messages. He got blamed when Emmett\u2019s goldfish died. (Text messages show G\u2019Blae tried to explain that Emmett\u2019s nanny said the fish was fine. \u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d Emmett texted back. \u201cI told you to get doctor ... and now my fish is dead.\u201d)\nG\u2019Blae also got chewed out for buying Emmett\u2019s favorite daily treat \u2014 a $2.25 Toll House ice cream sandwich \u2014 in bulk from Costco rather than the convenience store next door. Emmett tossed one in the trash, saying it wasn\u2019t \u201cfresh.\u201d A person close to Emmett denied these allegations, but a second assistant who was there confirmed the ice cream sandwich incident.\nIn June 2020, G\u2019Blae was tasked with arranging a romantic stay for his boss and Kent at the Beverly Hills Hotel.\nEmmett had asked him to decorate a suite with rose petals, so G\u2019Blae rushed to a Melrose Avenue florist and spent $350 for two bags. Upon arrival at the hotel, a guest services manager let G\u2019Blae into the room, which a second assistant had reserved. G\u2019Blae sprinkled the petals around the room and used them to spell \u201cL A L A\u201d on the bed.\nHe left the room key with a concierge and went home. But when Emmett arrived at the hotel restaurant for a candlelit dinner with Kent, he texted G\u2019Blae demanding the room key. G\u2019Blae replied that it was at the front desk. \u201cI can\u2019t go to front desk,\u201d Emmett texted. G\u2019Blae headed back to the hotel, where staff members told him that Emmett needed to physically provide his credit card. After he relayed this information to Emmett, the producer responded:\n\u201cStop \u2026 Dude my card is maxed,\u201d Emmett responded. \u201cHandle it.\u201d\nForty minutes later, Emmett asked: \u201cMartin where is the key?\u201d\nFearing he might lose his job, G\u2019Blae tried to put the charge \u2014 more than $1,200 \u2014 on his debit card. His bank rejected the transaction. So G\u2019Blae called his mom and begged for money. His mother, Amy Kamara, said she was rattled by the call \u2014 it was nearly midnight in Rhode Island \u2014 but she quickly transferred the money into her son\u2019s account because she feared he was in some danger. (The Times reviewed a copy of his debit charge rejection and the hotel invoice.)\nA source close to Emmett said: \u201cMartin knew he always had the option to contact George Furla to cover expenses, including Randall\u2019s personal ones. Apparently Martin did not use this option.\u201d\nG\u2019Blae, who left after working on \u201cMidnight in the Switchgrass\u201d in September 2020, said he has yet to be fully reimbursed for his expenses. By November 2021, after Hurricane Ida had damaged the roof of his family\u2019s home in Rhode Island, and G\u2019Blae needed money for repairs. He called EFO\u2019s former bookkeeper and began liking a series of old text messages he\u2019d sent about the charges to highlight what he believed he was still owed.\nG\u2019Blae didn\u2019t realize that Emmett was also on the text thread. G\u2019Blae sought reimbursement as Emmett was dealing with other issues: His former girlfriend, Kent, was demanding custody of their daughter; Allred was pressing for a settlement; and EFO\u2019s bank accounts were frozen.\nG\u2019Blae\u2019s phone lit up.\n- Share via\nVoice notes from Randall Emmett to former assistant Martin G\u2019Blae\n\u201cMartin, if you want $50,000 to produce this movie that starts next week, let me know,\u201d he said in the first of four voice notes shared with The Times. \u201cI\u2019m just sad, man. I just really need somebody who could be a friend to me right now.\u201d\nOffended that Emmett was now calling him a friend, G\u2019Blae declined the offer.\nHofmeister in a statement said that G\u2019Blae \u201chas only recently criticized Randall, despite previously speaking about him in glowing terms \u2014 even after leaving EFO.\u201d G\u2019Blae said he had been pleasant because he wanted to leave on good terms.\nSeveral former assistants said they grew weary of the alleged abuse and Emmett\u2019s semiregular threats of termination. \u201cIf you do that again, your fired,\u201d read one typical text. Three former assistants said they also endured insulting remarks such as \u201cyou\u2019re a moron,\u201d \u201cdo something with the zits on your face,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re f\u2014 lazy.\u201d\nWhile on location in Puerto Rico, another former assistant said he was ordered to book an inexpensive hotel room for Emmett and a female companion with his own credit card.\n\u201cThe next morning, he had me go back to his actual room at the Ritz [Carlton], go into his safe and get $1,800 bucks for her,\u201d the former assistant recalled. \u201cYou feel like you have to say \u2018yes\u2019 to everything he says.\u201d\nThe subordinate delivered the payment but apparently made a math error, prompting an irate call from Emmett.\n\u201cHe said I\u2019d overpaid her by $200,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said I was sorry, but he said I was fired, told me to get my stuff and find a flight home.\u201d\nHofmeister said that Emmett \u201chas never fired anyone for mistakenly overpaying a vendor, contractor or employee\u201d and that it is \u201cfalse and misleading to claim that verbally insulting his assistants is a common practice.\u201d\nThe Times interviewed nearly two dozen Black entertainment industry voices, spanning directors, producers, writers, designers, agents and executives. They discussed racism in Hollywood, what needs to change and their frustration with years of talk and little action by powerful companies.\nSeveral past assistants said they were also intimidated by the fact that Emmett had an LAPD officer working for him. In 2019, Emmett hired Eric Halem, a 34-year-old officer at the West Valley station, as a security consultant through a referral from \u201ca member of a concierge company.\u201d Though Halem described himself in a 2019 email as Emmett\u2019s \u201cbusiness and security manager,\u201d in an interview he said he never dealt with the producer\u2019s business.\n\u201cI may have used that descriptor as a ruse or something,\u201d Halem told The Times, adding that he obtained work permits for his consulting gigs through the LAPD. He said his responsibilities included running background checks through a private investigation firm, mediating disputes and responding to threatening parties. Once, he said, he also helped orchestrate the arrest of a man who was threatening Emmett with extortion. The man was later convicted.\nHalem, for his part, described his interactions with Emmett\u2019s staff as \u201cpositive.\u201d\n\u201cI never introduce myself to anyone as a LAPD officer. I always introduce myself as a security consultant,\u201d said Halem, who appeared in small roles in \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d and \u201cMidnight in the Switchgrass.\u201d\nIn January 2020, Halem sent an invoice to Emmett noting that he was to receive a $1,000 tip, \u201cper Randall,\u201d for a \u201cTMZ video.\u201d Asked what the video entailed, Halem responded: \u201cI have a lot of clients. I don\u2019t recall the specific incident.\u201d\nSteve Small, a longtime agent and business affairs executive, joined Emmett\u2019s operation last August after knowing the producer for 20 years. In an interview, Small disputed allegations of an abusive environment, saying that he \u201cnever saw any unprofessional behavior.\u201d\nIn a separate statement, Small, who now serves as film and television president of Emmett\u2019s new company, Convergence Entertainment, said, \u201cDuring my tenure with the company I have never witnessed any verbal insults from Randall to any employees.\u201d\nHe said Emmett and Furla have filled a niche in Hollywood by providing opportunities for aging stars and movies for their fans.\n\u201cRandall and George are trying to create an opportunity for artists and content creators \u2014 actors, writers and directors \u2014 in a very challenging environment for independent filmmakers,\u201d Small said. \u201cAnd I give these guys credit for that.\u201d\nEmmett and Furla\u2019s business model relied heavily on tax credits and paying millions to aging stars and then pushing their films in foreign markets including the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, where audiences remained eager to see American he-men smash bad guys. The bigger the name, the bigger the foreign presales, which meant more investment and more money that everyone \u2014 actors, agents and producers \u2014 could grab.\nAccording to internal emails, Willis\u2019 standard fee was $2 million for two days\u2019 work.\nActors\u2019 contract details:\nOther actors demanded even more, amounts that though not unheard of, were unusually high, according to Hollywood veterans.\nAl Pacino reaped $6 million for working up to 19 production days on \u201cAmerican Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally\u201d in September 2018. Gibson was paid $2 million the following year to act for 10 days in \u201cForce of Nature\u201d and $2 million more to serve as its executive producer, according to internal documents. In August 2020, Stallone\u2019s agent at Creative Artists Agency wrote an email to Emmett approving \u201cthe proposed $8M for four days of work\u201d on an undisclosed project. Through their publicists, Pacino, Gibson and Stallone declined to comment.\nThese actors\u2019 deals included private plane travel, five-star hotel accommodations, a trailer, personal drivers, assistants, their choice of hair and makeup artists and on-set security. Robert De Niro\u2019s deal stood apart.\nThe 78-year-old \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d star demanded $11 million to spend a week in Puerto Rico early last year to film \u201cSavage Salvation,\u201d an Emmett-helmed film about a recovering opioid junkie seeking revenge.\nFees for De Niro, who played a tough cop, ate up half the film\u2019s budget. De Niro\u2019s deal, reviewed by The Times, also included an all-expenses-paid weeklong vacation for his family at Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve. And, if De Niro wanted, EFO was to have the Gulfstream IV jet whisk him and his family off to \u201can additional Caribbean location for an additional vacation up to two weeks.\u201d The family\u2019s expenses, up to $100,000, would be paid by EFO. De Niro\u2019s publicist said the actor had no comment.\nDe Niro\u2019s talent agency, CAA, has long embraced Emmett and Furla. Most of the top talent in EFO movies, including Willis, were represented by CAA, which declined comment.\nEFO made hefty payments to actors even as it struggled to meet payroll and pay for crew meals and other costs on location, according to three film crew members.\nThe investors\nWealthy investors eager to play in Hollywood were attracted by Emmett\u2019s list of film credits and proximity to power.\nEFO\u2019s financiers over the years have been an eclectic mix. They included film studio Lionsgate and two London film financing groups, Ingenious Media and the Fyzz Facility. A decade ago, investors with ties to the Russian oil industry provided tens of millions of dollars for Emmett\u2019s films.\nInternal records show that Emmett also turned to multimillionaires outside of the entertainment world, including Jacksonville, Fla., entrepreneur Thomas M. Leonard; a former Hollywood tequila bar owner/real estate investor/filmmaker, Ted Fox; grandson of the late billionaire founder of Conair Corp. and actor Sergio Rizzuto; and, until about 2015, the head of an Atlanta-area healthcare staffing firm, Richard L. Jackson.\nIn recent years, Emmett\u2019s most generous investor has been Meadow Williams, an actress who primarily had small parts in shows like \u201cMurder, She Wrote,\u201d until she became romantically involved with the founder of Nature\u2019s Plus vitamins, Gerald Kessler.\nWilliams, who inherited a reported $800 million when her 80-year-old husband Kessler died in 2015, has invested heavily in Emmett\u2019s projects.\nBoth she and her boyfriend, Swen Temmel, typically would be assured roles in the film projects she helped to finance, according to contracts reviewed by The Times. Williams did not respond to requests for comment.\nWilliams also allowed Emmett to shoot films on her 554-acre ranch near Santa Ynez, the former retreat of McDonald\u2019s founder Ray Kroc.\nIn turn, Emmett and Furla tried to give their wealthy benefactor the star treatment, allowing Williams to pursue her acting dreams. She starred in the Emmett- and Furla-produced \u201cAmerican Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally,\u201d a story about a U.S.-born broadcaster who dished Nazi propaganda in Germany during World War II.\nWilliams invested $9 million in the project, according to internal documents; much of it went toward securing Pacino as her co-star.\nBut the veteran actor had some qualms, according to an email he wrote to Emmett in June 2019. After shooting wrapped on the $18-million film, Pacino complained that Williams was interfering with director Michael Polish\u2019s creative process.\nEmmett insisted that Williams needed to have \u201cher voice heard\u201d because \u201cshe wrote the check.\u201d\nPacino countered. \u201cMy thought Randall is very simple. She is not a professional. ... Someone has to say back off a second dear, we\u2019re completing the film still, take a look when it\u2019s ready,\u201d according to a 2019 email.\nThe actor suggested adding another shooting day \u201cto help [Williams] give a better performance.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s do this Randall. I\u2019m not going for the A\u2019s or the B\u2019s. I\u2019m going for something between C and B,\u201d Pacino wrote to Emmett. \u201cI don\u2019t like Ds. And, as long as you put the effort in with what you know about filmmaking and Michael too I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to a B-. And that\u2019s good enough for me, if it\u2019s good enough for you.\u201d\nPacino\u2019s publicist said the actor had no comment. \u201cRandall would never comment on his personal interactions with his actors,\u201d Hofmeister said.\nAnother longtime business partner of Emmett\u2019s, 50 Cent, turned on him in April 2019.\nEmmett and Jackson\u2019s relationship went back to 2008, when the producer put the performer in the 2008 film \u201cRighteous Kill\u201d with De Niro and Pacino. The two formed their own production company, Cheetah Vision, and in 2014 became producers on \u201cPower.\u201d\nBut in April 2019, Jackson announced on Instagram that Emmett had owed him $1 million and mocked his relationship with then-fiancee Kent. \u201cMoney by Monday Randall,\u201d Jackson demanded on Instagram.\nEmmett pleaded for Jackson\u2019s mocking posts to stop, but mistakenly called him \u201cFofty\u201d instead of \u201cFifty.\u201d Jackson just posted Emmett\u2019s texts.\nThe feud ended a few days later as a result of a settlement agreement, which was reviewed by The Times. Jackson agreed to delete the negative remarks and Emmett had to post a public apology, which also noted that Emmett had paid the debt.\nEmmett was required to stay clear of Jackson on a different Starz crime drama the pair produced, \u201cBMF: Black Mafia Family.\u201d The agreement did permit Emmett to attend the show\u2019s red carpet premiere, as long as he remained 100 feet from Jackson and refrained from joining group photos.\nThrough his publicist, Jackson declined to comment; Hofmeister said Emmett would not \u201cdiscuss the business matters of others.\u201d\nMonths later, Emmett learned \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d cast members talked about the \u201cFofty\u201d dust-up during the show\u2019s taping. Emmett reached out to Ron Meyer, then-vice chairman of NBCUniversal, which owns \u201cVanderpump\u201d network Bravo, and begged him to quash the segment.\n\u201cIf they mention him anywhere in this show \u2026 the antics will start Again which could Destroy my career,\u201d Emmett wrote in an October 2019 email.\nIn exchange for the favor, Emmett told Meyer he would thank him \u201cfor real\u201d from the Oscars stage if \u201cThe Irishman\u201d won best picture. Soon, Meyer\u2019s assistant sent an email, saying, \u201cRon would like to get\u201d six tickets reserved for the Scorsese film\u2019s premiere. Two were for his neighbor, and the rest were for private detective Anthony Pellicano. Emmett and Meyer declined to comment.\nClashes over money\nEmmett\u2019s career seemed to be soaring in 2019.\nThat fall, Netflix was releasing \u201cThe Irishman.\u201d And Emmett was swinging for the fences with his production of a $45-million time travel movie with Gibson and Frank Grillo called \u201cBoss Level.\u201d He was also putting together a TV series based on Schwarzenegger\u2019s early years in Venice Beach. \u201cThe Terminator\u201d himself was expected to have an on-screen role in \u201cPump.\u201d\nBut that spring, the facade began to crumble.\nOn March 9, 2019, Emmett and Furla received an email from a key financier with the subject line: \u201cDebts.\u201d\nIn the email, the British executive wrote that EFO owed: \u201cTOTAL $8,250,000 PLUS INTEREST. This is a serious amount of capital \u2026 I get calls every day from my investors on most of these loans \u2026 What\u2019s the plan?\u201d (A person close to the matter said much of the loan had been repaid.)\nThat October, additional financiers turned up the heat.\nCharles Auty, managing director of the Fyzz Facility \u2014 a group of wealthy British financiers who once lent money freely to EFO \u2014 had learned Emmett was coming to London for \u201cThe Irishman\u201d premiere. He suggested a meeting, but Emmett initially balked.\nIn an Oct. 10, 2019, email, Auty warned that Emmett risked sending \u201ca very dismissive and negative message to all of our investors to whom you guys owe in excess of $30 million in principal alone.\u201d Emmett needed to show up, Auty said in a follow-up email, \u201cto let the investor see you\u2019re there grinding away getting movies made.\u201d (Emmett met with the financiers, emails show. A person close to Emmett said his firm currently owes about $17 million in loan principal.)\nAuty declined to comment.\nFyzz Facility in May sued in Los Angeles County Superior Court for $10 million, alleging that Emmett and Furla used its funds without authorization, including allowing CAA to transfer $1.25 million from the loan advance without Fyzz\u2019s approval, to actor Gerard Butler\u2019s company for a movie, \u201cMexicali.\u201d But the film has not been made, and Emmett declined to comment.\nEFO has yet to file a response to the suit.\nAlso in the fall of 2019, the Schwarzenegger project, \u201cPump,\u201d was deflating.\nEmmett had hired four guild writers that year to develop scripts for a TV series loosely based on Schwarzenegger\u2019s early years in California, according to internal emails and interviews. Writers said they envisioned \u201cPump\u201d as a love letter to Venice Beach in the early 1970s and the birth of the modern bodybuilding culture. In a September 2019 meeting that included the writers and Schwarzenegger, the former California governor seemed enthusiastic. \u201cPump\u201d would showcase his immigrant story.\nHuang, one of the writers, recalled a separate September 2019 pitch session with producers. \u201cWe do the pitch and Randall loves it. He\u2019s \u2026 clapping and cheering the whole time. He was like, yeah, this is great. Now we can get Arnold on board.\u2019\u201d\nHuang was stunned: \u201cThat was when we learned that Arnold hadn\u2019t signed anything.\u201d\nThe writers said they previously had been told that Schwarzenegger and Emmett were producing the series, and that Emmett would shop it to a streaming service. That seemed odd, Huang said, because producers typically line up agreements and a buyer before producing episodes \u201cbecause it\u2019s so expensive to make television.\u201d\nBut, Huang said, \u201cwe were told Randall has these investors who just write him checks.\u201d\nJames van der Woerd had provided a $750,000 loan for \u201cPump\u201d in August 2019. A lawsuit brought by his Canadian firm, 902878 Ontario Ltd., alleges that Emmett assured him that Schwarzenegger was committed to the project and that his money would go toward the actor\u2019s fees and to hire writers.\nVan der Woerd didn\u2019t see his money again, according to his civil fraud and breach of contract lawsuit seeking $1 million. The loan was \u201cused by defendants to pay themselves exorbitant producer fees,\u201d the suit alleges. Van der Woerd declined to comment. Emmett declined to comment but disputes the claims.\nBy mid-October, writers and insiders felt the project was probably doomed when they learned Schwarzenegger had switched to United Talent Agency from CAA, which declined to comment. Martin Singer, a Schwarzenegger attorney, said the star had bowed out due to \u201cscheduling problems.\u201d\nThat November, payments to the writers stopped. One of the writers, Patrick Moss, camped out in the lobby of Emmett\u2019s Wilshire Boulevard building until one of Emmett\u2019s lieutenants, Tim Sullivan, brought down a check.\nBut finances were tight.\n\u201cWe\u2019re short about $14,000,\u201d Sullivan wrote in a group email Nov. 22, 2019. \u201cI\u2019ll put in 7 k george can put in 7 k,\u201d Emmett replied. But Furla disagreed: \u201cNot my account. I just wired money to pay efo salaries.\u201d\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, the writers still hadn\u2019t been fully paid, nor had EFO made contributions to WGA West\u2019s health and pension fund.\n\u201cHere we were, sitting in the middle of the pandemic,\u201d Moss said. \u201cThe message that [Emmett] was sending was that my family and my kids didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nThe WGA West filed for arbitration and advised its 10,000 members against working with EFO. The guild won an arbitration award against the firm that, with interest, now exceeds $588,000.\n\u201cThey have not paid a cent ... And on Instagram, you see that Randall leads this lavish lifestyle \u2014 flying in private jets, going to pickleball tournaments at La Quinta and constantly staying at these lavish resorts.\u201d\n\u2014 WGA West attorney Leila Azari\n\u201cThey have not paid a cent,\u201d said WGA West attorney Leila Azari. \u201cAnd on Instagram, you see that Randall leads this lavish lifestyle \u2014 flying in private jets, going to pickleball tournaments at La Quinta and constantly staying at these lavish resorts.\u201d\nA person close to Emmett said EFO\u2019s attempts to settle with a payment plan had not succeeded. Azari said the attempts were \u201cnothing more than bad faith legal maneuvers to try and evade\u201d the ruling against them.\nSince 2010, more than 30 lawsuits have been filed against Emmett and Furla, and a half-dozen more against Emmett. American Express sued Emmett for $393,756; the case was settled with a payment plan, court records show. Last year, Emmett repaid nearly $400,000 in debt to the IRS.\nFinanciers and fellow producers have hit Emmett and Furla with a barrage of lawsuits that allege fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract and personal enrichment at the expense of others. Emmett and Furla, who dispute the allegations, declined to comment on pending litigation.\nTwo lawsuits have raised concerns about the partners paying themselves excessive fees, including on projects that were abandoned. (Company records show that Emmett\u2019s fees in recent years were as high as $1.2 million a film.) Loans made to Emmett and Furla \u201cwere not utilized for their intended purpose,\u201d according to a February lawsuit filed by European banker Arnaud Lannic, one of the Fyzz Facility investors.\nLannic\u2019s investment firm, Shiny River, provided more than $7 million in loans from 2015 through mid-2016 in part to finance seven movies, but half of those projects were never made. (With interest, Lannic\u2019s attorney said, the debt at issue in the pending lawsuit now exceeds $14 million.)\nRather than investing in their business, Emmett and Furla paid themselves rich producer fees to \u201cmeet their extravagant living expenses,\u201d Shiny River alleged in the suit. Lannic, through his attorney, declined to comment.\nThe Shiny River suit also said that during a 2018 meeting at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York, Furla led Fyzz investors to believe that EFO was good for the money and its film library was worth around $9.6 million.\nBut, since then, an appraiser hired by Lannic \u201cconcluded that the EFO film library is worth, at best, only $2.1 million.\u201d\nEmmett and Furla declined to comment on Lannic\u2019s lawsuit.\nTwo years ago, Emmett and Furla began hunting for new partners and engaged in preliminary sales talks with Lionsgate, their longtime distribution partner. But the deal, referred to internally as \u201cProject X,\u201d never materialized.\nSoon, the pair thought they\u2019d found a new financial savior \u2014 New York investment firm Forest Road. An internal 2020 deal memo, reviewed by The Times, showed the firm considered paying $12 million for preferred EFO shares. But Forest Road, which declined to comment, withdrew.\nBy mid-2021, EFO was teetering. Filmmaking costs had soared due to the pandemic.\nThe producers moved out of their Wilshire Boulevard offices, leaving a debt of $336,000 in unpaid rent, parking and phone fees, according to an October lawsuit. (The landlord\u2019s attorney declined to comment.) \u201cWe fail to see how Randall\u2019s dispute differs from the numerous lease disputes resulting from Covid,\u201d Hofmeister said.\nMeanwhile, a Beverly Hills entrepreneur, filmmaker and investor, Jonathan Baker, was still steamed that Emmett allegedly reneged on a 2015 agreement for a two-picture deal. They made one film \u201cInconceivable,\u201d starring Nicolas Cage, which Baker directed, but their dealings soured. Baker sued in 2017 to try to get his $1-million investment back and reluctantly agreed to a $640,000 settlement.\nBut Emmett and Furla paid only a fraction of that amount, and in December 2020 L.A. County Superior Court Judge Craig D. Karlan ordered them to pay $570,855, according to a judgment. A person close to Emmett and Furla disputed Baker\u2019s allegations and said negotiations have been complicated by Baker\u2019s desire to include production of a second film in any resolution. Baker said they wanted him to first invest an additional $1 million.\n\u201cRandy and George prey on people with empty promises and they have only one thing in mind: Extract millions upon millions of dollars only to be told you will never work in this town again if you stand up to them,\u201d Baker said.\nIn March 2021, Baker\u2019s attorney, Joseph Kar, won a court order to freeze the EFO bank accounts. But just before the freeze went into effect, Furla withdrew $125,090 from the company\u2019s accounts, according to court testimony.\n\u201cThat\u2019s problematic to say the least,\u201d Karlan said at a hearing this year. Furla had told Kar during a court-ordered examination that he had been unaware the freeze was imminent. \u201cWhen money comes in, why should it just sit there?\u201d Furla asked. (He declined to comment.)\nWhen finances were tight, Szymanska said she often heard Emmett and Furla discussing making \u201canother bull\u2014 Bruce Willis movie.\u201d Emmett denies that he made such remarks, Hofmeister said.\nOne of the last films the company made with the actor was \u201cWrong Place,\u201d for which Willis spent two days on set in Alabama. His two associates \u2014 his producing partner, Stephen J. Eads, and Adam Huel Potter, who fed lines to Willis through an earpiece \u2014 guided him.\n\u201cHe was never alone,\u201d said Szymanska, who spent time on location. \u201cWhen nobody from Bruce\u2019s team was around, the crew would say how sad we were to see him in this state.\u201d\nFive months later, the actor\u2019s family would disclose his aphasia diagnosis.\nEads and Potter did not respond to questions from The Times about their work with Willis. The actor\u2019s attorney, Singer, said that his client relying on Eads and others was similar to \u201cStevie Wonder having an assistant lead him on stage to perform, or Marlee Matlin\u2019s reliance on a sign language interpreter[.] My client allegedly relying on Stephen Eads or others to provide certain assistance is in the same vein. ... It ought to be commended.\u201d\nEmmett was barely on the \u201cWrong Place\u201d set, according to crew members. After a brief appearance, he traveled from Birmingham, Ala., to Nashville, where onlookers would snap those now-infamous pictures of him out on the town with women who were not his fiancee. On Oct. 27, 12 days after the images surfaced, Kent moved out of the house on Mulholland Drive, her 7-month-old daughter in her arms.\nAs his custody battle began, Emmett continued to fight Baker\u2019s claims in court. In a hearing in late May, A. Raymond Hamrick III, a longtime lawyer for Furla and Emmett, rejected allegations that the pair had created a web of limited liability shell companies to shield themselves and their film titles from creditors.\n\u201cThis was not a shell. This was an active company [but] COVID gutted them,\u201d Hamrick told the judge. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t produce for two years because of COVID.\u201d\nBut the pair filmed at least eight movies during the pandemic, including \u201cWrong Place.\u201d\nBaker\u2019s attorney, Kar, has continued to press his case that Emmett and Furla should be held personally liable for their debt.\n\u201cThe company doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d Emmett told Kar in a late April deposition. \u201cThere\u2019s no employees, there\u2019s no money for overhead, there\u2019s no money \u2014 you know, we got hit really bad in COVID and had substantial overages on movies and liabilities the company has taken on and just couldn\u2019t survive anymore.\u201d\nEmmett said he had \u201cresigned\u201d from EFO to start a new venture: a new company called Convergence Entertainment. Emmett put his Mulholland Drive home on the market in May for $6.3 million. He also moved back into his old Wilshire Boulevard office building \u2014 despite the litigation over unpaid rent.\n\u201cI just wanted office space \u2026 to be able to get jobs as a director,\u201d Emmett told Kar. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on now.\u201d\nOn Friday Emmett wrapped production on the Georgia set of a new bank heist movie called \u201cCash Out.\u201d\nIt stars John Travolta.\nTimes staff researchers Scott Wilson and Cary Schneider contributed to this report.

      "text": "- Share via\nCall forth the mourners from far and wide.\nAnd remind them to bring their chainsaws.\nWe gather to prepare ourselves to bid a frond farewell to Los Angeles\u2019 palm trees.\nLos Angeles knows how to weather a crisis \u2014 or two or three. Angelenos are tapping into that resilience, striving to build a city for everyone.\nDon\u2019t freak out. This isn\u2019t an alert about any wholesale dying of palms. Not all of them, anyway, and not right away. But Ecclesiastes got it right about everything having a season, \u201ca time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.\u201d\nThe season \u2014 the long, long winning season \u2014 for so many of our palm trees is running its course. Our exotic, come-hither, haphazard forest is being slowly timed out.\nWe stand at an inflection point for L.A., after the fires, in the grip of climate change, recalibrating our future right down to the roots. Literally to the roots. Uncounted thousands of trees burned in the fires. Thousands more are getting thinned out by disease and drought and age. How do we replace our geriatric urban forest with more and better trees?\nOriginal L.A. was not the forest primeval. It was a landscape of scrubby shrubs and chaparral and grasses. What native trees there were grew alongside water, which flowed abundantly, if seasonally, until we took over the land and dried up the waterways.\nPalm trees came to town with the missionaries, for religious ceremonies, and then, decades later, with the great PR sales pitch of Southern California being the \u201cAmerican Mediterranean,\u201d which demanded the right set dressing \u2014 palm trees.\nA veteran of the advertising business recalls a trick New Yorkers used to employ to get a trip to Los Angeles.\nThe City Beautiful movement of the 1910s and1920s and the glories of the 1932 Olympics stuck thousands of trees of all kinds into the ground to adorn public L.A. All they had to do was look good; to fret over drought or heat was treason.\nAngelenos\u2019 faith that pretty much anything could grow here was usually right. The unlikeliest tree cuttings from the world over were carried here, adapted and came to elbow out the locals.\nThus, Los Angeles became a tree zoo.\nNow it\u2019s time to make it a tree ark, and not every species should make it aboard.\nClimate change changes cities. We can no longer afford freeloader trees, however glamorous. Palms suck down water like camels, but give back barely enough leafiness to shade a Hula-Hoop. Falling fronds can deliver a mean whack, and during fires, palms light up like a flare.\nThe nonprofit TreePeople has been trying to prep us for this for years.\nBryan Vejar is a master arborist who directs community forestry for TreePeople, and, yes, in fact, he does have a few thoughts on the topic, and this is the moment we need to hear them, so take it away, Mr. Vejar:\n\u201cTrees are not some cosmetic thing, some ornament. They\u2019re also critical infrastructure, like traffic signs and traffic lights. They have tremendous value for the health and safety of the community.\u201d\n\u201cWe should be planting trees that serve a greater range of ecological benefits. There\u2019s not just one clear answer. The trees we plant now have to be climate-adaptive for weather forecasts for 50 and 60 years.\u201d\n\u201cNative trees also support local wildlife, specifically ones endemic to our geographical biome. Pollinators, nesting birds, migratory birds and other species rely on them.\u201d\nCities are being urged to expand their urban tree canopy to mitigate the effects of climate change, but some are replacing mature shady trees with palms.\n\u201cNot a lot of trees check every box. You want trees that are very durable and very resilient, that can endure many different soil types in any given community.\u201d\nAll right, then. What\u2019s in, and what\u2019s out once we cart away old trees and/or plant new ones?\nOut: most palms. And don\u2019t replace them with something like crape myrtle, which is pretty but doesn\u2019t offer much shade for the space it takes up.\nMost eucalyptus, out. They\u2019re invasive below ground and tiki torches above.\nSweet gums, out; They\u2019re also invasive, triggering allergies, and dropping nasty, spiky balls like alien spoor. (Some trees appear on a city-approved list, but TreePeople gives them a \u201cbranches-down.\u201d)\nI share Vejar\u2019s loathing for the relentless \u201ctree of heaven,\u201d the deciduous plant that is sometimes called a stinking sumac. You see it everywhere; it not only crowds out natives, it also poisons the soil to kill off the competition and ruins biodiversity. Its leaves can also kill your dog. If you see one in your garden, kill it before it kills us.\nVejar\u2019s \u201cins\u201d include native oaks and some sycamores, black walnut trees, desert willows, drought-tolerant African sumac and Chinese pistache.\nFicus trees scrub away air pollution and cast vast shade, something vital when an urban forest can lower temperatures by 10 or 20 degrees. Ideal, right? Yet cities planted them unwisely alongside sidewalks, which their mature roots now crack and split.\n\u201cThe thing that makes it a workhorse for urban forests,\u201d says Vejar, \u201cis also what makes cities have to pay out millions in lawsuits from people tripping, ADA violations and such.\u201d\nSo, suppose the palms do take their last bow? Which understudy is ready to step onstage as our new arboreal star? Oaks and sycamores are too generic. Orange trees? Memento mori.\nBut the jacaranda \u2014 now there\u2019s beauty. Fast-growing, generous with shade, drought-tolerant and soil-forgiving. Bees and butterflies love them. And did I mention beautiful? That ultraviolet haze shimmering around a blossoming jacaranda delivers a moment of transcendent enchantment.\nSo what if the fallen petals are sticky? It\u2019s a small toll paid to glory. Like a wad of gum dropped on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."

      "text": "The next \u2018Big One\u2019 on the San Andreas fault might not be the earthquake we expect, researchers say\n- Share via\n- A new report studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault.\n- While the recent quake could hold vital clues for California\u2019s next \u201cBig One,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author notes that, \u201cEarthquakes never come back exactly the same way.\u201d\nWhat could the next mega-earthquake on California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault look like?\nWould it be a repeat of 1857, when an earthquake estimated at magnitude 7.7 to 7.9 ruptured the fault from Monterey County all the way through Los Angeles County? Would it be more akin to the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which began just offshore of the city and ruptured in two directions, toward Humboldt County and Santa Cruz County?\nDon\u2019t bet on an identical sequel.\nThat\u2019s the implication of a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The report, coauthored by scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to the San Andreas.\nThe earthquake ended up rupturing a much longer section of the fault than scientists expected, given the seismology of the region.\nThe implications of this study are that \u201cearthquakes never come back exactly the same way,\u201d Solene L. Antoine, a postdoctoral fellow at Caltech and the study\u2019s lead author, said in an interview.\n\u201cIt came as a surprise that you could get such a long rupture,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a coauthor of the study and a professor of geology and mechanical and civil engineering at Caltech.\nMarch\u2019s Mandalay earthquake devastated Myanmar, killing at least 3,791 people and an additional 63 people in Thailand. High-rise buildings were damaged as far away as Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and homes were damaged in the Ruili area of China. Damage was estimated at $1.9 billion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nIt was the most powerful earthquake in Myanmar in at least 79 years.\nThe magnitude 7.7 earthquake ruptured an astonishing 317 miles of the Sagaing fault, a finding based on Antoine\u2019s analysis of satellite data showing earth movement after the quake. That\u2019s the longest seismic rupture ever documented on a continent.\nBy comparison, California\u2019s 1906 earthquake ruptured 296 miles of the San Andreas fault; and the 1857 earthquake, 225 miles. Longer seismic ruptures have been found only on subduction megathrusts deep underneath the ocean.\nWhat\u2019s clear from the study is that while California\u2019s next \u201cBig One\u201d may share some characteristics of previously documented devastating quakes, it\u2019s unlikely to be an exact replay. As the recent experience in Myanmar shows, even well-documented faults can behave in surprising ways.\nThe next step is to develop a model simulating earthquakes over many millennia for the San Andreas fault, which the authors plan to do in the future. But the San Andreas fault \u201cis far more complex,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to come soon, because it\u2019s quite a heavy calculation.\u201d\nStill, such simulations would provide a model of \u201call possible scenarios so that we have a better view of the range of possible ruptures that could happen.\u201d\nFor instance, maybe the San Andreas fault will rupture in smaller, separate earthquakes, Avouac said.\nOr it could be a much larger earthquake \u2014 rupturing the fault not just from Monterey to Los Angeles counties, but perhaps all the way into San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, which would possibly exceed magnitude 8. Such a quake would be the largest simultaneous disaster in modern California history, with huge swaths of the state wracked by powerful seismic shaking all at once.\nBy comparison, the 1994 Northridge earthquake\u2019s footprint was relatively constrained, severely affecting only a portion of Los Angeles County, especially the San Fernando Valley \u2014 related to its relatively smaller magnitude of 6.7.\nBut while modeling previous activity on the San Andreas fault will provide a glimpse into the wide range of possible outcomes, it will not pinpoint precisely when the next great quake will strike.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just expect the exact same thing to happen,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIt is a matter of just showing what scenarios are possible, the diversity of scenarios and seeing what are the consequences of each of those scenarios.\u201d\nSometimes, Avouac said, \u201cit\u2019s quiet for a long time, nothing happens ... stress is building up, the fault is locked for a long time, nothing happens, and then, boom, you have a large earthquake.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then you have other periods during which you have a lot of [seismic] activity, but these earthquakes are all smaller,\u201d Avouac said.\nBut \u201csmaller\u201d earthquakes, in the minds of researchers, are still big to the layperson. In the study\u2019s simulations, there are periods where earthquakes around magnitude 7.7 are common. In other periods, earthquakes max out at magnitude 7.5 or so, but are more frequent.\nThe entire length of the Sagaing fault \u2014 including areas that didn\u2019t rupture in the March earthquake \u2014 is 750 miles, north to south, from the Himalayas to the Andaman Sea, and helps accommodate the northward push of the Indian tectonic plate.\nThe fact that 317 miles of the Sagaing fault ruptured in March was surprising to scientists. Only about 170 miles had been quiet seismically for more than a century, having last ruptured in 1839.\nScientists call these \u201cseismic gaps\u201d \u2014 particular areas of a fault that haven\u2019t recently ruptured.\nGenerally, scientists would\u2019ve expected only this long-dormant 170-mile piece of the Sagaing fault to rupture, Avouac said, but not more recently ruptured sections. That includes a 100-mile stretch that ruptured in large earthquakes in 1929 and 1930, and a 50-mile stretch that went off in a pair of quakes in 1946 and 1956.\nInstead, even those fault segments ruptured in the big March earthquake.\nSo what gives?\nA possible explanation is the Sagaing fault\u2019s extraordinary smoothness. \u201cAnd people have observed that when the fault is very smooth, the rupture ... tends to propagate at a velocity\u201d so fast that it results in an \u201cextremely elongated rupture,\u201d Avouac said.\nThe study also published the results of a computer model simulation looking at how earthquakes might rupture along sections of the entire 750-mile long Sagaing fault. The code, developed by study coauthor Kyungjae Im of Caltech, suggests that over a hypothetical 1,400-year period, there would be no repeatable patterns.\nIn other words, earthquakes didn\u2019t seem to re-occur like clockwork, rupturing the same stretch of fault in a repeatable, predictable pattern.\n\u201cThere is complexity here. And this is because each time you have an earthquake, it redistributes the stress on the fault, which is going to influence the next earthquake,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cThere\u2019s a self-induced complexity in the process, and that leads to a bit of randomness.\u201d\nThere is one certainty, which is bound to disappoint anyone who shares the hope that a \u201cBig One\u201d simply won\u2019t ever strike California again.\n\u201cThere will be an earthquake at some point,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIf there is stress building up on the fault, the fault won\u2019t hold forever.\u201d\nFurther research and observations are essential to refine models of future possible earthquakes, including from the Sentinel satellites, which are operated by the European Space Agency, the authors said.\nThe other coauthors of the study are Rajani Shrestha and Chris Milliner of Caltech; Chris Rollins of Earth Sciences New Zealand; Kang Wang of the Washington-based EarthScope Consortium; and Kejie Chen of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China."

      "text": "Agents detain student at gunpoint near school; safe zones to be expanded around LAUSD campuses\n- Share via\n- L.A. school district and city officials announce measures to keep schools safe amid immigration raids.\n- A key strategy is to maintain \u2014 as much as possible \u2014 safe zones near schools.\n- Immigration agents on Monday detained a disabled 15-year-old student at gunpoint outside a high school.\nLos Angeles school district police, staff and community volunteers will form protective perimeters around at least 100 schools when classes begin Thursday to help ensure the safe passage of children \u2014 an announcement that came on a day that immigration agents reportedly handcuffed, detained and drew their guns on a student outside Arleta High School in a case of mistaken identity.\nThe 15-year-old boy, a student with disabilities, was at Arleta High School on Monday with family members \u2014 he attends a different district school \u2014 when federal agents detained him, L.A. Unified School District officials said. Family members intervened and, after a few tense moments, the agents released the boy. The school\u2019s principal also came out to assess the situation. Agents left behind some bullets on the sidewalk, apparently by mistake, which were collected by school police.\n\u201cSuch actions \u2014 violently detaining a child just outside a public school \u2014 are absolutely reprehensible and should have no place in our country,\u201d school board member Kelly Gonez, who represents Arleta High, said in a social media post.\nA spokesperson from the Department of Homeland Security could not immediately be reached for comment.\nAcross Los Angeles Unified, parents, teachers and staff have expressed deep fears about school safety amid immigration raids. Citywide, leaders are concerned that children whose parents are living in the country without legal status will be kept home as families grapple with the climate of fear.\nL.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho spoke Monday at a news conference with Mayor Karen Bass near district headquarters. He said the district is doubling down on efforts to protect students and families by creating and expanding \u201csafe zones\u201d around campuses, before and after school, and that everyone must come together to protect the most vulnerable.\n\u201cThere are no sidewalks for immigrants and separate sidewalks for everybody else,\u201d Carvalho said. \u201cEverybody walks the same journey to school and everybody walks ... back home.\u201d\nFor the first day, Carvalho will deploy central and regional office staff across the school system, an effort mirrored by organizers in the teachers union, who are gathering volunteers to patrol the streets around schools. Safe passage zones have been expanded from about 40 at the start of the prior school year to more than 100. The school district has close to 1,000 campuses.\nThese safety zones \u2014 and school police patrols \u2014 will target areas most affected by immigration enforcement.\nBass was not specific about what role the Los Angeles Police Department would play.\n\u201cThe school police and the Los Angeles Police Department have a strong working relationship and will continue to share information as appropriate as needed,\u201d Bass said. \u201cBut neither police departments assist with immigration enforcement and have not for many, many years. There will be adults in the community who will serve as eyes and ears on the street.\u201d\nAlso speaking at the news conference were mayors from South Gate, Huntington Park, Bell, West Hollywood and Vernon.\nLos Angeles Unified covers an area totaling 710 square miles, which includes most of the city of Los Angeles and takes in all or portions of 25 other cities and unincorporated areas.\n\u201cThe Bell Police Department will be patrolling throughout the City of Bell at all our schools,\u201d Mayor Ali Saleh said. \u201cI will definitely be there myself to make sure that our students are protected and make sure that they\u2019re able to go from their homes to school and protected.\u201d\nVernon Mayor Leticia Lopez said officers will be \u201cmonitoring traffic around the school before and after, with special attention to crosswalks for children.\u201d Police will be \u201cmaking periodic visits to the campus throughout the day to offer a visible public safety presence, and ... responding to calls for service at the school on behalf of the LAUSD Police Department, allowing LAUSD officers to focus on other campuses.\u201d\nAlthough local police are not legally allowed to stop or interfere with federal law enforcement actions, authorities will alert parents along walking routes if agents are in the area. Also, they will trigger a communication chain to alert all nearby campuses of raids so that schools can be locked down as necessary.\nThe public commitment was intended to reassure families that school will be a safe place and that officials also will do what they can to protect families on their way to and from campuses.\nIn a string of recent appearances, Carvalho has reviewed measures taken by the nation\u2019s second-largest school system.\nThese included home visits or calls in recent weeks to more than 10,000 families considered at risk of immigration enforcement or at risk of not coming to school. The school system also is distributing family preparedness packets \u2014 \u201call the information in one single form, in a multitude of languages,\u201d said Carvalho, with the goal of \u201cexplaining the rights of our children and their parents, but also providing easy access to the resources that we have available to all of them.\u201d\nThe district also has created a \u201ccompassion fund\u201d to provide general help for families, including legal assistance.\nIn addition to students from immigrant families, the school system has more than 350 employees who are working legally but who could have their legal status revoked.\n\u201cThey continue to be ... valiant, productive workers,\u201d Carvalho said last week.\nThe district is working to reroute buses to make transportation more accessible to families. For the most part, the busing system is used by students with disabilities \u2014 for whom transportation is legally required \u2014 and students attending magnet programs at campuses far from where they live.\nBut this could change when the parameter for riding a bus is safety. In this light, neighborhood proximity to bus stops matters a lot, because families can be exposed to immigration enforcement while traveling to and from a stop.\nThe buses themselves will be considered an extension of the campus environment and federal agents will not be permitted to board them.\nCarvalho also acknowledged that immigration agents cannot be denied entry if they have a valid judicial warrant for an individual, although these are rare.\nThe Monday news conference took place at Roybal Learning Center, just west of downtown. That facility also serves as the headquarters of the L.A. Unified School Police Department, which is expected to have a role in monitoring immigration enforcement and potentially confronting it."
