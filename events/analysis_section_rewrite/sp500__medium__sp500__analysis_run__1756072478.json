      "feedback": "The draft is on the right track but needs a sharper, fully‑structured 3–6 month scenario map with explicit catalysts, timing, and invalidations, plus tighter first‑principles framing and precise numbers. Actionable edits: 1) Build a formal causal chain: AI cycle (Nvidia-led, AI‑30 list expansion to include CrowdStrike, Roblox, GE Vernova, Nebius; Adobe/C3.ai dropped) drives datacenter hardware/software demand, power usage, and cybersecurity spending, which should be tied to equity signals in AI/infra and value/low‑vol names; anchor this with a hard, quantifiable power-demand backdrop (945 TWh data‑center electricity forecast by 2030, from the AI‑centric article) and link to valuation/multiples for AI infra plays. 2) Quantify catalysts with sources: Coca‑Cola/Costa Coffee bid‑price (~£2B sale value) and Costa’s 2023/2024 sales (£1.22B in 2023) to frame the growth/exit risk; GM’s $4B US manufacturing investment and capacity commentary (2M vehicles/year) as a near‑term capex impulse; Disney’s Jan 4, 2026 last‑call for old perk and rollout of Lightning Lane per stay as a pricing/experience pivot; tariff/auto policy shifts (Trump‑era tariffs) as near‑term macro risk; KO dividend yield/readiness (2.89% forward yield) to justify a cash‑flow ballast. 3) Replace narrative vagueness with a 3–6 month scenario map: base case (AI momentum intact, modest auto tariff risk), bull case (AI/infra catalysts accelerate, data‑center power demand accelerates capex), bear case (tariffs spike, Costa exit pressure, consumer demand decelerates). Specify timing windows 0–2 months (AI‑30 revisions, Nvidia momentum), 2–4 months (tariff visibility, auto capex pacing), 4–6 months (Costa sale progress, Disney pricing/engagement shifts); end with a base case, 1–2 alternate paths, and explicit risks/watch‑list signals. 4) Strengthen the asset mix with named, sourced anchors: keep the Motley Fool dividend sleeve (TXN, AXP, SBUX, Alphabet, LLY, HON, PG, XOM, SO, MAA, SHW) as one alt, and couple it with a value/low‑vol tilt via IUSV as a second alt; cite the IUSV composition/score context from 4661GWFP7. 5) Add invalidation triggers: AI list rebalancing away from infra/cyber (Adobe/C3.ai re‑entry or stagnation), a sharper-than-expected AI cycle fade, Costa Coffee sale failing to reach £2B or taking longer than expected, tariff escalations or relief measures that alter auto pricing/margins, and Disney per‑stay economics turning unfavorable. 6) Tighten write‑up for coherence: clearly label Horizon Focus, present a single paragraph flow that moves from macro/AI catalysts to sector translations (tech/infra, autos, consumer services), then to fundamental anchors, with a dedicated “watch‑list signals” sub‑set and a concise confidence rating (target 0.65). 7) Improve-source reconciliation and coverage: explicitly acknowledge how Coca‑Cola’s growth bets clash with capex restraint, how GM’s domestic manufacturing push interacts with tariffs, and how Disney’s guest behavior shifts interact with park economics, ensuring all four critical sources (STBVARD8F, WTNT85IPR, U3ZK13ZQI, 4661GWFP7, plus YX2J8NHZ1) are woven into the scenario logic; avoid pairing unrelated AI lists with consumer‑goods cases without a coherent transmission mechanism. 8) Enhance numerical discipline: replace generalities with concrete numbers (e.g., 945 TWh data‑center demand; Costa sale around £2B; GM capex range $10–$12B through 2027; KO forward yield 2.89%; 14–21 consecutive years of dividend growth cited for dividend stocks; 0–6 month timing anchors). 9) Re‑package into a concise, class‑level deliverable: base case + 1–2 alts, explicit catalysts/triggers/invalidation, 3–4 timing windows, a risks/watch‑list, and a quantified confidence. With these edits, the piece will offer a world‑class horizon‑focused, first‑principles view that tightly maps macro data, policy, flows, and valuation to a coherent 3–6 month catalyst roadmap. Citations to anchor points should be STBVARD8F, WTNT85IPR, U3ZK13ZQI, 4661GWFP7, and YX2J8NHZ1.",
