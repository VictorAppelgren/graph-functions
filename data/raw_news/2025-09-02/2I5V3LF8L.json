  "content": "Healthcare stocks haven\u2019t moved since the April lows. As contrarian investors, this neglect piques our interest.\n\nAs income investors, seven healthcare yields up to 7.1% are equally intriguing. These dividend deals are available because these stocks have been left behind by the broader market. Since April 7, the S&P 500 has soared a terrific 27% while the healthcare sector hasn\u2019t budged:\n\nOf course there is plenty of uncertainty surrounding these stocks:\n\nLet\u2019s wade through this political mess to evaluate these payers. Are they bargains or yield traps?\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI, 6.4% yield), a major operator in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in both the US and UK, with a portfolio of 93,961 beds across more than 1,000 properties that\u2019s leased out to 92 operators.\n\nOmega is technically still recovering from COVID, but thanks to great momentum over the past two years, it\u2019s closing in on its pre-pandemic highs. We can thank a better operating environment and more cooperative interest rates.\n\nThe company\u2019s latest quarter exemplifies the progress Omega has seen: It beat estimates for adjusted fund from operations (AFFO, a critical measurement of REIT profitability), raised its full-year AFFO guidance, and it was plenty active with transactions, buying up 57 properties.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about OHI, including its recent momentum, a position helped by demographics, a 6%-plus yield and (typically) low volatility. Its recent run higher has kept its price buoyed, however, with shares trading at more than 13 times next year\u2019s AFFO estimates\u2014not expensive, but not value-priced, either. The dividend is also more than due for a bump higher.\n\nAnother traditionally low-drama REIT, LTC Properties (LTC, 6.3% yield), is a roughly 50/50 split of assisted living properties and skilled nursing facilities.\n\nBut LTC could become jumpier than normal, for better or worse. A few months ago, I explained that LTC was beginning converting some of its contracts from triple-net leases into REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act (RIDEA)-structured contracts that, without getting into the weeds, gives REITs exposure to the real estate\u2019s operations and lets them participate in net operating income (NOI). As of June, the senior housing operating portfolio (SHOP, where LTC is making these conversions) accounted for about 7% of total enterprise value. The company plans to double the segment by year\u2019s end.\n\nIt\u2019s still a relative unknown, though the hope is that it could drive significant growth. LTC shareholders would probably take anything that jolts some life into both its shares and its monthly dividend.\n\nAnother monthly dividend from the healthcare space is Healthpeak Properties (DOC, 7.0% yield), whose 700 properties include outpatient medical facilities (50% of portfolio income), laboratories (35%), and senior housing (15%). I covered DOC in more detail not too long ago, but in short: There\u2019s a lot to like about the dividend, which was both raised and converted to a monthly payout earlier this year (after a pair of deep cuts in 2016 and 2021) and is well covered by AFFO\u2014but growth could be muted in the near-term given strong headwinds pushing back on its life sciences portfolio.\n\nSila Realty Trust (SILA, 6.4% yield) is a relatively fresh triple-net healthcare REIT that was founded in 2014 and went public a decade later. It owns roughly 140 medical properties, including 90 medical outpatient buildings, 22 inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and 26 surgical and specialty facilities.\n\nWe won\u2019t hear Sila\u2019s name mentioned among the most exciting IPOs, but since going public in June 2024, it has delivered a nearly 20% total return and established a 6%-plus dividend. It also offers a decent amount of financial security: long average lease terms of around a decade, no final debt maturities for a few years, rent escalators, a strong debt position, and a well-covered payout.\n\nOne small strike against management, though: SILA initiated a monthly dividend in July 2024 but regressed to quarterly starting this year.\n\nREITs aren\u2019t the only healthcare plays throwing off fat dividends right now, though. We can find some abnormally large distributions in the pharmaceutical space.\n\nSiga Technologies (SIGA, 7.1% yield) has one of the largest yields in the healthcare sector\u2014a whopping 7%-plus payout. But unlike the two blue chips I\u2019ll talk about next, it\u2019s an outlier in two significant ways:\n\u2022 It has one product. That\u2019s it. Siga makes TPOXX, an antiviral that primarily treats smallpox in adults and children across more than 30 countries, but also is being used for mpox (formerly monkeypox) in the U.S. under an expanded-access program. It\u2019s working on gaining additional indications for TPOXX and does have other drugs in development. Those, however, are in very early stages, which could mean years before they come to market..\n\u2022 Siga\u2019s dividend is an annual special distribution. That said, Siga has been paying an annual special dividend for four years now\u201445 cents per share in 2022 and 2023, then 60 cents per share in 2024 and 2025.\n\nSiga is too hyperconcentrated to seriously consider right now, but its extreme generosity (a 7% yield for a single-drug company!) at this relatively early stage is worth noting in case it manages to become a more diversified pharmaceutical over time.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb (BMY, 5.3% yield) is a much more diversified pharmaceutical name\u2014and at nearly $100 billion in market cap, a true blue chip of the healthcare space. Most people know it for its cancer treatments Revlimid and Opdivo, as well as the anticoagulant Eliquis, but those are just a few of the biggest names in a broad stable of more than 30 products.\n\nUnfortunately, that diversification hasn\u2019t counted for squat over the past five years. While healthcare broadly has grossly underperformed the market (about 40% to the S&P 500\u2019s doubling) in that time, BMY has been even worse, sitting on about 25% in red ink on a price basis, and a 10% loss even with dividends included. Credit that to plunging sales of Revlimid and other drugs such as Abraxane (to treat a variety of cancers) and Sprycel (to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia).\n\nStill, BMY is coming off a beat-and-raise second quarter, it\u2019s making smart partnerships with the likes of BioNTech (BNTX) and Bain Capital (BCSF), and there\u2019s potential for Opdivo Qvantiq to help mitigate the damage when the main patent for Opdivo falls off the cliff in 2028. Shares also yield more than 5%, and they\u2019re cheap, at just 7 times earnings estimates.\n\nAround this time last year, I said that fellow healthcare blue chip Pfizer (PFE, 6.9% yield) \u201cusually goes on sale once in a blue moon.\u201d\n\nBut a blue moon isn\u2019t supposed to last for a year.\n\nAt the time, the Pfizer turnaround story revolved around a few potential drivers, including the purchase of Seagen\u2019s oncology drug portfolio, a developing weight-loss pill (danuglipron), and its Paxlovid COVID-19 treatment.\n\nHowever, since then, Pfizer has pulled the plug on danuglipron after a trial patient \u201cexperienced potential drug-induced liver injury that resolved after the medication was stopped.\u201d COVID drug sales are on the decline (and in further potential danger from the current administration). Changes to Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription-drug coverage are dinging Pfizer and other Big Pharma names. And several of its products\u2014including Eliquis, Ibrance, Xtandi, and Prevnar 13\u2014are scheduled to go over the patent cliff across the next five years.\n\nThe result? PFE shares have continued to hemorrhage ground, driving its yield to its highest point since the Great Recession\u2014and no other time before that.\n\nFor now, Pfizer is trying to cut its way to financial health, targeting more than $7 billion in cost savings by the end of 2027. Does that mean the dividend is in danger of being cut, too? Given an earnings payout ratio of 55%, I\u2019d say \u201cnot yet.\u201d And for anyone who wants to risk catching a falling knife, shares trade at just 8 times earnings estimates.\n\nBut trimming isn\u2019t enough to convince long-term buy-and-holders. The only way we can have more confidence in Pfizer\u2019s longer-term prospects is to see more success from its pipeline, and stronger growth out of its newer products.\n\nBrett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

      "text": "Quarterly payers are the norm. But monthly dividends\u2026. Yeah, that\u2019s that stuff.\nToday we\u2019ll chat about five monthly divvies that yield between 5.8% and 16.3% per year. That\u2019s right, these stocks pay early, often and heavy.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with a plain \u2018ol quarterly dividend? Let\u2019s consider using my Income Calendar dividend projection tool. If we put $100K into each of the top five stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, here is the lumpy, inconsistent and sad income picture we are looking at:\nDividends From Top 5 Dow Stocks\nSource: Income Calendar\nLumpy and, let\u2019s be honest\u2014lame.\nInstead let\u2019s consider our five monthly payers. Drop $100K into each and now we are talkin\u2019:\nDividends From These 5 Monthly Payers\nSource: Income Calendar\nNote the 10.5% yield, too! Yee haw. It\u2019s powered by five payers dishing between 5.8% and 16.3% yields.\nBuy, hold or sell these generous monthly payers? Let\u2019s explore each one.\nHealthpeak Properties (DOC)\nDividend Yield: 6.6%\nHealthpeak Properties (DOC) is new to the monthly divvie game. Welcome, DOC!\nDOC is a healthcare REIT that also dabbles in retirement facilities. It boasts roughly 700 properties, including outpatient medical facilities (50% of portfolio income), laboratories (35%), and senior housing (15%). Its tenants include biopharma firms, health systems, physician groups, medical device manufacturers, and retirement housing companies, among others.\nIn February 2025, Healthpeak announced it would switch to monthly dividends starting in April. It also bumped up its dividend\u2014from 30 cents per share to 30.5 cents for the February quarterly, which translated to 10.17 cents once the monthly payments got going a couple months later. That comes out to a meager sub-2% hike, but it\u2019s an important step in the right direction considering its prior two dividend changes were cuts (36% in 2016, then 19% in 2021).\nDividend Investors Are Far From Whole, But It\u2019s Progress\nBetter still, the distribution represents less than 75% of projected adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) for 2025, which is a healthy REIT payout ratio that leaves room for modest dividend growth going forward.\nGrowth isn\u2019t as clean-cut. Healthpeak\u2019s heavy life sciences exposure could be problematic given poor current fundamentals in that industry, but tailwinds in senior housing could bode well for its continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). At 11 times 2025 estimates for AFFO, we\u2019re not paying much\u2014at least compared to the healthcare REIT industry\u2014to find out.\nEPR Properties (EPR)\nDividend Yield: 5.8%\nEPR Properties (EPR) is an \u201cexperiential\u201d REIT. As in, it deals in experiences\u2014a segment of spending that, were it not for a pandemic-sparked interruption, would have been a virtually straight line up and to the right for the past quarter-century.\nWant to see a movie? We may visit an AMC Entertainment (AMC) theater. Hit a bucket of balls? Then we\u2019ll head to TopGolf. Get a pump in? Let\u2019s hit the gym. These types of properties comprise EPR\u2019s 331-property portfolio.\nSource: EPR Properties Q1 2025 Investor Presentation\nA few months ago, we discussed a business segment (theaters) that was once a liability for EPR was becoming an asset once more:\n\u201cTheaters still account for 36% of adjusted EBITDA, so it can still capture some of the rebound in theaters as Americans return to the movies. That\u2019s good, because North America\u2019s box-office gross is expected to improve by double digits in 2025, while AMC\u2019s master lease is slated to increase by 7.5% this year.\u201d\nWhile North America\u2019s Q1 box office gross was actually down year-over-year, Q2 has outperformed, and Q3 is off to a great start with the hit release of Superman. Also, on July 1, a 7.5% rent increase on AMC kicked in. All of this has conspired to drive EPR to a REIT-beating first half of 2025.\nA Stock-Market Smash (And a Dividend Hike to Boot)\nLonger-term, EPR is seeing improving costs of capital, which means management can start making acquisitions again. Shorter-term, EPR might have a harder time replicating its first-half pace, if only because its P/AFFO has thickened up from just 9 in January to around 12 today.\nGladstone Commercial (GOOD)\nDividend Yield: 8.5%\nGladstone Commercial (GOOD) is part of the Gladstone family of REITs and BDCs, which also includes Gladstone Land (LAND), Gladstone Investment (GAIN) and Gladstone Capital (GLAD).\nGOOD is a straight-up equity REIT\u2014one that owns 141 single-tenant and anchored multi-tenant net-leased properties. Those properties are leased out to 107 unique tenants, typically in long-term leases of seven years or longer. Overall occupancy is 98.4%, though that\u2019s carried by industrial tenants (99.4%), which are making up for the office tenants (91.7%).\nSpeaking of office tenants, Gladstone Commercial has been deliberately moving away from that particular business. Seven years ago, office properties accounted for 65% of annualized straight-line rent. Today? That number is 35%.\nSource: Gladstone Commercial May 2025 Investor Presentation\nOn the one hand, Gladstone\u2019s move away from office buildings makes sense given the lousy environment of the past half-decade. However, it also means GOOD is less exposed to the return-to-office rebound.\nFor now, we want to see Gladstone reverse its multiyear trend of declining FFO. It\u2019s not quite in dividend trouble yet\u2014its monthly dividend comes out to $1.20 annually vs. $1.43 in FFO over the trailing 12 months; 85% is high but not alarming\u2014but we need some reason to believe shares can escape nearly six years of rangebound trading.\nProspect Capital (PSEC)\nDividend Yield: 16.3%\nProspect Capital (PSEC) is a business development company that provides private debt and private equity to middle-market companies. It currently boasts 114 portfolio investments in 33 industries, most notably real estate, consumer finance, and health care. Roughly three-quarters of its portfolio is first lien and other secured debt, though it will also make equity investments.\nI frequently keep my eye on PSEC both because it\u2019s one of the largest BDCs, at well more than $1 billion in market capitalization, and because it frequently sports a double-digit yield. But I also frequently warn about Prospect Capital because it\u2019s a serial dividend cutter. For instance, I called it out in October 2024, and just a few weeks later, it hacked its payout down by 25%.\nThen in February, I highlighted PSEC among several Wall Street consensus Sell calls, and I couldn\u2019t help but agree with the pros.\nPSEC Is Down Another ~20% Since Then\nProspect Capital is now the cheapest BDC on the market, trading at just 46% of NAV. That means we\u2019re paying just 46 cents for every dollar in PSEC\u2019s assets\u2014while collecting a wild yield above 16%. That\u2019s cheap, but is it a deal? It\u2019s more like a falling knife with its net investment income (NII) in a doom loop.\nAGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC)\nDividend Yield: 15.5%\nAGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC) deals in \u201cpaper\u201d real estate (i.e., mortgages). It\u2019s one of the largest mortgage real estate investment trusts (mREITs), at more than $9 billion in market cap.\nFor those unfamiliar with mREITs: These companies make money by borrowing at short-term rates to purchase mortgages, which deliver income at long-term rates. Their profit is the difference, so the hope, of course, is that short-term rates are lower than long-term rates (which they typically are).\nAGNC is an \u201cagency\u201d mREIT that deals in residential mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) from government agencies such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae).\nAgency MBSes tend to be much safer than their private counterparts because the federal government backs agency mortgages (or in the case of Ginnie Mae, mortgage securities). As a result, agency mREITs tend to use a lot of debt leverage to make the most out of their investments\u2014a welcome accelerant when rates head lower, but problematic when rates are high and headed north.\nAs the chart here shows, the rate environment (and the rate-expectation environment) has been volatile over the past year or so. But spreads are tightening again, and importantly, AGNC is doing more with that than the mREIT industry as a whole.\nAGNC Gets More Out of Better Rate Environments\nDespite its performance, AGNC is among the cheaper mREITs right now, at just less than 6 times earnings estimates for this year. Dividend coverage is on the tight side (~90%), though. That\u2019s manageable\u2014as long as hedging-related expenses don\u2019t get out of hand.\nA Fully Paid Retirement for Just $500,000?\nSeveral of these stocks meet the two most important income baselines we\u2019re looking for in retirement:\n- Yields around the 8% mark. With that level of income, we can retire on dividends alone.\n- Income that\u2019s paid monthly. Our bills come every month. We want our retirement income to be paid out every bit as frequently.\nBut remember: Our goal is a retirement where we\u2019re not looking over our shoulders. We can\u2019t get that by buying habitual dividend cutters. And we can\u2019t get that if we\u2019re sweating every time the Federal Reserve makes a rate announcement.\nThat\u2019s what sets my 8%+ Monthly Payer Portfolio apart.\nThe 8%+ Monthly Payer portfolio is a group of generous stocks and funds that pay us enough to live on dividends alone\u2014without ever needing to sell a single share to generate cash, and without worrying about wild swings in the market.\nWhy am I laser-focused on earning 8%? Just check out the math:\n- A $500,000 nest egg could earn $40,000\u2014depending on where you live, that could be enough for a fully paid retirement on its own.\n- You could generate a $48,000 annual dividend \u201csalary\u201d from a $600,000 nest egg.\n- And if you have managed to stow away a cool million bucks to work with, the 8% Monthly Payer Portfolio could pay you an equally cool $80,000 in dividend income every year.\nAnd these holdings pay us each and every month. That means no \u201clumpy\u201d payouts. No complex dividend calendars. No dumping money into B-list stocks because it\u2019s the only way to make sure you collect enough income every third month.\nJust paydays every bit as predictable as when your employer was sending you checks.\nDon\u2019t miss out on these terrific income plays while you can still get in at bargain prices. Click here for all the details, and turn your portfolio into a monthly dividend machine."

Staring into the front room, labeled \u201chome office,\u201d my wife said, \u201cProgrammer.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re hoping for a rentback,\u201d said the realtor. \u201cThe couple has to move out of town for work.\u201d Back to the Bay Area for these two!\nThey\u2019re far from alone. Major cities\u2014Boston, New York, San Francisco\u2014are shaking off five years of downtown rust, preparing for commuters back four or more days a week.\nFunny thing is, many companies issuing back-to-office mandates these days don\u2019t have space for these workers, after shedding leases in 2021. Pinterest (PINS), you may recall, canceled a lease for nearly 490,000 square feet of future office space back then. Meta Platforms (META) walked away from 200,000 square feet in New York.\nNowadays, freshly \u201creturned\u201d workers are elbowing each other out of lousy temporary desks! That means we\u2019re going to be looking at a \u201creverse 2021\u201d shortly, as companies hunt for more space. And I\u2019ve got a complete strategy for us to play it\u2014and grab some high, and growing payouts, as we do.\n\u201cRevenge\u201d of the Office Will Long Outlast Work-From-Home\nAccording to Placer.ai\u2019s Office Index, June was the fourth-best month for in-office visits since COVID. (Placer specializes in foot-traffic data for offices, stores and the like.)\nThat might make it sound like we\u2019re too late here. But the gap between now and the \u201cold times\u201d is still wide, with office visits down about 27% compared to June 2019.\nA shifting trend with at least a 27% runway still ahead? That has our attention.\nSo how do we tap into it? Here\u2019s my take on two popular office landlords. One is the wrong way to play the shift; another could work as a speculative pickup. Finally, we\u2019ll dive into our very best play on this trend, which isn\u2019t an office REIT at all.\nSell This \u201cRevenge of the Office\u201d REIT Yesterday\nLet\u2019s start with one REIT we\u2019re not going to buy: Easterly Government Properties REIT (DEA).\nBack in the \u201cold days,\u201d having a portfolio of mainly government tenants was a plus\u2014Uncle Sam, of course, always paid the rent! But now, a government focused REIT is the opposite of conservative. Uncle Sam has been on a spending bender and has a $2-trillion deficit to tame. That adds risk.\nDon\u2019t be pulled in by its 7.7% dividend. DEA\u2019s $1.6-billion of long-term debt eclipses its market cap (or value as a public company) by a lot\u2014about $600 million. And it\u2019s been rising.\nDEA also executed a 1 for 2.5 reverse stock split on April 28. This is usually done to reduce its share count and give the impression of a higher share price\u2014not a good look. Neither is the 32% dividend cut the REIT announced earlier in the month. Management still has a lot of work ahead to turn things around, and we don\u2019t need to be here for it.\nThis NYC Office Landlord REIT Has Appeal\u2014and Risk, Too\nNext up is SL Green Realty (SLG), with interests in 53 buildings, or around 31 million square feet, in New York City. SLG yields 5.1% dividend, and that payout is well-covered, at 53% of the midpoint of management\u2019s forecast funds from operations (FFO\u2014the best metric of REIT profitability) for 2025.\nIn fact, with that low of a ratio (for a REIT\u2014ratios of 80%+ are common in the sector, and safe, thanks to steady rent checks), I\u2019d expect SLG to do more on the payout front. But it\u2019s been holding off for a good reason: Management has been cutting long-term debt, from about $5.5 billion five years ago to around $3.7 billion today.\nThat\u2019s smart, as interest rates remain elevated. But I\u2019m concerned about the company\u2019s focus on New York, where office visits are only 5.3% below 2019, according to Placer\u2019s June numbers. Moreover, SLG\u2019s occupancy rate is a bit lower than I\u2019d like to see, at around 91%, as of June 2025.\nAll of this suggests SL\u2019s growth potential may be close to a top. But that\u2019s not the case with the REIT I favor most as a play on \u201crevenge of the office.\u201d\nOur Top \u201cRevenge of the Office\u201d Play Isn\u2019t an Office REIT at All\nThere\u2019s a chance the couple whose open house I attended are headed back to the Bay Area\u2014and renting an apartment there from Equity Residential (EQR).\nThe REIT yields 4.1% and has interests in nearly 85,000 units in major markets like Boston, New York, Washington, DC, and, on the West Coast, Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California.\nRegarding those last three markets, I know there\u2019s been a lot of talk about AI replacing humans in Big Tech, and that trend will continue. But it\u2019ll still take years to play out.\nMeantime, Big Tech still employs more people than it did five years ago. Consider Meta, which had 58,604 workers back in 2020. As of March 31, that number stood at 76,834. And even if headcounts just held steady, demands for more in-office time alone will bring more workers back to these areas. Meta, for the record, requires three days a week, while Salesforce (CRM) now requires three days at minimum, with some teams back in their cubicles four and five days.\nContinued jobs growth supports EQR\u2019s cash flow\u2014and dividend, which has returned to growth after staying flat during the pandemic years. That\u2019s notable, as management has been raising the payout straight through the current higher-rate period, which has been tough on REITs.\nTo be sure, EQR\u2019s dividend yield is a bit low for us. But it has room to keep growing, with the current yearly amount at 70% of the midpoint of management\u2019s forecast 2025 FFO\u2014again, low for a REIT.\nWhat\u2019s more, EQR is seeing rental rates rise, with the expectation of what it calls \u201cblended rates\u201d rising around 2% to 3% this year. Occupancy is also high: 96.2% as of the end of Q2.\nWhat\u2019s more, the REIT stands to gain as interest rates move lower over time, cutting its borrowing costs. That\u2019s a big plus\u2014and management is already doing a solid job on the debt front, reducing long-term borrowings sharply in the last decade. The current level of $7.85 billion is just 31% of EQR\u2019s market cap, or its value as a public company. That\u2019s a very light debt load for a REIT.\nFinally, we love the fact that EQR is smartly culling older buildings from its portfolio and using the proceeds to snap up newer ones. That, of course, boosts its portfolio value and attractiveness to tenants while going easy on its balance sheet.\nIn the second quarter, the REIT sold off some of its older properties on the coasts and used the cash to pick up 2,064 units in fast-growing Atlanta. Management sees these new additions contributing to FFO in about two years.\nTech workers, after all, love their modern conveniences. EQR\u2019s newer units give them just that\u2014a small consolation, perhaps, for being herded back to the 9-to-5 grind.\nBrett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

      "text": "Monthly bills are no problem for careful contrarian readers banking 8.8% yields in monthly dividends. Let\u2019s discuss this rare but excellent dividend breed, the company or fund that pays monthly instead of quarterly.\nOnly 6% of dividend payers dish monthly. The rest are quarterly or annually, which will likely not be in time to cover your upcoming cell phone bill.\nMy monthly email from carrier Verizon arrives in a day or two. Another $267.26 will be debited from my account automatically on the 20th of August.\nFortunately, Verizon notes that there is \u201cnothing I need to do\u201d thanks to AutoPay. As if the automatic payment implies it costs any less money!\nOn the bright side of the phone ledger, we have no landline. The cell bill is it. But don\u2019t fall asleep, bank account. All the other cord cutting exacts its pound of flesh!\nFor example, we \u201ccut the cable cord\u201d years ago. And replaced it with an equally pricey version, albeit a wireless one!\nYouTube TV has a base plan of $82.99. However, my August 29 tab will be $131.95 plus tax.\nHow\u2019d I manage a 50%+ premium? By demanding sports in 4K (+$9.99/month). And refusing to live a Sunday in the fall without NFL RedZone and its 6+ hours of live look ins across football games (+$10.99/month).\nOh, and the WNBA season ticket that I watch with my daughters during the summer.\nSpeaking of which, A/C is a must-have here in Sacramento! I paid the power company $187.76 two days ago and that\u2019s a light month for our summers.\nBut the big one, the mortgage payment, dwarfs all. And oh yes, automatically deducted from our account on the first of August.\n\u201cJust\u201d eleven years to go on the mortgage! We shortened to 15-years when we refi\u2019d in 2021. My \u201cbasketball dad\u201d car is paid off (2019 Acura MDX) and, while motivated to drive it \u201cinto the ground,\u201d the odds are this car won\u2019t be my last.\nSo the big monthly payment wheel keeps on spinning. I am sure you can relate to a few of these regular drains in your own life.\nFor which we have a solution: plug these monthly drains with monthly dividends.\nHow To Find The Best Monthly Dividends\nBut you observe, \u201cBrett! You said only 6% pay monthly. How can I find them?\u201d\nGlad you asked! Our Contrarian Income Report has a \u201cvirtual monopoly\u201d on the sector. We have 18 monthly payers yielding an average 8.8%. Think about that. A million bucks in the CIR monthly payer lineup generates $7,333.33 per month in passive income.\nPlus, the original million invested in these \u201celite 18\u201d stays intact. Or better yet, grinds higher! Since inception 10 years ago, our entire CIR portfolio has generated 10.7% in annual returns. And that\u2019s mostly paid in cash dividends, with the majority dishing monthly.\nOur CIR monthly dividend GOAT (greatest of all time) is DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund (DSL). In April 2016, we added DSL to the CIR portfolio at a price of $16.99 per share.\nSince then we have collected 111 monthly dividends that have totaled $15.27. That\u2019s 90% of our initial buy price in payouts. It\u2019s almost house money now!\nImagine investing in a simple fund that trades just like any blue-chip stock\u2014and earning your entire investment back within 10 years via monthly dividends. With the regular payout stream still rolling strong!\nAnd DSL is not a mere annuity. It\u2019s way better. DSL is a bond fund run by the \u201cbond god\u201d himself Jeffrey Gundlach. The modern-day deity of fixed-income investing scours the globe to collect deals that power DSL\u2019s monthly 11-cent divvie.\nDSL yields 10.9% today. Investors with $100,000 invested in DSL shares enjoy $10,900 per year in passive dividend income. That\u2019s $908.33 in monthly deposits and\u2014oh!\u2014that\u2019s right: it\u2019s autopay, but to you!\nEnough to pay Verizon, YouTube TV and internet while air conditioning the house\u2014with extra cash left over for a nice dinner!\nAnd a $50,000 stake in DSL delivers $454.17 in monthly payouts. That\u2019s still meaningful income to cover those every-30-day expenses.\nNow, I wouldn\u2019t pile everything into DSL today, when savvy investors can spread risk among 17 more solid monthly payers that deliver a green cash river too. This is diversification without di-worseification (thank you, Peter Lynch!). We want to retire on dividends, and the best way is to bulletproof our payout streams across asset classes, sectors and national borders.\nAnd that\u2019s our elite 18!\nWe are not hanging on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next word. Nor are we glued to policymaker decisions. We are insulated from this noise by assembling an elite 8.8% paying portfolio of monthly dividend payers.\nBrett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

      "text": "Dividends over drama, please. Like these five steady stocks that yield 7.2%, on average.\nBack in school they taught us that to increase returns, investors had to take on additional risk. This was a financial engineering class at Cornell University, by the way. The prof should have known better, but he didn\u2019t, because he was a researcher and not an actual investor.\nIt\u2019s a common mistake in academia, and those who try to invest \u201cbuy the book.\u201d The book says more beta means more returns. Well, this text is often wrong!\nBig dividends and low volatility are a beautiful combination.\nVolatility can be measured several ways. I find that \u201cbeta\u201d is one of the best ones for regular investors because it\u2019s easy to understand, and because it\u2019s widely available from just about every market data provider.\nBeta measures an investment\u2019s volatility against a benchmark. The benchmark (for instance, the S&P 500) will always have a beta of 1. So:\n- A stock with a beta of 1 moves in line with the market.\n- If the S&P 500 gained 1%, we\u2019d expect the stock to gain 1%.\n- A stock with a beta above 1 is more volatile than the market.\n- If the S&P 500 gained 1%, we\u2019d expect a stock with a beta of 1.5 to gain 1.5%\n- A stock with a beta below 1 is less volatile than the market.\n- If the S&P 500 gained 1%, we\u2019d expect a stock with a beta of 0.5 to gain 0.5%\nImportantly, the reverse tends to be true\u2014high-beta stocks generally fall more sharply than the market, while low-beta stocks often decline by less.\nSo if we want some peace of mind, especially in a market like this, we want low-beta stocks.\nAnd if we really want to improve our chances of enjoying upside in downturns, we also want high yields. That\u2019s in part because of the income return potential itself, but also because that income tends to attract more buyers during market scares.\nSo let\u2019s review several stocks that \u2026\n- Have low volatility\n- Have produced gains against a down market in 2025\n- Have high yields\u2014they average 7.2% as a group, which would generate a healthy $72,000 annually on a million-dollar nest egg.\nLet\u2019s start with B&G Foods (BGS, 11.1% yield), which we\u2019ve discussed very recently, because it serves as a perfect warning about the dangers of relying on headline numbers alone.\nA stock can look like a perfect candidate in a screener, only to fall apart after just a little bit of scrutiny.\nB&G Foods is a consumer staples stock whose brands include pantry regulars like Crisco and Cream of Wheat. It has an 11% yield. Its 5-year beta is 0.8. Its 1-year beta is negative 0.6, which implies that when the market zigs, it zags\u2014exactly what we want in a down market. And B&G is killing it in 2025. The market is off about 10% since its Feb. 19 high; BGS shares are up by more than 10%.\nWhat\u2019s not to love?\nThat\u2019s Not So Great.\nIt\u2019s arguable that the only reasons BGS has defied the market\u2019s gravity lately are its yield and positioning in the staples sector. Past that, though, B&G earned less than it paid out in dividends last year, and it\u2019s projected to do so this year and next. It\u2019s also just a couple months removed from having to write down the worth of several of its best brands.\nGreat headline metrics, but it\u2019s downhill from there.\nClearway Energy (CWEN/CWEN.A, 5.8% yield) is a different story.\nCWEN owns a portfolio of non-regulated clean energy generation assets representing 11.8 gigawatts of gross capacity\u20149 gigawatts from wind, solar, and battery energy storage systems, and 2.8 gigawatts of conventional dispatchable power capacity. So while it\u2019s technically in the utility sector, its operations aren\u2019t the same as our garden-variety power-or-gas \u201cute.\u201d\nHowever, like utilities, Clearway is enjoying a surge in demand from data centers. It\u2019s already developing traditional data center agreements, but it\u2019s also beginning to scope \u201cbehind-the-meter\u201d agreements, where data centers generate energy on-site using renewables rather than tapping into a traditional utility grid. CWEN has also been re-contracting its gas portfolio, which takes some important question marks off the board for the next few years.\nClearway seems to have plenty of firepower to support its 5%-8% annual dividend growth goal. That\u2019s a fine level for a stock that\u2019s already yielding nearly 6%, and better still, shareholders have been enjoying those raises on a quarterly basis for years.\nThis Is What Getting Paid More Every Paycheck Looks Like\nIn addition to the dividend, shareholders have enjoyed relative stability of late\u2014CWEN\u2019s five-year beta of 0.9 is a hint less volatile than the market, but its shorter-term beta of around 0.4 reflects much smoother sailing over the past year.\nW.P. Carey (WPC, 5.8% yield) is another quarterly dividend raiser, but its smooth path has quite the hiccup in it.\nIt Got Knocked Down, But It Got Up Again\nW.P. Carey is a massive, diversified net-lease real estate investment trust (REIT) that boasts more than 1,600 properties leased out to more than 360 tenants in 90 industries. More than a third of its portfolio is made up of industrial real estate, another quarter is warehouses, about 20% is retail, and the remainder is scattered across other property types including self-storage.\nWhat\u2019s missing there is office properties, which W.P. Carey exited in September 2023 by spinning them off into Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP). Alongside that plan was a necessary \u201creset\u201d of the dividend policy to account for the shift in assets.\nIn other words, WPC\u2019s dividend \u201ccut\u201d was merely a technicality\u2014the dividend itself is quite healthy. That\u2019s in part because virtually its entire portfolio (99.6%) includes rent escalators; high occupancy of 98%-plus helps, too.\nFive- and one-year betas of 0.8 and 0.3, respectively, reflect W.P. Carey\u2019s status as a historically cool cucumber, too.\nAnother REIT, LTC Properties (LTC, 6.4% yield), offers up the gold standard in dividend delivery: monthly payments.\nLTC, which stands for \u201clong-term care,\u201d boasts 190 properties in 25 states, with its investments split roughly 50/50 between assisted living properties and skilled nursing facilities. These were promising businesses until COVID ruptured the space; operations are recovering, though.\nThe stock actually managed to hit its pre-COVID high back in 2023, but that was short-lived. But its second attempt, which started six months ago, is looking better\u2014and shares are stabilizing while the rest of the market falters. LTC not only boasts a five-year beta of 0.7 (good), but an extremely low one-year beta of just over 0.1 (great).\nThat said, LTC is walking into a whirlwind of uncertainty\u2014though possibly for the better. The company plans on pivoting to a RIDEA structure, which stands for the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act. Without getting too far into the weeds, this act lets REITs participate in net operating income, and it\u2019s where LTC believes the majority of external growth opportunities in assisted living remain. Specifically, the company expects to convert $150 million to $200 million of gross investment assets to RIDEA-structured contracts by Q2 2025.\nIt\u2019s a potentially transformative structure, but also a complete unknown. One vital sign to look out for? A long, long-needed increase in its dividend, which has remained stagnant for nearly a decade.\nREIT Investors Expect Better Payout Performance Than This\nSabra Health Care REIT (SBRA, 6.9% yield) is similar to LTC in that it\u2019s a senior-focused healthcare play. Roughly half of Sabra\u2019s portfolio is in skilled nursing and transitional care facilities, though it also has large allocations to managed senior housing (20%), behavioral health (14%) and leased senior housing (11%).\nA big signal of improvement in Sabra\u2019s operational health came a little more than a year ago when it provided full-year guidance. Yes, that guidance missed estimates, but it actually released guidance\u2014something it wasn\u2019t able to do a year before that.\nThat said, like LTC, while we\u2019re seeing improvement in the underlying business, we need to see that improvement in our pockets, too.\nSBRA\u2019s Dividend Hasn\u2019t Budged Since Its 2020 Distribution Cut\nStill, SBRA ended up returning more than 30% in 2024, crushing the VNQ and its piddly 5% advance.\nShares have cooled off in 2025 but are still up a few percentage points since the Feb. 19 market peak. They also offer a high yield of nearly 7%, and extremely low volatility\u2014a beta of 0.9 over the past five years isn\u2019t much to look at, but it has registered a nearly unconscious beta of 0.2 over the past 52 weeks. And health care REITs could continue to be defensive if the economic environment continues to worsen.\n5 Soaring Dividends That Were Made for This Trade War\nWe all know the score. Investors are fleeing to low-vol and other safety trades because America\u2019s trade war with the rest of the world is threatening us with recession, inflation, stagflation, you name it.\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve put together a \u201cmini-portfolio\u201d of 5 picks my Dividend Magnet system has pinpointed as the very best \u201cbattleship\u201d dividends to own right now.\nThey\u2019ve held up well in past downturns.

      "text": "How about two bold election predictions\u2014and two payouts that will thrive regardless of the results?\nMy first forecast: Americans will still want to eat food after November. Inflation is a hot topic on the campaign trail, but this is not a bad time to be hungry. Grain prices\u2014corn, soybeans and what\u2014are as cheap as they have been in years.\nAs contrarian investors, this commands our attention. Farmers are planting less corn, soybeans and wheat. The acreage is going to more profitable crops. Or, nothing at all.\nRemember, the cure for low prices is low prices. Cheap grain squeezes farmers, who plant less. Their smaller harvests reduce supply while the lower prices for grain products increase consumer demand. That demand drives product prices back up, leading farmers to plant more of the raw material grain. This is why grain\u2014and all commodity\u2014prices are cyclical. They rally high and crash, but rarely stay in either place for long.\nFertilizer maker CF Industries (CF) will benefit from the upcoming rally in grain prices. CF already forecasts strong global pricing for its nitrogen fertilizers.\nThe company believes that fertilizer demand will outpace supply over the next four years. And the turnaround is already reflected in CF\u2019s generous dividend hikes\u201467% combined the past two years!\nA Fertile Dividend\nOn the surface, CF trades for a reasonable 14-times earnings. However! We know that P/E ratios aren\u2019t real cash life for a company, due to excessive accounting leeway on how the \u201cE\u201d is calculated. We prefer free cash flow (FCF). You can\u2019t fake cash.\nCF is a cash cow, generating more cash flow per share than earnings (EPS). Over the past twelve months, CF banked $7.94 in FCF per share versus $5.63 in EPS.\nVanilla investors see the P/E of 14 and shrug. They miss that CF shares trade for less than 10-times FCF. Cheap. Assuming no growth, CF boasts a \u201cfree cash payback period\u201d less than 10 years!\nMeanwhile, mainstream income investors see only CF\u2019s 2.5% current yield. They see what\u2019s been, not the boom just around the corner.\nGrain prices will rally\u2014they always do\u2014and when they pop, CF\u2019s fertilizer prices will skyrocket, too. With all that cash, CF will pay us more and the \u201cdividend magnet\u201d will bring us sweet gains. Let\u2019s make sure we don\u2019t miss the next dividend mega-hike.\nLet\u2019s move on to my second post-election prediction. Americans will continue to pop pills to solve their ills.\nBlue-chip healthcare stock Pfizer (PFE) usually goes on sale once in a blue moon. Last time the stock was this cheap? April 2020. And before that, 2009 and 1987.\n(Sigh\u2014obligatory when anyone mentions 2020.)\nAfter the stock market crash of 1987, PFE stock was so depressed it yielded 4.3%. Great time to buy!\nAnd March \u201909 was another PFE bargain moment. Investors who dumpster dived locked in an incredible double-digit yield. They also quadrupled their investment over the next 11 years.\nWell, here we go again. PFE yields 5.8%. A screaming deal.\nPFE peaked in December 2021 during the \u201cpeak vaccination\u201d push. Shares fell by half over the next two-and-a-half years. That is a big dip for a blue chip!\nNow, PFE\u2019s long-term turnaround is beginning to pull it off the mat. The company recently bought Seagen\u2019s (SGEN) promising oncology drug portfolio showing why, once again, we don\u2019t worry about dry pipelines in big pharma. When they need drug candidates, these cash cows simply go buy them\u2014at a discount.\nManagement intends to add $25 billion in revenue between now and 2030, a 40% increase. The oncology unit is key, as is a new weight-loss treatment. Skinny pills are in, after all.\nPlus, there\u2019s Paxlovid, Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 treatment. The drug is well regarded as taking a significant edge off COVID (my co-author Tom Jacobs can testify to that!)\u2014it may help Pfizer deliver some pleasant earnings surprises ahead.\nPfizer also has an RSV vaccine called ABRYSVO. If you have never had RSV, well, don\u2019t. The first time our kids brought it home from school, my wife and I thought it was a new, nasty form of COVID. Argh.\nThe US has approved ABRYSVO for older adults and expectant mothers.

This feels like another 1987/2009/2020 historical low and a great time to buy.\nHow about recession-resistant dividends? If sub-$75 crude oil spooks you a bit, well, I don\u2019t blame you. Cheap oil and rising unemployment are often a one-two set of clues that a recession is here.\nBut bull or bear, though, these five dividend stocks really don\u2019t care!
