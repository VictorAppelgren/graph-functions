  "description": "KIERAN GILL: Nicolas Jackson has been left out of the Chelsea squad for their Stamford Bridge friendly versus Bayer Leverkusen tonight.",
  "content": "Nicolas Jackson has been left out of the Chelsea squad for their Stamford Bridge friendly versus Bayer Leverkusen tonight with the club now helping the 24-year-old striker secure a move away.\n\nDaily Mail Sport can reveal Jackson trained solo at Cobham today while everyone else's focus was on their 7pm clash with the Bundesliga visitors.\n\nIt comes with the Senegal international having officially told the club's hierarchy that he is keen to explore a transfer elsewhere this month.\n\nChelsea are currently in talks with multiple clubs from the Premier League and in Europe and will sanction a sale if they deem it as being within the club\u2019s best interests.\n\nIf Jackson ends up remaining at Chelsea once the summer window closes, insiders insist they will happily have him within their first-team picture moving forward. They still see him as a valued member of Enzo Maresca\u2019s squad.\n\nNewcastle United have been heavily linked with Jackson after missing out on Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig, as have AC Milan, Juventus and others. Chelsea sources have long said that they believe he is worth more than the \u00a374.1million spent on Sesko and also the \u00a379m that Liverpool paid Eintracht Frankfurt for Hugo Ekitike.",
