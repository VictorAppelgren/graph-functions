      "text": "'I feel compelled to make it clear I want to leave Brentford' - Wissa speaks out\n- Published\nStriker Yoane Wissa has called on Brentford to \"keep their word\" and let him leave before the transfer deadline, accusing the club of \"unduly standing in his way\" of a move to Newcastle United.\nWissa has made clear he wants to leave for St James' Park and has not been training or playing with the first team this season.\nBrentford have rejected two offers, with the latest being \u00a335m guaranteed, plus a further \u00a35m in add-ons.\nIn a statement on Instagram, Wissa said: \"I have stayed silent for much of the summer, but with just hours remaining of the transfer window I feel compelled to make it clear that I want to leave Brentford.\n\"I believe the club are unduly standing in my way despite a series of fair offers throughout the summer.\n\"As the window comes to an end, the club has now significantly changed its position, going against what was communicated.\n\"This has left me in a difficult and frustrating position. The promise that I could leave this summer has not been fulfilled. It saddens me to have to write that, and I maintain total respect for the club and its fans.\n\"Being made to stay beyond this summer will only tarnish four wonderful years at this incredible club and so I ask Brentford's owners and directors to now honour their promise to let me leave in the final hours of the window.\n\"I want to make it clear that I have not acted unprofessionally, nor do I wish to leave Brentford on bad terms. I have been transparent in my position throughout. I have continued to communicate openly with the club and conduct myself in a way that reflects my values as both a footballer and a human being.\n\"I remain hopeful that a fair and reasonable resolution can still be found before the transfer window shuts.\n\"In the meantime, I must do what I feel is right for my career and family, and insist that Brentford honour their promise to let me join a new club and at a fair price.\""

      "text": "Liverpool agree British record \u00a3125m fee for Isak\n- Published\nLiverpool have agreed a British transfer record fee of \u00a3125m to sign striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle United.\nSources close to the deal have told BBC Sport that an agreement for the Sweden international to move to Anfield is now in place.\nNewcastle sources claim the deal could be worth as much as \u00a3130m with add-ons.\nIsak is expected to have a medical on Monday before signing a six-year contract.\nLiverpool had an original \u00a3110m offer rejected in August but are now set to land their first-choice target of the summer.\nThe protracted saga involving the 25-year-old appears set to come to an end on the final day of the transfer window, and it follows Newcastle having signed striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart last week.\nLiverpool have already broken their club transfer record this summer by signing Germany attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz in a deal worth an initial \u00a3100m, with a further \u00a316m in add-ons.\nIsak's arrival would top that outlay. After also bringing in Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Armin Pecsi and Giovanni Leoni, the deal would take the club's spending to about \u00a3416.2m without add-on fees - the highest total in Premier League history.\nIt is only the second time that an English side has shelled out more than \u00a3400m in a single summer, following Chelsea's \u00a3401.2m outlay in 2023.\nLiverpool could still add to the spree, with the Reds working on a deal to sign England defender Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace.\nMeanwhile, the departures of Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez, Jarell Quansah, Caoimhin Kelleher, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Tyler Morton and Ben Doak have recouped an initial amount of about \u00a3190m.\n- Published20 hours ago\n- Published2 hours ago\nHow has the Isak move come about?\nIsak, who joined Newcastle in a \u00a360m move from La Liga side Real Sociedad in 2022, scored 27 goals in 42 appearances across all competitions last season.\nHe helped the Magpies win the Carabao Cup in March - scoring as Newcastle beat Liverpool in the final - and they went on to qualify for the Champions League by finishing fifth in the Premier League.\nEarlier this summer, Isak was left out of the Magpies' squad for their pre-season tour of Asia with what the club described as a \"minor thigh injury\", while it was understood he wanted to explore a move away.\nHe then trained alone at his former club Sociedad before Liverpool's initial bid for him was knocked back by Newcastle.\nAmid continued speculation about his future, Isak released a statement in which he said promises had been \"broken\" by Newcastle and that their \"relationship can't continue\".\nBBC Sport understands Isak believed he would be allowed to leave if a big club came in for him and offered the right price.\nNewcastle said that \"no commitment has ever been made by a club official that Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer\".\nHowever, a move has now been agreed after Isak remained on the sidelines and missed their opening three league games, which included a 3-2 defeat by Liverpool at St James' Park.\nWhere would the Isak fee rank?\nLiverpool's move for Isak would be one of football's biggest deals if completed.\nIn terms of the British transfer record, it would overtake the \u00a3107m Chelsea paid Benfica for Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez in 2023.\nWirtz, Moises Caicedo, Declan Rice and Jack Grealish all moved for initial fees of \u00a3100m.\nWith add-ons, the Wirtz deal could become the biggest of those, while Caicedo's move from Brighton to Chelsea in 2023 may end up costing \u00a3115m and Rice's switch from West Ham to Arsenal in the same year could reach \u00a3105m.\nOn a global scale, Isak's potential move to the Reds is set to come in third when based on initial fees.\nThe two most expensive moves in football are Paris St-Germain's signings of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. The French club spent \u00a3200m in bringing in Neymar from Barcelona in 2017. Mbappe joined in the same year, initially on loan, in what became a \u00a3165.7m permanent deal.\nThe Isak transfer could rank behind those but above moves involving Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Demble.\nCoutinho joined Barcelona from Liverpool in January 2018 in a \u00a3142m package which was worth an initial \u00a3105m, while the Spanish club paid Borussia Dortmund an initial \u00a396.8m for Dembele in the previous window, with the fee potentially rising to \u00a3135.5m.\nTimeline of Isak transfer saga\n25 May - Alexander Isak finishes 2024-25 season as Newcastle's top scorer with 27 goals in 42 appearances.\n19 July - Newcastle boss Eddie Howe says Isak will \"absolutely\" be on the club's pre-season tour of the Far East after the Swede missed a 4-0 friendly defeat by Celtic with a thigh injury.\n23 July - Liverpool sign striker Hugo Ekitike - who had been linked with Newcastle - in \u00a369m deal from Eintracht Frankfurt.\n24 July - Isak is left out of Newcastle's squad for their pre-season tour with a \"minor thigh injury\".\n24 July - Isak expresses desire to explore move away from Newcastle.\n28 July - Sources tell BBC Sport that Liverpool remain keen on signing Isak, despite the arrival of Ekitike.\n31 July - Isak trains alone at his former club Real Sociedad.\n1 August - Newcastle reject Liverpool's opening \u00a3110m offer for the Sweden international and it is suggested the Reds may not continue their interest.\n4 August - Isak returns to Newcastle training ground but told to train away from the first-team squad.\n8 August - Howe says it is \"clear\" he \"can't involve\" Isak at Newcastle as things stand.\n16 August - Isak not part of matchday squad as Newcastle held at Aston Villa in Premier League opener.\n19 August - Isak says promises have been \"broken\" by Newcastle and \"the relationship can't continue\", but club say \"no commitment has ever been made\" to Isak.\n30 August - Newcastle announce signing of striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for initial \u00a365m.\n1 September - Liverpool agree \u00a3125m deal with Newcastle for Isak.\n- Published12 April 2024"

      "text": "Newcastle sign Woltemade in club record \u00a369m deal\n- Published\nNewcastle United have completed the club record signing of striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart on a six-year contract.\nThe 6ft 6in (1.98m) Germany international, 23, has joined Newcastle in a deal worth up to \u00a369m.\nThis eclipses the \u00a363m Newcastle paid to make Alexander Isak the most expensive player in the club's history three years ago.\nWoltemade, who will wear the number 27, has not been registered in time to make his debut against Leeds United on Saturday.\nBut Woltemade will have a huge role to play moving forward, given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of Isak - who remains determined to join Liverpool.\n\"I'm really happy to be at this amazing club,\" he said. \"From the first contact, I felt like the club really wanted me and had big plans for me.\n\"It's a big step in my life to leave Germany but everybody has welcomed me so well and it already feels like family. I have a really good feeling from speaking to the head coach that this is the right place for me to find my best level.\n\"I know the stadium from watching games on television - it looks amazing and I know the atmosphere is crazy. I'm really excited to play and start scoring goals here.\"\nNewcastle United head coach Eddie Howe added: \"We're delighted to get Nick's signing over the line so quickly. He fits the profile for exactly what we have been looking to add to our attacking options.\n\"He's strong in a lot of areas - he has great technical ability and has proven himself to be a real threat in one of Europe's top leagues - but he's also still at an age where he has plenty of room to develop and grow here.\"\n- Published1 day ago\nAppearances can be deceiving - analysis\nOn first glance, Woltemade appears a battering ram of a centre forward - but that could not be further from the truth.\nThe towering striker is technically gifted - comfortable wriggling it out of tight spaces and linking play - and has even been nicknamed 'Woltemessi' by Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.\nThis unique profile convinced Newcastle to break their transfer record to cap a remarkable 12 months for Woltemade.\nA year ago, Woltemade was not even a household name in Germany. He was not even guaranteed a starting spot at Stuttgart when he joined the club on a free transfer from Werder Bremen.\nHowever, his progress since then has been remarkable.\nWoltemade scored 17 goals in 33 games for Stuttgart last season, including the opener in the German Cup final, as the striker won the first major trophy of his career.\nHe then lit up the Under-21 Euros last month and finished the tournament as top scorer with six goals as Germany reached the final, where they lost to England in extra time.\nWoltemade won't have much time to settle at Newcastle - neither did Isak, incidentally, when he joined the club at a similar age and a similar stage of the window three years ago - but this is clearly a coachable player with all the attributes to go to another level under Howe and his staff.\nThat is certainly what Newcastle will be banking on and, given the situation with Isak, and the lack of time left in the window, the black-and-whites will have felt they had to make the move this summer.\nOtherwise, there is a very real possibility that Woltemade, who also attracted bids from Bayern Munich, could simply have been unobtainable following another impressive season in the Bundesliga.\nIt does not feel like Newcastle are finished yet, though.\nThey are still active in the market and remain interested in Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen and Brentford's Yoane Wissa.\nNeither deal would be straightforward to do so late in the window - there is little time for Wolves or Brentford to source a replacement before Monday's 19:00 BST deadline - but things can move quickly.\nThe Woltemade deal proved that.\nRelated topics\n- Published26 July 2022"
