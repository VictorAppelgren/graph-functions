  "description": "Vice President JD Vance hosted his old GOP colleagues at the Naval Observatory this spring as part of a tradition dating back to his earliest days in the Senate.",
  "content": "Happy Tuesday, this is Congress Editor David Sivak welcoming you to our fourth edition of Capitol Tea, a weekly column dedicated to life on Capitol Hill. Miss our last installment? Catch up here.\n\n\u2013 Vice President JD Vance\u2019s class loyalty. The vice president still dines with his \u201credshirt freshman\u201d colleagues.\n\n\u2013 Food court blues. The union for House service workers is suing a third eatery.\n\nVance is no longer Ohio\u2019s senior senator, but he still considers himself a member of his freshman Senate class.\n\nVance and his wife, Usha, hosted his old GOP colleagues at the Naval Observatory this spring as part of a tradition dating back to his earliest days in the Senate.\n\nEach month, the group will dine at a restaurant, with a different senator hosting each time, but Vance chose his vice presidential residence, a 9,000 square-foot property that boasts a pool, solarium, and private garden, when it came his turn in early May.\n\n\u201cAll of our spouses came in town for that one, so that was really, I mean, special and surreal,\u201d said Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL), one of five Republicans who entered the Senate with Vance in 2023.\n\nThe gathering, which has not been previously reported, is a sign of how close Vance, despite his ballooning vice presidential portfolio, remains with his GOP classmates, a group made up of Britt and Sens. Ted Budd (R-NC), Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), and Eric Schmitt (R-MO).\n\nThey now maintain two separate text chains, one with Vance on it and one without, to avoid inundating his phone. (I\u2019m told the text threads are \u201cfun and sometimes spirited.\u201d)\n\nBut Vance, who plays an outsize role in the Senate as vice president, still has a standing invitation to the dinners, and Britt said he \u201ccomes when he can.\u201d\n\nCollectively, the class calls itself the \u201credshirts,\u201d a nickname I discovered in talking to staffers about the dinners. I received conflicting accounts on the origin story, but the senators have embraced the obvious sports reference \u2014 the \u201credshirt freshmen\u201d who defer their eligibility to play an extra year in college.\n\nThere is plenty of Senate lore to uncover surrounding class names. Britt, whose husband played for the New England Patriots, made \u201credshirt freshman\u201d T-shirts for each of her classmates, one of which is hanging in Mullin\u2019s office.\n\nThe 2014 class, a crop that includes Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Tom Cotton (R-AR), also goes by the \u201cBear Den,\u201d and Britt cited their nickname as inspiration in adopting their own.\n\nTHUNE TO VISIT NATO NATIONS WITH DELEGATION OF GOP FRESHMEN\n\nFor two-plus years, the dinners have anchored the friendship between Britt and her class colleagues. She called it a \u201ctrusted space\u201d for career advice, especially early in their Senate terms.\n\n\u201cFor me, being away from my husband and my kids, and trying to figure out, where is your lane, and how do you make all this work? \u2026 I mean, this was instrumental in being able to kind of get my footing,\u201d Britt said.\n\nThe meals have also become a venue to celebrate their accomplishments, as they take on new leadership roles or sponsor high-profile pieces of legislation.\n\nBefore the recess, the group held an impromptu dinner after Schmitt ushered a $9 billion rescission bill through the Senate. GOP leadership and Britt\u2019s son joined them for the occasion.\n\nThe dinners will be held everywhere from Mastro\u2019s Steakhouse to the Capital Grille. In one off-campus excursion, the class also cheered Schmitt on at Nationals Park for this year\u2019s Congressional Baseball Game.\n\nRicketts was a particularly good sport and wore the St. Louis Cardinals logo on their \u201cSchmitt Nation\u201d T-shirts. (The Ricketts family owns the Chicago Cubs.)\n\nTheir meals typically do not include Sens. Peter Welch (D-VT) and John Fetterman (D-PA), the two Democrats who joined the Senate in 2023, but they will have a classwide dinner about twice a year, according to Britt.\n\nShe is also friendly with the pair and had a separate dinner with them this spring.\n\nAs for the most recent crop of senators, Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH), who replaced Vance in January, is lobbying for his class to be known as the \u201coutsiders,\u201d given many of the GOP freshmen were businessmen before entering politics.\n\nBut the name isn\u2019t official yet \u2014 Moreno came up with it in a brief interview while offering a friendly jab at the \u201credshirts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the second-best class,\u201d he said. \u201cOurs is obviously the best.\u201d\n\nHe noted his GOP classmates, who host monthly breakfasts together, have camaraderie of their own. Later this month, they will travel to Europe with Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) as a congressional delegation.\n\nCHA Street Food, the Asian fusion eatery that opened in the Rayburn Cafeteria on Monday, is facing a wrongful termination lawsuit from the union representing House service workers.\n\nAccording to court documents, Unite Here Local 23 is seeking relief for Steak \u2018n Shake employees who lost their jobs as part of a larger reshuffling in the House\u2019s food offerings. The complaint, filed on July 29 and first reported here, alleges that, under D.C. law, CHA Street Food was obligated to rehire the workers when it took over the Steak \u2018n Shake food stall.\n\nThe restaurant is the first local chain to be sued as new vendors begin to open over the August recess. Previously, Unite Here filed a lawsuit against a Starbucks that is replacing Dunkin\u2019 in the Longworth Office Building, plus another against the new Jimmy John\u2019s in Rayburn.\n\nThe court battle is taking place alongside a vendor boycott that has attracted the support of the Congressional Labor Caucus.\n\nWe reached out to CHA Street Food but did not hear back.",

      "text": "Congress is poised to claw back billions in foreign aid after the Senate narrowly passed $9 billion in DOGE-inspired cuts on Thursday.\nIn a 51-48 vote, the Senate approved the White House request, known as a rescission bill, all but clearing the way for it to become law. Just two Republicans \u2013 Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) \u2013 joined Democrats in voting \u201cno.\u201d\nThe request now heads back to the House, which narrowly passed a similar version in June.\nThursday\u2019s vote, which came after a marathon voting session that stretched late into the night, is a major victory for President Donald Trump and a 180\u2013degree turn from an unsuccessful rescission request Trump made in his first term.\nCentrist Republicans lodged a series of complaints, including a lack of detail regarding which programs will be cut, but enough accommodations, including a carveout for AIDS prevention money, were made to shore up GOP support.\nAfter more than 12 hours, Republicans successfully fended off Democratic attempts to amend the bill, casting their final vote shortly after 2 a.m.\nThe House only has until Friday to pass the Senate bill, or the White House will be forced to spend the money under the rules of the Impoundment Control Act. But Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has already begun to clear procedural obstacles for a same-day vote and in June managed to keep nearly all of his conference together.\nThe rescission, which also targeted $1.1 billion for public broadcasters like NPR and PBS, is just the first of what the White House hopes will be repeated requests to pare back \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d\nDemocrats described the rescission as cuts to life-saving funding that would weaken America\u2019s standing on the world stage, while Republicans said the money, in particular grants on transgender rights, climate, and more, strayed from the purpose of foreign aid.\nThat funding will again be litigated as the Senate considers its 12 annual appropriations bills. Republicans passed the rescission on a party-line vote that skirted the Senate filibuster, but avoiding a government shutdown in September will require bipartisan cooperation.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called the vote a \u201cshort-circuiting of the appropriations process\u201d on Wednesday and has previously warned Republicans that rescissions would poison negotiations when it comes time to strike a deal.\nOn the Republican side of the aisle, Collins and other top appropriators have complained about the White House\u2019s tactics on spending.\nIn particular, Collins has expressed opposition to White House budget chief Russ Vought\u2019s interest in using \u201cpocket rescissions,\u201d which might sidestep a Senate vote altogether by transmitting the request at the end of the fiscal year.\nVought, who worked closely with tech mogul Elon Musk before he stepped away from the Department of Government Efficiency, has called Thursday\u2019s vote a test case for future spending reductions. However, he would not commit to bringing more requests in a hearing before the Appropriations Committee in June.\nHouse fiscal hawks have balked at the Senate for removing $400 million in AIDS prevention funding, bringing the total request down from $9.4 billion. Vought negotiated that concession along with outside commitments on public radio and other funding pools to secure 50 Senate votes.\nHOW THUNE AND TRUMP GOT BEHIND \u2018ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL\u2019\nThe Senate also ignored pleas from Johnson to leave the rescission unamended, meaning the House now has a take-it-or-leave-it decision to make.\nVice President JD Vance, who cast the tie-breaker on two procedural votes this week, was on call for final passage of the rescission, but the unexpected hospitalization of Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) on Wednesday gave Republicans more breathing room to pass it without his help.\nSen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) also voted \u201cyes\u201d after opposing the procedural votes on Tuesday."

      "text": "Senate Freshmen Aim to Be \u2018Force\u2019 Not \u2018Faction\u2019\nA preacher, a doctor, a historian, a governor, two businessmen, a few veterans and some lawmakers walk into a bar \u2026 and the \u201cbear den\u201d is born.\nEvery other week or so, an email will circulate among the Senate Republicans elected in 2014 with a line like, \u201cHey, you guys want to have a bear den?\u201d The regular morning meetings take place in one of their offices, and the meeting name derives from the hotel bar in Hershey, Pa., where they gathered during their first joint Republican retreat.\n\u201cI always joke that we should have a grunt as our official greeting or something,\u201d Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said with a laugh.\nAsk Gardner or any of the Senate GOP freshmen about their fellow \u201cclassmates\u201d and they\u2019ll be quick to remark that their class is a unique group of people.\nThough the class of 2014 is not be diverse in terms of race (each one is white), or gender (only two out of the 13 freshmen are women), the senators bring a wide swath of experiences, ranging from the business world to the battlefield, and have diverse perspectives on the country\u2019s problems. They\u2019re also overwhelmingly Republican \u2014 nine of them replaced Democratic senators, shifting control of the chamber with their arrival; three replaced fellow Republicans.\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., the only new Senate Democrat, took his status in stride, recently joking, \u201cIt put me in leadership right away because I was president of the Democratic freshman class.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s proof of the difference a year makes. The Huffington Post once pegged him as the \u201cloneliest person in the Senate ,\u201d but he spent the first days of February swarmed by reporters in the Senate basement who were looking for the scoop on the response to the Flint, Mich., water crisis.\nOther freshmen have made their marks as well. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., the youngest senator at age 38, gained national attention \u2014 or perhaps notoriety \u2014 when he wrote to the leaders of Iran . Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who said in his first floor speech that he was mistaken for a Senate page, has traded barbs with GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump.\nThe 12 Republicans make up nearly a quarter of the GOP conference, though Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said they don\u2019t want to be seen as a \u201cfaction,\u201d but rather \u201ca force promoting positive change.\u201d And despite some standouts, the senators said they work as a group.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not any one member that\u2019s tried to either rise above the others, or that you really see as the focal person in the class,\u201d said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.\nLankford is one of several members who said their class bonded on the campaign trail before coming to the Senate.\n\u201cA lot of the same themes of my campaign were played out in other campaigns,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re having $50 or 60 million worth of TV ads run against you, telling you you\u2019re the most miserable person on Earth, it\u2019s nice to share and have a conversation with someone who\u2019s going through the same thing.\u201d\nGardner and Lankford are two of seven freshmen, including Peters, who came from the House, and they\u2019ve been adjusting to the new procedures and power of their office.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like when you\u2019re going from junior high to high school,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W. Va., a former House member. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re in junior high you don\u2019t want to go to high school. You\u2019re like, \u2018Oh I don\u2019t know anybody. I don\u2019t know how to get around the building, I\u2019m going to be afraid.\u2019 But then on your first day of high school you step into the building and look back at junior high and you say, \u2018See ya!\u2019\u201d\nThe high school metaphor is often repeated in Congress, whether it\u2019s criticizing members\u2019 behavior or describing activities like orientation. And it\u2019s not lost on new senators, who are at the bottom of the totem pole.\n\u201cFreshman class makes it sound like high school,\u201d Sasse said in a statement,\u201dand I\u2019m 99th in seniority, so I joke that Dan Sullivan [the Alaska senator who ranks lower] is the only guy I can push into a locker.\u201d\nThe newcomers were also met with surprises ranging from how long it took to move into their offices (between six and seven months, some said), to how much bipartisan cooperation it takes to get to the magic number of 60 votes in the Senate, which is necessary to end debate.\nThe bipartisan rapport came as particular surprise to Capito, one of two women in the freshman class, who described regular dinners between Senate women from both parties.\n\u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t do that in the House,\u201d she said.\nThe freshmen also found an increased emphasis on foreign policy. They were able to delve into international affairs policy with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who took two groups of GOP newcomers on trips to the Middle East in March and October.\nMcConnell spokesman Don Stewart said they had to split the trips up because of the size of the class, and that McConnell does the trip with each group of freshmen.\nSen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., said the group went to Israel, Jordan, Iraq and Afghanistan, meeting with leaders in each country. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a bunch of pre-scripted talking points,\u201d Daines said. \u201c[McConnell] just let us engage in those meetings and get the information we wanted, ask the questions we wanted.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like being on a plane for 38 hours together,\u201d Capito said of the trip. \u201cA lot of bonding.\u201d\nGOP leadership has also sought the new senators\u2019 input in the ongoing discussion about changing Senate rules. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., formed a working group on the rules that included Gardner, Sasse, Lankford and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.\n\u201cAll of us are interested in finding a better way \u2026 to get rid of the frustrations that led to us running in the first place,\u201d Gardner said.\n\u201cWe all kind of ran on the same thing,\u201d noted Perdue, the only Fortune 500 CEO in the Senate. \u201cThat is, the dysfunction of Washington.\u201d\nSome senators noted the Senate\u2019s achievements since the GOP took control, echoing the leadership mantra that it is \u201cback to work.\u201d\n\u201cMost of the press stories are all about kind of how there\u2019s this horrible partisanship and nothing ever gets done,\u201d said Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, a former attorney general who also worked in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cI actually think a lot gets done.\u201d\nGOP leadership has pointed to legislation passed in 2015, including a highway bill and an education overhaul, as proof the Senate is working again. But one senator who came from outside Congress still thinks they have a long way to go.\n\u201cWhen I came here, I told everybody that [Washington] was broken,\u201d said Rounds, who served as South Dakota\u2019s governor. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than what I thought it was.\u201d\nRounds later added that he\u2019s brought up this concern with his fellow freshmen, who respond, \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen it the way it was.\u201d But, he argued, the Senate should be able to more quickly address pressing issues.\nAnd that sense of urgency is something Rounds said senior members have cautioned freshmen not to lose sight of.\n\u201cThe one thing that members in our conference have told us time and again: \u2018Don\u2019t lose your sense of urgency,'\u201d Rounds said. \u201c\u2018Remind the rest of us that it\u2019s still there.'\u201d\nSee photos, follies, HOH Hits and Misses and more at Roll Call\u2019s new video site.\nNEW!

      "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s sprawling domestic policy agenda narrowly passed the Republican-led Senate Tuesday after Vice President JD Vance cast the tiebreaking vote, capping off weeks of intense negotiations in the upper chamber to muscle through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\nThe marquee legislation, which advances Trump\u2019s second-term priorities on tax cuts, energy, and the border, now heads to the GOP-led House, where leaders are corralling votes to pass it by the president\u2019s July 4 deadline.\nThe bill cleared the Senate in a 51-50 vote. Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Susan Collins (R-ME) were the three Republican defectors who forced Vance to intercede and break the logjam after hours of arduous debate on and off the Senate floor that threatened to derail Trump\u2019s signature legislation at the eleventh hour.\nThe passage of the filibuster-skirting bill was the culmination of a messy and drawn-out budget reconciliation process and was preceded by days of debate, amendment votes, and backroom deal-making by Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) to win over enough Republican holdouts. Senators endured a grueling marathon amendment voting session in the hours leading up to the final vote, in which mainly Democrats and some Republicans forced dozens of roll-call votes over 26 hours beginning Monday morning.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will now be tasked with overcoming hurdles and complaints in his GOP conference. Complicating matters is that the Congressional Budget Office said the Senate version will add some $3.3 trillion to deficits over the next decade, which the House Freedom Caucus said violates the cost-cutting agreements in the budget framework. But the CBO also scored the bill using current policy baseline and found the legislation would reduce the deficit by $508 billion.\nThe \u201ccurrent policy baseline\u201d is a novel accounting method that suggests it is cost-free to make permanent the 2017 Trump tax cuts that would otherwise expire next year. The White House also argued that economic growth from the bill would offset the deficit hit.\nNotably, the CBO\u2019s $3.3 trillion number doesn\u2019t measure the bill against current policy. Rather, CBO assumes Congress would have allowed for a $4.5 trillion tax increase by letting Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of this year.\nDemocrats, and some GOP fiscal hawks such as Paul, decried it as a gimmick. The measure also raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.\nThe heart of the legislation is extending and making permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from Trump\u2019s first term, which lowered individual tax rates to the current levels that are set to expire at year\u2019s end. One of the biggest imprints the Senate made on the bill compared to a version previously passed by the House was to make permanent the business tax cuts, which the lower chamber only proposed to extend temporarily.\nTax cuts, illegal immigration, and energy\nSenate Republicans settled on maintaining the House\u2019s $40,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, a thorny issue for blue-state House Republicans whose constituents pay higher state taxes. The figure would quadruple the current rate of $10,000, as set by Trump\u2019s 2017 tax bill.\nSALT critics argue the deductions primarily benefit high-income earners in liberal states and subsidize spending by state and local governments led by Democrats. The provision was crucial to win over key SALT proponents such as Reps. Mike Lawler (R-NY) and Nick LaLota (R-NY).\nHowever, the $40,000 cap lasts only five years before snapping back to the $10,000 current limit.\nOther new tax measures include versions of Trump\u2019s campaign promises to exempt taxes on tips, reduce Social Security taxes, and eliminate taxes on overtime.\nThe bill would set a $25,000 limit for deductions on tipped income and phase out for single filers and joint filers who earn more than $150,000 and $300,000 annually, respectively.\nThe legislation would allow up to $10,000 in auto loan interest to be deducted, phasing out for single filers who make annually more than $100,000 and $200,000 for joint filers. Only new cars assembled in the United States would be eligible.\nA $6,000 deduction for seniors over 65 would be created as part of Trump\u2019s pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits.\nAnother area of tax policy closely watched and debated was the child tax credit, an increasingly popular benefit among populist conservatives who want to encourage more people to have families.\nUnder the Senate\u2019s proposal, the credit would increase from $2,000 to $2,200 per child. That\u2019s down from $2,500 under the House version. However, the Senate would make the increase permanent, whereas it would expire after 2028 in the House bill. Pro-family conservatives, including Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), wanted the credit as high as $5,000.\nThe Senate legislation also boosts the child and dependent care tax credit, known as the CDCTC.\nOn border security, the legislation includes nearly $200 billion over the next decade to beef up illegal immigration enforcement, which has been a major focus of the Trump administration. There is funding for the construction of additional southern border wall, immigration detention centers, state and local grants, surveillance technology, and broader enforcement and removal operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Justice Department.\n\u201cThe Big Beautiful Bill will allow ICE to hire 10,000 new officers,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. \u201cICE currently has 20,000 law-enforcement and support personnel in more than 400 offices. A larger force will provide ICE agents with the necessary protection so they can continue to carry out removals.\u201d\nIn a bid to crack down on federal spending and illegal immigration further, the bill strips benefits for most noncitizens from government programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.\nThe bill makes major changes to healthcare, particularly to Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for some 80 million lower-income adults and children. It creates work requirements for childless, able-bodied adults, and it would defund Planned Parenthood by prohibiting Medicaid funds from being used to reimburse health clinics that provide abortions.\nThe megabill would also rework the Medicaid provider tax framework that shrinks federal reimbursements to states for beneficiaries, a major concern of so-called \u201cMedicaid moderates,\u201d who feared the change could bankrupt rural hospitals in red states. The provision led Tillis to oppose the bill and others to threaten to withhold their support until concessions were made.\nTHOM TILLIS ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT AFTER OPPOSING TRUMP TAX BILL\nOn energy, federal subsidies for wind and solar projects are set to take a major funding hit by the rollback of clean energy tax credits from former President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. Senate Republicans opted to accelerate the credit phase-outs, similar to an earlier proposal from the House (the original Senate proposal was the soft one). But in a win for conservative conservationists, a controversial proposal from Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) to sell tracts of public lands to help pay for Trump\u2019s tax cuts was stripped from the text.\nFood stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would be reduced by nearly $70 billion through work requirements and $40 billion with state matching funds. Another roughly $85 billion is cut elsewhere from the program.\nGabrielle Etzel, Callie Patteson, David Sivak, and Marisa Schultz contributed to this report."

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) will be traveling to Europe later this month with a delegation of Senate GOP freshmen.\nThe senators will be making stops in Denmark, Norway, and Finland, according to Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH), who disclosed the trip in a brief interview with the Washington Examiner. A spokesperson for Thune declined to comment on the travel plans, but one source familiar with the schedule said the visit also includes a stop in Estonia, while two sources confirmed the delegation is limited to the GOP freshmen and Thune.\nThe trip is significant, in part, for the countries where senators will be visiting. The travel coincides with increasingly strained relations between Washington and the Kremlin, and each is a member nation of NATO. Thune and most of the Senate are ready to move legislation to impose withering penalties on Russia over the war in Ukraine but have so far held off at the request of the White House.\nKristjan Prikk, Estonia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, called the delegation a \u201cvery welcome visit\u201d that will \u201cgive them a great opportunity to learn of the partnership opportunities as well as the security related concerns in this part of the world, particularly in the light of the continuing Russian aggression against Ukraine and attempts to settle it. \u201c\nPresident Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be holding a summit to discuss the possible terms of a peace settlement next Friday in Alaska.\nThune\u2019s delegation to Europe is happening alongside other congressional travel organized for the August recess. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) traveled to Israel with a group of GOP lawmakers, drawing controversy for a reported visit to the West Bank.\nSENATE DEFEATS GROWING DEMOCRATIC BID TO RESTRICT ISRAELI MILITARY AID\nSen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is set to lead a separate delegation to Taiwan, a trip that follows the administration\u2019s decision to block Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te from making a brief stop in New York.\nThe Taiwan visit comes as Trump attempts to broker a new trade framework with Beijing, which claims territorial control over the island nation.\nMarisa Schultz contributed to this report."

The lawsuits are not directed at Starbucks and Jimmy John\u2019s, but rather two companies that have contracted to run locations in the Longworth and Rayburn office buildings on their behalf.\nThe suits, filed before the District of Columbia\u2019s civil courts division on July 18, allege that under D.C. law, the vendors are obligated to hire existing employees from the restaurants they are replacing, in this case Dunkin\u2019 and Subway, for at least 90 days and offer them permanent employment if their job performance is \u201csatisfactory.\u201d\nLocal 23, which represents Sodexo employees whose contracts are ending under a larger reshuffling of House eateries, claims that jobs have not been offered to its members, naming three workers in its wrongful termination suits.\nAccording to court documents, a hearing date for the defendants, Elite Retail Group and FCW Investments, has been set for Oct. 17. The Washington Examiner has contacted the defendants for comment.\nThe lawsuits coincide with a boycott announced this week alongside members of the Congressional Labor Caucus. Local 23 is asking lawmakers, staffers, and visitors not to frequent at least five vendors that will take over the current offerings in the coming weeks.\nHOUSE GETS MENU MAKEOVER WITH LOCAL CHAINS AND FAN FAVORITES\nTwo of the vendors, Metz and TMCA, have agreed to hire a subset of the Sodexo workers, according to a union representative, but it is not yet clear how many of its nearly 200 House employees will retain their jobs.\nIn the suits, Local 23 claims that the Starbucks vendor has not offered a job to two Dunkin\u2019 employees who submitted applications and that the Jimmy John\u2019s operator allowed a Subway employee to interview, but at a separate franchise location."

      "text": "Washington, D.C. \u2014 Senator Ted Budd (R-NC) released a statement after the U.S. Senate passed the Laken Riley Act. He and Senator Katie Britt (R-AL) led the introduction of the bill on January 7, 2025.\nThe bill is named after 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley who was murdered by an illegal alien on the University of Georgia campus last year. That illegal alien had been previously arrested for theft and shoplifting but was released.\nThe bill requires U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to arrest illegal aliens who commit theft, burglary, larceny, or shoplifting offenses and would mandate that these aliens are detained until they are removed from the United States.\nThe bill was led in the House by Rep. Mike Collins (R-GA).\nSen. Budd said in a statement:\n\u201cPassage of the Laken Riley Act is a victory for law and order and safety. What happened to Laken Riley should never happen to anyone. I am proud to have led this legislation with Senators Britt, Fetterman, and Majority Leader Thune and look forward to President Trump signing it into law.\nSenator Britt said:\n\u201cToday is a new day in America and a new day in the U.S. Senate with the passage of the Laken Riley Act\u2014which will become the strongest immigration enforcement bill enacted into law since 1996. I was honored to lead a bipartisan group of my colleagues to pass this lifesaving legislation.\n\u201cToday\u2019s monumental vote honors the beautiful life and enduring legacy of Laken Riley, who was taken from this world all too soon by a killer who never should have been in America in the first place,\u201d continued Senator Britt. \u201cI am proud the Laken Riley Act will be the very first landmark bill President Trump signs into law, and it is proof that President Trump and the Republican Senate Majority stand ready to come turn promises made into promises kept. Together, we will secure our southern border, protect American families and communities, and return to law and order.\u201d\nLaken Riley\u2019s mother Allyson and stepfather John Phillips said in a statement:\n\u201cThis is a truly momentous day. The Senate\u2019s passage of this purely commonsense bill will help save innocent lives and prevent more families from going through the kind of heartbreak we\u2019ve experienced. There is no greater gift imaginable to Laken and our country. We thank Senators Katie Britt and Ted Budd for their diligent, bipartisan work to get this bill through the Senate and Congressman Mike Collins for his continued leadership championing the Laken Riley Act in the House. Our family will forever be grateful for the prayers of people across our nation helping get this legislation into law. We pray Laken continues to do her good work here on earth and save lives. All glory to God.\u201d\n###"
