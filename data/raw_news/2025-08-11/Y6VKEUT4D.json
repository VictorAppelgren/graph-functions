  "content": "The future of California firefighting could someday happen without the deployment of humans. And that someday could be arriving sooner than we think, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe autonomous Sikorsky Black Hawk helicopter can use alerts from a satellite dish and sensors to locate a wildfire. Once it tracks the fire, its artificial intelligence forms a plan of attack. Once it locates a fire, it drops a load of water over the flames, intending to never let a fire grow larger than 10 square feet.\n\nThe Black Hawk, designed by Lockheed Martin and a California-based software company called Rain, is among the most advanced technologies developed for fighting fires in California \u2014 and it doesn't require putting any human lives at risk, the Times reported.\n\n \u201cThe dream is the evolution of this,\u201d Maxwell Brodie, Rain\u2019s chief executive, told the.

      "text": "- Share via\nA bolt of lightning strikes deep inside a California forest in the middle of the night.\nThe spark becomes a flame, and within seconds, a satellite dish swirling overhead picks up on the anomaly and triggers an alarm. An autonomous helicopter takes flight and zooms toward the fire, using sensors to locate the blaze and artificial intelligence to generate a plan of attack. It measures the wind speed and fire movement, communicating constantly with the unmanned helicopter behind it, and the one behind that.\nLos Angeles knows how to weather a crisis \u2014 or two or three. Angelenos are tapping into that resilience, striving to build a city for everyone.\nOnce over the site, it drops a load of water and soon the flames are smoldering. Without deploying a single human, the fire never grows larger than 10 square feet.\nThis is the future of firefighting.\nOn a recent morning in San Bernardino, state and local fire experts gathered for a demonstration of the early iterations of this new reality. An autonomous Sikorsky Black Hawk helicopter, powered by technology from Lockheed Martin and a California-based software company called Rain, is on display on the tarmac of a logistics airport in Victorville \u2014 the word \u201cEXPERIMENTAL\u201d painted on its military green-black door.\nIt\u2019s one of many new tools on the front lines of firefighting technology, which experts say is evolving rapidly as private industry and government agencies come face-to-face with a worsening global climate crisis. For many attendees, the trauma of January\u2019s firestorm in the Altadena and Pacific Palisades neighborhoods of Los Angeles remains top of mind.\nFire weather days have increased in Western U.S. over the last 50 years, with some of the largest jumps in California, according to a new report by Climate Central, a nonprofit news outlet that reports on climate change.\n\u201cThe dream is the evolution of this,\u201d said Maxwell Brodie, Rain\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe dream is to be able to live in your neighborhood knowing that there is protection from catastrophic high-intensity fire, and to feel safe. And I think that if we look hard at what is likely coming over the decades ahead, there\u2019s no time to waste.\u201d\nIndeed, the outlook for wildfire activity in the years and decades to come is concerning. Scientific studies and climate research models have found that the number of extreme fires could increase by as much as 30% globally by 2050. By 2100, California alone could see a 50% increase in wildfire frequency and a 77% increase in average annual acres burned, according to the state\u2019s most recent climate report.\nThat\u2019s largely because human-caused climate change is driving up temperatures and drying out the landscape, priming it to burn, according to Kate Dargan Marquis, a senior advisor with the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation who served as California\u2019s state fire marshal from 2007 to 2010.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really a controversial issue: Fires are going to increase in size, intensity and frequency across the western United States \u2014 probably globally in large measure \u2014 and it\u2019s because the atmosphere is getting hotter and drier,\u201d Dargan Marquis said. \u201cThat means the problem statement of wildfire is growing in front of us. The systems that we have built today, the communities that we have built today, the policies of today and the technologies of today are not going to serve us tomorrow. So we have to ramp up on all of those.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t all that long ago that firefighters were using paper maps and bag phones to navigate and respond to wildfires. Today, more than 1,100 mountaintop cameras positioned across California are already using artificial intelligence to scan the landscape for the first sign of flames and prompt crews to spring into action. NASA\u2019s Earth-observing satellites are studying landscape conditions to help better predict fires before they ignite, while a new global satellite constellation recently launched by Google is helping to detect fires faster than ever before.\nMuch of the innovation is coming from Southern California, according to Dan Munsey, chief of the San Bernardino County Fire Protection District who also chairs the technology committee of the International Fire Chiefs Assn.\nCal Fire is the first fire agency to use artificial intelligence to look for signs of wildfires and directly alert dispatch centers.\nThe goal, Munsey said, is to advance technology so that 95% of the state\u2019s fires can be limited to 10 square feet or less. It\u2019s something he likened to the moonshot \u2014 President Kennedy\u2019s goal of landing on the moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\u201cWe need to be bold with our vision in order to get to that new state,\u201d Munsey said. \u201cPeople look at it and say you\u2019re crazy, but you need a little bit of craziness because we\u2019re going to keep on burning down the Palisades and Altadena. We need to change the way we\u2019re doing business.\u201d\nSuch changes must include a top-down reconsideration of infrastructure, budgets and training, he said, which should occur in conjunction with the launch of satellite dishes, autonomous helicopters and drones, AI-powered cameras and other new tools.\n\u201cThe only effective way to keep our communities safe is to embrace technology and innovation,\u201d Munsey said.\nAs advanced as they may seem, the current tools are only scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible, according to Kirk McKinzie, a 35-year fire service veteran who studies and consults on fire service technologies.\nThink augmented reality helmets that will allow firefighters to create a 3-D image of a burning building in real time \u2014 including mapping exits, locating people in need of assistance and alerting crews ahead of a smoke explosion or structure collapse with time to spare.\nSmart fire trucks outfitted with sensors, cameras and radars will allow teams to get to blazes faster, and smart nozzles will monitor the flow of their hoses and alert in advance of water supply issues. Firefighters, too, will don uniforms with intelligent fabrics that will allow commanders to monitor their heart rates and other physiology metrics to spot a crew member in distress.\nSuch tools won\u2019t come cheap. Cost estimates for future technology are speculative and difficult to come by \u2014 its hard to say, for example, what a smart fire truck will cost in 2050 \u2014 but AI-powered rigs and autonomous helicopters will probably run fire departments millions of dollars.\nBut the real savings will come from prevented fires, McKinzie said. The estimated damage from L.A.\u2019s firestorm alone is more than $250 billion.\nNew missions backed by Google, NASA and other groups will monitor the planet\u2019s worsening wildfire activity from outer space.\nAlthough these tools and solutions are not yet pervasive in the industry, there is growing acceptance that they must be considered, McKinzie and others say. \u201cThe question is, how do we get there, with due digital safeguards, yet swiftly?\u201d\nHe painted a picture of Los Angeles as a smart city \u2014 in which electric fire and EMT aircraft zip across the sky, utility grids detect ignition sources instantly, and houses can even douse themselves in fire retardant or gel ahead of advancing flames. Robots, too, will be used to fight fire in high-risk situations \u2014 as was already done in 2019 when a firefighting robot named Colossus, developed by the firm Shark Robotics, battled flames searing through Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris.\nIndeed, much of this technology is already in development or in existence from companies such as Verizon and AT&T and technology firms such as Pivotal, ERIS, Magic Leap, Qwake and FLAIM, which are pioneering personal response aircraft, augmented reality software, heads-up displays and thermal imaging devices, among other smart tools for firefighters.\nOne project in development from the Department of Homeland Security and NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is known as AUDREY, or the Assistant for Understanding Data through Reasoning, Extraction and Synthesis, which will use AI to track fire crews as they move through an environment using head-mounted displays or mobile devices, collecting data to guide them through flames and monitor for danger.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think that the industry can take a step forward with technology,\u201d McKinzie said. \u201cWhether that is an expanded early response, whether it\u2019s an early notification to citizens to preserve property and life, or an intelligent grid to inform infrastructure entities responsible for water supplies of a pending shortage, it is a multi-factor equation.\u201d\nIn fact, finding water is also an issue that experts hope to soon resolve. During the Palisades fire, crews reported that scores of fire hydrants ran dry or suffered from low pressure, while a reservoir in the area sat empty as the fire burned.\nCal Fire\u2019s new maps for Southern California added 3.5 million acres into fire-hazard zones, increasing the acreage in the highest hazard zone by 26%.\nOne group tackling this problem is Wildfire Water Solutions, a startup that brings water directly to the scene of a fire through a system of mobile pumps, pipes and tanks, saving crews valuable time that is often spent transporting water tenders and securing their own supplies. The system can deliver a continuous flow of more than 150,000 gallons of water per hour up to 50 miles away from its source, according to Chief Executive Mike Echols. It can even desalinate water quickly, which means ocean water could potentially be used to fight a blaze like the Palisades fire in the future.\nSuch a system could have made a \u201chuge difference\u201d in January, Echols said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything can prevent an act of nature like that, but just think about having a continuous water supply network to disperse wherever it\u2019s needed.\u201d\nAnother forward-looking firm, Frontline Wildfire Defense, has created a sprinkler system that uses fire-tracking technology to detect blazes near a home. Once triggered, the system saturates the house and property with water and firefighting foam, \u201ccreating an environment that is too wet to burn,\u201d according to the company.\nIt\u2019s not only private industry that is building L.A.\u2019s firefighting future. Government officials also understand the growing urgency of the situation.\nProposed federal legislation known as the \u201cFix Our Forests Act,\u201d which is currently working its way through Congress, calls for the development of a suite of a high-tech products among its plans for managing forests and reducing wildfire threats, including AI and augmented reality tools, infrared-equipped low-Earth orbit satellites, and quantum computing applications. The bill has passed the House and is pending in the Senate.\nMeanwhile, a state assembly bill, AB 270, would direct the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to establish a pilot program to assess the viability of incorporating autonomous firefighting helicopters in the state. The agency in 2023 opened its own Office of Wildfire Technology Research and Development, which is dedicated to investigating new tools for emergency response, including ways to enhance firefighters\u2019 situational awareness and to use AI to power drones, data collection and post-fire analyses.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we either keep pace with technology, or technology advances past us,\u201d said Cal Fire Chief Joe Tyler.\nBut while technology continues to advance, some say there must also be an evolution of the ways in which Californians think about fire.\nGet informed on the latest California fires, worldwide fire news, fire preparedness tips, and more.\nFor years, the majority of the state\u2019s residents and firefighting agencies have operated under an ethos that all fire is bad \u2014 ignoring Indigenous burning practices and the fact that fire has been a natural part of California\u2019s landscape since long before humans ever arrived. By keeping fire out of the state\u2019s wildlands altogether, California has grown thick with branches, brush and understory that are now acting as fuel for the state\u2019s ever-larger blazes.\n\u201cWe have some challenges in front of us recognizing that there is a need for fire in many landscapes,\u201d said Dargan Marquis, the former state fire marshal, who also spent 30 years as a firefighter and chief. In addition to advancing new firefighting technology, \u201chow do we also, at the same time, hold in our heads and in our strategies and in our goals that fire is beneficial?\u201d\nThough much of present progress is by necessity focused on extinguishing flames, she hopes that in the years ahead, experts and technology will also find ways to incorporate as much \u201cgood fire\u201d as possible.\n\u201cWe can see a pathway to moving our technology, our fire service, our social acceptance and our entire wildfire perspective through an understanding \u2014 an arc of change \u2014 where fires become manageable events and then eventually, in 50 years, we can see them as valuable opportunities,\u201d she said.\nThere are other kinks to work out as well. In San Bernardino, officials had to cancel their scheduled demonstration of the autonomous Black Hawk helicopter due to 80 mph wind that day.\nBrodie, Rain\u2019s chief executive, was disappointed but not deterred. Wind is a huge factor in many fires \u2014 including the Palisades and Eaton fires \u2014 and sending autonomous aircraft in when it\u2019s too dangerous for humans to fly is among his goals.\n\u201cThe thing that keeps me up at night, and gets me up in the morning, is moving faster in advancing these technologies that we have \u2014 that are already here \u2014 so that we can start moving faster towards this future,\u201d Brodie said. He noted that the combination of satellite constellations, smart grid data, early detection cameras and pre-positioned autonomous resources \u201cjust make sense, and the economics pencil out.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the special moment we are in now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t do this.\u201d"
