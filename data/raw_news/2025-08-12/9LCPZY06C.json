  "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is down -0.16%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is down -0.40%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is down - 0.26%.\n\nStock indexes today are negative. Dovish Fed comments have pushed T-note yields lower, with the 10-year T-note yield down -2 bp to 4.26% after Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she supports an interest rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and that she favors three interest rate cuts this year. However, stocks fell back from their best levels on position squaring and long liquidation ahead of this week's US inflation reports on July CPI and PPI.\n\nStrength in chip makers is also a supportive factor for stocks today after Bloomberg reported that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to pay 15% of revenue from China chip sales to the US government, which boosts optimism that chip export restrictions to China will be eased. Also, Micron Technology is up more than +3% after raising its Q4 sales estimate.\n\nHopes have dimmed for an imminent end to the Russian-Ukrainian war. Markets last week initially found support on news of a Trump-Putin summit this Friday in Alaska. However, over the weekend, comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.\n\nOn Saturday, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she supports cutting interest rates at the FOMC's next meeting in September and that she favors three rate cuts this year to \"help avoid a further unnecessary erosion in labor market conditions and reduce the chance that the committee will need to implement a larger policy correction should the labor market deteriorate further.\" The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 89% from 40% earlier this month.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) is up more than +0.5% today , boosted by strong demand from institutional investors and corporate buyers, which are helping to lift the entire cryptocurrency market. According to data from Coingecko, digital-asset treasury companies, listed vehicles that accumulate cryptocurrencies, have amassed a Bitcoin stockpile worth $113 billion thus far.\n\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump announced last Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, President Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nThe market's focus this week will be on corporate earnings results and any new trade or tariff news. On Tuesday, the July US CPI is expected to edge up to +2.8% y/y from +2.7% y/y in June, and the July CPI ex-food and energy is expected to climb +3.0% y/y from +2.9% y/y in June. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -1,000 to 225,000. Also on Thursday, the July final-demand PPI is expected to increase to +2.5% y/y from +2.3% y/y in June, and the July PPI ex-food and energy is expected to rise to +2.9% y/y from +2.6% y/y in June. On Friday, July US retail sales are expected to climb +0.5% m/m and retail sales ex-autos are expected to rise +0.3% m/m. Also on Friday, July manufacturing production is expected to remain unchanged m/m. Finally, the University of Michigan's Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to climb by +0.3 to 62.0.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 89% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 62% at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 82% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\n\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell from a 1-week high and is down -0.31%. China's Shanghai Composite rallied to a 10-month high and closed up +0.34%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 was closed today for the Mountain Day holiday.\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are up by +3 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is down -1.9 bp to 4.264%. T-notes are moving higher on mounting speculation that the Fed may soon cut interest rates after Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she supports an interest rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and that she favors three interest rate cuts this year. T-notes also have carryover support from last Thursday, when President Trump nominated Stephen Miran for Fed Governor to replace Adriana Kugler for the rest of the year. Miran views President Trump's policies as disinflationary and would support a more dovish Fed policy.\n\nEuropean government bond yields today are mixed. The 10-year German bund yield is up +0.4 bp to 2.694%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is down -3.8 bp to 4.563%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 6% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nSemiconductor stocks are climbing today after Bloomberg reported that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to pay 15% of revenue from China chip sales to the US government, which boosts optimism that chip export restrictions to China will be eased. ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) is up more than +3%. Also, ON Semiconductor (ON), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell Technology (MRVL) are up more than +2%. In addition, Applied Materials (AMAT), Analog Devices (ADI), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Lam Research (LRCX) are up more than +1%.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) is up more than +3% after raising its fiscal Q4 sales estimate to $11.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million, from a previous estimate of $10.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million.\n\nCryptocurrency-linked stocks are climbing today after the price of Bitcoin rose by more than +2% to a 4-week high. As a result, Coinbase Global (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are up more than +3%.\n\nSapiens International Corp NV (SPNS) is up more than +12% after Calcalist reported that Formula Systems is in advanced talks to sell control of the company for about $2 billion.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) is up more than +9% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 after operations were halted at a major Chinese mine, spurring speculation that the Chinese government might move to suspend other lithium projects to tackle overcapacity concerns.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) is up more than +8% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight with a price target of $134.\n\nKratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS) is up more than +5% after Canaccord Genuity initiated coverage on the stock with a recommendation of buy and a price target of $74.\n\nIntel (INTC) is up more than +4% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 after the Wall Street Journal reported that CEO Lip-Bu Tan is scheduled to meet with President Trump later today.\n\nMonday.com (MNDY) is down more than -26% after reporting Q2 cash and cash equivalents of $1.59 billion, below the consensus of $1.61 billion.\n\nC3.ai (AI) is down more than -23% after DA Davidson downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral with a price target of $13, citing preliminary earnings results that were \"significantly below guidance.\"\n\nAAON Inc. (AAON) is down more than -13% after reporting Q2 EPS of 19 cents, well below the consensus of 32 cents.\n\nHershey (HSY) is down more than -5% to lead losers in the S&P 500 and chocolate makers on demand concerns after cocoa prices surged more than +9% to a 6-week high.\n\nUpstart Holdings (UPST) is down more than -4% after announcing it will offer $500 million of convertible senior notes due in 2032 in a private offering.\n\nAAON Inc (AAON), AST SpaceMobile Inc (ASTS), Celanese Corp (CE), Ralliant Corp (RAL), Roivant Sciences Ltd (ROIV).",

New delayed trade updates are updated on the page as indicated by a \"flash\".\nBarchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43)\nQuoteboard data fields include:\n- Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session.\n- Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram.\n- Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session.\n- Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.\n- YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.\nChart Snapshot\nA thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.\nPrice Performance\nThis section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the \"See More\" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.\nOptions Overview\nHighlights important summary options statistics to provide a forward looking indication of investors' sentiment.\n- Implied Volatility: The average implied volatility (IV) of the nearest monthly options contract that is 30-days or more out. IV is a forward looking prediction of the likelihood of price change of the underlying asset, with a higher IV signifying that the market expects significant price movement, and a lower IV signifying the market expects the underlying asset price to remain within the current trading range.\n- 30-Day Historical Volatility: The average deviation from the average price over the last 30 days. Historical Volatility is a measurement of how fast the underlying security has been changing in price back in time.\n- IV Percentile: The percentage of days with IV closing below the current IV value over the prior 1-year. A high IV Percentile means the current IV is at a higher level than for most of the past year. This would occur after a period of significant price movement, and a high IV Percentile can often predict a coming market reversal in price.\n- IV Rank: The current IV compared to the highest and lowest values over the past 1-year. If IV Rank is 100% this means the IV is at its highest level over the past 1-year, and can signify the market is overbought.\n- IV High: The highest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- IV Low: The lowest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- Put/Call Vol Ratio: The total Put/Call volume ratio for all option contracts (across all expiration dates). A high put/call ratio can signify the market is oversold as more traders are buying puts rather than calls, and a low put/call ratio can signify the market is overbought as more traders are buying calls rather than puts.\n- Today's Volume: The total volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) traded during the current session.\n- Volume Avg (30-Day): The average volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30-days.\n- Put/Call OI Ratio: The put/call open interest ratio for all options contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Today's Open Interest: The total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Open Int (30-Day): The average total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30 days.\nBarchart Technical Opinion\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overall Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy.\nThe Opinion will show on the Quote Overview Page for all asset classes with this exception: For all U.S. Stocks, the Market Cap must be greater than $1B.\nA symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:\n- Strong Buy (greater than \"66% Buy\")\n- Buy (greater than or equal to \"33% Buy\" and less than or equal to \"66% Buy\")\n- Weak Buy (\"0% Buy\" through \"33% Buy\")\n- Hold\n- Strong Sell (greater than \"66% Sell\")\n- Sell (greater than or equal to \"33% Sell\" and less than or equal to \"66% Sell\")\n- Weak Sell (\"0% Sell\" through \"33% Sell\")\nThe current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: \"The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: \"The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: \"The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: \"The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal.\"\nRelated Stocks\nFor comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.\nBarchart Commodities Insider Commentary\nBarchart Commodities Insider is Ag market commentary for Grains and Oilseeds, Energy, Gold, Silver, Cocoa, Coffee, and Sugar markets.\nMost Recent Stories\nView the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).\nToday's New Highs & Lows\nThe New Highs/Lows widget provides a snapshot of US stocks that have made or matched a new high or low price for a specific time period. Stocks must have traded for the specified time period in order to be considered as a new High or Low.\nNew Highs/Lows only includes stocks traded on NYSE, NYSE Arca, Nasdaq or OTC-US exchanges with over 5 days of prices, with a last price above $0.25 and below $10,000, and with volume greater than 1000 shares.\nCalculations are adjusted for stock splits but not dividend distributions. Numbers exclude exclude unit investment trusts, closed end funds, warrant stocks, preferred securities and any non-SIC classified stock.\nPercentage of Stocks Above Moving Average\nFor the major indices on the site, this widget shows the percentage of stocks contained in the index that are above their 20-Day, 50-Day, 100-Day, 150-Day, and 200-Day Moving Averages.\nIn theory, the direction of the moving average (higher, lower or flat) indicates the trend of the market. Its slope indicates the strength of the trend. Longer averages are used to identify longer-term trends. Shorter averages are used to identify shorter-term trends. Many trading systems utilize moving averages as independent variables and market analysts frequently use moving averages to confirm technical breakouts.\nWhen prices are rising they are usually above the average. This is to be expected since the average includes data from the previous, lower priced days. As long as prices remain above the average there is strength in the market."

If IV Rank is 100% this means the IV is at its highest level over the past 1-year, and can signify the market is overbought.\n- IV High: The highest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- IV Low: The lowest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- Put/Call Vol Ratio: The total Put/Call volume ratio for all option contracts (across all expiration dates). A high put/call ratio can signify the market is oversold as more traders are buying puts rather than calls, and a low put/call ratio can signify the market is overbought as more traders are buying calls rather than puts.\n- Today's Volume: The total volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) traded during the current session.\n- Volume Avg (30-Day): The average volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30-days.\n- Put/Call OI Ratio: The put/call open interest ratio for all options contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Today's Open Interest: The total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Open Int (30-Day): The average total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30 days.\nBarchart Technical Opinion\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overall Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy.\nThe Opinion will show on the Quote Overview Page for all asset classes with this exception: For all U.S. Stocks, the Market Cap must be greater than $1B.\nA symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:\n- Strong Buy (greater than \"66% Buy\")\n- Buy (greater than or equal to \"33% Buy\" and less than or equal to \"66% Buy\")\n- Weak Buy (\"0% Buy\" through \"33% Buy\")\n- Hold\n- Strong Sell (greater than \"66% Sell\")\n- Sell (greater than or equal to \"33% Sell\" and less than or equal to \"66% Sell\")\n- Weak Sell (\"0% Sell\" through \"33% Sell\")\nThe current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: \"The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: \"The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: \"The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: \"The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal.\"\nRelated Stocks\nFor comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.\nBarchart Commodities Insider Commentary\nBarchart Commodities Insider is Ag market commentary for Grains and Oilseeds, Energy, Gold, Silver, Cocoa, Coffee, and Sugar markets.\nMost Recent Stories\nView the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).\nToday's New Highs & Lows\nThe New Highs/Lows widget provides a snapshot of US stocks that have made or matched a new high or low price for a specific time period. Stocks must have traded for the specified time period in order to be considered as a new High or Low.\nNew Highs/Lows only includes stocks traded on NYSE, NYSE Arca, Nasdaq or OTC-US exchanges with over 5 days of prices, with a last price above $0.25 and below $10,000, and with volume greater than 1000 shares.\nCalculations are adjusted for stock splits but not dividend distributions. Numbers exclude exclude unit investment trusts, closed end funds, warrant stocks, preferred securities and any non-SIC classified stock.\nPercentage of Stocks Above Moving Average\nFor the major indices on the site, this widget shows the percentage of stocks contained in the index that are above their 20-Day, 50-Day, 100-Day, 150-Day, and 200-Day Moving Averages.\nIn theory, the direction of the moving average (higher, lower or flat) indicates the trend of the market. Its slope indicates the strength of the trend. Longer averages are used to identify longer-term trends. Shorter averages are used to identify shorter-term trends. Many trading systems utilize moving averages as independent variables and market analysts frequently use moving averages to confirm technical breakouts.\nWhen prices are rising they are usually above the average. This is to be expected since the average includes data from the previous, lower priced days. As long as prices remain above the average there is strength in the market."

      "text": "The Quote Overview page gives you a snapshot view for a specific index. During market hours, indices are 15 minute delay, ET. New delayed trade updates are updated on the page as indicated by a \"flash\".\nBarchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43)\nQuoteboard data fields include:\n- Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session.\n- Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram.\n- Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session.\n- Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.\n- YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.\nChart Snapshot\nA thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.\nPrice Performance\nThis section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods.

IV is a forward looking prediction of the likelihood of price change of the underlying asset, with a higher IV signifying that the market expects significant price movement, and a lower IV signifying the market expects the underlying asset price to remain within the current trading range.\n- 30-Day Historical Volatility: The average deviation from the average price over the last 30 days. Historical Volatility is a measurement of how fast the underlying security has been changing in price back in time.\n- IV Percentile: The percentage of days with IV closing below the current IV value over the prior 1-year. A high IV Percentile means the current IV is at a higher level than for most of the past year. This would occur after a period of significant price movement, and a high IV Percentile can often predict a coming market reversal in price.\n- IV Rank: The current IV compared to the highest and lowest values over the past 1-year. If IV Rank is 100% this means the IV is at its highest level over the past 1-year, and can signify the market is overbought.\n- IV High: The highest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- IV Low: The lowest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- Put/Call Vol Ratio: The total Put/Call volume ratio for all option contracts (across all expiration dates). A high put/call ratio can signify the market is oversold as more traders are buying puts rather than calls, and a low put/call ratio can signify the market is overbought as more traders are buying calls rather than puts.\n- Today's Volume: The total volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) traded during the current session.\n- Volume Avg (30-Day): The average volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30-days.\n- Put/Call OI Ratio: The put/call open interest ratio for all options contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Today's Open Interest: The total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Open Int (30-Day): The average total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30 days.\nBarchart Technical Opinion\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overall Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals.
