  "content": "Ivanna Sakhno, who plays Shin Hati in the Ahsoka show, has given a very exciting update on filming for the second installment.\n\nAt the end of Ahsoka, Shin Hati was abandoned by her mentor Baylan Skoll on Peridea, leaving her stranded and alone. Following the death of Baylan actor Ray Stevenson, Game of Thrones star Rory McCann has stepped in to play his character, as confirmed at Star Wars Celebration 2025.\n\n\"We're in the middle of filming right now. I'm reporting to you from London, so I... get to see Rory nearly daily at the moment, and he has been amazing to work with,\" Sakhno told The Direct. \"I will have his work speak for itself, but he is definitely a gift for us to have. And there couldn't have been anyone better to take on this role.\"\n\nThis seemingly suggests that Shin will indeed reunite with Baylan again in season 2, but that remains to be seen.\n\nNot much is known about Ahsoka season 2 just yet, but we do know that Hayden Christensen will return as Anakin Skywalker, Admiral Ackbar will face off against Grand Admiral Thrawn, and there was even a behind closed doors first look at Celebration teasing giant droids and battles across galaxies.\n\n\"You know, there's absolutely nothing that I can speak on at the moment, and I wish I could share with you something at least, because it's such an exciting time for us to be back together, and we're currently in the middle of filming it,\" Sakhno previously told GamesRadar+. \"All I can say is that it is bigger and even more in-depth, and I'm really excited for people to see it. It means the world.\"\n\nAhsoka season 2 doesn't yet have a release date. While you wait, check out our guide to all the upcoming Star Wars movies and shows for everything else the galaxy far, far away has in store.",

I was like, 'That sounds really cool, George.' And then just how well it was presented in the animated world, I was just really excited to get to do that in live-action.\"\nSeason 1 ended with Ahsoka and Sabine stranded on Peridea with Anakin watching over them. We can guess that Anakin will continue to guide his former Padawan in the new season, just as he did in season 1.\nThe panel also revealed that Rory McCann will take over from the late Ray Stevenson as Baylan Skoll, Admiral Ackbar will feature, and there was even a first look (of sorts).\nNext up for Star Wars is Andor season 2, which arrives in a triple episode premiere on Disney Plus this April 22 in the US and April 23 in the UK.\nIn the meantime, check out our guide to all the upcoming Star Wars movies and shows, or see our roundup of everything announced and what to expect at Star Wars Celebration 2025 through the link.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nI'm the Deputy Entertainment Editor here at GamesRadar+, covering all things film and TV for the site's Total Film and SFX sections.

      "text": "Ahsoka star Ivanna Sakhno says the Star Wars show's second season is \"currently in the middle of filming\" and promises a \"bigger\" and \"even more in-depth\" journey: \"I'm really excited for people to see it\"\nExclusive: M3GAN 2.0 star Ivanna Sakhno gives us an exciting update on Ahsoka season 2, which is currently filming\nAlmost 2 years after season 1 hit Disney Plus, Ahsoka season 2 is finally on the way, and it sounds as though filming on the upcoming installment is going well. Although the star is unable to spill any beans on her character or the plot, Ivanna Sakhno has given an exciting update on the scale of the new season.\n\"You know, there's absolutely nothing that I can speak on at the moment, and I wish I could share with you something at least, because it's such an exciting time for us to be back together, and we're currently in the middle of filming it,\" Sakhno tells GamesRadar+. \"All I can say is that it is bigger and even more in-depth, and I'm really excited for people to see it. It means the world.\"\nThe Star Wars show hit Disney Plus in 2023 and took the fandom by storm, so much so that it was renewed for a second season in January 2024. However, since then, updates have been scarce. Much like Sakhno, the rest of the Ahsoka cast and crew have been keeping rather tight-lipped on details surrounding the highly anticipated season.\nWe last saw Sakhno\u2019s character Shin Hati at the end of Ahsoka season 1, abandoned by her master, Baylan Skoll, as he left to embark on a mysterious quest related to the Mortis Gods. However, in a bid to find her purpose, she aligns herself with a group of local bandits, suggesting she could become some sort of a leader in the next season.\nWith Shin now left to her own devices, it seems like the lightsaber slinger might get into some trouble, but that won\u2019t be a problem for Sakhno, as the star spent her break on Ahsoka taking on the role of evil AI bot AMELIA in new movie M3GAN 2.0. In the horror sequel, AMELIA is a military grade weapon, hellbent on killing anyone who has anything to do with her creation, including M3GAN\u2019s builder Gemma. This threw Sakhno into plenty of action sequences.\n\"I had a wonderful, wonderful stunt team and personal trainer as well, who are very grounded people, and honestly work a lot with energy and being present in your own body,\" says Sakhno. \"We did quite a bit of obviously, like Krav Maga and different styles of fighting. We also did Tai Chi and studied the ability to move your energy from one place to another in order to remain still.\"\nIt looks like any Jedi will have to think twice about taking on Shin next season. Ahsoka season 2 does not yet have a release date.\nM3GAN 2.0 is out in theaters now, but before you reunite with the diva doll, make sure to read our M3GAN 2.0 review first.

      "text": "Ahsoka season 2 release date speculation, cast, story, and everything else you need to know about the Star Wars show\nGet up to speed on Ahsoka season 2\nAhsoka season 2 is filming as we speak, so there's not long to wait to return to Peridea (and the galaxy far, far away) for the next installment in the story of Anakin Skywalker's wayward Padawan.\nWhile news has been scarce on the next chapter, at Star Wars Celebration 2025, creator Dave Filoni revealed plenty about what we can expect, and you can read all about that below. Plus, we recently got an exclusive update on filming from Shin Hati star Ivanna Sakhno.\nYou can find all that and more below, where we've collected absolutely everything there is to know about Ahsoka season 2. We're keeping up to date with all the latest news, too, so you can get up to speed on the return of Snips at a glance. And, for even more, see our guides on watching The Clone Wars in order or our streamlined list of what to watch before Ahsoka to catch up on the character's storied history.\nAhsoka season 2 release date speculation\nAhsoka season 2 doesn't yet have a release date. It's now in production, though, as Rosario Dawson confirmed with a behind the scenes picture on her Instagram.\nNo release window was revealed during Star Wars Celebration, but it's looking likely that we can expect the Ahsoka season 2 release date to fall in 2026.\nRecently, Shin Hati actor Ivanna Sakhno gave us an update on filming, too. \"You know, there's absolutely nothing that I can speak on at the moment, and I wish I could share with you something at least, because it's such an exciting time for us to be back together, and we're currently in the middle of filming it,\" she revealed. \"All I can say is that it is bigger and even more in-depth, and I'm really excited for people to see it. It means the world.\"\nAhsoka season 2 plot\nAhsoka ended with Ahsoka Tano and Sabine Wren stranded in Peridea, while Grand Admiral Thrawn and Ezra Bridger both made it home to the main Star Wars galaxy. In the final moments of the season, we see Anakin Skywalker watching over Ahsoka and Sabine with a smile.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nFiloni shared the first piece of concept art back in early 2024, providing some more clues. Baylan Skoll was last seen on a giant statue of the Father, a Force god representing the balance who was killed in The Clone Wars (read our World Between Worlds explainer for a full explanation). It would seem Baylan is seeking a great power, and the first piece of concept art for the new season shows Ahsoka and Sabine on the same statue, which is pointing into the distance.\nCould Baylan be seeking the power of the World Between Worlds? One thing we do know for sure is that the Mortis gods will factor into the Ahsoka season 2 plot. \"It's a big mystery,\" Filoni teased of the statues on Peridea at Star Wars Celebration. \"The Son's there, the Father's there, most of the Daughter's there. So yeah, we'll figure it out. It's a good story.\"\nGame of Thrones star Rory McCann will be taking over from the late Ray Stevenson as Baylan Skoll, which means his story definitely isn't over yet.\nAlso at Star Wars Celebration, Hayden Christensen confirmed he'll return as Anakin Skywalker, so we know Skyguy will factor into the plot so far.\nPlus, Filoni revealed that Admiral Ackbar will appear in the new season, and he'll be facing off against Thrawn. Expect an epic naval battle from two of Star Wars's greatest strategists.\nThanks to a teaser trailer Filoni patched together from concept art and a retro voiceover, we also know that Sabine and Ahsoka will be battling giant evil droids, while battles will take place across two galaxies, and she'll eventually have another showdown with Baylan.\nAhsoka season 2 trailer: when might we get one?\nThere's no trailer for Ahsoka season 2 just yet, since we're still a long way away from the new episodes releasing. But, a teaser trailer made from concept art and a retro-style voiceover was played for those in attendance at Star Wars Celebration 2025. Filoni explained that he was inspired by a similar trailer for The Empire Strikes Back, which was shown before George Lucas had filmed any of the sequel movie \u2013 since, at the time, Ahsoka season 2 hadn't begun shooting, either.\nThe trailer was brief, but it showed Ahsoka and Sabine battling giant evil droids, Ezra Bridger running in a flight suit, and plenty of Grand Admiral Thrawn, as well as a showdown between Ahsoka and Baylan Skoll. It's unclear if this one will ever be released to the public, or if it was a special treat just for those in attendance at Celebration.\nAhsoka season 2 cast\nHayden Christensen and Rosario Dawson are confirmed for the cast of Ahsoka season 2. Sadly, Ray Stevenson, who played Baylan Skoll in season 1, died in 2023. He's being replaced by Game of Thrones star Rory McCann for season 2.\nZeb, from Rebels, will show up at some point, but it's unknown just yet who'll be portraying him. Some other stars, including David Tennant, who plays Huyang, remain unconfirmed at present.\nThe Ahsoka season 2 cast so far:\n- Rosario Dawson \u2013 Ahsoka Tano\n- Natasha Liu Bordizzo \u2013 Sabine Wren\n- Lars Mikkelsen \u2013 Grand Admiral Thrawn\n- Eman Esfandi \u2013 Ezra Bridger\n- Mary Elizabeth Winstead \u2013 Hera Syndulla\n- Hayden Christensen \u2013 Anakin Skywalker\n- Rory McCann \u2013 Baylan Skoll\n- Ivanna Sakhno \u2013 Shin Hati\nHow many episodes of Ahsoka season 2 are likely?\nNothing is confirmed just yet, but we expect the Ahsoka season 2 episode count to be the same as season 1 \u2013 eight episodes. That's also the same as all three seasons of The Mandalorian.\nWhere to watch Ahsoka season 2\nThe only place to watch Ahsoka season 2 is Disney Plus, and, for that, you'll need a subscription. The streamer is the home of all the Star Wars shows and movies, so you can get caught up on the rest of the saga, too.\nHowever, season 1 is being released physically \u2013 so we can probably expect season 2 to eventually get a physical release, too.\nThat's a wrap on Ahsoka season 2.

      "text": "Who is Grand Admiral Thrawn in Star Wars? The Ahsoka villain explained\nAn important Imperial leader is back\nGrand Admiral Thrawn is back. The menacing Star Wars villain made the jump to live-action in Ahsoka episode 6 after plenty of build up, but, if you haven't seen Star Wars Rebels, you might be sketchy on his backstory \u2013 and just what makes him such a formidable threat. That's where we come in.\nWe've got everything you need to know about Grand Admiral Thrawn below, so you can get up to speed now that all episodes of Ahsoka are streaming on Disney Plus. Naturally, that means you'll find Ahsoka and Rebels spoilers ahead.\nIf you want to catch up on the animated Star Wars shows in earnest, though, then look no further than our complete guide on everything you need to know about Star Wars Rebels. There's also our roundup of what to watch before Ahsoka and how to watch The Clone Wars in order.\nWho is Grand Admiral Thrawn?\nThe blue-skinned Imperial made his first appearance in the old Legends continuity of Star Wars, which was made non-canon after Disney bought Lucasfilm and started its own continuity. However, Thrawn wasn't gone long, soon making a reappearance in novels written by his original creator Timothy Zahn.\nReal name Mitth'raw'nuruodo, Thrawn was in charge of taking out the Rebels in Lothal in Star Wars Rebels. He's personally met the Emperor and has worked with Darth Vader \u2013 and, before that, he encountered Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars. He's famous for his strategic brilliance and is a calm and surprisingly collected villain, which only makes him all the more chilling.\nWho is playing Grand Admiral Thrawn in Ahsoka?\nIt was revealed at Star Wars Celebration 2023 that Thrawn will be played by none other than Lars Mikkelsen, who voiced the character in Rebels. The first Ahsoka teaser featured only a glimpse of the back of Thrawn's head, but the second trailer finally unveiled a front-facing look at the Imperial in all his glory.\nWhere have we seen Grand Admiral Thrawn in Star Wars before?\nThrawn's entrance to the new Star Wars canon comes in Zahn's trilogy of novels, the first of which was published in 2017. They chart the Grand Admiral's past, including how he was found in the Outer Rim, and his rise to power through the ranks of the Imperial Navy.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nThe character then reappears in the animated Rebels series, going up against the young Jedi Ezra Bridger and his friends multiple times. This includes a run-in with Hera Syndulla on her home planet of Ryloth, as well as getting involved (via hologram) when Sabine Wren returns to Mandalore and fights the Imperial presence there. Thrawn, Chiss of culture that he is, also has a collection of Sabine's artwork, weirdly enough.\nThrawn has been mentioned twice in The Mandalorian \u2013 once in season 2 episode 5, when Ahsoka demands to know where he is, and again in season 3 episode 7, when a group of Imperials discusses his apparently imminent return. How's that for ominous?\nIn the Legends continuity, which is no longer part of the Star Wars lore, Thrawn had the same tactical skill as his canon counterpart. Interestingly, he had a plan to return after his death through a clone, just like Palpatine in the sequel trilogy \u2013 though the Grand Admiral's double was destroyed.\nWhat happens to Grand Admiral Thrawn in Star Wars Rebels?\nEventually, in the Star Wars Rebels season 4 finale, Ezra is able to stop Thrawn from destroying Lothal by sending the two of them, who were on the same ship together, to locations unknown via purrgils (giant, space whale-style creatures that can travel through hyperspace). They weren't found until Ahsoka episode 6.\nWhat happens to Thrawn in Ahsoka?\nWell, it took a bit of time before we actually met him, but Thrawn made his triumphant return in Ahsoka episode 6. The blue-skinned Imperial was located by Morgan Elsbeth, after her ancestors, the Nightsisters of Dathomir, called to her across multiple galaxies. We've not seen too much of his plan yet, as he's mostly preoccupied with getting off the planet he's been stuck on, but given his army of Dark Troopers, we have to admit we're a little worried about what he has in store for the galaxy.\nIn Ahsoka episode 7, he showcases his tactical prowess by attacking the purgills (and Ahsoka), and he also discovers that Anakin was Ahsoka's master, which elicits a shocked reaction from the Grand Admiral. In Ahsoka episode 8, the worst comes to pass and Thrawn makes it off of Peridea and back to the main galaxy \u2013 while Ahsoka and Sabine are left stranded. Luckily, Ezra makes it back, too, though.\nWe'll most likely see Thrawn again in either a potential Ahsoka season 2 or Dave Filoni's Star Wars movie.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are streaming now on Disney Plus.\nFor everything coming soon to the galaxy far, far away, check out our guide to the upcoming Star Wars movies and Disney Plus TV shows through the link. You can also see our deep dives on the World Between Worlds and the history between Anakin and Ahsoka for even more on the new show.\nI'm the Deputy Entertainment Editor here at GamesRadar+, covering all things film and TV for the site's Total Film and SFX sections.

      "text": "Every new Star Wars movie and TV show currently in the works\nWhat you need to know about the new Star Wars movies and TV shows releasing in the next few years\nThere are so many upcoming Star Wars movies and shows on the way that it can be hard to keep up. Next year brings with it the first big screen adventure for the galaxy far, far away since 2019's The Rise of Skywalker, and there's plenty more where that came from.\nWith Andor season 2 wrapped up on Disney Plus, there's never been a better time to get up to date on what's next. Below, we've rounded up every single one of the upcoming Star Wars movies and shows, including some scrapped projects and the films with a more uncertain status, like Rian Johnson's trilogy. With the Star Wars timeline growing every year, our guide will help you keep everything straight.\nRight here, we have all the updates from Star Wars Celebration 2025, as well as exclusive quotes from an Ahsoka season 2 star. So, for all that and more, draw your lightsaber and get reading.\nNew Star Wars movies release dates\nWhen is the next Star Wars movie heading to cinemas? Well, we know that there are three Star Wars release dates penciled into the release schedule, but just which movies these are for is unclear at the moment. For now, these are the release dates Disney has announced:\n- May 26, 2026\n- December 17, 2027\nThe Mandalorian & Grogu\nRelease date: May 22, 2026\nThe Mandalorian and Grogu are headed to the big screen, in a film aptly titled The Mandalorian & Grogu. Star Wars made the surprise announcement online. \"I have loved telling stories set in the rich world that George Lucas created,\" Favreau said in a statement (via StarWars.com). \"The prospect of bringing the Mandalorian and his apprentice Grogu to the big screen is extremely exciting.\"\nThe announcement said the movie will \"lead\" the new slate of Star Wars films, and it's arriving on May 22, 2026. At D23 2024, attendees were treated to the first look at footage from the movie. It showed Grogu as Mando's bounty hunting apprentice, more of Zeb Orrelios, the return of the Razor Crest, and Baby Yoda hanging out with some Babu Friks (AKA Anzellan). So far, the only cast member news is Sigourney Weaver joining the line-up in an unknown role.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nStar Wars: Starfighter\nRelease date: 2027\nDeadpool and Wolverine director Shawn Levy is making a Star Wars movie, and Ryan Gosling is in the lead role. Revealed as Star Wars: Starfighter at Celebration 2025, the feature is moving along at pace, with a release window of 2027. No other details have been revealed, but Levy has spoken about what it was like signing up to the franchise with Total Film magazine. \"Getting that call was a great day,\" he said. \"I was in the edit room on All the Light We Cannot See, and I look at my phone, and it's [Lucasfilm president] Kathy Kennedy. Thus began a conversation that led to her inviting me in to develop and make my Star Wars movie. I'm putting everything I have into it, because I love that world, and it is a privilege to get to join that galaxy.\"\nAccording to Kathleen Kennedy, the movie will arrive after The Mandalorian & Grogu, and it will be set after The Rise of Skywalker. \"That's also in the future. It's all post-[the first] nine. Shawn's is a standalone Star Wars story that'll take place post-nine, maybe five or six years out,\" she said. \"And Mandalorian really stands on its own because there, we're dealing with a whole other era in the New Republic,\" Kennedy continued. \"We have other development going on in that space as well. So that's the space that we're pretty much focused on right at the moment, because obviously with Mandalorian, we have a pretty good sense of where that's going. And with this, it's all pretty much new characters. We may bring some of the characters back from the sequel saga, but pretty much new characters.\"\nExcitingly, we also more cast members: Mia Goth is set to play the villain. And, Matt Smith will reportedly be playing the saga's \"next great villain\" too.\nSimon Kinberg's new Star Wars trilogy\nRelease date: Unknown\nAccording to Deadline, Simon Kinberg is set to direct a new trilogy that will be considered episodes 10-12. There are no details other than Kinberg will write all three movies and produce them with Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy. It's unclear whether or not the movies will continue the Skywalker saga or create a new storyline entirely. In addition to the upcoming standalone Rey movie, Kinberg's trilogy is also reportedly set to feature Rey in some capacity.\nA new Rey movie\nRelease date: Unknown\nIt was revealed at Star Wars Celebration 2023 that a new movie is coming that will focus on Rey. The film will be set after The Rise of Skywalker and will see Rey rebuilding the Jedi Order. It will be directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. Watchmen showrunner Damon Lindelof and The Strain executive story editor Justin Britt-Gibson were originally attached to write, but exited the project. It was then announced that Steven Knight was working on the screenplay instead, with Kathleen Kennedy previously saying the script is weeks away. Knight, however, subsequently left the project, and George Nolfi took over.\nSpeaking to IGN, Kennedy also opened up on how the movie connects to the Skywalker Saga. \"Well, we're 15 years out from Rise of Skywalker, so we're post-war, post-First Order, and the Jedi are in disarray,\" she said. \"There's a lot of discussion around, 'Who are the Jedi? What are they doing? What's the state of the galaxy?' She's attempting to rebuild the Jedi Order, based on the books, based on what she promised Luke, so that's where we're going.\"\nFor her part, Obaid-Chinroy told CNN in early 2024 that they're about to create something \"very special.\" Fingers crossed! We caught up with Daisy Ridley herself, too, and she teased a little something about Rey's approach to rebuilding the Jedi Order: \"It's exciting, because there are lots of discoveries to be had, and that is going to continue to be a creative conversation. And I'm very excited to see.\" Mysterious...\nJames Mangold's Star Wars movie\nRelease date: Unknown\nIndiana Jones 5 director James Mangold is working on a film that will be set thousands of years in the past, focusing on the first Jedi. \"When I first started talking to [Kathleen Kennedy] about doing one of these pictures, what occurred to me was thinking about what kind of genre of movie within Star Wars I wanted to do,\" Mangold said on the Celebration Stage, after the film was announced. \"And I thought about a biblical epic, like The Ten Commandments, about the dawning of the Force. Where did the Force come from? When did we discover it? When did we learn how to use it?\"\n\"From the moment I stepped in and George [Lucas] brought me into the company, there's been a lot of interest in that,\" Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy told us back in June. \"I think it's a really nice complement to what we're doing with moving into the future with Rey, and then understanding a bit more of where this all came from,\" she said. \"Because it will be at the heart of creating the new Jedi Order, so to get a real sense of where that might have began with the dawn of the Jedi could be pretty cool.\" Kennedy confirmed the movie was still going ahead in February 2025 in an interview with Deadline. \"He got delayed a bit because of [A Complete Unknown] and the awards season,\" she explained.\nDave Filoni's Star Wars movie\nRelease date: Unknown\nIt was revealed at Celebration 2023 that Dave Filoni will helm a live-action Star Wars movie. It will bring together the Disney Plus shows so far (The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and The Book of Boba Fett) into a \"cinematic event\" that will take place between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.\nPer a recent report, Ahsoka season 2 is more likely to arrive before the Filoni movie, though. Filoni also recently teased the opening scene of the film. \"Because I've been writing [Ahsoka season 2], things have clicked and I have a much better idea about where things are going to go,\" he shared on the Happy Sad Confused podcast. \"I will say, I have an opening I really like quite a bit, I'm very excited about it for that picture. I'm excited about the potential of just doing it.\"\nTaika Waititi's Star Wars movie\nRelease date: Unknown.\nTaika Waititi will direct an upcoming Star Wars movie, co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns, who helped script the Oscar-nominated 1917 and Edgar Wright's Last Night in Soho. No other details have yet been announced other than the movie will be heading to cinemas. Kathleen Kennedy previously told Total Film in an interview that the film is headed for a \"late 2023\" release, but said \"we haven't locked anything in\" when asked if that meant December 2023. Clearly, it never made that 2023 release date \u2013 last we heard, it was still being written.\nIn a separate interview with Total Film, Waititi hinted that he would be exploring a new side to Star Wars. \"Look, I think for the Star Wars universe to expand, it has to expand,\" he told us. \"I don't think that I'm any use in the Star Wars universe making a film where everyone's like, 'Oh great, well that's the blueprints to the Millennium Falcon, ah that's Chewbacca's grandmother.' That all stands alone, that's great, though I would like to take something new and create some new characters and just expand the world, otherwise it feels like it's a very small story.\" Per Variety, the director will also likely have a part in the movie.\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023, Kennedy told Variety that the film is still in the works. \"Taika is still working away,\" she revealed. \"He's writing the script himself. He doesn't really want to bring others into that process and I don't blame him. He has a very, very unique voice. So we want to protect that and that's what he's doing. But we\u2019re going to make that one day.\"\nWaititi revealed that he wants the film to be in the spirit of the original trilogy. \"I've been developing [the Star Wars film] for a few years, but I think with any film, but that one in particular, it's something I'd really like to get right,\" Waititi commented. \"It's going to bubble along on the side. I'm trying to figure that out. It'll happen.\" The latest update is that the film is indeed still happening, with an insider saying that the studio is using a \"different way of development\" to make Waititi's, and two other projects, happen.\nIn February 2025, Kennedy gave another update, and it doesn't sound like we'll be seeing it anytime soon. \"Well, I keep waiting for Taika, and he is working with another writer now,\" she said. \"He's so busy. I love him. I think if we ever do get a script from Taika, it's going to be fantastic. I already saw a first act that I loved, but tying him down, it's tricky.\"\nLando\nRelease date: Unknown\nEveryone wants to see more of Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian. Lando will focus on the swashbuckling hero, though where exactly on the Star Wars timeline the series will fall remains to be seen. Kennedy recently indicated to Vanity Fair that, following Solo, the younger versions of iconic characters would not be recast. She expanded on her comments in her interview with Total Film \u2013 and gave an update on Lando in the process.\n\"I never say never. It's certainly not something that we're doing with any intention right now,\" Kennedy commented. \"We're still talking about Lando with Donald Glover, for instance, but I don't think we would intentionally just look back at some of the characters like Luke and Leia and whatnot and decide arbitrarily to do a story. There would have to be a really strong reason why.\"\n\"I can just tell you it's still happening, and he's very excited about it,\" Kennedy told IGN at Star Wars Celebration 2023. Glover also said in a GQ interview that he was in conversations about the project, something confirmed inn August when it was revealed that he and Stephen Glover would be taking over writing duties from Justin Simien. The project has also switched to a movie from a show, intriguingly enough.\nThe aforementioned Hollywood Reporter article also confirmed that Lando was still set to go ahead, despite rumors of being scrapped alongside Shawn Levy and Taika Waititi's upcoming Star Wars projects.\nRian Johnson's new Star Wars trilogy\nRelease date: Unknown\nThe Last Jedi director Rian Johnson must have impressed someone at Lucasfilm and Disney because, just before the film hit cinemas, the studio announced that the filmmaker would be heading up a brand new Star Wars movie trilogy featuring \"new characters from a corner of the galaxy that Star Wars lore has never before explored.\"\nBut, as of 2025, it looks like the movies won't be happening, or at least not any time soon. \"Nothing really happened with it,\" Johnson told Rolling Stone. \"We had a great time working together, and they said, 'Let's keep doing it.' I said, 'Great!' I would kick ideas around with Kathy. The short version is Knives Out happened. I went off and made Knives Out, and was off to the races, busy making murder mysteries. It's the sort of thing if, down the line, there's an opportunity to do it, or do something else in Star Wars, I would be thrilled. But right now I'm just doing my own stuff, and pretty happy.\"\nStar Wars: Rogue Squadron\nRelease date: TBA\nBack in December 2020, Disney announced that Wonder Woman 1984 helmer Patty Jenkins was expected to take the reins on the next Star Wars movie in production, titled Star Wars: Rogue Squadron. Since then, it's been an on-again/off-again sort of project, with Jenkins updating everyone in March 2024 and suggesting it was back on track. The film has had a tumultuous production history \u2013 first it was delayed, reportedly due to creative differences between Patty Jenkins and Lucasfilm. A separate Star Wars report from Vanity Fair then said the film is \"further off\" than Waititi's.\nHowever, Jenkins told the Talking Pictures podcast that she now \"owe[s] a draft of Star Wars.\" In a video coinciding with the initial announcement, Jenkins talked up her history with the Air Force and her desire to create the \"greatest fighter pilot movie ever\". The official synopsis added: \"The story will introduce a new generation of starfighter pilots as they earn their wings and risk their lives in a boundary-pushing, high-speed thrill-ride, and move the saga into the future era of the galaxy.\"\nThe name of the movie will also be familiar to many: it is the title of an iconic series of video games that centered around Rebel pilots fighting back against the Empire. It has, however, been confirmed that the new movie would take place after the main saga, pushing the Star Wars universe further into the future.\nLocation scouting took place in Scotland for a Star Wars movie back in 2019, and Jenkins previously said that the story treatment for Rogue Squadron was almost finished. \"We're finishing the treatment, basically, which is pretty big,\" she said in January 2021. \"So it ends up being like where you're fairly close to a well-along screenplay by the time I'm done with the treatment in my process. So yeah, we've been working on it for a while. It's going great. I'm super excited about it.\"\nFinally, in 2024, we got a surprising update: the movie, alongside the aforementioned Taika Waititi, Shawn Levy, James Mangold, and Donald Glover projects, is allegedly still happening. The report states that the films are in development, with an insider saying that there's \"so much parallel work going on.\"\nNew Star Wars shows release dates\nLego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy \u2013 Pieces of the Past\nRelease date: September 19\nRebuild the Galaxy returns with a second installment, which will see more galactic mash-ups of the characters we know and love. This time, Cal Kestis will make the jump to TV, once again played by Cameron Monaghan, while the rest of the cast includes Billy Dee William as Lando (or a Mandalorian version of him, anyway), Alan Tudyk as K-2SO, Ahmed Best as Darth Jar Jar, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Sam Witwer as Maul, Ashley Eckstein as Ahsoka Tano, and even a guest appearance from Mark Hamill.\nVisions season 3\nRelease date: October 29, 2025\nThe incredible anime compilation show returns, with another set of episodes featuring some of the finest animation talent in Japan. Things are a little different this time around, because we're getting sequels to three episodes from the first season, 'The Ninth Jedi', 'The Duel', and 'The Village Bride'. Just like previous seasons, there'll be nine episodes in total, each handled by a different studio and creative team.\nThe Ninth Jedi\nRelease date: 2026\nIn addition to another season of Visions, one of the episodes is being expanded into its own show. The Ninth Jedi follows a young Jedi, Kara, as she tries to save her dad after he gets captured by Sith in a timeline where the Dark Side is running rampant. Kenji Kamiyama, the director of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, is overseeing The Ninth Jedi, with animation from Production I.G.. Going by Visions to date, this will be one of the most visually impressive Star Wars shows to date.\nMaul - Shadow Lord\nRelease date: 2026\nThe fan-favorite Sith is coming back for his own animated show. The series will feature Maul on a quest to train a new apprentice, with the belief being that it'll reintroduce Darth Talon to the canon universe. Sam Witwer is back to voice the evil Force-user, who's developed a dedicated following over the years through appearances in Rebels, The Clone Wars, and Solo. A side character no more, he'll finally get the attention he deserves here.\nThe Mandalorian season 4\nRelease date: Unknown\nIt's currently unclear if The Mandalorian season 4 will actually happen. It was reportedly still happening alongside the movie, though another report cast doubt on this. According to a newsletter from The Hollywood Reporter, before the dual strikes shut down Hollywood, season 4 was written and ready to go (as Jon Favreau said back in February 2023).\nBut when Hollywood ground to a halt, Lucasfilm pivoted to a movie, leaving season 4's future in doubt. Confusingly, one of Din Djarin's physical performers, Brendan Wayne, said in November 2023 that the fourth instalment was being \"ramped up.\" Whether he meant the movie or not is unclear.\nAhsoka season 2\nRelease date: Unknown\nAhsoka is returning for season 2, and the show is well into development. So far, Star Wars has shared a small tease for the new episodes, and it already has us speculating about what could be in store. Deadline indicated after the Ahsoka season 1 finale that season 2 is more likely to arrive before Dave Filoni's theatrical movie, though there's no confirmed release date just yet.\nHowever, we do know that the season is \"currently in the middle of filming,\" as star Ivanna Sakhno told GamesRadar+, \"All I can say is that it is bigger and even more in-depth, and I'm really excited for people to see it. It means the world.\"\nA Droid Story\nRelease date: Unknown\nThis one's a little different. Lucasfilm Animation and Lucasfilm\u2019s visual effects team, Industrial Light & Magic are teaming up for a Disney Plus movie, A Droid Story. \"This epic journey will introduce us to a new hero, guided by legendary duo R2-D2 and C-3PO,\" read the synopsis. Well, anything with our two favourite droids in will be worth a watch, so we can't wait to see how this will look!\nCanceled Star Wars movies\nKevin Feige's Star Wars movie\nRelease date: Unknown\nMarvel mastermind Kevin Feige had reportedly been brought on board to help shape the future of Star Wars, but this is another project that Variety reports is no longer in active development. That's not a huge surprise, considering just how full the producer's plate is with the MCU.\nDisney co-chairman Alan Horn previously said in a statement: \"We are excited about the projects Kathy and the Lucasfilm team are working on\u2026 With the close of the Skywalker Saga, Kathy is pursuing a new era in Star Wars storytelling, and knowing what a die-hard fan Kevin is, it made sense for these two extraordinary producers to work on a Star Wars film together.\"\nFeige, meanwhile, apparently approached a \"major actor\" about a role in the upcoming unnamed Star Wars movie, according to one source close to The Hollywood Reporter. Loki head writer Michael Waldron was writing the project and recently revealed that he was working on the script.\nThe writing was potentially on the wall when Vanity Fair's report cast some doubt over the project. Kennedy went as far as denying anything was in the works: \"I would love to see what movie he might come up with,\" she said. \"But right now, no, there isn't anything specifically.\"\nOther canceled Star Wars movies\nReports emerged in February 2020 that J.D. Dillard \u2013 best known for the film Sleight \u2013 was working on a feature-length project with Luke Cage and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. scribe Matt Owens. The Hollywood Reporter first announced the news, with Deadline claiming that the movie would be set on the Sith planet Exegol (though the accuracy of the setting has been questioned).\nHowever, upon Levy's Star Wars movie being announced, Dillard said that his own project was \"unfortunately no longer a thing,\" but \"it was not for lack of trying.\" Plot details of the unrealized project were never revealed.\nThen there were Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who were originally meant to spearhead a trilogy but were reportedly too busy making shows for Netflix after signing a nine-figure deal with the streaming service in 2019.\nThere had been rumors that their movie would be set a few hundred years before the prequels, in the time of the Old Republic. The obvious source of inspiration here could be the Knights of the Old Republic video game series or The High Republic era.\nAny more Star Wars Story movies?\nThe original plan, when Disney bought Lucasfilm for upwards of $4 billion, was to release standalone 'Anthology' movies between all the new 'Saga' Episodes. That meant the two-year gaps between The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and The Rise of Skywalker were to be punctuated by Rogue One and Solo \u2013 and at one point it looked like there'd be a third Star Wars Story after The Rise of Skywalker. Then the relatively disappointing box office performance of Solo prompted Disney to rethink the strategy and put the spin-offs on hold, and then that turned into the company pivoting to Disney Plus.\nSolo\u2019s conclusion was clearly setting up a sequel. There were also multiple reports concerning a standalone new Star Wars movie centered on Boba Fett, first with Fantastic Four director Josh Trank at the helm, and after that (according to reports that were never confirmed by Disney) Logan's James Mangold. However, this morphed into The Mandalorian and, later, Fett's own spin-off show The Book of Boba Fett.\nThe other frontrunner for a standalone movie was Obi-Wan Kenobi. Indeed, there were various (similarly unconfirmed) reports (one apparently leaking the synopsis) that Disney/Lucasfilm had an Obi-Wan project in the works with Billy Elliot director Stephen Daldry attached. Writer Stuart Beattie later said there was a trilogy planned to be directed by Daldry and even revealed some plot details. Like the Boba Fett solo movie, though, the Obi-Wan trilogy also changed into something new: Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Disney Plus spin-off series telling the tale of the wise Jedi Knight between Episodes 3 and 4.\nBut, it seems the door isn't totally shut. \"There's always a future for Solo!\" Kennedy told Total Film. Whether we do ever see more of that particular story, or if the anthology movies are done, remains to be seen. There is a Lando movie in the works, though, so never say never.\nWant to catch up with the Star Wars story so far? Getting your hands on a Disney Plus sign-up is the easiest way, because all the films and canon TV shows are available there. Seeing as the Disney Plus free trial is no longer available, be sure to investigate the Disney Plus bundles in your area for the best deals.\nI'm the Deputy Entertainment Editor here at GamesRadar+, covering all things film and TV for the site's Total Film and SFX sections.

      "text": "Ahsoka's Ezra Bridger actor shares video showing off his lightsaber skills, and now I'm even more hyped for season 2 of the Star Wars show\nFilming on the new episodes is currently under way, but a release date has yet to be confirmed\nAhsoka star Eman Esfandi is more than ready for another action-packed season of the Star Wars show. The actor, who is set to reprise his role as Ezra Bridger in Ahsoka season 2, has shared a video on social media showing off his excellent lightsaber skills, and now we can't wait to see him using them alongside Rosario Dawson and the rest of the cast.\n\"This little light(saber) of mine, I\u2019m gonna let it shine,\" Esfandi wrote in the Instagram post. \"Y\u2019all got me hyped up thank you for the love, may the force be with you,\" he added in a second message, following the enthusiastic reaction to the video.\nFilming on season 2 of the show is currently underway. Esfandi was actually the one to confirm the start of the production last March through a reposted story on his personal Instagram account.\nThe latest update we have came from his co-star Ivanna Sakhno, who told GamesRadar+ exclusively in June that Ahsoka season 2 was \"in the middle of filming\", meaning there are a few months of shooting left. She also promised a \"bigger\" and \"even more in-depth\" journey for the upcoming season.\nIf you are as excited as us to see the new episodes, take a look at Esfandi's post below, and start feeling the force:\nA post shared by Eman Esfandi (@emanesfandi)\nA photo posted by on\nAhsoka season 2 was originally announced in January 2024, but filming didn't start until last March 2025.\nIf you remember, Ahsoka season 1 ended on a cliffhanger when Sabine (played by Natasha Liu Bordizzo) and Ahsoka were left stranded after helping Ezra escape Peridea. Meanwhile, Grand Admiral Thrawn (played by Lars Mikkelsen) is heading out to wreak havoc in the galaxy.\nAlthough plot details are still under wraps, we do know some exciting details about the new season. Christensen confirmed he'd be returning as Anakin Skywalker, after briefly featuring in season 1. The actor has recently canceled a Comic Con appearance over night shoots, so we're hoping that means he has a bigger role than expected in the show.\nIt has also been confirmed that Admiral Ackbar will appear and face off with Grand Admiral Thrawn.\nAhsoka season 2 does not yet have a release date.

Ahsoka's sophomore effort has been a long time coming, as Lucasfilm preps the return of Rosario Dawson's titular Jedi master. The show's second season will see much of the original cast reprise their roles from Season 1, like Natasha Liu Bordizzo as Sabine Wren and Eman Esfandi as Ezra Bridger; however, one big name from the show's first season has sadly been replaced.\nBaylan Skoll actor Ray Stevenson was recast for Ahsoka's second season following Stevenson's tragic death in May 2023. Instead of doing away with Stevenson's mysterious villain, the character will be back in Season 2, played by Game of Thrones star Rory McCann. McCann will join Ivanna Sakhno's Shin Hati as the show's primary Force-wielding big bads.\nAccording to Ivanna Sakhno, Ahsoka Season 2 will feature plenty of her Shin Hati and McCann's Baylan Skoll together on-screen.\nIn an exclusive conversation with The Direct while promoting the digital release of M3GAN 2.0, Sakhno confirmed that she and McCann's Ahsoka characters will share many scenes in the series' still-in-production second season.\n\"I get to see Rory nearly daily at the moment,\" the Shin Hati star revealed, insinuating that she will be sharing plenty of screentime with the former Game of Thrones actor:\nThe Direct: \"The passing of Ray Stevenson was obviously incredibly tragic, but thankfully, his legacy and the character he brought to the screen will live on forever. And for Season 2, Rory McCann was brought on board to help keep Baylan Skoll's story alive. I know you can't speak on the show, but just, what was it like working with him as an actor? And being able to continue that character's journey and Ray's legacy?\"\nSakhno: \"We're in the middle of filming right now. I'm reporting to you from London, so I, you know, I get to see Rory nearly daily at the moment, and he has been amazing to work with. I will have his work speak for itself, but he is definitely a gift for us to have. And there couldn't have been anyone better to take on this role.\"\nSakhno and McCann will star alongside Rosario Dawson, Natasha Liu Bordizzo, Eman Esfandi, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Lars Mikkelsen in Ahsoka Season 2. The next batch of episodes from Star Wars Rebels and The Mandalorian creator Dave Filoni will follow Dawson's titular Jedi as she and her Mandalorian mentee, Sabine Wren, remain marooned in another galaxy, all while the villainous Grand Admiral Thrawn eyes galactic domination in the Star Wars galaxy fans are more accustomed to.\nAhsoka Season 2 has no official release window, but it is expected to debut on Disney+ sometime in 2026.\nWhat To Expect from Shin Hati in Ahsoka Season 2\nEven though audiences have yet to see a glimpse of Ahsoka Season 2, they are still eager to find out what will become of the show's characters in its second batch of episodes.\nThis is especially true with the show's characters stranded in another galaxy at the end of Season 1, like Ivanna Sakhno's Shin Hati. Shin, Baylan Skoll, Ahsoka, and Sabine Wren were all marooned on the uncharted planet of Peridea by the Ahsoka Season 1 finale.\nThis will almost surely come into play in the second season, as Lars Mikkelsen's Grand Admiral Thrawn has returned to the prime Star Wars galaxy without Ahsoka there to lend a hand in the fight against Thrawn's terrifying military mind.\nAs Ezra Bridger, Hera Syndulla, and the New Republic reckon with Thrawn's reemergence, Ahsoka and Sabine will be left to uncover why Shin and her master Baylan wanted to get to Peridea so severely in the first place.\nSome have speculated this could be because the planet is Mortis (as seen in the beloved Mortis arc in Star Wars: The Clone Wars), a realm that exists outside of known reality and is said to be the origin point for the Force itself."

That means there wasn't really anything to show for a first look, but it didn't stop Filoni.\nRecalling that George Lucas made a trailer for Empire Strikes Back before he'd even filmed it, Filoni said he'd made a trailer for season 2 in a similar style, and then the audience in the Celebration Stage got to watch.\nThe clip was indeed very retro, featuring a promise of action across two galaxies, a teased showdown between Ahsoka Tano and Baylan Skoll, a look at Ezra Bridger jumping into action zipping up a flight suit, Ahsoka and Sabine Wren battling giant droids, and plenty of Grand Admiral Thrawn. There was also an '80s-style voice over to complete the throwback vibes, and the whole thing was put together with artwork.\nSeason 1 ended with Ahsoka and Sabine stranded on Peridea, but with Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker watching over them. Baylan Skoll and Shin Hati are also stuck on the planet, and it seems Baylan is investigating the Mortis gods and the World Between Worlds.\nFiloni, though reluctant to give anything away, did talk a bit about Mortis. \"It's a big mystery,\" he said of the statues on Peridea. \"The Son's there, the Father's there, most of the Daughter's there. So yeah, we'll figure it out. It's a good story.\"\nThe same panel confirmed that Game of Thrones star Rory McCann would be taking over as Baylan from the late Ray Stevenson, Hayden Christensen will return as Anakin Skywalker, and Admiral Ackbar will feature.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nNext up for Star Wars is Andor season 2, which arrives in a triple episode premiere on Disney Plus this April 22 in the US and April 23 in the UK.\nIn the meantime, check out our guide to all the upcoming Star Wars movies and shows, or see our roundup of everything announced and what to expect at Star Wars Celebration 2025 through the link.\nI'm the Deputy Entertainment Editor here at GamesRadar+, covering all things film and TV for the site's Total Film and SFX sections.
