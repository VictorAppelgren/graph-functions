      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid starting point but still reads like a high‑level overview rather than a world‑class, 3–6‑month scenario analysis. Tighten the causal chain by linking each catalyst to a specific macro or micro trigger (e.g., “FAA’s next‑quarter commercial‑drone certification → 10 % lift in UAS contract volume → 3–5 % revenue bump for North Dakota firms”) and quantify the impact (use the 97 % job growth figure from FOM34PUWA as a baseline and project a 2–3 % YoY increase in UAS revenue). For the gaming‑laptop segment, replace generic “high‑performance hardware” with concrete numbers: the Alienware m16 R2’s 240 Hz 2K display and 12,725 Geekbench score, and estimate a 5–7 % sales lift if a new model launches in Q4 2025. In the dividend section, anchor each yield to a forward P/E and free‑cash‑flow metric (e.g., Abbott’s 1.8 % yield + 53‑yr streak → 4–6 % dividend hike probability; AbbVie’s 18.2 B FCF → 6.8 % CAGR in dividends). For Inghams, quantify the 60 % customer concentration risk by citing the 2024 sales mix and model a 2–4 % margin squeeze if feed tariffs rise. Toyota’s RAV4 should include the 111,526 hybrid and 17,074 PHEV sales figures and model a 3–5 % sales acceleration if the 2026 hybrid‑only launch hits Q1 2026. Add a clear timing window for each trigger (e.g., FAA certification Q2 2025, next‑gen laptop launch Q3 2025, dividend declarations Q4 2025). Include path‑dependency logic (e.g., UAS growth depends on defense spending, which is tied to fiscal policy). Expand the watch‑list signals to specific dates and data releases (e.g., FAA docket 2025‑05‑15, NPD laptop sales Q3 2025). Finally, justify the 60 % confidence rating with a risk matrix that weighs supply‑chain fragility, tariff volatility, and rate hikes, and provide a clear confidence band (e.g., 55–65 %). Ensure every claim is cited with the appropriate source ID (e.g., FOM34PUWA, U0I2AFHOV, WISLWAJ15, GUJQZY4UO, H8880U45S). This will elevate the analysis from a broad narrative to a precise, data‑driven scenario map that meets the Section Focus requirements.",
