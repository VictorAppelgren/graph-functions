  "title": "The Ultimate Guide to Performance Wagons: 8 You Can (Sort Of) Buy Today",
  "description": "These are the best performance wagons you can buy today",
  "content": "Dads rejoice \u2013 this one\u2019s for you. It\u2019s an excuse to have a mid-life crisis of a maturely immature kind, and a cool one at that. Just bring a fresh pair of New Balance 530s. You know you deserve it, so ditch the SUV and instead buy a car that celebrates your life stage without too much compromise. Go buy a performance wagon.\n\nOkay, but let\u2019s get real first. As a car community, we love wagons and what they bring: style, utility, and uniqueness that sticks out in a sea of dull SUVs. It\u2019s hard to wrap your head around the fact that the wagon was once the world\u2019s SUV, but it just lacked the ground clearance. Again, as a car community, there\u2019s a stigma that we all froth over wagons, but we hate to buy them. However, if you\u2019re thinking of breaking that stigma, here are 8 Performance wagons that you can (sort of) buy today:\n\nTwin Turb-Charged V8 with an electric motor to make 717 hp, 0-60 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds. They complained when the M5 went turbocharged, and they complained when it went All-wheel drive, but what are they saying now when the M5 goes hybrid? Oh, and who are \u201cthey\u201d?\n\n\u201cThey\u201d are probably the ones who will never buy an M5 anyway. For those who can, the all-wheel drive works, and judging by the outgoing competition model, which I had the pleasure of testing, it is an absolute rocket ship. This hybrid, in a touring version, will undoubtedly be sublime in its all-German fight with Audi\u2019s RS6.\n\nAlthough discontinued in 2023 before this new craze relaunched (perhaps Mercedes is kicking themselves), a few examples are still floating around, sporting the trusty W213 platform Biturbo powerplant of the AMG\u2019s V8, along with the silky lines of the E-Class, this time in Wagon mode.\n\nThe output was 603 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque, and it could rocket this people mover from 0-60 mph in 3.3 seconds, equipped with a 9-speed Automatic all-wheel drive. That\u2019s supercar territory, but with luggage! I\u2019d be childish to harp on the point around why we don\u2019t have these for sale anymore, new, but what would an all-German Touring Wagon trio be without this? This is the real automotive holy trinity that I signed up for.\n\nA worthy performance car, but not for those seeking brute force acceleration, as other options might offer. This is more of a well-rounded crossover car that can be taken both on and off road, thanks to its 7.9-inch ground clearance. If you\u2019re looking for some overlanding nuggets to enhance your V90 experience further, happy hunting in here. Volvo has a history of building performance Wagons. The British Touring Car Volvo 850R is what I\u2019m referring to, so perhaps the V90 carries some of that legend forward and has some spice.\n\nSporting Mild-Hybrid Technology and no plug-in required, the V90 Cross Country comes loaded with driver-focused tech. The Swedish firm knows how to make an off-road cross version, and the Swedes know how to make a performance wagon, but don\u2019t expect fire-breathing performance here from the 295 hp that delivers a respectable 0-60mph time in 6.1 seconds.\n\nBMW started the resurgence of performance tourers with the M4 Touring, and now that the world has calmed down somewhat over that front end, it might be okay to admit that this is a great-looking car. Under those aggressive features lies a 3.0-liter twin-turbo inline-six engine producing 530 hp and 480 lb-ft of torque. All this translates to a 0-60 mph time of 3.6 seconds, achieved through the 8-speed M Steptronic Sport transmission.\n\nAgain, as an ongoing trend, there\u2019s the M Xdrive with active M differential, and yes, you can light up the rear wheels in DSC-off mode. But be warned. This car will bite back in true BMW M tradition. It will not suffer foolish behavior. Despite the divided opinions on design, one can\u2019t deny the striking presence of arguably one of the coolest and unique wagons to grace our roads of late.\n\nAnother less-stressful option to consider for joining our Volvo V90 is the Subaru Outback Wilderness. Subaru\u2019s legacy (no pun intended) lives on in the outback. Although you may not be getting the M-Sport Forrester version of the past, you\u2019re getting the DNA, and that\u2019s a cool thing, as well as buying into the assurance that comes with a sound history and a solid platform to venture out and have fun.\n\nThe 2025 Subaru Outback Wilderness will feature the legendary 2.4-liter turbocharged BOXER engine, which produces 260hp and 277 lb-ft of torque. Although no manuals are offered, you\u2019ll be getting a CVT with it, and if it\u2019s anything like the outgoing model, it won\u2019t be the worst compromise. I would still, however, prefer one with a manual transmission, in true Subaru style. It just feels right.\n\nVolkswagen has also jumped onto the performance wagon hype train with the Golf 8 R platform. It\u2019s an all-wheel-drive dad mobile. One drawback is that it\u2019s not available everywhere in the world, including America, but it does have \u201cfuture classic\u201d written all over it if you can get your hands on one. 330 hp and 309 lb-ft are healthy numbers from the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine that will get you to 60 mph from 0 in 4.7 seconds. Top speed is limited to 155 mph.\n\nI had the pleasure of testing both the Golf 8 R and Tiguan R and can state that if the Wagon version is as good, this will be a proper working-class hero. Grip for days, balanced chassis with a low center of gravity, and the ability to do the job and carve up some canyons on the breakfast run.\n\n911s aren\u2019t just getting the Safari-esque ground clearance treatment, but so is all-electric, all-wheel-drive Taycan with the Taycan 4S Cross Turismo. Porsche\u2019s ambitious touring wagon comes with 690hp and 449 lb-ft of torque, featuring motors on both the front and rear wheels, and a curb weight of 5,090 lbs, which is 156 lbs less than the outgoing model.\n\nThe Taycan Cross Turismo is a 320kW fast-charging unit based on Porsche\u2019s 800-V technology, which roughly means you can go from 10% to 80% in 18 minutes and add another 160 miles to your daily journey. That\u2019s only if you\u2019re not planning on using the launch control to achieve the 0-60mph in 3.1 seconds. The top speed on this model is limited to 155 mph.\n\nEntering its \u201cGOAT\u201d era is the latest Audi RS6, featuring a twin-turbo 4-liter V8 that produces 621 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque. With the 8-speed transmission, it reaches 60 mph from 0 in just 3.3 seconds (so tell the kids to pack their neck braces). If there were a car that could do it all, this is it. Plenty of performance, and I stress plenty. Utility to boot. Looks to kill with its stage presence and boasts a certified \u201cZaddy\u201d aficionado ranking, thanks to that all-important Audi lineage that dates back to the granddaddy of them all, the Audi RS2.\n\nNo one can knock the Ingolstadt heroes for how to make a sports wagon, and no one dares to share. Secretly, despite everyone\u2019s feelings about the brand, if you ask anyone, this is the one they want to own. It\u2019s the kingmaker that ticks all the boxes.\n\nNot that I\u2019m demanding at all, but if Toyota could get to producing a GR Corolla Wagon, we could officially be living in the most exciting time for wagons. At the same time, everyone keeps saying that motoring is getting boring with all these SUVs. Whether we\u2019d finally convince the masses to stop frothing over wagons and start buying them, that would be a tall ask, but having these types of offerings shows us that, as a motoring industry, we haven\u2019t all quite lost the plot yet.",

      "text": "For the average Joe, the idea of owning a supercar is all but a pipe dream. Thankfully, for those of us with more humble-sized pockets, there are cars on the market with similar performance stats but at a fraction of the cost.\nGranted, exotic cars like the Audi R8, Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n, and Nissan GT-R can hit 60 mph in the blink of an eye and reach upwards of 200 mph. The problem is, though, these illustrious and elusive exotics have sky-high price tags to match their horsepower figures.\nSo unless you've got $150,000 to $300,000 burning a hole in your pocket, it's probably never going to happen. The vehicles that feature on this list may not look as exotic as the aforementioned fabled cars, but the vast majority are way more practical.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturers and other authoritative sources, including Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book. The following entries were chosen for their performance and low starting prices.\n10 Sports Cars That Depreciate The Most After 5 Years Of Ownership\nThese 10 sports cars lose value faster than most, making them great used buys but costly for first owners. Here\u2019s why their depreciation is so steep.\n10 2025 Ford Mustang GT\nMSRP: $42,860\nKicking off our list is the Ford Mustang, which is not only a fast sports car but also an American icon. Muscle car roots aside, the Mustang's huge V8 engine sends just shy of 500 horsepower to the rear wheels.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n5.0-liter V8 |\n|\nTransmission |\n6-speed manual |\n|\nHorsepower |\n486 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n418 lb-ft |\n|\nDriveline |\nRear-wheel drive |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n4.2 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n155 mph |\n9 2025 Nissan Z\nMSRP: $42,970\nNext up is the Nissan Z, which is a steal of a sports car. For way under $50,000, you get a sports car equipped with a twin-turbocharged engine offering plenty of low-end grunt ideal for daily driving and a lot of top-end power for those track days.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\nTwin-turbocharged V6 |\n|\nTransmission |\n6-speed manual or 9-speed automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n400 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n350 lb-ft |\n|\nDriveline |\nRear-wheel drive |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n3.9 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n165 mph |\nAlthough it's an out-and-out sports car, that doesn't mean the Nissan Z isn't practical. In fact, it has plenty of space for two people and a decent amount of cargo space. It also has many safety features and plenty of tech features for entertainment.\n8 2025 BMW Z4\nMSRP: $54,500\nThere's no denying that most supercars are fun to drive, but the BMW Z4 offers something a little extra. With a power-folding soft top that folds back within seconds, occupants can be at one with the outside world. Further, the Z4's turbocharged engine and athletic suspension combine to deliver the exciting driving dynamics the German automaker is synonymous with.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\nTurbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six |\n|\nTransmission |\n6-speed manual |\n|\nHorsepower |\n382 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n369 lb-ft |\n|\nDriveline |\nRear-wheel drive |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n3.9 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n152 mph |\nAnother area BMW is reputed for is its interiors, and the Z4 is no different, coming equipped with a cabin built with the finest materials and trim. There's also plenty of tech on show, including a large infotainment screen and wireless phone connectivity. It's common knowledge supercars don't make great dailies, so the BMW Z4 could be a more comfortable option.\n10 Most Reliable Used German Cars Under $15,000\nThese 10 reliable used German cars offer premium engineering and solid dependability\u2014all for under $15,000.\n7 2025 Toyota GR Supra\nMSRP: $56,250\nIf ever there was an excellent substitute for a supercar, it'd be the Toyota GR Supra, thanks to its striking style and stout turbocharged engine. It's a two-seater that's comfortable enough for two people to commute daily, and its BMW-sourced engine makes it a hoot to drive.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\nTurbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six |\n|\nTransmission |\n6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n382 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n368 lb-ft |\n|\nDriveline |\nRear-wheel drive |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n3.9 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n161 mph |\nThe Toyota GR Supra is available with an automatic transmission, or if you're seeking a more involved drive, it can be had in manual guise. Music heads can rejoice, knowing it comes with a premium audio system and it has an adequately sized cargo area, big enough to be practical for everyday use.\n6 2025 Cadillac CT5-V\nMSRP: $56,995\nAlthough Cadillac is best known for its floaty sedans and large SUVs, the brand aims to change that perception with the CT5-V. Granted, it's a comfortable sedan, but under the hood lies a twin-turbocharged V6 packed with performance rivaling sports cars twice its price.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\nTwin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 |\n|\nTransmission |\n10-speed automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n360 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n405 lb-ft |\n|\nDriveline |\nRear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n4.8 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n168 mph |\nOkay, it might not achieve 0-60 in two seconds, but it's a versatile vehicle. On the one hand, it's a streetworthy race car, and on the other, it's a comfortable commuter.\n5 2024 Audi RS3\nMSRP: $62,300\nAudi may have a reputation for producing luxurious commuter sedans and SUVs, but the German automaker also builds some of the fastest sports sedans on the market. Take the RS3, for example\u2014a small, four-door sedan based on the more sedate A3.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\nTurbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five |\n|\nTransmission |\n7-speed dual-clutch automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n401 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n369 lb-ft |\n|\nDriveline |\nAll-wheel drive |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n3.3 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n159 mph |\nDon't be fooled, though, as the RS3's unconventional five-cylinder engine pumps out over 400 horses sent to its wheels via its Quattro all-wheel drive system. Plant your right foot, and you'll reach highway speeds in supercar times.\n10 Affordable Used Sports Cars That Can Keep Up With A Porsche 911\nThese 10 affordable used sports cars deliver impressive speed and handling, proving you don\u2019t need a Porsche 911 to experience thrilling performance.\n4 2025 Mercedes-AMG C43\nMSRP: $62,500\nIt doesn't seem that long ago that turbocharged four-cylinder engines struggled to break the 300-horsepower mark. The Mecedes-AMG C43 shows how times have changed, with its force-fed four-pot engine making over 400 horsepower.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\nTurbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four |\n|\nTransmission |\n9-speed automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n416 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n369 lb-ft |\n|\nDriveline |\nAll-wheel drive |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n3.9 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n165 mph |\nImpressive, to say the least, especially considering the small, high-performance C-Class sedan can reach highway speeds just as quickly as a supercar with twice the power. Then again, said supercar would cost twice the price, which makes the Mercedes-AMG C43 that much more of a compelling buy.\n3 2025 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray\nMSRP: $68,300\nThe C8-generation Chevrolet Corvette debuted a few years ago, and critics and the public alike were in fierce debate about whether it should be considered a supercar or a mere sports car. But what's the difference? Supercars typically have an astronomical price tag, a powerful engine, and exceptional handling characteristics.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n6.2-liter V8 |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-speed dual-clutch automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n495 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n470 lb-ft |\n|\nDriveline |\nRear-wheel drive |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n2.8 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n184 mph |\nBut the C8 Corvette bucks the trend, as it ticks all of those boxes, with the exception of a hefty price tag. Further, it even has a mid-engine, rear-drive layout like some supercars. Is it a supercar then? Performance-wise, certainly, but its price tag says something different.\n2 2025 Porsche 718 Cayman\nMSRP: $72,800\nWhen you think of Porsche, the 911 is probably the model that immediately springs to mind, and for good reason\u2014it's an icon. That doesn't mean the Porsche 718 Cayman shouldn't be any less thought of, though. Despite being the entry-level car in the automaker's lineup, it is no less exciting to drive than its pricier and more powerful stablemate.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n4.0-liter flat-six |\n|\nTransmission |\n7-speed dual-clutch automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n394 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n309 lb-ft |\n|\nDriveline |\nRear-wheel drive |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n3.4 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n182 mph |\nWith just shy of 400 horses on tap being sent to the rear wheels, the 718 Cayman embodies everything a sports car should be. Its chassis and suspension are well-crafted, delivering the type of smile-inducing engagement gear heads crave when enjoying a spirited drive on a twisty road.\nThe Story Behind BMW And Toyota\u2019s Hydrogen Partnership\nBMW and Toyota joined forces to develop hydrogen fuel cell tech, combining BMW's engineering with Toyota's hydrogen expertise for a greener future.\n1 2025 Audi RS5 Sportback\nMSRP: $79,900\nYou'll be hard-pressed to find a car that offers the type of performance, precision, and practicality the Audi RS5 Sportback does. Not only is it supercar-fast thanks to its unique twin-turbocharged V6, but it's also incredibly practical.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\nTwin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V6 |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-speed automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n444 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n443 lb-ft |\n|\nDriveline |\nAll-drive drive |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n3.4 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n155 mph |\nThe RS5 Sportback is based on the five-door Audi A5 platform, meaning it offers ample space for four adults and all their belongings. Its trunk area isn't just large, but it also opens up with a hatch door, making loading larger cargo a doddle while maintaining its sporty driving dynamics. If you've ever dreamed of taking a supercar on a long weekend road trip but need more space (or can't afford one), the Audi RS5 is a great alternative."

      "text": "If you\u2019re looking for a mid-size sedan that can tear up the track as well as it can cruise along the highway, then it\u2019s likely that the BMW M5 is already on your radar. However, what if we told you that there was an even more impressive sedan, and it was actually built by an American automaker?\nThe M5 set the standard for mid-size performance sedans when it first hit the roads. However, since then it has been softened and leans more in the direction of luxury than its hard-edged predecessors. The American sedan we focus on in this article brings a bonkers level of entertainment that we feel the M5 lacks.\nWe take a look at this fantastic performance sedan and how it stacks up against its competition. Outlining its features, we take a look at what makes it such a special car in such a crowded segment. We decipher how much a new model will cost you and what kind of luxury elements you can expect as well.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including TopSpeed and the EPA.\nThe Sports Sedan Redefining Luxury Without Breaking the Bank\nThis luxury sedan is turning heads with its upscale features, surprisingly accessible price point, and impressive performance capabilities.\nCadillac's CT5-V Blackwing Is a Near-Perfect Sports Sedan\nLong ago, BMW's M5 set a standard for mid-size sports sedans that every other automaker has had to strive for. While it has sat at the top for a long time, there is currently another model on the market that may actually be better, despite not being as popular. Cadillac's 2025 CT5-V Blackwing is a raucous yet refined machine that will thrill you as much as it will keep you comfortable.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n6.2-Liter Supercharged V-8 |\n|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n6-Speed Manual or 10-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n668 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n659 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n3.5 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n205 MPH |\nOne of the biggest criticisms that people have of the M5 is that it has become far too subdued. While its performance is still exceptional, it is so ridiculously over-engineered that there is little space for the driver to find a lot of fun in it. While those looking for the best spec sheet may still opt for the M5, we think that the Cadillac delivers a more visceral driving experience.\nThe CT5-V Blackwing is quintessentially American. It comes standard with a massive, supercharged V-8, something that has become quite rare in the automotive world today. It is also surprisingly reliable. While the lack of all-wheel drive may be seen as a negative to some, rear-wheel drive adds to the level of driver engagement. Finally, the fact that Cadillac still offers this massive sports sedan with a manual transmission is worthy of applause.\nBeyond the mechanics of the engine and the transmission, the American brand has gone through a lot of effort to make the CT5-V Blackwing the perfect track weapon. It comes fitted with a limited-slip differential and Performance Traction Management, allowing the driver to keep on the throttle all the way through a corner. The second you move off the track, though, the magnetorheological dampers sense how you want to drive and the conditions of the road to give you exceptional ride quality.\nFuel Economy\n|\nModel |\nCity |\nHighway |\nCombined |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nCT5-V Blackwing |\n13 MPG |\n20 MPG |\n15 MPG |\nIt may seem odd to talk about fuel economy when it comes to a track-ready sports sedan, but it is one area that is becoming increasingly competitive, even in this segment. The BMW M5, for instance, is now a plug-in hybrid, and while its gas-only efficiency is worse than the Cadillac's, it can travel on electric power only for short distances, meaning you can daily it without getting a massive fuel bill.\nThe CT5-V Blackwing is designed to be a performance machine, though, meaning that it does guzzle fuel regardless of whether you commute on the highway or in the city. At least you can find solace in the fact that the automatic and manual models return the same fuel economy figures, meaning you aren't penalized further for opting for the six-speed.\n10 Affordable Luxury Grand Tourers That Will Make You Feel Rich\nYou don\u2019t need a six-figure budget to enjoy the luxury and performance of a grand tourer.\nThe CT5-V Blackwing Is Tens Of Thousands Less Expensive Than The M5\nEven when you're spending six figures on a sports sedan, value is still something that should get your attention. While a fully-kitted M5 can cost you well over $130,000, the Cadillac can be had for just under $100,000. Thirty thousand dollars is nothing to scoff at. On top of this, the Cadillac comes exceptionally well-kitted, definitely giving you plenty of machine for your money.\n2026 Trims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nCT5-V Blackwing |\n$99,095 |\nFor the 2025 model year, the CT5-V Blackwing underwent a refresh, alongside the regular CT5 sedan. It got a wider grille and reworked lighting elements to give it a more modern and refined look. It also better set itself apart from the regular sedan with more aggressive-looking sheetmetal. On the inside, the 10-inch touchscreen was ditched for a massive 33-inch unit instead. For 2026, all Cadillac has done is add Blind Zone Steering as standard equipment and gotten rid of some interior color options.\nThe CT5-V Blackwing exists in a segment where almost every one of its competitors is more expensive to start with. On top of this, you see costs start to stack up on many of its rivals as you make your way through the configurator. The Cadillac comes well-equipped and it doesn't exactly feel like you're getting ripped off every time you select an optional extra.\nOptional Packages\nThere are a number of ways to customize your CT5-V Blackwing to make it personal to you, from an array of exterior paint colors to finely crafted interior upholstery options. Basic black leather upholstery is standard, but you can opt for full semi-aniline seating instead. Chosing between the more comfortable performance bucket seats and the more focused high-performance bucket seats won't cost you anything.\nA number of other packages are available, with the Red, Blue, and Bronze accent packages changing the color of a number of elements. Carbon fiber packages can also be had. The most important package by far, though, is the Precision Package, which improves performance. This $18,000 package adds a number of features, including carbon ceramic breaks, a more performance-focused suspension tune, and a complete rework of a ton of other mechanical pieces resulting in a more responsive and tighter machine. Finally, it comes with a set of 19-inch high-performance summer tires.\nFuturistic Dashboards Take These Cars to the Next Level\nForget boring displays. These cars feature futuristic dashboards that blend tech, design, and innovation to transform the driving experience.\nCadillac Delivers An Exceptional Interior In The CT5-V Blackwing\nWhen you're buying a larger sports sedan like the CT5-V Blackwing, you expect a level of opulence on the inside. While performance is definitely the focus with this impressive machine, you can quite comfortably drive it on a day-to-day basis thanks to the level of refinement offered on the inside for you and whatever passengers you may have.\nInterior Design and Comfort\nThe one area that needed slight improvement in the CT5-V Blackwing, before it got facelifted, was the interior. Cadillac isn't quite where it once was in terms of interior comfort and it showed. However, the facelifted model features a much improved dashboard that looks sleeker and more impressive than a lot of high-performance luxury cars.\nComfort is clearly a priority in this brilliant Cadillac, with the leather-upholstered front seats coming with 18-way power adjustability. These seats are also ventilated and heated, and you get heating in the back seats as well. A sunroof lets in plenty of natural light during the day and customizable ambient lighting allows you to set the vibe otherwise. Dual-zone automatic climate control is also standard.\nInfotainment and Technology\nAs mentioned before, one of the biggest upgrades that Cadillac made was to the screen in the CT5. Now a large 33-inch screen displays both the digital gauges and the infotainment system. This massive screen boasts an impressive 9K resolution, and it responds quickly and smoothly. If you aren't the biggest fan of touch controls, you can also use the rotary knob on the center console to control the system instead. Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard.\nTech is used for both comfort and performance in the CT5-V Blackwing, and this extends to the interior. A Performance Data Recorder can display key information for your track days, such as lap timings, ideal racing lines, and your speed as compared to total distance on track. On the practicality side of things, a wireless charging pad is standard, as is a 16-speaker AKG sound system with active noise cancellation to keep the cabin quiet.\n***Insert Related Link***"

      "text": "The intimidating world of overlanding is enough to deter anyone from getting into this lifestyle. Social media has showcased countless behemoth-like rigs with lifted aftermarket suspension, tricked-out caps, and rooftop tents that offer better outfitting than your average inner-city apartment. It does have the ability to turn you away, to stop you from trying, but it doesn't need to be that way. You don't need to spend a fortune to start enjoying the overlanding lifestyle. All you need is a car with a bit of ground clearance, packing space, some roof load capacity, and you can be set on your way to unlock that inner weekend warrior.\nLet's break it down, and provide some options for a compact or subcompact vehicle type, where affordability is key and compromise is not a bad thing. All of which are hovering around the $30,000 benchmark. Barring some exceptions, and given the likelihood that these cars will spend most of their lives on the road rather than off, four-wheel drive may not be the best option, especially when considering MPG figures, so a reasonably priced compact SUV may be the way to go\nHere are five easy and affordable options that won't break the bank if you're looking to get into overlanding:\n5 Hyundai Kona\nThe Kona may be the smallest option on our list, but it also may be the easiest to look at. All-wheel drive is also available on all models, as well as an EV version. However, for overlanding, we're still a considerable distance away from sustainable charging infrastructure.\nWe're not saying charging the wild is an impossibility, as many have attempted to solve, but it's a little impractical at this point. Two engine options exist with the 2.0 Atkinson 4-cylinder and the range-topping 1.6-Turbo GDI 4-cylinder offering 190 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque, and in the ground clearance department, 8.1\" is the clearance with the all-wheel-drive option over the 6.7 inches that comes with the front-wheel drive. The Htrak All-wheel-drive system, found on some models, may be the diamond in the dirt here (Puns were intended), given the ability of the system to distribute torque between the front and rear wheels so you could get the best of both worlds of grip and fuel efficiency.\n4 Chevrolet Trax\nOn the Subcompact side, with a ground clearance of 7.3 inches, you might be lacking in this department compared to others, but again, it's coming down to what you want to do. And where the clearance is lacking, the trump card could be that the Trax is the most affordable option with a starting price tag of $21,600. With a dynamic roof load capacity of 220 pounds, you could do a fair deal.\nWhile everyone may not be fond of the 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine, which produces 137 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque through a 6-speed automatic, the fuel economy, especially when not driving with all the rooftop accessories, is the redeeming factor. There are no all-wheel-drive options in the range. However, again, with momentum across the trickier terrain, you could get away with a lot. Sure, it'll take some practice, but that's where the fun lies. Additionally, if you're a small family of two, along with a dog or two, this is a sensible option.\n3 Subaru Forester\nThe only dedicated all-wheel-drive option on the list, and one we feel was purposely built for the contents of this article. The comparison topping 8.7\" ground clearance is backed up by the rich history of rallying, the trademark Subaru badge comes with. A 2.5-liter Boxer 4-cylinder motor is mated to a Lineartronic CVT transmission, so don't expect the fire-breathing attributes of the STI of days gone by. Instead, you're getting a much more sophisticated package.\nGiven the permanent all-wheel-drive option that brings a slightly higher MPG rating, and considering this is an affordability discussion, this may see the Forester ruled out, but it is a worthy final option. There is, however, a hybrid option here that offers 35 MPG, which may be its redeeming factor. Plus, it's a Subaru. Their DNA is off-roading. And if that doesn't get you over the line, there's the 14 more horsepower you're getting from the increased electric power mode, which could see you scaling some steeper inclines with a little more ease, and we could all deal with a \"little more ease\" in life.\n2 Toyota RAV4\nThe RAV4 is a no-nonsense vehicle that competes in the highly competitive compact/subcompact SUV segment. Sufficient space, comfort, and ability are its trump cards. A 2.5-liter 4-cylinder motor that produces 203 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque is not going to blow your hair back, but it will get the job done. While most of the offerings across the range are front-wheel-drive only, there is an all-wheel-drive option. We would opt for the LE base model, as many features will not be needed where you're headed\u2014options like 19\" Alloys, panoramic roofs, and leather trimmings. Instead, we'd suggest taking the base and spec in what you'd need like a 360-degree camera, for navigating off-road obstacles, and budget the spare cash for additional bolt-on gear.\nOn all models, you get 8.1\" of ground clearance, and on the TRD Off-Road and Woodland packages, you get 8.6 inches. You get the idea that Toyota is on the same wavelength as us. With a roof weight rating of between 176 pounds of dynamic load (when the car's in motion), you can easily get away with a lighter-spec rooftop tent, a shadow awning, and one or two extra accouterments. We know you'd like some appropriately colored Jerry cans, as they look badass. For the first time in 2024, after 50 years of the Ford F-150 sales dominance, the RAV4 exceeded it in numbers. That has to tell you something about their value proposition. Check out the Corolla Cross Hybrid as an extra option here.\n1 Honda CR-V\nWe couldn't have a list with Toyota's RAV4 without including its closest rival. Could we? Manufacturers have been taking hatchbacks and regular cars and raising the suspension profile, labeling them crossovers. The Honda CR-V is not that, but rather, like the RAV4, it is a dedicated, purpose-built SUV, not a hatchback on stilts. That will translate well for easy off-road driving.\nWith two engine options, the 1.5 turbocharged engine and a hybrid 2.0-liter Atkinson cylindered variant paired with two electric motors, frugality is the order of the day. All-wheel drive is available for both engine options, and the transmission utilizes a Continuous Variable Automatic (CVT) transmission. However, it is worth noting that this transmission is not always favored for off-roading. Again, this is not a deal-breaker given the overlanding challenge-light approach. What is cool is 'snow mode' for improved traction, and here's the kicker: it works on sand too. Fancy that?\nPricing and Comparable Specifications\n|\nHyundai Kona |\nChevrolet Trax |\nSubaru Forester |\nToyota RAV4 |\nHonda CR-V |\n|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\nPrice |\n$24,550 |\n$21,600 |\n$29,995 |\n$29,550 |\n$30,100 |\n|\nHorsepower |\n147 |\n137 |\n182 |\n203 |\n190 |\n|\nTorque |\n132 |\n162 |\n176 |\n184 |\n179 |\n|\nCargo Volume - Cu. Ft - Rear Seats folded |\n54 |\n54.1 |\n74.4 |\n69.8 |\n76.5 |\n|\nGround Clearance - Inches |\n6.7\" |\n7.3\" |\n8.7\" |\n8.1\" |\n8.2\" |\n|\nDrive Train |\nFWD |\nFWD |\nAWD |\nFWD |\nFWD |\n|\nMPG*Combined |\n31 |\n30 |\n29 |\n28 |\n30 |\n|\nRoof Loading Capacity - Lbs |\n176 |\n220 |\n176 |\n176 |\n165 |\nLike most things in life, before you overinvest in something you may end up not liking, it's best to dip your toes in before over-committing. As you progress and graduate to the next level, you'll quickly realize what you're lacking and make the appropriate adjustments when on a budget. In the world of overlanding, spending is easy, and it could run away from you, given the almost limitless options you could get in the vehicle customization world.\nIt's a cautionary tale, so the best approach is to start small and gradually build up. Sell and upgrade if necessary, and never be that person with all the gear and none of the ideas. Sometimes less is more, especially when you're starting in the game. Smaller SUVs are leveraging technology and capability and have a lot of potential, punching above their weight. So, if the bigger, more expensive cars can do it, why can't the smaller ones join in on the fun at less of the cost?"

      "text": "Not all entry-level luxury SUVs deliver the upscale experience buyers expect, but this one does. With refined design, smooth performance, and thoughtful features, it punches well above its weight in the luxury segment.\nStep inside, and you\u2019re greeted by a cabin that feels anything but entry-level. High-quality materials, intuitive tech, and a minimalist aesthetic create an environment that rivals more expensive models. On the road, it offers a composed ride, confident handling, and just enough power to feel spirited.\nWhat really sets this compact luxury SUV apart is how effortlessly it blends a premium feel with everyday usability. It\u2019s comfortable, stylish, and practical, making it an excellent choice for buyers who want upscale features without stretching their budget.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including TopSpeed and the EPA.\nThis Compact SUV Delivers Luxury Without the High Price Tag\nWith upscale styling, a premium cabin, and refined road manners, this compact SUV feels luxurious, without the luxury-brand pricing.\nVolvo's XC40 is Reasonably Affordable For a Luxury Crossover\nVolvo is a brand that doesn't necessarily carry all that much clout in the luxury world, with people generally opting for flashier options. Despite the Swedish brand's low-key approach, we think that they develop some of the most impressive premium vehicles on the market. Even their most affordable crossover, the XC40, clearly demonstrates this, and it is more affordable than a lot of its rivals.\n2025 Trims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nCore |\n$41,945 |\n|\nPlus |\n$46,795 |\n|\nUltra |\n$50,595 |\nThe Volvo XC40 has one of the lowest starting prices in the subcompact SUV segment, with many of its core rivals costing a couple of thousands higher. Even more impressive is the fact that the Swedish crossover comes so well-equipped, with a plethora of standard features that come as extra-cost options if you were to go for its competitors. This includes a bevy of safety and driver assist features.\nThe Core model comes pretty stacked in terms of features for the price, and we wouldn't blame you if you wanted to stick with the most affordable model. However, if you're looking for the high-end features that truly define the luxury segment, then the Plus is the way to go. It tacks on things like high-quality leather upholstery, a panoramic sunroof, and a striking Orrefors crystal gear selector, among other things.\nChanges For 2025\nVolvo hasn't made all that many changes to their subcompact SUV for the 2025 model year. They have, however, added a new paint option for you to choose from, namely Sand Dune, which replaces Bright Dusk. The Core model no longer comes with the Dark Theme interior, but it does gain power-folding rear seats as a standard feature instead. They have also renamed the top trim, changing it from Ultimate to Ultra. Finally, front-wheel drive has been axed as an option, with all 2025 XC40's coming standard with all-wheel drive instead.\nWarranties and After-Sales Support\n- Limited Warranty - Four Years or 50,000 Miles\n- Powertrain Warranty - Four Years or 50,000 Miles\n- Complimentary Maintenance - Three Years or 36,000 Miles\nVolvo's included warranty coverage is not mind-blowing, but it is reasonable. The bumper-to-bumper coverage on offer is slightly above average for this segment, with the powertrain warranty being slightly below average. What is impressive, though, is the fact that the Swedish brand includes three years of scheduled maintenance visits as part of your purchase.\nThe Best Used Luxury SUV Under $30,000\nSpacious, elegant, and loaded with premium features, this used luxury SUV delivers top-tier value and refinement for under $30K.\nA Refined, Minimalist Interior Packed With Premium Materials Awaits You\nVolvo is a brand that embodies the phrase \"money doesn't shout, it whispers\". Where a lot of other luxury automakers aim to be as flashy as possible, sometimes coming across as kitsch, the XC40 lets its exceptional build quality, comfortable materials, and plentiful features speak for themselves. In our opinion, there are few right now who do luxury as well as Volvo.\nInterior Dimensions and Comfort\n|\nFront Row Headroom |\n37.6 Inches |\n|---|---|\n|\nFront Row Legroom |\n40.9 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Headroom |\n38.3 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Legroom |\n36.1 Inches |\n|\nCargo Capacity (Behind Third Row) |\n34.9 Cubic Feet |\nFor a subcompact crossover, the Volvo XC40 is impressively spacious. Those in the front seats are obviously treated the best, with a ton of legroom. However, those relegated to the back seats won't find all that much to complain about, with more legroom than you would find in the Volvo's rivals. Cargo capacity is also exceptional, with a ton of space behind the second row. Fold the rear seats down, and you can get a total of 65.7 cubic feet.\nVolvo has a pretty cohesive design ideology across their entire lineup, one that they have spent a lot of time cultivating. While the minimalist approach is certainly evident, the XC40 does feature a hint of playfulness. The star of the show, though, is the high-end materials used throughout the cabin. When fully kitted, it comes with plenty of comfort features, including heated seats, a heated steering wheel, and dual-zone climate control with an air purification system.\nInfotainment and Technology\nCore in Volvo's design identity right now is the portrait layout of the infotainment screens in their vehicles. The XC40 features a nine-inch touchscreen that sits dab in the middle of the dashboard, regardless of which model you opt for. While there are a few physical buttons, most of the cabin's core functions can be accessed via this touchscreen. Voice controls are also available though. Every XC40 also comes with a 12.3-inch digital gauge display.\nThe XC40 features a number of USB ports, which can be used to connect your phone via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Volvo doesn't currently offer wireless connectivity for these features, unfortunately. A standard eight-speaker sound system will satisfy most, but a 13-speaker Harman Kardon premium sound system is available on top trims.\nThe Innovative Mid-Size Luxury SUV That Costs Less Than Its Rivals\nPacked with high-end tech, standout design, and a smooth ride, this mid-size luxury SUV undercuts its competitors without cutting corners.\nThe XC40 Is Perky, Efficient, and Packed With Safety Features\nVolvo is known around the world for building some of the safest cars on the road. In the modern age, they have innovated some of the industry's most impressive safety features. This all helps to make the XC40 one of the sturdiest vehicles that you can buy today. Don't think this makes it boring, though, with the subcompact SUV featuring a peppy powertrain.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n247 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n258 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n6.1 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n114 MPH |\nEvery XC40 comes with the same powertrain. A turbocharged four-cylinder engine sits under the hood, assisted by a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. As mentioned already, Volvo has gotten rid of front-wheel drive models for 2025, meaning that every new model comes standard with all-wheel drive. This setup means that the crossover is quicker off the line than you would expect.\nEverything in the XC40 operated smoothly. From the slick-shifting eight-speed automatic to the finely tuned suspension. It may not be as athletic as some rivals, but it handles twists and turns in the road with plenty of confidence. Ride quality is superb, with the suspension eating up most of the bumps in the road without any complaints. One of the most impressive things about this little SUV is the fact that it comes with a tow rating of 3,500 pounds, an extreme rarity in this segment.\nFuel Economy\n|\nModel |\nCity |\nHighway |\nCombined |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nXC40 AWD |\n23 MPG |\n30 MPG |\n26 MPG |\nThe XC40 may not be the most efficient vehicle in its class, but it doesn't perform badly by any means. If outright efficiency is what you're after, then you may be better served opting for the BMW X1 or the Mercedes-Benz GLA. Given the power that is on offer here, though, it feels like a pretty fair trade off.\nKey Safety and Driver Assist Features\n- City Safety Collision Avoidance\n- Lane Keeping Aid\n- Rear Collision Warning & Mitigation\n- Blind Spot Information System\n- Adaptive Cruise Control\nVolvo is king when it comes to safety on the road, with a ton of standard features making their way into the XC40. Things like automated emergency braking and blind-spot assistance are standard features. The Volvo also has an interesting feature where it tightens the seatbelts and flashes its lights when it predicts a collision, preparing you and your passengers for impact. Semi-autonomous driving is also available in the XC40.\nIt has performed excellently in crash testing, with the NHTSA scoring the crossover five stars out of five for safety."

It\u2019s the rare kind of car that\u2019s as common in suburban driveways as it is on rugged trails, and that\u2019s exactly why it continues to outsell entire luxury lineups.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including TopSpeed and the EPA.\nToyota's RAV4 is the Best-Selling SUV in the United States\nThere is no denying the popularity of the Lexus brand, with most of their vehicles offering affordable alternatives to other luxury options while delivering the same level of comfort. However, a single Toyota model manages to outsell the entirety of the Lexus brand, taking its place as the best-selling SUV in the United States multiple years in a row.\nRAV4 Sales vs Lexus Sales (2025 YTD)\n|\nToyota RAV4 |\nLexus Division |\n|\n|---|---|---|\n|\nUnits Sold |\n239,451 |\n178,966 |\nIn the luxury space, Lexus is easily one of the biggest players. They outsell their rivals by quite a large margin. The Lexus RX and the NX take first and second, respectively, when it comes to the best-selling luxury vehicles. Despite having quite a large lead over the rest of its competition, the Toyota RAV4 manages to outsell the entirety of Lexus' lineup combined.\nToyota has found a recipe that is so successful that few of its rivals manage to even compete. It has held the spot as the best-selling SUV in the United States since 2017. Last year it even managed to dethrone the Ford F-150 to become the best-selling vehicle in the country. The only other SUV that manages to come close is Honda's CR-V, which is still tens of thousands behind the RAV4. This is despite Toyota seeing a 3.6 percent decrease in sales compared to last year.\nA Diverse Lineup Helps the RAV4 Sell\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nLE |\n$29,550 |\n|\nXLE |\n$31,060 |\n|\nHybrid LE |\n$32,600 |\n|\nXLE Premium |\n$33,950 |\n|\nHybrid XLE |\n$34,110 |\n|\nHybrid SE |\n$35,295 |\n|\nHybrid Woodland Edition |\n$35,820 |\n|\nHybrid XLE Premium |\n$37,000 |\n|\nLimited |\n$37,885 |\n|\nHybrid XSE |\n$38,260 |\n|\nHybrid Limited |\n$40,905 |\n|\nPHEV SE |\n$44,565 |\n|\nPHEV XSE |\n$48,435 |\nThe Toyota RAV4 comes in a number of different forms, with there being a gas-only, a hybrid, and a plug-in hybrid on offer. This diversity helps make the RAV4 one of the most versatile nameplates out there, catering to a number of different buyers. A total of 111,526 RAV4s sold so far in 2025 were hybrids and 17,074 were plug-in hybrids. This means that half of all RAV4 sales in 2025 so far come from electrified models.\nWe think that the plug-in hybrid model is a bit niche, hence why it has the lowest sales, and that the regular hybrid is the best value version of the crossover. We also think that the XLE Premium trim is the trim of choice, whether you go with the gas-only model or the hybrid, offering fantastic features like faux-leather upholstery, keyless entry, a moonroof, and blind-spot monitoring, among other things.\nThe Upcoming 2026 Model Could Bolster Sales\nAs mentioned above, the RAV4 has actually seen a decline in sales compared to last year. This is likely because it is getting a little long in the tooth, with other compact crossovers feeling a little bit more modern. However, Toyota unveiled their 2026 model, going all in on hybrid power. It comes with a ton of interior and exterior upgrades that Toyota hopes will only increase its popularity.\nThe RAV4 is Sturdy, Comfortable, and Exceptionally Efficient in Any Form\nToyota has built the RAV4 on a reputation for reliability and simplicity. It is meant to be a vehicle that you get into every morning and start without issues, taking you from point A to point B without any fuss. While it might be a little dull, its consistency is a part of what makes it so successful. Its like going to McDonalds, you know the Big Mac is going to be the same every time, which is what makes it good.\n2025 Performance Specifications\n|\nModel |\nGas |\nHybrid |\nPlug-In Hybrid |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nEngine |\n2.5-Liter Naturally Aspirated Inline-Four |\n2.5-Liter Naturally Aspirated Inline-Four |\n2.5-Liter Naturally Aspirated Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\nCVT |\nCVT |\n|\nHorsepower |\n203 HP |\n219 HP |\n302 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n184 LB-FT |\n163 LB-FT |\n163 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\nAWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n8.3 Seconds |\n7.3 Seconds |\n5.4 Seconds |\nUnder the hood of every RAV4 is a proven four-cylinder engine that is known for its reliability. The hybrid model adds three electric motors to the mix, with the plug-in hybrid getting more powerful versions of the electric motors. The gas-only model gets a standard eight-speed automatic while the hybrids get a CVT instead. All-wheel drive is optional on the gas model and standard in the hybrids.\nNo matter which model you choose, the RAV4 is never going to feel sporty. It may be pretty quick off the line in hybrid or plug-in hybrid guise, but the handling and ride are exceptionally soft. This does mean that while the Toyota isn't particularly exciting, it is very comfortable. The crossover doesn't try to be anything that its not, it is simple and comfortable transportation, and we respect that.\nFuel Economy and Range\n|\nModel |\nCity |\nHighway |\nCombined |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nHybrid AWD |\n41 MPG |\n38 MPG |\n39 MPG |\n|\nPHEV AWD |\n40 MPG |\n36 MPG |\n38 MPG |\n|\nGas FWD |\n27 MPG |\n35 MPG |\n30 MPG |\n|\nGas AWD |\n27 MPG |\n33 MPG |\n29 MPG |\nIf you're running on gas power, the hybrid is the most efficient model. A crossover of this size coming close to breaking 40 miles per gallon combined is exceptional to say the least. The gas-only model isn't bad either, sitting near the top of its class. When you're not running on electric power, the plug-in hybrid is also impressively efficient, sticking close to the figures achieved by the regular hybrid.\nThe PHEV also comes equipped with an 18.1-kWh battery pack, allowing for a total of 42 miles of all-electric range. That means it offers more electric range than most PHEVs on the market. When plugged into a 240-volt outlet, Toyota says the battery will fully charge in as little as two and a half hours.\nSafety and Driver Assist Features\n- Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection\n- Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist\n- Panoramic View Monitor with Perimeter Scan\n- Front and Rear Parking Assist with Automatic Braking\n- Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control\nA big part of the success of the RAV4 is that Toyota includes so many advanced safety and driver assist features in the crossover as standard. Many of them form a part of Toyota's Safety Sense 2.5 package. Things like collision detection and avoidance systems and advanced radar cruise control are all standard features. Parking assist and the 360-degree camera are the main non-standard features available.\nThe RAV4 also performs exceptionally in crash and safety testing. The NHTSA has given the crossover five stars out of five for safety.\nToyota's RAV4 Is Comfortable, Practical, and Loaded With Features\nToyota is all about value for money, and this is a big reason why the RAV4 sells so well. While it doesn't try and be fancy nor sporty on the inside, it is an easy-to-use SUV that offers tons of space on the inside. Some may look at the RAV4 and feel that it is a little mundane, but that commonality is why it performs so well. The average car buyer wants something simple and easy to use.\nInterior Dimensions and Comfort\n|\nFront Row Headroom |\n39.5 Inches |\n|---|---|\n|\nFront Row Legroom |\n41 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Headroom |\n39.5 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Legroom |\n37.8 Inches |\n|\nCargo Capacity |\n37.6 Cubic Feet |\nToyota finds the perfect sweet spot when it comes to space in the front seats, rear seats, and cargo hold. Those at the helm are treated best, with plenty of space to stretch out. If you find yourself in the backseat, you still have enough legroom to be comfortable on long journeys. The slightly smaller rear quarters means that the RAV4 can offer you more space in the cargo hold than most of its rivals. Fold the rear seats down, and you can increase cargo space to 69.8 cubic feet.\nAs mentioned a couple of times, the RAV4 doesn't try and be flashy, even in its most expensive trims. It focuses on practicality, something that the average buyer values quite highly. This doesn't mean that it skimps on features, though. Faux-leather upholstery is available, as is a six-way power-adjustable driver's seat, heating and ventilation in the front seats, dual-zone climate control, and ambient interior lighting.\nInfotainment and Technology\nIf you go for the LE or the XLE trims, then you get the standard eight-inch infotainment screen, which rises up above the dashboard. Every other trim benefits from a larger 10.5-inch unit instead. Things like a 4G mobile hotspot and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are on offer. Top trims also come with a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster.\nThere are multiple USB and USB-C ports available the cabin, and you can also equip your RAV4 with a wireless smartphone charging pad. A digital rearview mirror is also among the options available. Base models come with a pretty wimpy six-speaker sound system, but you can upgrade to a much better 11-speaker JBL system instead."
