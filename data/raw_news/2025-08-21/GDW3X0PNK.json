  "title": "How wealthy investors use ETFs to skirt capital gains taxes. The strategy is 'like magic,\u2019 advisor says",
  "description": "Wealthy investors avoid capital gains taxes by using a 351 conversion to transfer profitable assets to an ETF. Here's how the strategy works.",
  "content": "After years of stock market growth, many investors are sitting on large profits in taxable accounts, which could trigger hefty capital gains when sold. That bill can be significant for wealthy Americans, with a 20% top capital gains rate, plus 3.8% net investment income tax, depending on earnings. One solution, known as a 351 conversion or exchange, allows higher earners to transform appreciated assets into shares of new exchange-traded funds. The strategy seeds ETFs before launch, and the original investor defers capital gains until selling their shares. For some investors, the strategy is \"like magic,\" said certified financial planner David Haas, president of Cereus Financial Advisors in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.\n\nOne of the benefits of the ETF wrapper is that fund managers can accept assets before launch, and later rebalance without incurring gains. While the volume of 351 exchanges for ETFs has increased in recent years, there are still relatively few public options, experts say. Haas has used 351 conversions for certain clients. But there are some downsides to consider, he said. Here are the key things to know.\n\nMany higher earners keep some investments in separately managed accounts, or SMAs, which are taxable, customized portfolios with an active manager. One benefit of SMAs is tax-loss harvesting, which uses losses to offset portfolio gains. But those opportunities \"dwindle over time\" as assets grow, said Daniel Sotiroff, a senior analyst for Morningstar Research Services. Eventually, \"there are fewer losses to harvest,\" and you can't change investments without incurring capital gains, he said.\n\nFor some, 351 conversions to ETFs could solve the problem, he said. Large financial planning firms that manage clients' SMAs can create a private ETF via 351 conversions. More recently, smaller firms or SMAs can participate in publicly seeded ETFs. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we see more,\" Sotiroff said. However, minimum investments are still high. For example, Alpha Architect recommends a \"minimum portfolio\" of $1 million. Cambria Funds' first 351 ETF conversion launch in December 2024 also had a $1 million minimum for individuals.\n\nYour 351 conversion must be 'diversified'\n\nWhile deferring capital gains taxes on embedded profits may be attractive, 351 conversions to ETFs have specific rules, experts say. \"You can't just put one stock into a 351 exchange and get tax-deferred treatment,\" Ben Henry-Moreland, a CFP with advisor platform Kitces.com, told CNBC. There are strict diversification requirements to qualify for deferred capital gains. Your transferred assets are only \"diversified\" if:\n\u2022 A single stock or company isn't more than 25% of the contributed assets\n\u2022 The five largest assets aren't more than 50% of the contributed assets Plus, certain assets, like mutual funds or alternative assets such as private equity or cryptocurrency, may not be permitted for the transfer, Henry-Moreland wrote of 351 exchanges in March.\n\nYour money could be 'stuck'",

      "text": "Investors who hold exchange-traded funds can often escape a tax bill incurred by those with mutual funds, which are generally less tax efficient, according to investment experts.\nETFs and mutual funds are baskets of stocks, bonds and other financial assets overseen by professional money managers. But they have a different legal structure that bestows ETFs with a \"tax magic that's unrivaled by mutual funds,\" Bryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research for North America and editor of the ETFInvestor newsletter at Morningstar, wrote this year.\nThat tax savings relates to annual capital gains distributions within the funds.\nCapital gains taxes are owed on investment profits.\nFund managers can generate such taxes within a fund when they buy and sell securities. The taxes then get passed along to all the fund shareholders, who owe a tax bill even if they reinvest those distributions.\nThe ETF tax advantage is by virtue of \"in-kind creations and redemptions,\" which essentially provides for tax-free trades for many ETFs, experts explain. (The ETF's in-kind transaction mechanism is somewhat complex. At a high level, it involves large institutional investors called \"authorized participants,\" which create or redeem ETF shares directly with the ETF provider.)\nThe tax advantage is generally most apparent for stock funds, they said.\nFor example, more than 60% of stock mutual funds distributed capital gains in 2023, according to Morningstar. That was true for just 4% of ETFs.\nLess than 4% of ETFs are expected to distribute capital gains in 2024, Morningstar estimates. Such data isn't yet available for mutual funds.\nImportantly, this tax advantage is only relevant for investors holding funds in taxable accounts, experts said.\nIt's a moot point for retirement account investors like those with a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account, which already come with tax benefits, experts said.\nThe tax advantage \"really helps the non-IRA account more than anything,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald III, a certified financial planner based in Orlando, Florida, and a founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo.\n\"You'll have tax efficiency that a standard mutual fund is not going to be able to achieve, hands down,\" he said.\nHowever, ETFs don't always have a tax advantage, experts said.\nFor example, certain ETF holdings may not be able to benefit from in-kind transactions, Armour said.\nExamples include physical commodities, as well as derivatives like swaps, futures contracts, currency forwards and certain options contracts, he said.\nAdditionally, certain nations like Brazil, China, India, South Korea and Taiwan may treat in-kind redemptions of securities domiciled in those countries as taxable events, he said."

      "text": "Find out if the Net Investment Income Tax applies to you.\nBasics of the Net Investment Income Tax\n1. What is the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)?\nThe Net Investment Income Tax is imposed by section 1411 of the Internal Revenue Code. The NIIT applies at a rate of 3.8% to certain net investment income of individuals, estates and trusts that have income above the statutory threshold amounts.\n2. When did the Net Investment Income Tax take effect?\nThe Net Investment Income Tax went into effect on Jan. 1, 2013. The NIIT affects income tax returns of individuals, estates and trusts, beginning with their first tax year beginning on (or after) Jan. 1, 2013. It does not affect income tax returns for the 2012 taxable year filed in 2013.\nWho Owes the Net Investment Income Tax\n3. What individuals are subject to the Net Investment Income Tax?\nIndividuals will owe the tax if they have Net Investment Income and also have modified adjusted gross income over the following thresholds:\n| Filing Status | Threshold Amount |\n|---|---|\n| Married filing jointly |\n$250,000 |\n| Married filing separately |\n$125,000 |\n| Single |\n$200,000 |\n| Head of household (with qualifying person) |\n$200,000 |\n| Qualifying widow(er) with dependent child |\n$250,000 |\nTaxpayers should be aware that these threshold amounts are not indexed for inflation.\nIf you are an individual who is exempt from Medicare taxes, you still may be subject to the Net Investment Income Tax if you have Net Investment Income and also have modified adjusted gross income over the applicable thresholds.\n4. What is modified adjusted gross income for purposes of the Net Investment Income Tax?\nFor the Net Investment Income Tax, modified adjusted gross income is adjusted gross income (Form 1040, Line 37) increased by the difference between amounts excluded from gross income under section 911(a)(1) and the amount of any deductions (taken into account in computing adjusted gross income) or exclusions disallowed under section 911(d)(6) for amounts described in section 911(a)(1). In the case of taxpayers with income from controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) and passive foreign investment companies (PFICs), they may have additional adjustments to their AGI. See section 1.1411-10(e) of the final regulations.\n5. What individuals are not subject to the Net Investment Income Tax?\nNonresident Aliens (NRAs) are not subject to the Net Investment Income Tax. If an NRA is married to a U.S. citizen or resident and has made, or is planning to make, an election under section 6013(g) or 6013(h) to be treated as a resident alien for purposes of filing as Married Filing Jointly, the final regulations provide these couples special rules and a corresponding section 6013(g)/(h) election for the NIIT.\nA dual-resident individual, within the meaning of regulation \u00a7301.7701(b)-7(a)(1), who determines that he or she is a resident of a foreign country for tax purposes pursuant to an income tax treaty between the United States and that foreign country and claims benefits of the treaty as a nonresident of the United States is considered a NRA for purposes of the NIIT.\nA dual-status individual, who is a resident of the United States for part of the year and a NRA for the other part of the year, is subject to the NIIT only with respect to the portion of the year during which the individual is a United States resident. The threshold amount (described in # 3 above) is not reduced or prorated for a dual-status resident.\n6. What estates and trusts are subject to the Net Investment Income Tax?\nEstates and trusts are subject to the Net Investment Income Tax if they have undistributed Net Investment Income and also have adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket for an estate or trust begins for such taxable year under section 1(e) (for tax year 2013, this threshold amount is $11,950). Generally, the threshold amount for the upcoming year is updated by IRS each fall in a revenue procedure. For 2014, the threshold amount is $12,150 (See Rev. Proc. 2013-35 PDF).\nThere are special computational rules for certain unique types of trusts, such as Qualified Funeral Trusts, Charitable Remainder Trusts and Electing Small Business Trusts, which can be found in the final regulations (see # 20 below).\n7. What estates and trusts are not subject to the Net Investment Income Tax?\nThe following trusts are not subject to the Net Investment Income Tax:\n- Trusts that are exempt from income taxes imposed by Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., charitable trusts and qualified retirement plan trusts exempt from tax under section 501, and Charitable Remainder Trusts exempt from tax under section 664).\n- A trust or decedent\u2019s estate in which all of the unexpired interests are devoted to one or more of the purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B).\n- Trusts that are classified as \u201cgrantor trusts\u201d under sections 671-679.\n- Trusts that are not classified as \u201ctrusts\u201d for federal income tax purposes (e.g., Real Estate Investment Trusts and Common Trust Funds).\n- Electing Alaska Native Settlement Trusts.\n- Perpetual Care (Cemetery) Trusts.\nWhat is Included in Net Investment Income\n8. What is included in Net Investment Income?\nIn general, investment income includes, but is not limited to: interest, dividends, capital gains, rental and royalty income, non-qualified annuities, income from businesses involved in trading of financial instruments or commodities and businesses that are passive activities to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 469). To calculate your Net Investment Income, your investment income is reduced by certain expenses properly allocable to the income (see #13 below).\n9. What are some common types of income that are not Net Investment Income?\nWages, unemployment compensation; operating income from a nonpassive business, Social Security Benefits, alimony, tax-exempt interest, self-employment income, Alaska Permanent Fund Dividends (see Rev. Rul. 90-56, 1990-2 CB 102) and distributions from certain Qualified Plans (those described in sections 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, 408A or 457(b)).\n10. What kinds of gains are included in Net Investment Income?\nTo the extent that gains are not otherwise offset by capital losses, the following gains are common examples of items taken into account in computing Net Investment Income:\n- Gains from the sale of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.\n- Capital gain distributions from mutual funds.\n- Gain from the sale of investment real estate (including gain from the sale of a second home that is not a primary residence).\n- Gains from the sale of interests in partnerships and S corporations (to the extent the partner or shareholder was a passive owner). See section 1.1411-7 of the 2013 proposed regulations.\n11. Does this tax apply to gain on the sale of a personal residence?\nThe Net Investment Income Tax does not apply to any amount of gain that is excluded from gross income for regular income tax purposes. The pre-existing statutory exclusion in section 121 exempts the first $250,000 ($500,000 in the case of a married couple) of gain recognized on the sale of a principal residence from gross income for regular income tax purposes and, thus, from the NIIT.\nExample 1: A, a single filer, earns $210,000 in wages and sells his principal residence that he has owned and resided in for the last 10 years for $420,000. A\u2019s cost basis in the home is $200,000. A\u2019s realized gain on the sale is $220,000. Under section 121, A may exclude up to $250,000 of gain on the sale. Because this gain is excluded for regular income tax purposes, it is also excluded for purposes of determining Net Investment Income. In this example, the Net Investment Income Tax does not apply to the gain from the sale of A\u2019s home.\nExample 2: B and C, a married couple filing jointly, sell their principal residence that they have owned and resided in for the last 10 years for $1.3 million. B and C\u2019s cost basis in the home is $700,000. B and C\u2019s realized gain on the sale is $600,000. The recognized gain subject to regular income taxes is $100,000 ($600,000 realized gain less the $500,000 section 121 exclusion). B and C have $125,000 of other Net Investment Income, which brings B and C\u2019s total Net Investment Income to $225,000. B and C\u2019s modified adjusted gross income is $300,000 and exceeds the threshold amount of $250,000 by $50,000. B and C are subject to NIIT on the lesser of $225,000 (B\u2019s Net Investment Income) or $50,000 (the amount B and C\u2019s modified adjusted gross income exceeds the $250,000 married filing jointly threshold). B and C owe Net Investment Income Tax of $1,900 ($50,000 X 3.8%).\nExample 3: D, a single filer, earns $45,000 in wages and sells her principal residence that she has owned and resided in for the last 10 years for $1 million. D\u2019s cost basis in the home is $600,000. D\u2019s realized gain on the sale is $400,000. The recognized gain subject to regular income taxes is $150,000 ($400,000 realized gain less the $250,000 section 121 exclusion), which is also Net Investment Income. D\u2019s modified adjusted gross income is $195,000. Since D\u2019s modified adjusted gross income is below the threshold amount of $200,000, D does not owe any Net Investment Income Tax.\n12. Does Net Investment Income include interest, dividends and capital gains of my children that I report on my Form 1040 using Form 8814?\nThe amounts of Net Investment Income that are included on your Form 1040 by reason of Form 8814 are included in calculating your Net Investment Income. However, the calculation of your Net Investment Income does not include (a) amounts excluded from your Form 1040 due to the threshold amounts on Form 8814 and (b) amounts attributable to Alaska Permanent Fund Dividends.\n13. What investment expenses are deductible in computing NII?\nIn order to arrive at Net Investment Income, Gross Investment Income (items described in items 7-11 above) is reduced by deductions that are properly allocable to items of Gross Investment Income. Examples of deductions, a portion of which may be properly allocable to Gross Investment Income, include investment interest expense, investment advisory and brokerage fees, expenses related to rental and royalty income, tax preparation fees, fiduciary expenses (in the case of an estate or trust) and state and local income taxes.\n14. Will I have to pay both the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax and the additional .9% Medicare tax?\nYou may be subject to both taxes, but not on the same type of income.\nThe 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax applies to individuals\u2019 wages, compensation and self-employment income over certain thresholds, but it does not apply to income items included in Net Investment Income. See more information on the Additional Medicare Tax.\nHow the Net Investment Income Tax is Reported and Paid\n15. If I am subject to the Net Investment Income Tax, how will I report and pay the tax?\nIndividuals, estates, and trusts will use Form 8960 PDF and instructions PDF to compute their Net Investment Income Tax.\nFor individuals, the tax will be reported on, and paid with, the Form 1040. For estates and trusts, the tax will be reported on, and paid with, the Form 1041.\n16. Is the Net Investment Income Tax subject to the estimated tax provisions?\nThe Net Investment Income Tax is subject to the estimated tax provisions. Individuals, estates and trusts that expect to be subject to the tax in 2013 or thereafter should adjust their income tax withholding or estimated payments to account for the tax increase in order to avoid underpayment penalties. For more information on tax withholding and estimated tax, see Publication 505, Tax withholding and Estimated Tax.\n17. Can tax credits reduce my NIIT liability?\nAny federal income tax credit that may be used to offset a tax liability imposed by subtitle A of the Code may be used to offset the NII. However, if the tax credit is allowed only against the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code (regular income tax), those credits may not reduce the NIIT. For example, foreign income tax credits (sections 27(a) and 901(a)) and the general business credit (section 38) are allowed as credits only against the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code, and therefore may not be used to reduce your NIIT liability. If you take foreign income taxes as an income tax deduction (versus a tax credit), some (or all) of the deduction amount may deducted against NII.\n18. Does the tax have to be withheld from wages?\nNo, but you may request that additional income tax be withheld from your wages.\nExamples of the Calculation of the Net Investment Income Tax\n19. Single taxpayer with income less than the statutory threshold.\nTaxpayer, a single filer, has wages of $180,000 and $15,000 of dividends and capital gains. Taxpayer\u2019s modified adjusted gross income is $195,000, which is less than the $200,000 statutory threshold. Taxpayer is not subject to the Net Investment Income Tax.\n20. Single taxpayer with income greater than the statutory threshold.\nTaxpayer, a single filer, has $180,000 of wages. Taxpayer also received $90,000 from a passive partnership interest, which is considered Net Investment Income. Taxpayer\u2019s modified adjusted gross income is $270,000.\nTaxpayer\u2019s modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold of $200,000 for single taxpayers by $70,000. Taxpayer\u2019s Net Investment Income is $90,000.\nThe Net Investment Income Tax is based on the lesser of $70,000 (the amount that Taxpayer\u2019s modified adjusted gross income exceeds the $200,000 threshold) or $90,000 (Taxpayer\u2019s Net Investment Income). Taxpayer owes NIIT of $2,660 ($70,000 x 3.8%).\nAdditional information\n21. Other than these FAQs, is there additional information available about the Net Investment Income Tax?\nYes. You can find additional information about the NIIT in the 2013 final regulations PDF and in a new 2013 proposed regulation PDF published on Dec. 2, 2013.\n22. The proposed regulations that were published on Dec. 5, 2012, are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2013, but the Net Investment Income Tax went into effect on Jan. 1, 2013. May I rely on those proposed regulations, the proposed regulations published on Dec. 2, 2013, and/or the final regulations, also published on Dec. 2, 2013, for guidance on the Net Investment Income Tax during 2013?\nYes. For taxable years beginning before Jan. 1, 2014 (e.g., calendar year 2013), taxpayers may rely on the 2012 proposed regulations (published on Dec. 5, 2012), the 2013 proposed regulations (published on Dec. 2, 2013), or the 2013 final regulations (published on Dec. 2, 2013) for purposes of completing Form 8960. However, to the extent that taxpayers take a position in a taxable year beginning before Jan. 1, 2014 that is inconsistent with the final regulations, and such position affects the treatment of one or more items in a taxable year beginning after Dec. 31, 2013, then such taxpayer must make reasonable adjustments to ensure that their Net Investment Income Tax liability in the taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2013 is not inappropriately distorted. For example, reasonable adjustments may be required to ensure that no item of income or deduction is taken into account in computing net investment income more than once, and that carryforwards, basis adjustments and other similar items are adjusted appropriately.\nRelated Item: Forms and Publications"

      "text": "President Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' added a temporary $40,000 limit on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT.\nBut the phaseout, or income-based benefit reduction, creates what some experts are calling a \"SALT torpedo,\" or artificially high tax rate, when modified adjusted gross income falls between $500,000 and $600,000.\n\"Anyone reporting income in that range\" should talk with their tax and investment advisors, said certified financial planner Jim Guarino, managing director at Baker Newman Noyes in Woburn, Massachusetts. He is also a certified public accountant.\nTrump's legislation boosts the SALT deduction cap to $40,000 starting in 2025. That limit increases yearly by 1% through 2029 and reverts to $10,000 in 2030.\nThe $40,000 limit decreases once MAGI exceeds $500,000, and phases out completely to $10,000 when income reaches $600,000. But the \"SALT torpedo\" creates a 45.5% federal tax rate on earnings between those thresholds.\nThat 45.5% rate could impact higher earners for 2025, but you can still reduce MAGI to avoid the tax penalty before year-end, experts say.\nHere are some strategies to consider.\nLimit the 'sneaky year-end tax hit'\nIf you're approaching the thresholds, you should manage any unexpected income, experts say.\nOne solution could be opting for exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, versus mutual funds in your taxable brokerage accounts.\n\"This could help limit the sneaky year-end tax hit,\" said CFP William Shafransky, a senior wealth advisor with Moneco Advisors in New York.\nWhile some mutual funds distribute year-end capital gains to shareholders, ETFs typically don't have a yearly payout.\nHowever, you would need to check the possible capital gain \u2014 and other tax consequences \u2014 from trading profitable mutual funds for ETFs in a brokerage account, Shafransky said.\nTax breaks become 'a lot more valuable'\nWith a tax penalty between $500,000 and $600,000, you could use tax breaks to keep earnings below those thresholds, experts say.\nFor example, you could switch from Roth to pretax 401(k) contributions to help bring earnings below $500,000, said Andy Whitehair, a CPA and a director with Baker Tilly's Washington tax council practice.\nThe tax break \"becomes a lot more valuable in that phaseout range,\" he said.\nPretax 401(k) contributions lower your adjusted gross income, but you have to pay taxes when you withdraw the funds in retirement.\nAvoid extra earnings\nIf you're approaching the $500,000 level for 2025, you may avoid activities like selling investments or a home with large profits, depending on your goals, experts say.\n\"You wouldn't want to take a big gain that's going to push you into this threshold,\" said Whitehair.\nYou wouldn't want to take a big gain that's going to push you into this threshold.Andy WhitehairDirector with Baker Tilly's Washington tax council practice\nThe same guidance may apply to Roth individual retirement account conversions, experts say. Roth conversions transfer pretax IRA funds to a Roth IRA, which starts future tax-free growth. The strategy typically incurs upfront income.\nHowever, \"you never want to do anything in a silo,\" and tax moves should always happen in tandem with your financial plan, Guarino said.\nTrump's legislation includes several key changes, which may require multiyear tax projections to gauge the full impact, he said."

      "text": "Executive Summary\nFollowing the long run-up in the US equity markets since the bottom of the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis, many investors with taxable investment accounts have likely found themselves with high embedded gains in their portfolios. While the gains signal portfolio growth, they also create challenges for ongoing management. Because when it comes time to rebalance the portfolio to its asset allocation targets \u2013 or to reallocate the portfolio to a new strategy \u2013 any trades made to implement those changes can generate capital gains, resulting in tax consequences for the investor.\nOnce a portfolio becomes 'locked up', i.e., unable to be managed without triggering capital gains, investors' options become limited. Charitably inclined investors can donate appreciated securities and avoid gains on the sale. If they don't plan to use the portfolio funds in their lifetime, they could simply hold the assets for heirs to preserve the stepped-up basis. Otherwise, the investor would traditionally have had to accept that taxes would impose a drag on their portfolio performance going forward.\nOne relatively new strategy, the Section 351 exchange, allows some investors to reallocate assets without triggering capital gains tax. Section 351 allows for tax deferral when assets are transferred to a corporation in exchange for that corporation's stock, provided the transferor owns at least 80% of the corporation following the exchange. Although the concept of Section 351 exchanges has existed for over a century, it has only recently been applied to individual investment portfolios.\nThe strategy works by pooling the portfolios of multiple investors in a newly created ETF, with the investors receiving ETF shares in return for the assets that they contributed. If the exchange meets the requirements of Section 351, it is tax-deferred for investors. And once inside the ETF 'wrapper', assets can be reallocated with no tax impact for the investors via the tax-efficient ETF structure, which makes use of in-kind creation and redemption of shares. In effect, investors can effectively trade a locked up for an ETF that can be managed with little or no tax impact at all!\nHowever, to meet the requirements for tax-deferred treatment under Section 351, each investor's portfolio must meet a diversification test, where no single asset can exceed 25% of the portfolio's value and the top five holdings cannot exceed 50% of the overall value. Additionally, certain assets, like mutual funds, alternative assets, and REITs, may not be eligible for exchange, although other ETFs generally are.\nFor financial advisors, Section 351 exchanges present a potential solution for clients with high embedded gains, such as those who through the use of tax-loss harvesting have lowered their portfolios' basis to the point where it's no longer possible to harvest any losses to offset the gains realized in reallocating the portfolio. Recently, several ETF sponsors have launched ETFs seeded in-kind by individual investors, creating a new channel for advisors who want to take advantage of Section 351 exchanges for clients. Some providers even offer services to help advisors launch their own ETFs seeded by their clients' funds.\nWhile the options for Section 351 exchanges remain limited \u2013 and some advisors may not yet be comfortable recommending them due to their short track record \u2013 the strategy is still worth watching. If it gains traction, it could be a helpful tool for advisors to implement more tax-efficient investment strategies \u2013 while overcoming the inconvenient tax friction of implementing the strategy to begin with!\nIf an investor has stayed in the equity markets over the last 15 years, there's a good chance they have substantial unrealized capital gains in their portfolio. During that time, the S&P 500 has risen over 600%, while more diversified 60/40 portfolios have grown by over 300%. This means that someone who bought and held onto their investments in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis could now easily have holdings worth three to six times what they originally paid for them.\nWhile it's obviously a good sign to have embedded gains in a portfolio \u2013 since it means the investments have performed well \u2013 the downside for assets held in a taxable account is that high unrealized gains can make the account difficult to manage without incurring taxable income. Rebalancing a portfolio to its target asset allocation often requires selling over-allocated (i.e., more appreciated) assets in order to buy under-allocated (less appreciated) assets, triggering taxable gains whenever trades are made to keep the portfolio aligned with the investor's risk/return goals. And if the investor needs to shift the portfolio to an entirely new asset allocation, it can be difficult to do so without generating significant taxable income when the old appreciated assets are sold to make way for the new allocation.\nAdvisors often offset the tax impact of trading through tax-loss harvesting, i.e., selling assets at a loss to counterbalance gains and minimize the investor's tax burden over time. In recent years, direct indexing technology has supercharged tax-loss-harvesting strategies by allowing investors to hold individual securities that track an index like the S&P 500. This makes it possible to take advantage of frequent short-term price movements to continually harvest losses throughout the year. The investor can then buy a similar (though not identical) security to avoid a wash sale that defers the loss, or simply wait out the 30-day wash sale period before repurchasing the original security.\nBut there's a tradeoff: Each time a security is sold at a loss and replaced with another, it lowers the cost basis of the portfolio. And although individual holdings may fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, markets tend to move upward over time. As a result, the account's basis moves downward while the overall portfolio value moves upward, making it harder to find capital losses to harvest. Eventually, there's little ability to make any moves in the portfolio without incurring taxable gains, and the portfolio has become \"locked up\".\nOnce a portfolio becomes locked up, the options for avoiding additional tax on trading are limited. If the owner doesn't plan to use the funds in the portfolio during their lifetime, they can avoid capital gain taxes entirely by contributing the portfolio to a charitable organization, either directly or via a charitable remainder trust or donor-advised fund. Or they can simply hold the assets as is, without any further trading, until death to pass to their heirs with a stepped-up basis.\nBut if the portfolio's owner does plan to use the funds during their lifetime, it becomes harder to avoid the tax consequences of rebalancing once the portfolio becomes locked up. This can result in a drag on the portfolio's pre-tax performance if funds have to be withdrawn to pay for the tax burden \u2013 and has led some investors and advisors to look for new solutions to minimize the tax impact of trading and rebalancing in taxable portfolios.\nHow Section 351 Exchanges Work\nThe problem of what to do with portfolio assets that are 'locked up' due to high embedded gains has sparked interest in a relatively modern twist on an existing tax strategy: the Section 351 exchange.\nIRC Section 351(a) states:\nNo gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a corporation by one or more persons solely in exchange for stock in such corporation and immediately after the exchange such person or persons are in control (as defined in Section 368(c)) of the corporation.\nIn practice, what that means is that appreciated property transferred to a corporation in exchange for its stock can qualify for tax-deferred treatment of any gain or loss on the property, provided the transferor owns at least 80% of the corporation immediately afterward.\nSection 351 has existed since 1954 (with similar provisions dating back to 1921) to encourage business formation by preventing property contributions to start a business from triggering taxable events.\nFor example, Company X decides to form a subsidiary, Company Y, to manufacture widgets. Company X transfers a factory worth $2 million (with a cost basis of $1 million) to Company Y in exchange for 100% of Company Y's stock.\nIf this were a taxable transaction, Company X would owe capital gains tax on the $1 million gain on the factory, even though it hasn't liquidated or given up control of the property through its ownership of Company Y. However, under Section 351, the transfer is tax deferred and there is no tax due on the transaction. Company X's tax basis in the factory simply carries over to its new shares in Company Y.\nThe modern twist on this strategy is that instead of transferring physical assets (e.g., factories) to a newly formed corporation, one or more individuals or businesses can instead transfer financial assets (e.g., stocks or bonds) into a newly formed Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) structured as a corporation.\nIn exchange, the investors receive ETF shares (at the tax lot level) without recognizing taxable income, as long as they collectively own at least 80% of the new ETF's shares immediately after the exchange.\nThe '25/50 Diversification Test' For Section 351 Exchanges Into An Investment Company\nAt least in theory, Section 351 lays the groundwork for investors to convert a portfolio of individually owned assets into a more tax-friendly corporate structure without recognizing any capital gains on the trade.\nThe caveat, though, is that Section 351(e) explicitly prohibits tax-deferred treatment from applying to any transfers of property to an \"investment company\". Treasury Regulations 1.351-1(c) clarifies that an \"investment company\" consists of any one of the following:\n- A Regulated Investment Company (RIC);\n- A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT); or\n- Any corporation where at least 80% of its assets (excluding cash and debt receivable) consist of readily marketable stocks or securities, RICs, or REITs.\nSince ETFs are a type of RIC, they generally fall under the Section 351(e) restriction, meaning tax-free transfers to ETFs are not allowed.\nHowever, the IRS regulations add that the Section 351(e) restriction only applies when two conditions are met:\n- The transferee is an investment company; and\n- The transfer results in the \"diversification\" of the transferor's interests.\nTreasury Regulations 1.351-1(c)(6) further specify that if a transferor's assets are already diversified prior to the exchange, the transfer does not count as diversification. This means that ETFs (or any other type of investment company) can be used in a Section 351 exchange, as long as the assets transferred in the exchange are already diversified.\nTo determine whether a portfolio is considered diversified, the IRS applies the Section 368(a)(2)(F) 25/50 test, which states that the portfolio is considered diversified if:\n- No more than 25% of the portfolio's assets are made up of the stock or securities of a single company; and\n- No more than 50% of the portfolio's assets are made up of the stock or securities of any five or fewer companies.\nSignificantly, Section 368(a)(2)(F)(ii) specifies that, for purposes of the 25/50 diversification tests, shares of a Regulated Investment Company that are transferred into the new company are treated as if they were a \"proportionate share of the of the assets held by such company or trust\".\nIn other words, if a fund such as an ETF is transferred into another ETF via a Section 351 exchange, the IRS will view the transferred ETF on a 'look-through' basis, and examine its underlying assets to determine whether it meets the diversification requirements for tax-deferred treatment under IRC Section 351. So, for example, shares of an S&P 500 index ETF would be treated not as a single asset but as an agglomeration of each of its 500 individual portfolio companies. This makes it much easier for ETF-based portfolios to pass the 25/50 diversification tests for a Section 351 exchange, since a portfolio consisting of 'only' one or two ETFs can still meet the requirements as long as the ETFs are themselves diversified.\nTo sum it up, then, to make a Section 351 exchange into an investment company like an ETF, the transaction must meet both the general requirements of Section 351(a) and the requirements of Section 351(e) and the related Treasury regulations that apply specifically to transfers to investment companies. This means that the exchange needs to have three broad characteristics:\n- Each investor contributes an already-diversified portfolio that passes the 25/50 diversification test (i.e., no single holding exceeds 25% of the portfolio's value, and the top five holdings don't exceed 50%, with regulated investment companies like ETFs treated on a look-through basis);\n- The transferor(s) receive stock in the new company (e.g., ETF shares) in exchange for the transfer; and\n- The transferor(s) retain at least 80% ownership of the transferee immediately following the exchange.\nNerd Note:\nIf multiple investors contribute assets to an investment company via a Section 351 exchange and one or more fail the 25/50 diversification test, the exchange remains tax-free for those who passed the test. Only the investor(s) whose assets failed the diversification test will have their transfer treated as a taxable event.\nSeeding ETFs Via Section 351 Exchange\nWhile a Section 351 exchange can theoretically be used to transfer assets into any investment vehicle structured as a corporation, it is most commonly applied to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This is because ETFs have an inherently tax-friendly structure that is conducive to investing in a taxable account.\nUnlike mutual funds, which must buy and sell their holdings for cash (potentially resulting in capital gains or losses that are passed on to shareholders as taxable income each year), ETFs deliver and receive assets in-kind from third party financial institutions called Authorized Participants (APs) \u2013 typically institutional broker-dealers. These APs facilitate the delivery and receipt of securities in exchange for shares of the ETF, a process that qualifies for tax-free treatment under IRC Section 852(b)(6). As a result, these redemptions are nontaxable to the ETF and, by extension, its shareholders.\nAs shown below, APs play an important role in balancing ETF supply and demand by capturing arbitrage opportunities:\n- When the ETF's share price rises above its Net Asset Value (NAV), APs contribute securities to the ETF in exchange for newly created ETF shares.\n- When the ETF's share price declines below its NAV, APs redeem ETF shares in exchange for securities.\nThis continuous arbitrage process relies on movements in the fund that offer opportunities to reallocate the ETF's holdings, without recognizing taxable gains, toward the investment objectives stated in the ETF's prospectus.\nAs a result, ETFs generally don't incur taxable gains for their investors when funding share redemptions in-kind. Similarly, they can also use in-kind redemptions for ongoing portfolio rebalancing with minimal tax consequences. Other than dividend distributions from the fund's underlying portfolio companies or instances where ETFs sell holdings for cash to cover costs, ETFs typically produce very little ongoing taxable income for investors. This makes them especially useful for taxable brokerage accounts, where lower taxable income reduces the drag of taxes on the portfolio's performance.\nAnd so, when using a Section 351 exchange to transfer assets tax-deferred into a new investment vehicle, it makes sense to use an ETF as the vehicle: Not only can the assets be moved into the ETF 'wrapper' via the Section 351 exchange to defer the realization of any gains, but once inside the ETF, they can be reallocated to the ETF's target investment mix without incurring taxable income through the ETF's in-kind share creation and redemption process.\nHow ETF Seeding Works\nThe key limitation to transferring assets tax-deferred into an ETF is that, under Section 351(a), individual(s) transferring assets need to own at least 80% of the transferee corporation to defer taxes on the exchange. As a result, Section 351 transfers can only be used to contribute assets to a newly created ETF, not an existing one where it wouldn't be realistically possible to meet the post-transfer ownership requirements.\nHere it's helpful to give a brief overview of the mechanics of how ETFs come into existence. ETFs are formed by a process called \"seeding\", where the fund's initial investors provide the capital used to buy the ETF's initial underlying holdings. Traditionally, ETF seeding is done by banks or financial institutions, which contribute cash or securities that become the ETF's initial holdings in return for shares of the ETF.\nHistorically, the ETF seeding process has usually been carried out by financial institutions that seek to sell their ETF shares as soon as they can trade them, rather than by investors who plan to keep their shares long-term. But there's no rule preventing individual investors from seeding an ETF \u2013 it's just easier for a single large institution to raise the capital needed to launch the ETF than it is for hundreds or thousands of individual investors to coordinate their own contributions.\nStill, some advisory firms have successfully launched their own ETFs seeded by client assets. In response, white-label ETF firms like ETF Architect, Tidal, and ETC have emerged to help facilitate the ETF creation process. But launching a proprietary ETF comes with its own set of financial and operational hurdles: ETFs, in general, are expensive to launch and run, with the startup costs of a new ETF running from $40,000\u2013$150,000 and the ongoing annual cost of running the fund reaching $200,000 or more.\nIn order to simply break even while charging a reasonable expense ratio (say, 0.5%), an advisor would need to seed the ETF with a minimum of $200,000 \u00f7 0.5% = $40,000,000 of client assets (and even more if they plan to charge a lower expense ratio).\nThe First Wave Of Publicly Seeded ETFs\nRecently, several retail ETF issuers have announced plans to launch ETFs seeded in-kind by individual investors via Section 351 exchange. Three funds have already been launched: Stance's Sustainable Beta ETF (November 11, 2024), Cambria's Tax Aware ETF (December 18, 2024), and Longview's Advantage ETF (February 25, 2025). Cambria is also in the process of launching a second fund, Cambria Endowment Style ETF, expected to launch on April 9, 2025.\nThe rapid succession of these ETFs seeded in-kind via Section 351 exchange is notable for advisors; for the first time, it suggests that a Section 351 exchange into an ETF could be a viable strategy for clients without requiring the advisor to create their own ETFs (and take on the associated costs and operational challenges). If publicly seeded ETF launches become more common in the future, advisors could help their clients choose from an array of ETFs open to seeding, then work with the chosen ETF sponsor to facilitate the paperwork and asset movements needed to complete the exchange. Which, at least in theory, could make it much easier to move a client's 'locked-up' portfolio into a more tax-efficient vehicle \u2013 without the significant up-front tax cost of selling the entire portfolio.\nHowever, with only a handful of ETFs having been seeded in-kind so far, that future is still a long way off. Still, the recent wave of in-kind seeded ETFs has sparked some important questions on how seeding an ETF via a Section 351 exchange would work in practice and whether the potential tax benefits of doing so would even make it a worthwhile strategy.\nThe Tax Benefits Of Section 351 Exchanges\nAt a base level, the value of a Section 351 exchange lies in its ability to defer the tax impact of shifting from one investment strategy to another. An investor who would have otherwise needed to carry out a complex multi-year liquidation strategy to minimize the tax hit from reallocating their portfolio can, theoretically, use a Section 351 exchange to reduce the tax 'friction' of the reallocation to zero.\nAlthough the tax on any embedded gains is only deferred, not eliminated \u2013 the tax will still be owed if and when the ETF is sold, unless it's either donated to a charity (potentially avoiding capital gains taxes altogether) or held until death to receive a step-up in basis. Still, deferring capital gains taxes allows for the continued growth of the dollars that would have otherwise gone toward paying capital gains tax when the portfolio was reallocated.\nSo for a given investor, the value of a Section 351 exchange comes down to two key factors: 1) How much the portfolio would benefit from shifting to a different strategy, and 2) How big the tax impact would be if the investor didn't use a Section 351 exchange to reallocate their portfolio.\nWhen A Portfolio Can Be Reallocated With A Section 351 Exchange\nFrom a portfolio perspective, there are many reasons why an investor might want to shift investment strategies \u2013 whether it's to better match the risk/return profile of the current portfolio with the investor's own needs, reduce high fees that drag on the portfolio's performance, or minimize taxable income through dividends or capital gains distributions that likewise bring down the portfolio's after-tax return.\nTransferring portfolio assets into an ETF with a Section 351 exchange can potentially solve some of these problems, but not all of them.\nBecause the Section 351 rules require assets transferred into an investment company to already be diversified, Section 351 exchanges can't be used to diversify a portfolio with highly concentrated holdings. This is a key distinction from exchange funds, a different type of investment vehicle governed by IRC Section 721 that's commonly used by investors with concentrated stock holdings (e.g., startup employees with employer stock compensation) to pool together their holdings with other investors with their own concentrated holdings in order to create a more diversified total portfolio. While media coverage, and in some cases ETF sponsors themselves, have compared seeding an ETF via Section 351 exchange to an exchange fund, the two are not the same. Section 351 exchanges require that the seeding investors' portfolios are already diversified before they're transferred to the ETF, which means they can't be used to diversify out of a concentrated position.\nAt the same time, however, Section 351 exchanges can still be used to increase the diversification of a relatively undiversified portfolio as long as it meets the 25/50 diversification test of Section 368(a)(2)(F).\nFor example, a portfolio of 15 technology stocks might not be well-diversified from an investment risk standpoint. However, if no single stock makes up more than 25% of the portfolio and the top five holdings don't exceed 50% of the portfolio, the portfolio could still be \"diversified\" enough to qualify for a Section 351 exchange. From there, the ETF can reallocate using in-kind exchanges to significantly increase the diversification of the original portfolio by adding additional companies and/or expanding into other sectors or industries \u2013 even though the original portfolio was already diversified according to the rules of Section 351.\nWhile IRC Section 351 doesn't explicitly restrict the types of assets that can be transferred, the mechanics of ETF in-kind redemptions limit what ETFs will actually accept. In practice, ETFs generally won't accept mutual fund shares, alternative assets like private equity or hedge fund positions, commodities, or cryptocurrency assets. So, if the reason for changing portfolio strategies is to exit any of those investment vehicles or asset classes, it won't work to do so via a Section 351 exchange into an ETF.\nFor instance, if an investor has a portfolio of high-fee mutual funds with large capital gains distributions that they want to convert into more tax-efficient ETFs, they would not be able to use a Section 351 exchange to transfer those shares into an ETF. Instead, they would first need to sell the mutual funds, recognize any embedded capital gains, and then reinvest the proceeds into an ETF. (ETFs do accept shares of other ETFs, as noted earlier, so it's possible to take a current portfolio of ETFs and convert it into a single new ETF via Section 351 exchange.)\nNerd Note:\nSEC rules require that an incoming portfolio must be aligned with the ETF's prospectus. For example, if an ETF's prospectus states that it only invests in non-US stocks, then it wouldn't be able to receive a portfolio of US stocks as a seeding contribution. In practice, though, publicly seeded ETFs tend to have relatively broad investment mandates that give the funds leeway in what types of assets they can receive. The ETF sponsor may still reject any contributions that create conflicts with the fund's stated investment strategy.\nAdditionally, ETF sponsors might not allow an incoming portfolio to have exactly 25% of a single position \u2013 they may cap the amount at 20% in order to ensure that market movements don't inadvertently cause a violation of the diversification rules.\nAnd so at the bottom line, two types of portfolios are a strong fit for conversion into an ETF via a Section 351 exchange.\nThe first is a portfolio of individual stocks that needs to be \"de-risked\" in some way, because it's too concentrated in a small number of companies, individual countries, sectors, or asset classes, with the caveat that the portfolio needs to meet the 25/50 diversification rules described earlier to receive tax-deferred treatment in the Section 351 exchange. For these portfolios, the Section 351 exchange into an ETF could allow for more diversification while continuing to defer taxes on any unrecognized gains.\nThe second is a portfolio experiencing a significant drag on its returns from a combination of high management fees and/or taxable income generated by the portfolio. The caveat here is that many of the portfolios with this issue are made up of mutual funds, which are generally ineligible for seeding an ETF.\nNerd Note:\nAlthough individual mutual fund shares generally can't be used to seed an ETF via a Section 351 exchange, an entire mutual fund can convert into an ETF by transferring its holdings into a newly created ETF, as Dimensional Fund Advisors did when it converted several of its long-standing mutual funds into ETFs in 2021.\nNotably, some Separately Managed Account (SMA) and Direct Indexing (DI) portfolios might also experience high return drag, particularly if the portfolio has high embedded gains and there are few opportunities to harvest losses, resulting in taxable gains any time the portfolio is rebalanced.\nIn these cases, transferring the portfolio into an ETF via Section 351 exchange could help minimize the tax drag of ongoing portfolio rebalancing once there are no more opportunities for tax-loss harvesting. Additionally, if the ETF's expense ratio is lower than the management fee of the SMA or DI platform, there might also be an opportunity to reduce fees with the ETF.\nThe Tax Deferral Impact Of A Section 351 Exchange\nOne of the biggest challenges of reallocating an investment portfolio \u2013 whether to adjust risk and return or to reduce fees or tax drag \u2013 is the tax impact of selling the existing holdings. When there are large embedded gains in the old portfolio, selling everything at once can generate a significant tax bill (especially if doing so bumps the investor from the 15% up to the 20% or 23.8% capital gains tax brackets). Which in turn takes money out of the portfolio that would otherwise be able to grow and compound over time.\nA Section 351 exchange, like other tax deferral strategies, helps eliminate this tax friction by allowing the assets to be transferred without an immediate tax event. This makes it similar to Section 1031 exchanges of real estate assets, Section 1035 exchanges of life insurance or annuity policies, and Section 721 exchange funds for concentrated positions mentioned earlier, as a class of transaction that allows for the deferral of gains provided that certain conditions are met.\nThe benefits of deferring taxes on an exchange are greatest when the tax consequences of the exchange would have had the biggest impact. The magnitude of the impact is a function of two factors: 1) The amount of taxable income that would be realized by making the change, and 2) the tax rate of the portfolio's owner. The more capital gains income that would be realized from selling the current portfolio and the higher the tax rate that the portfolio's owner pays on that income, the bigger the tax impact from making the change \u2013 and the greater the potential benefit from tax deferral.\nEvaluating When It Makes Sense To Use A Section 351 Exchange\nUltimately, the potential benefits of seeding an ETF via a Section 351 exchange move along two dimensions: 1) Whether reallocating the current portfolio into an ETF makes sense, and 2) whether doing so would have a significant tax impact.\nIf there's no urgent need to reallocate the portfolio, there's little reason to use the Section 351 exchange. If the portfolio is already adequately diversified, appropriate for the client's risk and return needs, tax-efficient, and has reasonable fees, it won't necessarily be improved any further by converting it into an ETF.\nLikewise, if the portfolio would benefit from being reallocated, but there would be little or no tax impact from simply selling the current portfolio and buying the ETF, then a Section 351 exchange wouldn't provide much value, since there would be no tax to defer to begin with.\nFor example, if there are enough unrealized losses in the portfolio that can be harvested to offset the capital gains from selling, then the portfolio could be reallocated without any tax impact without using a Section 351 exchange. And if the investor is in the 0% capital gains tax bracket, it could be better not to use a Section 351 exchange, since realizing gains in the 0% capital gains bracket resets the investor's cost basis at a higher level without incurring any additional (Federal) income tax.\nBut if there's a good reason to shift the portfolio into a different strategy, and the potential for a high tax impact from selling, then using a Section 351 exchange to transfer the portfolio into an ETF could be worth considering \u2013 assuming the portfolio meets the diversification requirements needed to receive tax-deferred treatment, and that it's comprised of assets that ETF sponsors will accept for the exchange.\nRisks And Downsides Of Section 351 Exchanges\nFailure To Receive Tax-Deferred Treatment\nAs noted earlier, there are specific rules about the assets that can be transferred into an ETF while receiving tax-deferred treatment in a Section 351 exchange. For the exchange to be tax-free, the portfolio needs to meet the 25/50 diversification test prior to the exchange, and it must consist of eligible assets \u2013 typically stocks, bonds, and/or ETFs (mutual funds and most alternative asset classes are not accepted for seeding new ETFs).\nIt's possible that a Section 351 exchange could fail if the incoming portfolio fails to meet the 25/50 diversification requirements prior to the exchange, or the 80% ownership requirement immediately following the exchange. This could occur if the investor or ETF sponsor fails to properly analyze the portfolio's holdings, or if sudden market movements unexpectedly shift asset values over the required thresholds. In either case, if the IRS deems the transfer to be a taxable transaction, the investor would recognize any embedded capital gains \u2013 which could also result in the ETF sponsor incorrectly reporting the holding period and cost basis of that investor's shares in the fund.\nThere's an additional risk that the Section 351 exchange may be misreported by the investor's custodian. If the custodian incorrectly classifies the Section 351 as a taxable sale instead of a tax-free exchange, they may issue a Form 1099 to the investor (and the IRS). While not necessarily negating the Section 351 exchange for the investor (assuming it's performed correctly), this may trigger an audit from the IRS when the custodian's records mismatch what is reported by the investor.\nHigh Fees And Tracking Error\nOutside of the risk of the Section 351 exchange failing to qualify for tax-deferred treatment, the biggest obstacle to using this strategy to seed ETFs is simply the limited number of available options for doing so at the moment. The few publicly seeded ETFs launched so far have come from comparatively smaller ETF sponsors with active investment strategies, which is concerning from a due diligence perspective as the ETFs (or any predecessor mutual funds) have little or no track record by which to evaluate the fund's manager or investment strategy.\nAdditionally, publicly seeded ETFs tend to have a higher ongoing expense ratio than traditional index-tracking ETFs. This is because the ETF sponsor pays not only the cost of setting up and running the ETF but also (in the case of publicly seeded ETFs) the cost of legal counsel, an opinion letter, and operations support to ensure that the in-kind seeding of the funds is done properly according to Section 351.\nFor example, the average index-tracking equity ETF has around a 0.15% expense ratio, while the Stance Sustainable Beta ETF and Cambria Tax Aware ETF both have a 0.49% expense ratio.\nIf the practice of offering publicly seeded ETFs proves successful for the first few sponsors, it's possible that some of the larger ETF sponsors like Vanguard and BlackRock will follow suit. This could have the dual effect of giving more potential options for investors to choose from (since now they are mostly confined to waiting until the 'right' strategy for them becomes available as a new publicly seeded ETF) as well as driving down the cost with the bigger sponsors' size and scale.\nBut for now, other than for advisory firms that are willing to shoulder the cost of launching and managing their own ETFs to be seeded by their existing clients, it would take a lot of luck to deal with the conundrum of what to do with a client's \"locked-up\" portfolio at the exact time that an ETF that's just right for that client happens to be receiving in-kind seeding transfers.\nFinally, it's worth noting that ETFs seeded in-kind via Section 351 exchanges can take time to actually reallocate their initial 'seed' holdings (which can comprise holdings contributed by many different investors) to their final target allocations. For example, as of February 12, 2025, nearly two months after its launch, Cambria's Tax Aware ETF still comprised many of the funds contributed during its seeding process, with Vanguard's Total Stock Market ETF making up over 12% of its portfolio, and Nvidia accounting for more than 5%.\nThe cost to investors is that it could take up to 12 months for the ETF to fully align with its intended investment strategy. It takes time to completely reallocate an ETF in a way that doesn't disproportionately affect the values of its underlying holdings (or create scrutiny from the IRS that the Section 351 exchange lacked economic substance other than to avoid taxes, which could nullify the tax-deferred treatment of the exchange). In other words, while a Section 351 exchange into an ETF can be tax-efficient, it isn't necessarily instantaneous. Investors should be aware of potential short-term tracking error as the ETF fully implements its intended investment strategy.\nEvaluating Section 351 Exchanges Compared To Other Strategies\nThere are some interesting potential tax benefits to seeding an ETF via a Section 351 exchange. Given the emergence of and attention surrounding the first generation of publicly seeded ETFs, advisors may soon find clients asking whether this strategy would make sense for them.\nIn these scenarios, it's important to evaluate a Section 351 exchange not in a vacuum but in comparison to other available options \u2013 including both doing nothing (i.e., sticking with their current portfolio as is) and reallocating to a new portfolio without using a Section 351 exchange.\nAs discussed earlier, the impact of a Section 351 exchange will vary depending on the investor's individual situation. For some, it might really be worth pursuing, while for others, there may be better options available.\nScenario 1: 'Rescuing' A Portfolio With High Embedded Gains\nThe most obvious use case where a Section 351 exchange might be worth considering is when an investor has a 'locked-up' portfolio \u2013 such as a Separately Managed Account (SMA) or direct indexing account \u2013 with high embedded gains and no losses available for tax harvesting.\nExample 1: Libby is a 45-year-old attorney. 15 years ago, she inherited a taxable brokerage account from her grandmother worth $300,000. Her financial advisor managed the account as an SMA and was very efficient in harvesting losses to offset gains in the portfolio. Today, the portfolio is worth $1 million, but as a result of all the tax-loss harvesting its cost basis is only $200,000.\nAt this point, there are few opportunities left to harvest losses, and Libby, who is in the top capital gains tax bracket of 23.8%, faces significant taxable income from both capital gains from rebalancing and dividends from the underlying holdings.\nLibby's SMA portfolio has earned an average return of 8% per year, with 6% coming from price appreciation and 2% from dividends. The portfolio has a 10% annual turnover rate (meaning that 10% of the holdings are sold each year for rebalancing or reallocation) and has a 0.25% annual management fee.\nLibby's advisor projects that, after 20 years, the portfolio will be worth $3,385,837 (after accounting for management fees and taxes on portfolio income). At that point, though, the portfolio's cost basis will have risen to $2,408,683, leaving unrealized gains of $3,385,837 \u2212 $2,408,683 = $977,154. And after accounting for the embedded capital gains, the after-tax portfolio value would be $3,385,837 \u2013 (23.8% \u00d7 $977,154) = $3,153,274, equating to a 7.0% after-tax, after-fee return.\nLibby's advisor decides to explore how to reallocate the SMA portfolio to a more tax-efficient investment strategy.\nOption 1: Move The SMA Into A Portfolio Of ETFs\nThe first option Libby's advisor considers is a portfolio of ETFs that roughly matches the 8% annual gross return of the SMA (including the 2% dividend yield). The portfolio won't generate taxable income from turnover (since the ETFs can rebalance in-kind) and has a lower average expense ratio of just 0.15%.\nHowever, to move into the new portfolio, Libby would need to liquidate her existing SMA, triggering $1,000,000 \u2212 $200,000 = $800,000 in capital gains. With a 23.8% tax rate, this would result in a 23.8% \u00d7 $800,000 = $190,400 tax bill, leaving her with only $1,000,000 \u2013 $190,400 = $809,600 to invest into the new portfolio.\nAfter 20 years, the new portfolio would be worth $3,407,726 on a pre-tax basis, with a cost basis of $1,527,930, leaving unrealized gains of $1,879,796. After taxes on those embedded gains, her portfolio's after-tax value would be $3,407,726 \u2013 (23.8% \u00d7 $1,879,796) = $2,960,335, equating to a 6.7% after-tax, after-fee return.\nIn other words, reallocating into the new \"tax-efficient\" portfolio resulted in a worse outcome, after accounting for the tax paid to reallocate into the portfolio in the first place!\nOption 2: Use A Section 351 Exchange To Transfer Into A New ETF\nInstead of reallocating into a portfolio of existing ETFs, Libby's advisor considers a new ETF that could be seeded with in-kind transfers via Section 351 exchange. Again, the portfolio's expected return before taxes and fees is 8%, which includes a 2% dividend yield, but the management fee of the publicly seeded ETF is 0.5%, higher than Libby's original portfolio management fee of 0.25%.\nBy using a Section 351 exchange to transfer her assets into the new ETF, Libby won't pay any capital gains tax when reallocating her portfolio \u2013 the gains would stay deferred until she needs to sell the ETF.\nAfter 20 years, Libby's advisor projects the portfolio would be worth $3,997,030 on a pre-tax basis, with a cost basis of $1,060,667, resulting in unrealized gains of $2,936,363. After accounting for the embedded gains, her portfolio's after-tax value is $3,997,030 \u2013 (23.8% \u00d7 $2,936,363) = $3,298,176, equating to an after-tax after-fee return of 7.3%.\nIn other words, using the Section 351 exchange is expected to have the highest after-tax return (7.3%), while simply doing nothing would have the second-highest (7.0%) and reallocating to the ETF portfolio without the Section 351 exchange would have the lowest return in this scenario (6.7%).\nAs the example above shows, a Section 351 exchange can add after-tax value over other alternatives in some scenarios. However, the relative benefit depends on the investor's tax situation. The lower the potential tax impact of reallocating into a new portfolio through selling outright, the less of a relative advantage of using a Section 351 exchange. If the embedded gains in the example above hadn't been so high, or if Libby had been in the 15% capital gains tax bracket instead of the 23.8% bracket, the relative advantage of the Section 351 exchange would have been much smaller.\nAdditionally, if Libby has charitable goals, she might benefit more from donating her most highly appreciated securities to charity, a donor-advised fund, or a charitable remainder trust. These strategies could give her a tax deduction for the charitable contribution, along with avoiding the recognition of gains on the portfolio.\nScenario 2: \"De-Risking\" A Concentrated Portfolio\nAs mentioned earlier, a portfolio isn't eligible for tax-deferred treatment in a Section 351 exchange if any single holding constitutes more than 25% of the portfolio, or if the top five holdings make up more than 50%. This means that, for example, a single large stock holding can't be moved to an ETF and diversified without recognizing any gain on the sale.\nHowever, investors may still be able to partially diversify a concentrated position, if they have other assets to contribute to the ETF that meet the 25/50 diversification rule.\nExample 2: Yuni bought $15,000 of Apple stock in 2008 for $3.50 per share. Today her Apple shares are worth $1 million, with the same cost basis of $15,000. In addition to the Apple stock, Yuni owns $1 million in an S&P 500 index ETF, meaning her portfolio currently consists of 50% Apple stock and 50% of the S&P 500 ETF.\nYuni cannot transfer her Apple stock into an ETF via a Section 351 exchange, nor can she transfer her entire combined portfolio (including the S&P 500 ETF), since that would violate the 25/50 diversification rule.\nHowever, she could transfer a portion of her Apple stock, along with enough of the S&P 500 ETF to meet the diversification requirements (since, as noted earlier, ETFs are viewed on a \"look-through\" basis for Section 351 exchanges, meaning that their underlying holdings are used to determine whether they meet the 25/50 diversification tests).\nTo satisfy the 25/50 diversification test, Yuni transferred 33% ($333,333) of her Apple stock, plus all $1 million of her S&P 500 ETF into a new ETF. This way, her Apple stock makes up $333,333 \u00f7 $1,333,333 = 25% of the new portfolio (ignoring for this example the likelihood that the S&P 500 ETF would also contain Apple stock, which would lower the amount of individual Apple shares she could contribute).\nAfter the exchange, Yuni still holds $666,667 of Apple stock outside the newly created ETF, which consists of $333,333 (25%) in Apple stock and $1 million (75%) in a diversified mix of stocks from the S&P 500 ETF.\nIf the new ETF that was seeded via the Section 351 exchange became an S&P 500 ETF itself, then Yuni's overall portfolio would consist of $666,667 (33%) of directly held Apple stock outside the ETF, and $1,333,333 (67%) of S&P 500 stocks inside the newly seeded ETF.\nThough she hasn't fully diversified her Apple concentration, she has taken a bite out of it (no pun intended).\nBut the key thing to note here is that a Section 351 exchange can go some way toward diversifying out of a concentrated position, even if it can't diversify the entire thing.\nSection 351 exchanges present a new opportunity for advisors to help clients reallocate or de-risk their portfolios in a tax-efficient way, particularly when those portfolios are 'locked up' due to high embedded gains and little or no losses to harvest.\nThat said, the tax benefits of Section 351 exchanges can only be realized if they're done correctly. This means that the transferred portfolio must meet the 25/50 diversification rules; the portfolio assets can generally only include stocks, bonds, and other ETFs; and the exchange can only be made to a newly created ETF that will accept in-kind 'seeding' contributions.\nAdditionally, since Section 351 exchanges primarily serve to reduce the tax friction when reallocating to a more suitable portfolio, it's crucial to evaluate whether the ETF being used for the exchange is actually a good investment. Key questions advisors can consider:\n- Who will be managing the ETF?\n- What is the ETF's investment objective?\n- If the ETF is actively managed, what is the investment thesis?\n- Does the ETF sponsor have any history of seeding funds via Section 351 exchange?\n- What are the fund's costs and expense ratio?\nAll of these are questions advisors can ask to help ensure the potential benefits of a Sectio n351 exchange (tax-deferred reallocation and ongoing tax efficiency of the ETF structure) outweigh the risks and costs (higher expenses, tracking error while reallocating the ETF to its investment objective, and the possibility of taxable income and/or IRS examination if the ETF sponsor doesn't manage the Section 351 exchange properly).\nFinally, it's important to consider other strategies that might be available, including charitable donations, donor-advised funds, or charitable remainder trusts for individuals who plan to donate some or all of the portfolio to charity.\nBut for those who plan to use funds from their portfolio (or simply want to maximize what they leave to their heirs), a Section 351 exchange can be a powerful tool \u2013 particularly for investors who are in need of reallocating their portfolio and who would otherwise pay significant taxes when transitioning their portfolio. At which point advisors can help their clients explore the options for ETFs that are (or will soon be) open to in-kind seeding, or consider launching their own ETFs to give clients their own customized option for 'rescuing' their locked-up portfolios!"

History shows that the stock market is remarkably resilient, and offers handsome returns to those who take a long view.\n\"Investor uncertainty escalated amid the initial developments of tariffs,\" said Wes Crill, senior client solutions director and vice president at Dimensional Fund Advisors.\n\"[E]ven while the news headlines may be concerning, investors have good reasons to stay invested,\" Crill said. \"Prices are always set to provide positive expected returns.\"\nStill, there are also some tactical moves investors can take in this environment if they don't want to just sit tight and stay the course, market strategists say.\n\"Tariffs have made this investing environment very tricky,\" said Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management.\n\"[But] there are lots of opportunities if you're willing to look for them.\"\nS&P 500 up 12% since Trump's 'Liberation Day'\nTrump has announced and rescinded a flurry of actions around tariff policy since his so-called \"Liberation Day\" on April 2.\nThe U.S. effective tariff rate is estimated to rise to about 17% \u2014 from 2.3% last year \u2014 after tariffs Trump proposed last week on a swath of countries, Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote in an Aug. 1 research note.\nPatience often trumps panic.Douglas Boneparthcertified financial planner\nThose so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" come on top of others, like duties placed on automobiles, steel, aluminum and copper, for example. A 17% effective rate would be the highest since the 1930s, Brown wrote.\nBut the stock market is still chugging along. Between the start of April and early August, the S&P 500 rose over 12%, according to Morningstar Direct. As reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Thursday, the market was little changed by midday.\nThat uptick \"reinforces a timeless investing principle,\" said certified financial planner Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York.\n\"Patience often trumps panic,\" said Boneparth, a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council.\nETFs can help target investing amid tariffs\nFor investors who want to try to allocate their money in a strategic way amid the era of tariffs, exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, may be one place to look, said Andrew Hiesinger, founder and CEO of Quant Data, a market information platform.\n\"ETFs let investors adjust exposure to entire sectors, regions or supply chains in a single trade,\" Hiesinger said.\n\"When tariffs disrupt global markets, this flexibility can help smooth out risk compared to holding individual stocks that may be directly impacted by a single policy change,\" he added.\nMany of the best-performing ETFs since early April have been focused on cryptocurrencies, an analysis by Morningstar Direct found.\n\"Cryptocurrency ETFs have gained momentum because digital assets are not directly impacted by tariffs on physical goods,\" Hiesinger said.\n\"Broader trade uncertainty can also drive investors toward crypto as a perceived hedge against geopolitical and currency risks.\"\nMeanwhile, nuclear energy ETFs have benefited from a growing demand for stable power sources and policy support, Hiesinger said.\n\"Tariffs on other energy inputs or technology components can indirectly make nuclear power more attractive,\" he added.\nThere is no single rule for how much of their portfolio investors should allocate to ETFs, Hiesinger said.\n\"The key is ensuring the position fits within their overall risk tolerance and broader portfolio strategy, rather than a fixed percentage or amount they can afford to lose,\" he said.\nTech and financial sectors stand to benefit\nAmong the challenges for investors is the whipsawing nature of the Trump administration's tariff policy, experts said.\nBut tactical traders looking to pinpoint investment opportunities over a time frame of weeks or months \u2014 compared to the multiyear or multidecade time frames of long-term investors \u2014 \"shine\" in such a fast-moving, volatile environment, Ritholtz Wealth Management's Cox said.\nTechnology, consumer discretionary, materials and industrials are among the investment sectors broadly poised for a negative tariff impact, Cox said. The consumer discretionary spending category encompasses retailers that sell good and services such as appliances, toys, electronics and apparel \u2014 many of which are manufactured overseas.\nMeanwhile, the industrials sector includes transportation and logistics firms such as UPS, FedEx and other shippers that will need to adjust to a new reality of lower import volumes, Cox said.\nOn the other hand, the Trump administration has exempted many consumer tech products like smart phones and computers from tariffs. That somewhat insulates the tech sector from tariff impact, said Jacob Manoukian, U.S. head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\nCox and Manoukian view sectors like utilities and financials as being less exposed to tariffs, as well. These include more services-oriented businesses, which are less focused on physical goods, and are more U.S.-based, Cox said.\n\"You're not importing bankers from Europe,\" Cox said.\nBeyond tariffs\nUltimately, tariffs will have at least some financial impact on \"almost everything\" because of the interconnected nature of global supply chains, Manoukian said.\nBut investors should consider their impact alongside other Trump administration policies, Manoukian said.\nFor example, a recently passed tax and spending package tweaked rules around bonus depreciation and expenses for research and development; changes that are likely to prove financially beneficial for many companies, Manoukian said."

      "text": "A major exchange-traded fund provider is getting ready to launch a fund designed to ease investors' tax burdens from a record-setting stock market.\nEven though ETFs are considered more tax efficient than mutual funds, Astoria Portfolio Advisors plans to launch the Astoria U.S. Enhanced Core Equity ETF (LCOR) in October. The fund uses a tax-mitigation strategy that's known as an exchange or conversion under Section 351 of the tax code.\nWhen a stock has a huge run-up, investors may end up overconcentrated in that name, putting them on the hook for large capital gains taxes if they try to sell down the position. With a Section 351 exchange, investors may be able to reallocate some of that position without triggering capital gains taxes. They transfer those assets to a newly created ETF and receive shares of that fund in exchange.\nBruce Lavine, the firm's chief operating officer and head of ETFs, thinks LCOR is particularly relevant as Big Tech's outperformance can leave investors with a pretty hefty tax bill if they take profits.\n\"The idea behind a 351 fund is that you have a lot of stocks that get stuck from a tax perspective because they're up so much.

      "text": "Despite a strong year for the stock market, you could still be sitting on portfolio losses. But you can leverage down assets to score a tax break, experts say.\nThe tactic, known as \"tax-loss harvesting,\" involves selling losing brokerage account assets to claim a loss. When you file your taxes, you can use those losses to offset portfolio gains. Once your investment losses exceed profits, you can use the excess to reduce regular income by up to $3,000 per year.\n\"Tax-loss harvesting is a tried and true strategy to lower investors' tax bills,\" said certified financial planner David Flores Wilson, managing partner at Sincerus Advisory in New York.\nAfter offsetting $3,000 in regular income, investors can carry any additional losses forward into future years to offset capital gains or income.\n\"Investors can benefit substantially over time\" by tax-loss harvesting consistently throughout the year, Wilson said.\nWhat to know about the wash sale rule\nTax-loss harvesting can be simple when you're eager to offload a losing asset. But it's tricky when you still want exposure to that asset.\nThat's because of guidelines from the IRS known as the \"wash sale rule,\" which blocks you from claiming the tax break on losses if you rebuy a \"substantially identical\" asset within the 30-day window before or after the sale.\nIn other words, you can't sell a losing asset to claim a loss and then immediately repurchase the same investment.\nHow exchange-traded funds can help\nWhile the wash sale rule is a challenge, exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, can help investors avoid trouble with the IRS, experts say.\n\"The beauty of using ETFs for doing tax-loss harvesting ... is that there are so many similar, but not identical, ETFs that could be exchanged for a losing one,\" said George Gagliardi, a CFP and founder of Coromandel Wealth Strategies in Lexington, Massachusetts.\nFor example, many ETFs in the same sector, such as large-cap value, emerging market or small-cap growth, use the same pool of stocks with different selection criteria, he said.\nBut ETFs with identical indexes, like the S&P 500, \"will run afoul of the wash sale rule\" and the loss won't be allowed, Gagliardi said.\nUltimately, the IRS definition of \"substantially identical\" isn't black and white and \"depends on the facts and circumstances\" of your case, according to the agency.\nWhen in doubt, consider reviewing your plan with an advisor or tax professional to make sure you're safe from violating the wash sale rule."

Exchange\u2011traded funds (ETFs) can help avoid wash\u2011sale pitfalls by offering similar but not identical alternatives, allowing investors to maintain sector exposure while claiming losses.",
