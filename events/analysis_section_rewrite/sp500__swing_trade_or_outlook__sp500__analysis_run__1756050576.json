      "feedback": "This draft fails the SECTION FOCUS in several concrete ways: it peppers Ford with non-Ford topics (Disney, Shopify, Beasley, etc.), bursts beyond the required 4 Movers lines (2 Up, 2 Down), and muddles the horizon into too many buckets. To lift to world-class level, trim to Ford-only, four Movers lines (2 Up, 2 Down) with strictly: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, plus a single Swing Trade line if Ford is tradable (otherwise an Outlook line). Build a tight first-principles causal chain: (a) sector structure (capital intensity, fixed costs) → (b) EV transition and capex cadence → (c) margins and cash flow (Q2 EV loss ≈ $1.3B; capex up to $50B through 2026 with deferrals) → (d) policy/tariff regime as a reprice/exit risk, to drive regime states A–D with explicit triggers and invalidations. Quantify lines with底line numbers anchored to the sources (e.g., 22PL3Q360; 65UUBU0OR; W2622L6WW) and only cite when asserting facts; ensure each probability is evidence-based (e.g., 25–35% for upside in a regime-up path tied to an EV-margin inflection; 25–35% for a downside path tied to tariff/policy shocks). Remove all non-Ford scenario blocks and ensure the 4 lines deliver a concise narrative on regime-driven price path, with clear triggers (e.g., Q3 EV-margin inflection, capex deceleration, tariff relief or persistence) and unambiguous invalidations (e.g., sustained EV losses or policy shocks that maintain margin pressure). For the Swing Trade, if Ford is tradable, supply 1–2 lines: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability | Confidence, anchored to the same EV/margin/capex milestones and policy signals; ensure entry/stop levels are realistic from price data and the trigger is concrete (e.g., “Q3 EV margin turns positive,” or “capex cadence decelerates meaningfully”). Finally, ensure the output is coherent, non-redundant, and tightly sourced, with a single, consistent Ford-focused narrative and no trailing citation lists.",
