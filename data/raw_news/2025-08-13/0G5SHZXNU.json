  "description": "You can get a like-new Kindle Paperwhite at an unbeatable price on Amazon right now.",
  "content": "If you've been thinking about getting a new Kindle e-reader or waiting for the right moment to buy your first one, this deal for the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition might finally be what you've been waiting for.\n\nCurrently on Amazon, you can get a like-new Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition for $127, saving you $53 off its regular price of $180, which brings it back to its best price ever.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a refurbished model. However, Amazon describes its condition as \"Like-new,\" meaning it has been barely used and has gone through Amazon's refurbishment process, which includes testing and certification to ensure the device looks and works like new.\n\nBuying a refurbished device is a great way to save money, especially when it's in nearly new condition. It even comes with the same limited warranty as a brand-new Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, so you're not missing out on warranty coverage. If you're a student heading back to school soon and need a reliable reading device, this is a perfect chance to get a Kindle at an unbeatable price. You can check out this deal for the like-new Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition below.\u200b\u200b\n\nIt has an auto-adjusting front light and supports wireless charging\n\nCompared to the standard base Kindle model, which starts at $110 new, the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition offers several notable upgrades. Specifically, it features a larger 7-inch glare-free display and a significantly bigger battery, providing up to 12 weeks of use compared to the 6 weeks offered by the basic Kindle.\n\nIn terms of storage, the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition has 32GB, double the 16GB capacity of the standard Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite. Compared to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, the Signature Edition includes improvements such as an auto-adjusting front-light sensor that automatically changes screen brightness based on surrounding lighting conditions, and support for wireless charging, making recharging more convenient. It also has an IPX8 waterproof rating, allowing you to use it near the pool or at the beach without concern about it getting wet.\n\nIf you're a student who needs to do a lot of reading this school year, the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition could make that easier, thanks to its paper-like E Ink display (which is gentler on your eyes than a regular tablet screen) and distraction-free operating system. This limited-time deal on a like-new Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is currently available on Amazon.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Back to school is fast approaching, with lots of students returning to class this August or early September.\n- You can snag some great back-to-school tech deals, like a MacBook Air or a Google Pixel 9a.\n- A Kindle Scribe is the ultimate note-taking companion, while a pair of Beats Studio Pro headphones can help you jam out while studying.\nIt's officially mid-August, which means the start of school is once again right around the corner. Whether you're heading to campus for the first time or preparing to head back, there are a lot of different gadgets out there that can make your experience of heading back to class easier and less stressful.\nWhether you're searching for a dependable laptop to handle your work, headphones for listening to music, or a tablet for taking notes, here are six back-to-school gadgets worth considering. Even if you graduated long ago, these are still worth checking out, especially since some are on sale. When I was in college, even adding one useful tech gadget to my backpack often changed how I studied and helped me succeed.\n1 MacBook Air (M4)\nA reliable and powerful laptop\nMacBook Air (M4)\n- Operating System\n- macOS\n- CPU\n- M4 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU\n- RAM\n- 16GB, 24GB, 32GB\nApple's M4-powered MacBook Air features the tech giant's latest chip, a new 12-megapixel Center Stage camera, and a lower starting price.\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB\nI wouldn't have gotten through my college years without my MacBook, and if you're looking for a laptop that can survive all the years you have left studying, look no further than Apple's 13-inch M4 MacBook Air. It's currently on sale for $800, saving you $200 off its regular price of $1,000. This is Apple's latest MacBook Air, featuring 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and its powerful M4 chipset. What I especially love about the MacBook Air is its portability, thanks to its thin and lightweight design, which makes it easy to slide into your backpack and pull out during class.\n2 SanDisk 1TB Portable SSD\nStore large files and back up important ones\nSanDisk 1TB Extreme Portable External SSD\n- Storage Capacity\n- 1TB\n- Brand\n- SanDisk\nEqually important as a laptop for school is portable storage. If you're a media major that requires editing videos or handling large files, a portable SSD will make your life easier. Even if you're not in a media-oriented program, having a portable SSD to back up all your files and important school documents will provide added peace of mind. When I was in college, I did exactly that, and it saved me quite a few headaches and missed deadlines. That said, SanDisk's 1TB Extreme Portable SSD is perfect for this purpose. Not only does it offer 1TB of ample storage, but it also features a durable design, so if you accidentally knock it off your desk, you don't have to worry about it breaking. It's on sale currently for $100, saving you $30 off its regular price of $130.\n3 Beats Studio Pro\nJam out to your favorite tunes while studying\nBeats Studio Pro\n- Brand\n- Beats\n- Battery Life\n- Up to 40 hours\n- Bluetooth\n- Bluetooth 5.3\n- Noise Cancellation\n- ANC, Transparency modes\n- Microphones\n- Six with ANC on, three with ANC off\nThe Studio Pro succeed the popular Studio Wireless 3, bringing a number of improvements, including USB-C Audio and Spatial Audio with Dynamic Head Tracking, as well as a refined design and up to 40 hours battery life.\n- Colors\n- Black, Navy, Sandstone, Deep Brown\nI wouldn't have made it through college without Spotify and podcasts, and there's nothing like a good pair of headphones to complement that experience. Currently, the Beats Studio Pro is on sale for $180, saving you $170 off its regular price of $350. What I like about these headphones is that they are compatible with both Android and iOS, and offer up to 40 hours of battery life, which is more than enough for extended studying sessions without needing to recharge them. They also feature noise-cancelling and transparency modes, allowing them to adapt to your specific needs depending on the setting you're in. Additionally, it offers lossless audio via USB-C, enabling you to achieve the best possible sound quality.\n4 Google Pixel 9a\nThe best value mid-range smartphone\nGoogle Pixel 9a\n- Brand\n- Colors\n- Iris, peony, porcelain, obsidian\n- SoC\n- Tensor G4, Titan M2\nGoogle's mid-range Pixel 9a offers impressive high-end features like a 48-megapixel main shooter, a 13-megapixel ultrawide camera with macro, its Tensor G4 chip, and 8GB of RAM, all in a cost-effective $500 package.\n- Display\n- 6.3-inch 1080 x 2424 pixel resolution pOLED, (422.2ppi), 60-120Hz variable refresh rate, 1,800 nits (HDR), 2,700 nits (peak brightness)\nIf you're in need of a new smartphone for back to school and don't want to break the bank, then the Pixel 9a is worth considering. It's the latest mid-range handset from Google, and features a beautiful 6.3-inch OLED display, 128GB of storage, Google's Tensor G4 chipset, two rear cameras, and a massive 5,100mAh battery. It's way better than the $600 iPhone 16E, and is currently on sale for $400. You can't argue with its value.\n5 Kindle Scribe\nTake your notes to the next level\nAmazon Kindle Scribe (2024)\n- Brand\n- Amazon\n- Resolution\n- 300ppi\n- Storage\n- 16GB, 32GB, 64GB\n- Screen Size\n- 10.2-inch glare-free\n- Connections\n- USB-C\n- Weight\n- 15.3oz (433g)\nThere's a good chance that when you go back to campus this fall, you'll be taking plenty of notes in class. One of the best devices to make that easier is the Kindle Scribe. Like Amazon's regular Kindle devices, it has an E Ink display, but what makes the Scribe unique is that it's specifically designed for note-taking. It features a 10.2-inch display, 64GB of storage, and comes with a stylus for jotting down notes. Its display feels paper-like, so even though it's a tablet, it gives the impression you're writing on paper. It also avoids the distractions of your smartphone or tablet, so you can focus on what you're writing. You can also load documents onto it, like textbooks, to read and mark up. The Kindle Scribe is available on Amazon for $450.\n6 Apple iPad\nA budget-friendly tablet\nApple iPad 11\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- Storage\n- 128GB, 256GB, 512GB\n- Weight\n- 1.05 pounds (477 grams)\n- CPU\n- A16 chip\nIf a Kindle Scribe isn't the type of tablet you're looking for, when I was in college, my iPad was my sidekick. It was a handy second display for my Mac, and at night, I used it to unwind by watching YouTube videos, TV shows, and movies. The bigger screen is typically better than your phone for watching content on, and it's still just as portable and lightweight. Currently, you can snag Apple's iPad for $300, saving you $50 off its regular price of $350. What I like about this particular model is that it's affordable, features an 11-inch screen, comes with 128GB of storage, and is powered by Apple's A16 chipset. While it may not be as fancy or powerful as the iPad Air or iPad Pro, for $300, it offers a lot of value, and for basic tasks, it gets the job done."

      "text": "Summary\n- Amazon's latest Kindle update offers new spacing options for paragraphs, words, and characters, enhancing readability on the device.\n- To access the new spacing options, update your Kindle to software version 5.18.3 or higher, then navigate to Font settings and choose Spacing.\n- Before this update, Amazon only had three line spacing options available. Now there are plenty.\nI bought my very first Kindle e-reader about five months ago, and so far, I've loved using it for reading. It's much less distracting than my iPad or phone, and since the Kindle store has a huge selection of books, I can easily find whatever I'm looking for. Additionally, as a Prime member, Amazon offers a free book each month through its First Reads program, which is a nice bonus.\nOf course, one of the highlight features of Amazon's Kindle series is its E Ink displays, which give the screen a paper-like look. This makes reading not only easier on your eyes, but the display is also much more visible in the daylight, allowing you to enjoy reading outside just as you would with a regular book. On an iPad, that isn't always easy, especially on bright summer days.\nAdditionally, I appreciate the many customization options available on my Kindle. You can choose between different themes, fonts, layout styles, and more to tailor your reading experience and make it more enjoyable for you.\nWith that in mind, recently, Amazon released an update for the Kindle that went largely unnoticed. The update, version 5.18.3, was made available for 11th and 12th generation Kindles, as well as the Kindle Colorsoft and Kindle Scribe, earlier this summer. In the update notes, Amazon only stated that it updated the Kindle with \"Performance improvements, bug fixes, and other general enhancements,\" omitting the fact that it also added some fantastic new spacing options that make reading on the device significantly easier. Here's how I've taken advantage of this new hidden setting, and how it can benefit you as well.\nAmazon Kindle (2024)\n- Storage\n- 16GB\n- Screen Size\n- 6-inch E Ink (300ppi)\n- Connections\n- USB-C\n- Battery\n- Up to 6 weeks\nAmazon's base-level Kindle ships with 16GB of storage, a 6-inch E Ink display, and a ruggedized exterior shell that can withstand the elements.\n- Size\n- 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32-inches\n- Weight\n- 5.56oz (157g)\nHow to use your Kindle's new spacing options\nYou'll find them under the Spacing tab in Font options\nBefore I explain how to use these new Kindle spacing settings, make sure your Kindle is updated and has this feature. It was added with the 5.18.3 software update in June, but the latest version is 5.18.4, released in July. To determine which version your Kindle is running, navigate to Settings > Device Options > Software Updates. When you select this, it will display your current version and update it if necessary. As long as it says 5.18.3 or higher, you're all set.\nThat said, prior to this new Kindle software update, there were only three line spacing options on the Kindle. Now, there is a plethora of options, and you can customize not only line spacing but also paragraph spacing, word spacing, and character spacing to various levels (as shown in the image above). So, if you prefer your words to be closer together or further apart, you can adjust that, and also fine-tune the character spacing to exactly how you like it.\nTo check out these new spacing options, follow these steps:\n1. Open a book on your Kindle.\n2. Tap the top of the screen to reveal the toolbar.\n3. In the toolbar, select the \"Aa\" option.\n4. Select Fonts from the options that appear.\n5. Then choose Spacing.\n6. You'll now see all the different spacing options available for you to choose from, including: Line spacing, Paragraph spacing, Word spacing, and Character spacing.\nEach space option has five different settings. The default, which is none, and then four levels to choose from. The higher the number, the more spaced out the option you've selected will be, with larger gaps. I recommend trying each setting until you find the one that works best for you. Luckily, you can preview how it looks in your book above the settings.\n...with the new Kindle spacing options, reading without my glasses is much easier...\nI've been using these new settings for about a month now, and they've had a really positive impact on my reading experience. I initially started wearing glasses for distance, but over time, my near vision also got worse, so now I struggle to see my tablet or iPhone up close without my glasses. Luckily, with the new Kindle spacing options, reading without my glasses is much easier, which is nice when I'm in bed and accidentally fall asleep while reading, something that happens quite often. Besides changing the spacing options on my Kindle, I've also slightly adjusted the font size, making the text larger, which helps a lot as well. If you've been struggling to read with the default spacing options on your Kindle, it's definitely worth giving these new settings a shot.\nIf you're looking for more Kindle insights, Pocket-lint recently covered the new Kindle Colorsoft and how many books you can actually store on your Kindle. Also, if you're an Amazon Prime member, remember to claim your free Kindle e-books for the month through Amazon First Reads."

I have been debating about upgrading my 7th gen kindle for a while and I think that the signature paper white is the way to go! I love that there are no adds. Also there is so much storage which I really appreciate as someone who owns a lot of kindle books. Also the pink is so pretty!\nColor: Metallic RaspberryOption: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase\nMy Paperwhite that I received was pretty indistinguishable from brand new. No scratches or damage. I\u2019ve had it for almost 3 weeks and I use it every day. I love the big screen and the auto-adjust for brightness is pretty spot-on. The warmth adjustment is nice for reading at night which is one of the reasons why I got the Paperwhite. It could easily go a month without charging. I think going refurbished was a great way to save money but still get a nice Kindle. I held off on getting an ereader for a long time but I\u2019ve been reading some longer books recently and this is way more comfortable to hold for long periods.\nColor: Metallic RaspberryOption: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase\nIt came in perfect condition.

It\u2019s easy to read on and more convenient than carrying a book everywhere.\nColor: Metallic BlackOption: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase\nThe media could not be loaded.\nI love my used like new kindle but I Wish I could have used my free kindle unlimited subscription when it came in.

Still lovely and light not too big and battery life amazing compared to my old paperwhite\nColor: Metallic BlackOption: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase\nDer Kindl ist wie neu, keinerlei Gebrauchsspuren oder sonstiges. Der erste Eindruck ist sehr gut. Sehr angenehme Beleuchtung, scharfer Bildschirm, lange Akkulaufzeit.\nColor: Metallic BlackOption: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase\nBisher 5 von 5 Sternen. Absolute Kaufempfehlung. Es ist wie neu angeliefert worden auch in Originalverpackung. Das Pad ist in einem super Zustand und hat keinerlei Kratzer oder Gebrauchsspuren. Es funktioniert super und hatte bereits so viel Akku, dass ich es bisher noch nicht laden musste.\nColor: Metallic BlackOption: Without Kindle UnlimitedVerified Purchase\nIch hatte vorher einen 5 Jahre alten 6\" Kindle. Dieser hier ist refurbished, ich sehe aber keinen Unterschied zu einem Neuger\u00e4t, au\u00dfer das die Verpackung anders ist. die fliegt aber eh in den M\u00fcll, das ist also v\u00f6llig egal. Daf\u00fcr spart man eine Menge Geld. So, nun zum Kindle selbst. Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, der ist noch nen Zacken sch\u00e4rfer als mein alter. Und schneller ist er. Deutlich schneller, besonders wenn ich neue B\u00fccher ausw\u00e4hle. Im shop war der alte schon recht z\u00e4h. Bis hierhin also locker 5 Sterne. Was jetzt zum Abzug f\u00fchrt, ist das merkbar h\u00f6here Gewicht. Es sind lt. Datenblatt nur 30Gramm, aber da der Schwerpunkt weiter oben liegt, merke ich das deutlich. Vielleicht gew\u00f6hne ich mich daran, aber f\u00fcr Viel-Leser wie mich kann das ein Faktor sein."

      "text": "Summary\n- Turn on Clock While Reading for accountability during late-night reading binges.\n- Disable Popular Highlights to avoid distractions and maintain focus on the story.\n- Turn on Page Turn Animation for a different reading experience with a swiping animation.\nI'm sure that throughout history -- way more than once -- bookworms wished they could carry an entire library in their pockets. I don't think my collection of Jane Austen, romantasy, and dystopian fiction books is the particular library that the readers of old might've imagined, but my library of 403 titles and counting sure feels like paradise on earth (or should I say 'cloud?').\nE-readers granted this wish, with Amazon's Kindle and Barnes and Noble's NOOK leading the charge in the early 2000s. NOOKs fell off for the most part and were replaced by Boox's tablets, but it's safe to say that e-readers are here to stay. For well over a decade, I've owned a couple of different models, and recently acquired the brand-new, 12th generation Kindle Paperwhite from Amazon. It's one of my most-used, well-traveled devices, but there are a few things I have to change right off the bat to make my reading experience optimal.\nSo, here are four tips and lesser-known settings I'd change immediately on my Kindle Paperwhite if I were you.\n1 Turn on Clock While Reading\nI need some accountability\nAnyone who has ever come across a life-changing read knows the danger of the \"one more chapter\" temptation at 3AM. It's irresistable, and as long as you don't look at the clock, time is just a construct, right?\nI could get away with such binges on hot summer nights between semesters -- you could feel the lack of responsibility in the balmy air. But now, I have work in the morning, so that cliffhanger is just going to have to wait. The best way to remind yourself that with great discipline comes the money to pay rent is with the clock on your screen. Kindle's default setting is to hide it -- almost like it never wants you to sleep -- so here's how to turn it on:\n- Tap the top of your screen.\n- Select the \"Aa\" option in the menu that appears at the top.\n- Tap \"More.\"\n- Toggle on \"Show Clock While Reading.\"\n2 Turn off Popular Highlights\nMy eyes can't help themselves\nI'll spoil the twist at the end of the chapter simply by glancing at the bottom of the page before I've gotten there -- I physically have to cover the bottom with my hand, so I don't do it accidentally. So, if I'm so easily tempted by words at the bottom of the page, what do you think happens when I see physically underlined portions of text? My eyes immediately jump to eat up what is often an incredible sentence.\nPopular highlights are lines that are frequently highlighted or annotated by other readers. I'm not much of an annotator myself, and I really have no use for the feature in general. All the popular highlights do is pose distractions and take away my ability to notice and appreciate the powerful lines organically as they appear in the story. If you agree, here's how to disable them:\n- Tap the top of your screen.\n- Select the \"Aa\" option in the menu that appears at the top.\n- Tap \"More.\"\n- Scroll down once. The second option will be \"Popular Highlights\" -- toggle it off.\n3 Turn on Page Turn Animation\nWhat's wrong with a little bit of whimsy?\nI must admit, I don't inherently dislike the default animation -- it blinks one page out while blinking the other in, and I really enjoy it. However, it always feels good to switch up small things in my routine to keep things interesting. I recently tried out the other option, \"Page Turn Animation,\" and was tickled by the way it looked.\nInstead of the blinking, it's more of a swiping animation. Here's how to turn it on:\n- Tap the top of your screen.\n- Select the \"Aa\" option in the menu that appears at the top.\n- Tap \"More.\"\n- Scroll all the way to the bottom. \"Page Turn Animation\" should be the second to last option -- turn it on.\nIt isn't a race to me, and I'm not trying to burn through each chapter like it's a biology textbook reading assignment.\n4 Set up hotspot in advance\nIf you binge books as fast as I do\nThe only thing worse than finishing a book and realizing you have to wait a year or two for the next to come out is the agonizing days or hours after you finish a book on an e-reader and want to dive into the next only to realize that A) you never downloaded the next one and B) there isn't Wi-Fi to connect to. I've found myself in many such predicaments since e-readers were a thing, and I've finally found a solution: connecting to my personal hotspot -- but the thing is, you should really do this ahead of time.\nTo find Wi-Fi settings, go to the main home page and click the three-dot menu option in the top-right corner. From the dropdown, select Settings, and then tap Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Choose the second option, Wi-Fi networks, and find your hotspot to enter the password and connect.\nMake sure that your phone's hotspot is set to \"Discoverable.\" If you still don't see it, scroll down on your Kindle and tap \"Rescan.\"\n5 Get rid of Reading Progress\nWhat's the hurry?\nNow this is a setting that's always ground my gears. Reading is a pleasurable experience to escape the nature of reality, not something to \"get through.\" A book is the epitome of the journey being the point rather than the destination. I've also never understood the people who refuse to read a book because it's too long -- I'd read 10,000 more pages of Sarah J Maas' Throne of Glass series if I ever had the chance.\nIt isn't a race to me, and I'm not trying to burn through each chapter like it's a biology textbook reading assignment. Now that would've been a great feature for homework. But my romantasy novel isn't a reading comprehension exam, so here's how to disable it:\n- Tap the top of your screen.\n- Select the \"Aa\" option in the menu that appears at the top.\n- Tap \"More.\"\n- Select the very first option: Reading Progress.\n- It will give you five options: Page in Book, Time left in book, Time left in chapter, Location in book, or None. I chose None."
