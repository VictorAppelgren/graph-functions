  "content": "reveled in her ability to convince Jason Kelce\u2019s young daughters that cats are, in fact, not \"poisonous.\"\n\nDuring her appearance on the \"New Heights\" podcast, tight end Travis Kelce asked Swift how she felt about Jason telling his daughters that cats are poisonous, likely in an effort to dissuade them from asking for one.\n\n\"It was actually really a great challenge, because as soon as I got the kids around the cats, it was my goal to prove to them that they weren\u2019t poisonous. And there\u2019s no better way to prove that than to just hand them Benjamin, my rag doll cat, who lets humans hold him like he\u2019s a baby,\" Swift said confidently.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON\n\nMy favorite thing ever is when Benny (Jason\u2019s 2-year-old) will come up to me and just go, \u2018I find Benjamin. I find him,' And she\u2019s just like over there, just laying with him and petting him and holding him.\"\n\nSwift added that the girls get excited to be around her three cats, which she named Meredith Grey, Olivia Benson and Benjamin Button.\n\n\"I\u2019m like, \u2018Yup, and you know what? [Meredith] didn\u2019t bite you at all, did she? And if she did bite you, she wouldn\u2019t be poisonous.\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018That\u2019s not what our dad said.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Well.\u2019\"\n\nJASON KELCE DEFENDS HIMSELF AFTER DEBUTING NEW LOOK IN PODCAST FEATURING TAYLOR SWIFT: 'DON'T HATE ME'\n\nThe international pop star, who joined the podcast Wednesday for the first time since her began in 2023, also revealed that Jason\u2019s family may be getting a cat of their own after becoming friendly with hers.\n\n\"You\u2019re getting a proper cat. You\u2019re getting a cat that chases mice,\" she said. \"What I have are not that. They sit around, and that\u2019s enough.\"\n\nJason didn\u2019t deny the speculation, adding that a \"barn cat\" wasn\u2019t entirely out of the question.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJason and Kylie Kelce welcomed another member of the family earlier this year when they announced the birth of their fourth daughter, Finnley, in March.",
