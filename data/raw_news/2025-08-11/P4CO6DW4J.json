  "description": "Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and his agent are sued and accused of sabotaging a $240 million Hawaii real estate project.",
  "content": "Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani and his agent are being sued by a Hawaii real estate investor and a broker, alleging that both men got them terminated from a $240 million housing development on Hawaii's Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Aug. 8 and obtained by USA TODAY Sports. It says that Ohtani\u2019s agent, Nez Balelo, wanted assurances from Kevin J. Hayes Sr. \u2014 a developer who has been in business for 40 years \u2014 and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before they demanded their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, remove both from the real estate deal.\n\nOhtani is referred to in the lawsuit, in which some portions are redacted, as \"Otani.\" The developers say in the lawsuit that they spent more than a decade trying to work on the deal before signing Ohtani to an endorsement deal in 2023.\n\n\"This case is about abuse of power. Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built. Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity,\" the lawsuit says. \u201cDefendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants\u2019 misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\u201d\n\nOhtani and Balelo are accused in the lawsuit of \"tortious interference and unjust enrichment, who used their \"celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs\u2019 role in the project\" and attempted to sabotage a second business venture.\n\nOhtani is listed in a 2024 press release for the Vista at Mauna Kea Resort that says he will be the first resident on the property. \"To me, Hawaii is a beautiful blend of Pacific Ocean cultures,\" Ohtani says in the release. \"Here, I found my own paradise at Mauna Kea Resort: Two perfect beaches, two amazing golf courses, and so much more. I selected my homesite and am building my winter home here. This is a special place \u2013 a place I will soon call home.\"\n\nOhtani is in his second season with the Dodgers, after signing a 10-year, $700-million contract, helping Los Angeles win the World Series last year. He is a five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, who is hitting .284 with 42 home runs and 78 RBI for the NL West leaders in 2025.",

      "text": "Two-time American League MVP Shohei Ohtani will be the first resident for Kohala Coast project\nKOHALA COAST, Hawaii, April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Located on the scenic Kohala Coast of the island of Hawaii, Hapuna Estates is a gated community within the world-renowned Mauna Kea Resort. Offering discerning buyers unparalleled residential settings heightened by the legendary landscape, Hapuna Estates consists of 66 luxury homes over 34 acres valued at $500+ million.\nOne section of the project, \"Panorama at Mauna Kea Resort,\" will include 36 duplex condos ranging in price from $4 to $6 million. Another subdivision, \"The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort,\" will include 14 homes located on an adjacent 17 acres priced in the range of $17 to $20 million. Buyers will have the opportunity to purchase finished lots, whole homes, or they can purchase co-ownership with as little as 25% ownership of a home.\nOnly 12 of the 14 homesites are currently available within The Vista estates, as one lot is currently in escrow with a buyer and Shohei Ohtani has already selected his. \"To me, Hawaii is a beautiful blend of Pacific Ocean cultures,\" said the new star of the Los Angeles Dodgers. \"Here, I found my own paradise at Mauna Kea Resort: Two perfect beaches, two amazing golf courses, and so much more. I selected my homesite and am building my winter home here. This is a special place \u2013 a place I will soon call home.\"\nExpansive, very private, and surrounded by 360\u00b0 views of rolling rangeland and the Kohala Coast, The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort homesites are being designed by Tom Kundig and the Seattle office of Olson Kundig, a collaborative global design practice renowned for expanding the concept of built and natural landscapes and recently honored on the 2024 AD100 list. The residences range from 5,000 to 6,135 square feet of living space and are scheduled for completion by late 2025.\nBoth projects are elevated more than 500 feet above sea level, offering over 40 miles of coastline and sunset views. The Vista and Panorama are located in Hapuna Estates on the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th holes of the Arnold Palmer-designed Hapuna Golf Course and a short golf cart ride from Hapuna Beach \u2014 often ranked as Hawaii's best beach.\nMauna Kea Resort traces back more than five decades to when eco-tourism visionary Laurance S. Rockefeller and his resort management company RockResorts opened environmentally focused properties on various islands of the Caribbean and along the Kohala Coast of Hawaii Island.\nThe general partner and manager of the development is highly respected Newport Beach, California-based developer West Point Investment Corporation. West Point is led by President Kevin Hayes, Sr. and Hawaii real estate broker Tomo Matsumoto, who is the leader of project sales in the resort.\nMost recently, West Point partnered with investment firm Angelo Gordon on the conversion of 98 rooms at the Westin Hapuna Beach Hotel in the Mauna Kea Resort into The Hapuna Beach Residences (68 condominiums generating $270 million of sales and five resales that have appreciated more than 30% on average since they were originally purchased in 2021 and 2022). \"As we continue to build beautifully designed residences in Hawaii's most famous and amenity-rich resort, I know we will continue to deliver value to our homebuyers,\" noted Hayes.\nLas Vegas-based developer Kingsbarn Realty Capital is the investment co-partner with West Point on the 14-home Vista at Mauna Kea Resort. Kingsbarn is an investment and asset manager that provides structured investments to institutional and accredited investors with an array of alternative investment products.\nKingsbarn has over $2 billion of assets under management and has acquired over 280 properties throughout the United States. Kingsbarn is also a leading national real estate developer with a current pipeline of over $2 billion in projects consisting of multifamily, student housing, industrial, retail, and hospitality. \"There is high demand and little supply for luxury homes on Hawaii Island with no competition for the shared-home ownership structure,\" stated Kingsbarn CEO Jeff Pori.\nHawaii-based family office Dominis Holdings LLC is the principal investor with West Point for the 36-unit Panorama at Mauna Kea Resort, located only 200 yards away from the Vista project. Also involved in the project is Aloha Partners, which includes NYC-based Mark Dalton of Halsey Lane Holdings, Mark Laska of La Jolla, California, and Jeffrey Lenkov of Los Angeles. Aloha has also provided financial and other consulting services for the project since its inception.\nConstruction is slated to begin by mid-2024, with the first homes to be delivered in late 2025.

      "text": "This World Series is over. Dodgers beat Yankees again, put champagne on ice.\nNEW YORK \u2212 Start spreading the news, this World Series is over.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers once again cruised past the New York Yankees, 4-2, on Monday night in front of a subdued crowd at Yankee Stadium, and can finish off a four-game sweep with a victory Tuesday night.\nThe Dodgers have a 3-games-to-0 lead in the World Series, with one baseball team in postseason history who has ever overcome a 3-0 deficit.\nAnd the Yankees aren\u2019t the \u201904 Boston Red Sox.\nNot even close.\nThe Dodgers know this, and besides ordering champagne, have already tentatively scheduled a parade in downtown Los Angeles on Friday.\nThe Yankee have been outmatched in virtually every facet of the game, with Freddie Freeman looking like Reggie Jackson and Aaron Judge looking like George Costanza at the plate.\nFreeman homered once again, a two-run shot in the first inning, tying a World Series record by homering in five consecutive games, while Judge\u2019s postseason struggles continue.\nFreeman is hitting .333 (4-for-12) with three homers and seven RBI, while Judge is hitting .083 (1-for-12) with seven strikeouts.\nGame 3: Dodgers one win away from World Series championship\nJudge\u2019s struggles, according to several scouts, can be attributed to being drilled in the ribcage in Game 5 of the ALCS by a 96-mph fastball by Cleveland Guardians starter Tanner Bibee.\nJudge hasn\u2019t been the same since, going 1-for-16 with nine strikeouts, and a mere single. It\u2019s almost as if Judge is so conscious of the fastball now that he struggles to even make contact on off-speed pitches. Certainly, the hit-by-pitch has triggered bad mechanics. They haven\u2019t seen him even trying to hit the ball the opposite way to right field, showing how out of whack he is at the plate.\nReally, the Yankees entire team is out of synch, with the Dodgers barely breaking a sweat.\nThe Dodgers don\u2019t need heroics, or even a hit out of Shohei Ohtani to win this series. He wore a sling during the pregame introductions, ran gingerly with his partially dislocated left shoulder, didn\u2019t get a hit, but it hasn\u2019t mattered in the least.\nThe only real drama was whether Ohtani would even be in the lineup after suffering a subluxation in the seventh inning in Game 2, but he made it a complete non-issue, telling the Dodgers he was playing before they even boarded the flight to New York.\n\u201cHe was very adamant that he was going to play,\u2019\u2019 Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cI think there was more uncertainty in all of our minds, but in his mind from day one, from Saturday evening, he was going to play. \u2026\n\u201cNot that there was ever any doubt that he was going to post, but he's a competitor, he wasn't going to not be in there.\u2019\u2019\nYet, even if Ohtani could swing one-handed, just his presence alone, Roberts said, can play a factor.\n\u201cI think it's certainly an edge to us having him in the batter's box,\u2019\u2019 Roberts said. \u201cRegardless of what limitations a pitcher might think he might or might not have, not many guys are willing to take that chance. I'm just expecting him to control the strike zone, let the at-bats come to him, and swing and fire when the ball is in a hitting zone.\n\u201cWe're just very grateful that he's in the lineup.\u2019\u2019\nIf Ohtani needs any inspiration, he needs to look no further than Freeman.\nFreeman severely sprained his right ankle on Sept 26, an injury that doctors told him would take six weeks to fully heal. Freeman, undaunted, came in for treatment 4 \u00bd hours before each day, and has turned into the most feared hitter in the postseason.\nFreeman, who hit the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history in Game 1, hit a home run in the third inning of Game 2, didn\u2019t waste time thus night, homering on the fourth pitch he saw, drilling Clarke Schmidt\u2019s 93-mph fastball into the right-field bleachers.\n\u201cHe looks pretty close to normal,\u2019\u2019 Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy said. \u201cIt's been pretty special. You're talking about a six-week injury that he came back from in essentially four or five days.\n\u201cHe obviously wasn't himself (early in the postseason), but when you're talking about a name like Freddie Freeman in the lineup, that does a lot. Just having certain guys in the lineup does a lot because the other team doesn't ever know how a certain guy is feeling.\n\u201cFor example, you might try to have a lefty come in and face him, and he hits a grand slam.\u2019\u2019\nAh, nothing like a little shade, with Muncy referring to Freeman\u2019s slam off left-hander Nestor Cortes.\nThe Yankees\u2019 biggest advantage this series was supposed to be the starting rotation, but they\u2019ve yet to out-pitch the Dodgers in any of the three games. While Schmidt lasted just 2 \u2154 innings this night, Walker Buehler, who hasn\u2019t pitched in 12 days, pitched five shutout innings, giving up just two hits.\nThe Yankees are getting out-pitched, out-hit, out-played, out-managed, and even out-performed in pre-game ceremonies with Ice Cube easily out-singing Fat Joe in a battle of rappers.\nIt has been a complete team effort that has methodically dismantled the Yankees, bringing back memories of Roberts\u2019 team speech back in spring training at Camelback Ranch in Phoenix.\n\u201cI believe his exact words are 'you need to want to be the guy,'\u2019\u2019 Muncy said. \u201cThat's why we're all here. We all want to be in this situation. We all want to be the guy in that moment. \u2026\n\u201cThat's definitely something that sticks out to you when your manager calls you out like that in spring training saying, 'Hey, you guys all need to want to be the guy in that situation. You can't leave it up to someone else.'\n\u201cIt's proven true already how many guys have come through in big moments for us.\u2019\u2019\nNow, one more game, one more victory, one more hero, and the Dodgers can get ready to party like it\u2019s 1988.\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news \u2014 fast.
