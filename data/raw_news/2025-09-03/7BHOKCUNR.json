  "title": "OPEC Oil Output Rose In August Amid Supply Revival, Survey Shows",
  "description": "OPEC bolstered crude production last month as the group and its allies continued to revive halted supplies, according to a Bloomberg survey.",
  "content": "The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries raised output by 400,000 barrels a day \u2014 roughly the amount planned \u2014 to 28.55 million barrels a day, the survey showed. Group leader Saudi Arabia accounted for just over half of the increase.\n\nThe cartel and its partners have fast-tracked the return of shuttered production in recent months in a bid to reclaim global market share. The extra barrels have so far only put modest downward pressure on crude prices, but threaten to unleash a major surplus in the coming months, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

While the downturn offers some relief for consumers and a win for President Donald Trump, it threatens financial pain for producers including Saudi Arabia, which is grappling with a budget deficit, and America\u2019s shale industry.\n\nRiyadh boosted output by 230,000 barrels a day in August to 9.6 million barrels a day, the survey showed. While that was the biggest increase among OPEC\u2019s 12 members, it still fell short of the 9.756 million barrels a day the kingdom was permitted to pump by the alliance\u2019s agreement.\n\nThe kingdom\u2019s production has fluctuated in recent months, surging in June as it shifted barrels beyond the Persian Gulf during the Israel-Iran conflict, then retreating sharply the following month. Bloomberg\u2019s estimates for July were revised lower.\n\nThe next-biggest production increase in August came from Iraq, which boosted by 120,000 barrels a day to 4.28 million barrels a day, according to the survey. That\u2019s about 109,000 above the country\u2019s OPEC+ quota for the month, suggesting Baghdad failed to make the additional curbs it had pledged as compensation for previous over-production. The nation has long chafed against OPEC+ limits while rebuilding its shattered economy.\n\nAlongside three countries from the broader OPEC+ coalition, the eight nations agreed last month on an increase of 547,000 barrels a day for September that will complete the return of 2.2 million barrels shuttered since 2023.",

  "argos_summary": "OPEC lifted output by 400,000 barrels per day in August to 28.55\u202fmbpd, largely driven by Saudi Arabia's 230,000\u2011bpd increase. The boost has only modestly eased price pressure on Brent, which is trading near $68 a barrel after a 9% YTD decline. The IEA warns that the surge could trigger a major surplus in coming months, while Saudi faces a budget deficit and U.S. shale producers feel the pain.",
