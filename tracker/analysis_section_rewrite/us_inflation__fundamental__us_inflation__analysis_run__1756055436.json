      "feedback": "Strong multi-year framing is there, but to reach world-class quality you need a tighter, source-driven, first-principles chassis and a clear scenario architecture; concrete edits below. 1) Build a formal first-principles backbone: anchor the analysis in invariant anchors (productivity via AI gains vs labor reallocation, real rate dynamics, terms-of-trade, and policy-reaction functions) and state regime definitions (e.g., base, automation-accelerated, policy-constraint) with explicit transition conditions. 2) Make the causal chain explicit and testable: AI-driven productivity uplift affects firm margins and pricing power; labor displacement shifts unemployment and wage pressure; policy tools (UBI, retraining) alter consumption/output; inflation/real rates feed asset pricing; then map how each step transmits to equity valuations (base-case vs. alternate regimes). 3) Define regimes and triggers with concrete, source-backed thresholds: e.g., automation exposure quantified (NL5YYTLF2) as a base, Finland’s UBI outcome as a boundary condition on employment responsiveness, and a policy-shock regime triggered if unemployment or social-cohesion metrics exceed defined thresholds; articulate invalidation signals (e.g., UBI failing to cushion consumption or a sustained wage-price spiral). 4) Quantify and constrain the macro frame with cited numbers: cite NL5YYTLF2’s Brookings wrinkle (roughly 25% of US employment high automation exposure and about 36 million jobs, plus >70% of task content at risk) and Finland’s UBI result; when discussing equities, front-load Ford’s cyclicality and EV-cost headwinds (22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW), and contrast UnitedHealth and Lululemon via their fundamentals (IGP1Q4ZEJ) including UnitedHealth’s free-cash-flow yield and dividend context; integrate ROIC discipline numerically from the ROIC piece (6) and total-return logic from the “Total Return” article (4). 5) Strengthen the narrative with precise, non-generic language: replace broad claims with value-adding specifics (e.g., “automation exposure implies a structural labor reallocation path with X% of workers potentially displaced over Y years” drawn from NL5YYTLF2; “Finnish UBI trial showed limited employment effects but did not measure identity/psychological costs” from NL5YYTLF2). 6) Reconcile conflicts and cover critical sources: explicitly acknowledge the Brookings automation stat vs. Finland’s trial results, and show why identity costs could dominate in the long run; ensure the GoBankingRates tariff/inflation channel is anchored to a source ID (e.g., a gobankingrates tariff analysis) rather than inferred from retirement articles; cite IGP1Q4ZEJ for Burry’s contrarian tilt to UNH/LULU to illustrate how durable moats may survive near-term shocks. 7) Improve citation discipline: assign after every factual claim a matching source ID (NL5YYTLF2 for automation/UBI psychology, YVQU6QCY4 for retirement-cost context where relevant, IGP1Q4ZEJ for Burry, 22PL3Q360 and W2622L6WW for Ford, ROIC (6) for capital-allocation anchor, and 4 for total return logic), and avoid mixing non-core sources; ensure no critical source is omitted. 8) Expand the scenario structure: add a dedicated base-case, bear-case, and bull-case with explicit catalysts (AI-adoption pace, retraining outcomes, policy adoption intensity, tariff/inflation shocks) and a clear invalidation rule (e.g., a persistent deviation of unemployment/inflation from baseline beyond a defined band). 9) Tie to horizon/style constraints: produce a concise base-case narrative (2–3 paragraphs) plus a focused appendix of catalysts, invalidations, and key data points; keep the prose lean and avoid detours into unrelated retirement tips (unless you explicitly frame them as ancillary cross-asset consumption effects). 10) Calibrate takeaway: finish with a base-case probability ladder and a risk watchlist (watch AI-adoption pace, wage/inflation path, healthcare-cost momentum, UNH/LULU vs Ford flows) and a clear confidence rating, as mandated by SECTION FOCUS. 11) Clean up the draft’s structure and provenance: replace the generic closing with a crisp “base case, key risks, what to watch, confidence” block, and present the cited numbers in a compact table-like spine within the appendix (but without actual tables if formatting is constrained). 12) Audit length and format: compress the core causal chain into 600–900 words focused on horizon-relevant transmission, and reserve longer numerics and definitions for an appendix; ensure every assertion ties to IDs NL5YYTLF2, YVQU6QCY4, IGP1Q4ZEJ, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, ROIC (6), and Total Return (4). Overall, the piece should evolve from a descriptive weave into a disciplined, first-principles, regime-based framework with explicit catalysts, invalidations, quantitative anchors, and tightly tied sourcing to produce a world-class, multi-year macro-valuation narrative.",
