  "title": "I bought $50 worth of cheap home decor from Amazon Haul. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d buy again",
  "description": "I scoured Amazon Haul for cheap home decor finds, many of which were under $10, to see what would impress me and what would be useless junk.",
  "content": "As a home editor on a budget, I\u2019m always looking out for furniture and decor that looks more expensive than it actually is. As much as I\u2019m personally interested in scoring deals, I also love sharing these affordable home products with CNN Underscored readers. And there\u2019s no doubt that Amazon is one of the most convenient places to find hidden gems that will elevate your space.\n\nI\u2019ve had my eye on Amazon Haul \u2014 a marketplace where pretty much everything from tech gadgets to fashion finds costs less than $20 and often is unbranded \u2014 ever since it launched less than a year ago, but I was skeptical about the selection of home decor and its quality. To find out what it was really like, I spent hours scrolling through Amazon Haul and ordered $50 worth of decor. Everything I added to my cart was $10 or less, but surprisingly, only a few things proved to be useless junk. Keep reading to discover the cheap home decor finds I\u2019d actually consider purchasing again.\n\nI was most excited about these USB-C rechargeable wall sconces. I didn't feel like drilling anything into my walls, so I used the included double-sided tape \u2014 it's surprisingly strong \u2014 and stuck the lights on both sides of my bed. They have a magnetic head that makes it easy to adjust the angle (plus a remote for changing the brightness and warmth), so they could be used as a reading light or as a spotlight for artwork on the wall. The only downside is that they don't hold a charge very long. But since you can detach them from the wall, it's no big deal to plug them in as needed.\n\nAmazon Haul launched in November 2024 as a mobile-only shopping experience where everything could be purchased at ridiculously low prices, similar to Shein and Temu. Though the Amazon Haul storefront appears to be available on desktop now too, it\u2019s still in beta mode. In my experience, the search function is finicky and descriptions for many products are bare bones. You have to spend at least $25 to get free shipping, which can take up to two weeks (though all my items were delivered much faster than expected). You can even get a slight discount for spending more; I got 5% knocked off because my cart totaled $50. According to Amazon\u2019s return policy, items purchased from Amazon Haul that cost over $3 can be returned within 15 days of delivery, while anything less than $3 is considered final sale. Since some of the items I bought arrived a week earlier than expected, I noticed that the return window was still based on the original delivery date, so I ended up getting more time. (This isn\u2019t advertised anywhere, though.) Whether shopping on Amazon Haul is worth it or not depends on what you\u2019re looking for and how you set your expectations. As long as you don\u2019t expect high-quality products at dirt-cheap prices, you have a good chance of avoiding disappointment. In total, I ordered 11 items from Amazon Haul and was satisfied with the quality of seven of them. Some items only slightly missed the mark; the flower vase I ordered was too lightweight for my liking and kept tipping over, while this acrylic jar arrived chipped and required way too much assembly for a $5 product. In many cases, I think you could find similarly priced items on Amazon\u2019s regular storefront that come with the retailer\u2019s beloved two-day shipping and 30-day return window. However, it\u2019s worth mentioning that I saw quite a few items (including some of the decor finds on my list) with identical Amazon Haul and regular Amazon listings, both at the same price. I even found some brand-name items hidden among Amazon Haul\u2019s pages, so you never know what you\u2019ll come across. You\u2019ll probably have trouble finding very specific types of home decor on Amazon Haul, so it\u2019s better to have an open mind if you\u2019re determined to shop there.\n\nCNN Underscored has a team of skilled writers and editors who have many years of experience testing, researching and recommending products, and they ensure each article is carefully edited and products are properly vetted.

She bought $50 worth of home decor on Amazon Haul to see if any of it is actually worth buying.",

      "text": "Amazon is targeting retail rivals Shein, Temu and TikTok Shop with a new deeply discounted storefront that sells a wide array of products for $20 or less.\nCalled \u201cAmazon Haul,\u201d the mobile-only experience debuted Wednesday in the Amazon app and has everything from fashion accessories to home goods, plus clothes and electronics.\nHaul is Amazon\u2019s response to Chinese marketplaces, which have seen rapid growth in the United States from cost-conscious shoppers looking for cheap products, according to Neil Saunders, managing director for retail at GlobalData.\n\u201cThe value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the main Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination,\u201d he told CNN.\nAmazon said in an announcement that a \u201cmajority\u201d of the Haul items are under $10, with some even less than $1. For example, an iPhone case is on sale for $1.79, a tablecloth for $4.99 and memory foam slippers for $9.99.\nHowever, the cheap prices come with a caveat that items can take one to two weeks to be delivered. And shipping is only free for orders more than $25, with an additional $3.99 fee for orders below that threshold. Also, the store only accepts returns on items that are $3 or more.\nIn what could be seen as a slight dig to its overseas rivals, Amazon said it \u201cscreens the products sellers offer in Haul so customers can be confident they\u2019ll receive products that are safe, authentic, and compliant with applicable regulations.\u201d\nShein and Temu have been recently targeted by US regulators in a proposed investigation for selling \u201cdeadly baby and toddler products.\u201d Two leaders from the Consumer Product Safety Commission want to look into how the companies comply with safety regulations.\nAmazon said Haul was created because it hears from customers who want \u201cultra-low-priced products even if some of them take one to two weeks to arrive.\u201d\nSaunders said there will be concerns that Haul might cannibalize sales from its flagship website, but it\u2019s \u201cbetter that Amazon cannibalize its own sales than cede ground to rivals,\u201d and the storefront could prove popular with younger consumers who are avid shoppers of Amazon competitors."
