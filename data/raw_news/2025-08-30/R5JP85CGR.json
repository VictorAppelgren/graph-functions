  "description": "The FIG's decision to allow pro-war Russian gymnast Angelina Melnikova to compete at September's World Challenge Cup has ignited a firestorm. Ukraine vows to fight back.",
  "content": "Russian and Belarusian gymnasts are set to return to international competition for the first time since 2021, following a ban implemented by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) in March 2022.\n\nThe ban, which excluded athletes and officials from FIG-sanctioned events due to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, was lifted on January 1, 2024. The FIG permits their return, but only as \"individual neutral athletes\" (AIN) under strict conditions prohibiting national representation.\n\nThis August, the International Gymnastics Federation confirmed the registration of five Russian or Belarusian gymnasts as authorized neutral athletes (AIN) at the upcoming FIG World Challenge Cup in Paris. Among them was Olympic and World Champion Angelina Melnikova.\n\nTheir approval to compete in September has generated significant uproar, with many alleging Melnikova\u2019s participation, in particular, violates FIG rules. Many athletes\u2019 approvals contradict the International Gymnastics Federation\u2019s (FIG) neutrality conditions detailed in their ad-hoc guidelines.\n\nAccording to the FIG, an athlete\u2019s neutrality status should be determined using the following criteria:\n\nAn athlete seeking neutral status must have:\n\u2022 No link with the Russian/Belarusian military or with any national security agency.\n\u2022 No communication associated with Russia or Belarus.\n\u2022 No support for the military conflict in Ukraine.\n\nAngelina Melnikova, the third most-decorated female Russian gymnast in history, has generated significant international fandom throughout her career, which includes a historic team gold at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and the 2021 World All-Around title. However, many argue that her public support for the war in Ukraine should disqualify her from neutral status.\n\nDesignated a \"Champion of Terror\" by the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, Melnikova competes for the Central Sports Club of the Army (CSKA), which is subordinate to the Russian Ministry of Defense. Ukraine considers athletes from this club to be representatives of \"the armed forces of the aggressor state.\"\n\nFurthermore, Melnikova\u2019s political ties are notable: she ran in a local election in Voronezh in April 2025 and won the primary as a candidate for the pro-government United Russia party. Although she withdrew her candidacy in July to focus on gymnastics, critics point out this was not a retraction of her political stance.\n\nMelnikova has also publicly shown her support for the war on social media, sharing pro-war content and using the Z-symbol for \"Za pobedu\" (\"For victory\"). Despite these actions, the FIG confirmed her participation in the upcoming World Challenge Cup.\n\nFollowing the confirmation of Russian and Belarusian participation in Paris, I spoke exclusively with the Ukrainian Gymnastics Federation (UGF) and Lilia Podkopayeva, the country\u2019s star gymnast and 1996 Olympic and 1995 World All-Around Champion.\n\nPodkopayeva strongly opposes the decision. \u201cThis is an injustice the world cannot ignore,\u201d she asserts. \"Sport cannot be neutral during a war: every victory becomes a tool of propaganda, and [Russian and Belarusian] participation undermines the very values sport is meant to uphold.\u201d\n\nThe Olympic gymnastics legend has long advocated for human rights in her home country, serving as the United Nations Goodwill Ambassador on HIV/AIDS in Ukraine in 2005. Since Russia\u2019s 2022 attack on Ukraine, Podkopayeva has only increased her presence as an anti-war advocate. In 2023, she expanded her humanitarian efforts, providing aid to Ukrainian Border Guards on the front lines.\n\n\u201cThe war has killed at least 648 children, hundreds of athletes and coaches, and destroyed over 700 sports facilities. Ukrainian children suffer from rockets and drones, while Russian and Belarusian children train and compete,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cThis is an injustice the world cannot ignore. As long as the aggression continues, these athletes must not take part in international competitions.\u201d\n\nPodkopayeva then addressed the FIG directly. \u201cI urge (International Gymnastics Federation) and the sporting community to draw a clear moral line: protecting sport begins with protecting human life.\u201d\n\nIryna Deriugina, President of the Ukrainian Gymnastics Federation, also issued a strong response to the Russian and Belarusian involvement at the Paris World Challenge Cup in an exclusive letter.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian Gymnastics Federation constantly monitors the composition of participants in international sports competitions and the compliance of this status with the criteria of the International Gymnastics Federation,\u201d Deriugina states.\n\nIf a \u201cdeviation from the criteria for assigning neutral status with respect to specific athletes is detected,\" Deriugina attests that the Ukrainian Gymnastics Federation will take \u201call possible measures to prevent such athletes from participating in international sports competitions.\u201d\n\nThese measures include submitting statements to the International Gymnastics Federation, \u201cdemanding that the neutral status be revoked from those athletes whose behavior and actions do not meet the criteria of neutrality.\u201d The UGF will also file protests, directed at competition organizers.\n\nDeriugina vows to handle the athletes\u2019 neutral status approvals accordingly. \u201cThe Ukrainian Gymnastics Federation will take similar actions with respect to the athletes specified,\" she says.\n\nShe designates athletes\u2019 neutral status as one of the \u201cmost important topics for the global sports community,\u201d adding that the Ukrainian Gymnastics Federation remains committed to preventing \u201cSportwashing.\u201d\n\nCambridge Dictionary defines \u201cSportwashing\u201d as \u201cthe practice of an organization, a government, a country, etc., supporting sports or organizing sports events as a way to improve its reputation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSportwashing is when sport \u2014 with all the positive feelings it inspires \u2014 is used to divert attention from social or environmental problems.\u201d\n\nMelnikova\u2019s and her teammates\u2019 approval as neutral athletes is \u201cexactly this case,\" the federation alleges.\n\nIf the FIG does not address the UGF\u2019s allegations of sportwashing, Ukrainian athletes may withdraw from the event in a form of \u201cpassive protest,\u201d Deriugina stated. The Paris World Challenge Cup\u2019s nominative roster currently includes seven Ukrainian gymnasts.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, significant support in preventing the implementation of Sportswashing should be provided by the media, and the Ukrainian Gymnastics Federation considers your letter as voicing an existing problem,\u201d she says.\n\nDeriugina also emphasized the media\u2019s crucial role in preventing \"Sportwashing,\" adding that when the FIG grants \"neutrality\" status to athletes \"despite and contrary to even public facts, [it] discredits the legal institution of 'neutrality\u2019 itself.",

It also conducts military-patriotic education for children and youth, organizes patriotic sports events, and promotes international cooperation, including through the World Military Games project. As a result, CSKA athletes competing in international events effectively represent the armed forces of the aggressor state.\nIn April 2025, she won the primaries of the pro-government political party United russia to run in the elections to the Voronezh City Duma. Later, in July 2025, she announced her withdrawal from the race, explaining that it was impossible to combine an election campaign with preparation for international competitions.\nIn 2021, she was personally awarded the Order of Friendship by putin for \"a great contribution to the development of domestic sports, high sporting achievements, the will to win, resilience, and determination demonstrated at the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in 2020 in Tokyo (Japan)\".\nAlso in 2021, she was personally awarded the Medal \"For Strengthening the Combat Commonwealth\" by Sergei Shoigu, who at that time served as russia\u2019s Minister of Defense.\nShe is implementing the project Angelina Melnikova\u2019s School of Sports Gymnastics within the framework of the grant competition organized by ANO Image of the Future, with direct support from the government of Voronezh region, russia.\nThrough her Instagram account, Melnikova publicly expresses support for russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, publishing and sharing pro-war content online, as well as using Z-symbols. In 2023, she took part in raising funds for the daughter of a russian serviceman killed in action. In January 2025, she held a \"charity training session for children from families of participants in the so-called \"special military operation\", and in May 2025 she posted a photo of herself wearing a St. George\u2019s ribbon stylized as the letter Z, thereby promoting russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine."
