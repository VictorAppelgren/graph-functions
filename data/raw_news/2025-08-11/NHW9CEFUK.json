  "description": "Following the arrest Saturday of Anaheim resident Matthew Juarez, 31,whom police say has known gang ties, more information is emerging about the NMUSD student killed in the Shalimar Drive incident.",
  "content": "First responders were contacted Saturday at 12:30 p.m. regarding a stabbing on the 700 block of Shalimar Drive, and discovered a 15-year-old girl with a life-threatening stab wound.\n\nAuthorities have identified a victim of a fatal stabbing in Costa Mesa Saturday as a 15-year-old Newport-Mesa Unified student whom social media reports describe as an up-and-coming soccer player killed in an incident being investigated as a gang-related attack.\n\nAllison Castillo \u2014 a student athlete who was recently invited to play soccer in Spain \u2014 was identified by the county coroner\u2019s office Monday as the teenager found collapsed in an outside courtyard on the 700 block of Shalimar Drive by police.\n\nFirst responders were contacted Saturday at 12:30 p.m. regarding a stabbing and arrived to find the teen suffering from a life-threatening wound, according to a Costa Mesa Police Department release issued Sunday.\n\nOfficers and paramedics performed CPR at the scene and eventually transported the victim to a nearby hospital, where she died of her injuries a few hours later, the release stated.\n\nAlthough CMPD spokeswoman Roxi Fyad declined to release Castillo\u2019s identity to the public, Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department spokesman Gerard McCann confirmed Monday coroner officials had identified the victim as Castillo, a resident of Costa Mesa.\n\nDuring their investigation of the incident, police detectives determined the stabbing may have involved a suspect with known gang ties, at which point investigators from CMPD\u2019s Gang Unit were called to the scene.\n\n\u201cThe suspect was known to law enforcement as a known participant in illegal criminal gang activity,\u201d Fyad said Monday.\n\nThat individual \u2014 Matthew Juarez, 31, of Anaheim \u2014 was quickly traced to a residence in the city of Anaheim, where he was detained without incident. Juarez was booked into the county\u2019s intake release center on Sunday and is awaiting charges from the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nNewport-Mesa Unified School District officials acknowledged Castillo was a student of the district, although a spokesperson did not indicate which school the student attended.\n\n\u201cShe was a student in our district, and we are saddened by her passing,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement to media, declining to share further out of respect for the victim\u2019s family. \u201cCounseling and support services are available for our school community.\u201d\n\nCastillo reportedly played soccer for two years with So Cal Select, an independent scouting program that prepares young athletes to play in college- and professional-level international tournaments, according to the organization\u2019s .\n\nAn online GoFundMe account established on behalf of Castillo\u2019s family recalled the youth as \u201cthe life of the party, always bringing joy, laughter and warmth to everyone around her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer kindness, her ability to inspire, and her loving nature changed lives,\u201d the page read. \u201cShe was a kind soul who didn\u2019t deserve what happened to her. We demand justice for Allison, and we will not stop until those responsible are held accountable.\u201d\n\nCosta Mesa police detectives are asking anyone who may have information about Saturday\u2019s incident to contact Det. Eloisa Peralta at (714) 754-5039 or Investigator Eric Molina at (714) 754-5694.",
