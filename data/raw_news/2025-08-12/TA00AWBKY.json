  "content": "When eCommerce sales go live, consumers in the United States open their apps, scroll flash deals and fill carts.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nWhile they do their shopping across all platforms, they\u2019re not playing any favorites beyond price.\n\nThe fact that Walmart\u2019s Walmart+ event ran April 28 to May 4 while Amazon\u2019s Prime Day event ran July 8 to 11 just meant more chances for more deals to a new, fast-growing consumer segment: the dual-event shopper.\n\nThe July PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cSpeed Versus Spend: Who Shopped Amazon and Walmart\u2019s Deal Days and Why\u201d revealed that shoppers participating in both Prime Day and Walmart+ Week, a Walmart+ members-only event, drove most of the growth in participation.\n\nThat means the most valuable customer isn\u2019t just loyal to one ecosystem but is engaged in many. Smart retailers are learning how to play that flexibility to their advantage.\n\nThe evolution of Prime Day and Walmart+ Week signals a broader trend that summer discounts are no longer about sales alone. Instead, they\u2019re becoming about recalibrating loyalty. These events are carefully, and increasingly, choreographed moments of consumer reprogramming.\n\nAmazon, the once-primary architect of this summer shopping spectacle, kept its core tactic of deals for Prime members only unchanged, reinforcing the Prime subscription as a gateway and reward. Yet the eCommerce giant\u2019s execution was more sophisticated than ever.\n\nAmazon deployed real-time app notifications, dynamic homepage banners and a tidal wave of digital ads that followed users across platforms. Even Prime Video got in on the action, inserting retail tie-ins between content streams.\n\nThe average Amazon Prime Day participant spent $360 this year, an increase of just over 10% from 2024, the report found. The average Walmart+ Week shopper spent $484, a nearly 11% rise.\n\nThe idea of comparison shopping is as old as commerce itself. But what\u2019s changing is the volume, velocity and intent behind that behavior. Dual-event shoppers are not just hunting for random bargains; they\u2019re executing orchestrated shopping strategies.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the PYMNTS Intelligence data found that the quality and availability of Walmart\u2019s deals improved more than those of Amazon. Specifically, 53% of Walmart+ Week participants who completed purchases both this year and last year said this year\u2019s deals in general were better.\n\nRead the report: Speed Versus Spend: Who Shopped Amazon and Walmart\u2019s Deal Days and Why\n\nThe report also found that many consumers load up digital carts ahead of each event, monitor price drops in real time, and spread purchases across platforms based on value, availability and perks like free shipping or same-day delivery.\n\nAs these events mature, the consumer playbook is evolving and suggests that loyalty programs alone are not moats.\n\nSpeed, for example, was the breakout star in both retail events. Walmart+ Week participants were more likely than Prime Day shoppers to cite shipping time as a key factor influencing their decision to buy furniture, consumer electronics, appliances, health products, travel services and more.\n\nFor retailers, this creates opportunity and peril. On one hand, dual shoppers offer more transaction volume. On the other hand, they\u2019re less loyal to platform identity. They\u2019ll go where the best value lives, not necessarily where their membership lies.\n\nInstead, retailers must deliver consistent, personalized value across multiple touch points and be prepared to do so more than once a year. The holiday season and its accompanying retail warfare are around the corner, and learnings from May and July will inform November\u2019s playbook.",

  "summary": "The trend of summer discounts becoming more about sales and not just about sales, but about recalibrating loyalty, according to a report by PYMNTS Intelligence. The report revealed that shoppers participating in both Prime Day and Walmart+ Week saw significant growth in participation, driven by the dual-event shopper. This shift aligns with a new consumer segment of consumers who are more likely to shop across multiple platforms rather than just one. The average Amazon Prime Day participant spent $360 this year, an increase of just over 10% from 2024, while the average Walmart+ week shopper spent $484, a nearly 11% rise. The study also found that while dual shoppers offer more transaction volume, they are less loyal to platform identity and prefer shopping based on value, availability and perks like free shipping or same-day delivery.

      "text": "For the world\u2019s biggest retailers, summer means two things: sales events, and more sales events.\nAmazon kicked off its annual summer sale on Tuesday (July 8), and the eCommerce giant announced that its Prime Day event will now stretch over four days instead of the usual two, running from July 8 through July 11. Walmart has responded with its own counterpunch: a reinvigorated Walmart+ Week, launching the same day, loaded with its own slate of member-exclusive deals.\nBut from tariff anxiety to full-priced deals masked as discounts, this summer\u2019s shopping season could be a litmus test for America\u2019s evolving retail resilience. The biggest question on retailers\u2019 minds may be this: will consumers behave differently than they did last year?\nIn 2024, shoppers entered July deal season under a cloud of economic uncertainty. While inflation was slowing, consumers were still reeling from years of price volatility and interest rate hikes. Credit card balances had reached all-time highs, and discretionary spending was under pressure.\nPYMNTS Intelligence found that last year, consumers struggled to purchase the items they wanted on sale during the summer online shopping bonanza. Fast forward to 2025, and global tariffs have thrown supply chains and pricing strategies into disarray, while consumer confidence continues to slide. Will the story be the same? Who will come out ahead this year, the retailers, their shoppers or both?\nRead more: The Year in Amazon vs Walmart, and a Look Into 2025\nWhat Happened Last Year and Could This Year Be Different?\nThe stakes this year are high. For both retailers, mid-year sales have become about more than just clearing inventory; they are strategic stress tests for supply chains, pricing models and consumer sentiment.\nBoth events are unfolding against a backdrop where the 2024 Prime Day and Walmart+ Week events were less than stellar for many consumers.\nDespite months of anticipation, a key finding from PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s 2024 post-sale report, \u201cBNPL Fuels Essential Spending Surge on Amazon Prime Day, Walmart+ Week,\u201d revealed that a significant portion of shoppers left disappointed. While 75% of participants said they joined the sales to find deals on products they buy regularly, many didn\u2019t see the deep discounts they were hoping for.\nA separate report, \u201cShoppers Flocked to Amazon Prime Day and Walmart+ Week for More Than Discounts,\u201d found that 41% of items bought on Amazon Prime Day were full-priced, while 44% of Walmart+ Week purchases were not discounted.\nThe lack of markdowns was not lost on consumers, especially in an economic climate where every dollar counts. Many voiced frustration that the \u201cdeals\u201d were either unavailable, sold out within minutes or didn\u2019t apply to the everyday essentials they needed most.\nThis year, the wild card isn\u2019t inflation. It\u2019s tariffs. Both Amazon and rival Walmart are working on ways to overhaul their supply chains in response to the tariffs, and consumer optimism about the impact of the tariffs varies greatly depending on what they value in their purchases, according to the report PYMNTS Intelligence \u201cConsumer Tariff Sentiment: Informed Americans Are Skeptical of the Benefits.\u201d\nSee also: Amazon and Walmart Focus AI Investments on Their Retail Soft Spots\nThe Tariff Effect Emerges as a New Variable in 2025\nTariffs are changing the equation on what products get discounted \u2014 and how deeply. In May, retail sales slipped 0.9%, adding to a revised 0.1% decline in April.\nWhen offered the choice between low-priced or American-made products, 39% of shoppers always or mostly value affordability, a feature associated with goods imported from low-cost China. On the flip side, 34% of consumers said they always or mostly prefer items made in the U.S., and 26% placed equal weight on both.\nPYMNTS Intelligence research has also found that more than 8 in 10 consumers are taking measures to offset the financial impact of tariffs on their bank accounts.\n\u201cIn fact, the average individual is making nearly five such behavioral changes, and 44% of consumers have already changed their shopping habits in response to tariff-induced price pressures,\u201d PYMNTS wrote last month.\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cThe Urban-Rural Economic Divide: How Location Affects SMBs\u2019 Outlook\u201d found that nearly 1 in 3 rural small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) (30%) report their sales are down.\nPerhaps the most underreported trend is what we might call \u201cdiscount fatigue.\u201d After years of being bombarded with sales events \u2014 Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Spring Savings, Flash Sales \u2014 many consumers have grown skeptical. They now approach sales with caution, armed with price-comparison tools and browser plugins that expose inflated prices disguised as markdowns.\nShoppers are prepped and ready to spend, but they want to feel in control, not manipulated."
