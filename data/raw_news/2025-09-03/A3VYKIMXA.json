  "title": "XPANCEO And INTRA-KER Put First Camera-Display Implant In The Human Eye",
  "description": "XPANCEO and INTRA-KER unveil a prototype eye implant that uses an external camera and microdisplay to bypass the cornea and project images directly to the retina.",
  "content": "XPANCEO, the Dubai-based deep tech unicorn developing smart contact lenses, and INTRA-KER, an Italian medtech startup, announced today the first working prototype of an implantable device designed to restore vision for patients with corneal blindness. Early tests, including on a human donor eye, showed the system projecting clear images directly to the retina, bypassing the cornea entirely.\n\nThe announcement reframes corneal blindness as a challenge of information delivery. Normally, light passes through the transparent cornea, then through the lens of the eye before being converted into neural signals by the retina. When the cornea is clouded or scarred, the pathway is blocked even if the retina itself is healthy. Donor tissue can help, but it is scarce, and even after transplant, some patients remain legally blind.\n\nXPANCEO and INTRA-KER\u2019s system sidesteps the cornea by embedding a microdisplay in the damaged tissue. The device receives a video feed captured by external smart glasses with an embedded camera. Data is transmitted wirelessly using the same communication and power protocols XPANCEO developed for its smart contact lens prototypes. The microdisplay then projects images directly onto the retina, restoring visual input without relying on corneal transparency.\n\nIn the lab, researchers first validated the implant in a fluid medium that mimicked intraocular conditions. They then implanted the prototype into a donor eye, where it produced clearly distinguishable retinal images. The current version combines a 450-by-450 pixel display with a micro-optical projection system into a 5.6-millimeter package. \u201cFor clinical use, we aim to miniaturize the entire system,\u201d said Dr. Valentyn Volkov, founder of XPANCEO.\n\nVolkov places the work in a broader context. According to the World Health Organization, over 12 million people are awaiting corneal transplants. \u201cWe see this as the beginning of a new era, where advanced optics and computation can bridge longstanding gaps in vision care,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUntil now, implanting electronics in the anterior segment of the eye has not met with success,\u201d said Professor Massimo Busin of INTRA-KER. \u201cWith only 185,000 traditional corneal transplants performed each year, we see a critical need for solutions that don\u2019t rely on donor tissues.\" The implant represents a paradigm shift away from biology to engineered solutions that focus on information delivery.",
