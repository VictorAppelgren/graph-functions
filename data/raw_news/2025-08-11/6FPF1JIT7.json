  "content": "Shares of Excelerate Energy slipped after the company's second-quarter profit fell, hurt by costs tied to a recent acquisition, and its top line missed estimates.\n\nThe stock fell 4.1%, to $23.33, midday Monday. Despite having lost about one-fifth of their value in the past three months, shares are up 21% in the past year.\n\nBefore the bell, the Woodlands, Texas, energy company posted net income attributable to shareholders of $4.7 million, or 15 cents a share, down from $11.4 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet expected quarterly earnings of 27 cents a share.\n\nAdjusted earnings came in at 34 cents a share, ahead of the 30 cents a share that analysts projected.\n\nRevenue jumped 12%, to $204.6 million, but missed the $228.9 million that Wall Street modeled.\n\nExcelerate said the recent quarter's earnings were squeezed by transition and transaction costs stemming from its $1.06 billion acquisition of New Fortress Energy's business in Jamaica, which closed in May.\n\nThe deal is, however, expected to provide a boost to the company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year. The company last month increased its adjusted Ebitda outlook to between $420 million and $440 million, from between $345 million and $365 million.\n\nAnalysts are looking for adjusted Ebitda of $423.6 million.",
