      "summary": "Russia and China signed a legally binding memorandum to build the long‑delayed Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, which will deliver 50 billion cubic metres of gas per year to northern China for 30 years. The deal signals Russia’s pivot away from Europe amid Western sanctions and a broader push for a multipolar order, while China seeks to secure a stable, long‑term energy source. The agreement, announced on 2 September 2025, is a step forward for Gazprom but remains an MOU, with pricing still to be negotiated. The pipeline could lift Russian gas revenues and deepen Sino‑Russian economic ties, while potentially easing China’s energy supply constraints and reshaping global gas flows.",
