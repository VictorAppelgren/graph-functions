  "content": "Database platform company MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) will be announcing earnings results this Tuesday after market close. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nMongoDB beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 4.1% last quarter, reporting revenues of $549 million, up 21.9% year on year. It was a very strong quarter for the company, with EPS guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations and an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates. It added 110 enterprise customers paying more than $100,000 annually to reach a total of 2,506.\n\nIs MongoDB a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting MongoDB\u2019s revenue to grow 15.8% year on year to $553.6 million, improving from the 12.8% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.66 per share.\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. MongoDB has only missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 4.2% on average.\n\nLooking at MongoDB\u2019s peers in the data and analytics software segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Commvault delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 25.5%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 5.2%, and DigitalOcean reported revenues up 13.6%, topping estimates by 1%. Commvault traded up 18.2% following the results while DigitalOcean was also up 34.9%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Commvault\u2019s results here and DigitalOcean\u2019s results here.\n\nThe euphoria surrounding Trump\u2019s November win lit a fire under major indices, but potential tariffs have caused the market to do a 180 in 2025. While some of the data and analytics software stocks have shown solid performance in this choppy environment, the group has generally underperformed, with share prices down 4.3% on average over the last month. MongoDB is down 10% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $272.21 (compared to the current share price of $219.99).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nStockStory is growing and hiring equity analyst and marketing roles.

      "text": "High-Quality Businesses Win\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is an exciting stock because it offers exposure to the multi-decade mega-trend of automation. On top of that, its role in automating IT Service management puts it in a prime position to benefit from the introduction of generative AI.\nWe are long-term investors, not speculators, so we don\u2019t celebrate the short-term wins. Nonetheless, we are grateful and fortunate that Lead Analyst Anthony Lee chose a good time (August 17, 2023) to issue our ServiceNow buy recommendation exclusively to paying members of StockStory Edge. The stock was roughly $540 a share then.\nDespite the 85+% share price increase since then, we still have ServiceNow in our portfolio. Note that we (the StockStory team) only bought shares in ServiceNow days after recommending it to members of StockStory Edge. And if in the future we no longer consider ServiceNow compelling, StockStory Edge members will be the first to know. We never trade personally until after informing our members and giving them 5 trading days to act.\nAs our way of welcoming you aboard our free membership tier, we hope you enjoy this abridged version of our full recommendation, which is only available to members of StockStory Edge.\nServiceNow (NOW): StockStory Edge Stock Of The Month For August 2023\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has been a stock market winner ever since its summer 2012 IPO. It priced at $18, closed its first day of trading at $24.60, and hasn\u2019t looked back. The shares now trade at around $1,000. Since its IPO, this is not just one of the best-performing stocks in enterprise software but in the whole market.\nJust because the stock is up big, however, doesn\u2019t mean the opportunity is gone.\nIn this case? Quite the opposite.\nThat\u2019s because ServiceNow offers sticky mission-critical products across IT, HR, and customer service that reduce manual work, eliminate human error, and keep large corporations functioning. The company generates reliable subscription revenue from its happy customers and because of attractive unit economics, that revenue turns into high profits and free cash margins. The excess cash churned out by the business can be used to continually widen ServiceNow's lead over the competition competition from a brand, product, and customer service standpoint.\nThe kicker is that ServiceNow is now very much a Generative AI beneficiary due to its partnership with NVIDIA.\nWhat Does ServiceNow Do?\nServiceNow\u2019s software platform helps businesses automate workflows and gives them a birds-eye view of their operations, unifying what has become an increasingly complex technology stack for many companies.\nServiceNow was founded in 2003 when current Chairman of the Board Fred Luddy recognized the inefficiencies of traditional IT Service Management (ITSM) at a time when employees might have to jump through multiple hoops to request help and then sit on standby for hours until someone from the IT department fixed their problem.\nLuddy envisioned a world where technology could speed up these slow, cumbersome processes and launched the company\u2019s first product in 2006.\nToday, corporations of all sizes rely on ServiceNow to not only streamline IT but also manage their entire organization through a simple yet comprehensive online portal. For example, onboarding a new employee involves HR for payroll, IT for device needs, and whatever is specific to that person\u2019s department.\nServiceNow brings these disparate systems together and automates the onboarding process, which will inevitably happen over and over again.\nServiceNow\u2019s all-in-one platform gives customers numerous products to choose from, as shown in the graphic below. These software programs allow administrators to execute repetitive, labor-intensive tasks with the click of a button. On top of that, each product is wrapped in analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning capabilities, allowing customers to extract powerful insights from their data.\nThe company\u2019s ambition doesn\u2019t end there. ServiceNow has a strong track record of releasing new products to boost its customers\u2019 productivity, the latest being a low-code platform that enables non-technical employees to build custom software applications. ServiceNow constantly surprises its customers (and investors) with innovation, granting it huge upside potential.\nWhy We Love An Investment In ServiceNow\nFor starters, we love the software subscription business model. If you sell sneakers, for instance, customers who bought from you last quarter may not come back again this quarter. On the other hand, software customers often sign multi-year contracts, resulting in recurring, predictable revenues and lower customer acquisition costs.\nWithin software, we believe ServiceNow has a very strong brand. \u201cNobody ever got fired for buying IBM\u201d was a common phrase in IT circles in the 1980s and early 1990s, and we argue that NOW is heading in the same direction. 85% of Fortune 500 companies are ServiceNow customers and those controlling IT budgets view the company as trustworthy, reliable, and safe because of how many happy, loyal, and influential customers it has.\nFurthermore, ServiceNow\u2019s customers rarely cancel their subscriptions because its products are deeply intertwined with company operations. ServiceNow is capable of replacing a multitude of legacy software systems\u2013everything from technical support to managing downtime. That means switching to ServiceNow can make life easier for employees, and once it\u2019s there, switching away is very disruptive. This results in a sky-high renewal rate of around 98%.\nTurning to profit, ServiceNow stands out with its gross margin of around 85% on its subscription revenue. From there, its adjusted operating margin and free cash flow margin will both hover around 30% when 2024 is all said and done. This makes ServiceNow a money-printing machine with the capital to grow its competitive position by improving existing products, adding new products, and promoting its brand.\nWhat Does ServiceNow\u2019s Future Hold?\nWe think much of ServiceNow\u2019s future growth will stem from selling more products to existing customers. The chart below shows how its \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy has developed over time. ServiceNow has successfully upsold its customers as 82% of contracts in 2023 featured five or more products purchased, up from 54% in 2019 (note that NNACV is 'net new annual contract value', a proxy for incremental revenue). We expect this number to be around 85% when the company reports 2024 results.\nAnother underappreciated growth lever is ServiceNow\u2019s pricing power. Before 2018, the company had one pricing tier for all products. That changed in 2018 when NOW introduced a \u2018Pro\u2019 tier for IT service management, whereby customers could upgrade their packages to get more analytical and AI functionality. What\u2019s next? Pro Plus, of course. It boasts \u201cgreater AI capabilities\u201d, and we expect it to contribute to future growth.\nWe think as more of ServiceNow\u2019s growth comes from existing customers, marketing expenses will moderate as a percentage of revenue, and thus we believe ServiceNow can earn higher profit margins as it grows.\nWhy Is Now The Right Time to Buy?\nServiceNow\u2019s price-to-forward-sales (next 12 months) multiple is currently over 15x, higher than most companies and higher than when we recommended it back in August 2023.\nNonetheless, we think ServiceNow can justify its valuation due to its long-term demand tailwinds, predictable subscription model, best-in-class customer retention, and robust profit margins. We'd also add that our extensive backtest research and analysis has shown that when it comes to outperforming the market, business quality matters much more than entry price--you get what you pay for. Said differently, valuation may seem daunting in the near term, but companies showing robust growth up and down the P&L \"grow into\" their premium multiples over time.\nThe cherry on top is that the company is increasingly showing that it will be a Generative AI beneficiary for years--even decades--to come. In May 2023, ServiceNow and NVIDIA announced a partnership. The principal goal for ServiceNow was to develop custom large language models (LLMs) using NVIDIA\u2019s technology.\nThe result includes intelligent virtual assistants and AI chatbots that can better resolve user issues and support requests. The secret sauce involves two parts: the GenAI\u2019s capability to pull knowledge from unstructured data such as source code, internal documents, or videos to answer questions combined with the LLMs\u2019 ability to summarize the information, eliminate the technical jargon, and give conversational responses.\nIn February 2024, ServiceNow unveiled an industry-specific solution for the telecom sector. \u2018Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management\u2019 is for an industry where consumers are particularly frustrated with their customer service interactions (have you ever called customer service about your smartphone bill or tried to change plans??). Surely, similar solutions for other consumer-facing industries will roll out soon.\nWe really like that these GenAI and LLM-driven offerings are easy for customers to understand and provide straightforward, quantifiable benefits (the cost of a customer service agent). Combined with ServiceNow\u2019s large customer base that already trusts the company in IT, Customer Service, and Human Resources, we think the company can start reaping the needle-moving benefits of GenAI in the near term.\nWith its product portfolio that is mission-critical for most customers, the expansion of this portfolio, and the GenAI tailwind, we think ServiceNow's revenue can sustain 20+% growth for a number of years.\nWith efficiency on expenses, especially the sales and marketing leverage, that revenue growth can translate into roughly 35% adjusted operating profit growth over time. It's had a big run in a short period and could take a breather in the near term, but we\u2019re convinced the stock could approach $1,550 by the end of 2027. If that occurs, it would still generate a return that likely beats the market despite the big jump in the share price since we first pitched the stock.\nLooking beyond 2026, we love a number of things about ServiceNow: the secular tailwinds it enjoys, the company's continually strengthening brand, and its products that bring customers great value and efficiency. This combination will drive stronger-for-longer revenue growth than the market anticipates.\nThis is a stock for investors looking for a high-quality business to hold over the long term.\nWhat Are The Key Risks And How Do We Feel About Them?\nThose stocks that are \u2018\u201csure things\u201d? They don\u2019t exist. Every investment has its risks.\nFor ServiceNow, we\u2019ve boiled them down into the three most important: competition, margins, and valuation.\nServiceNow has a tight grip on the IT service management market, but future returns will need to come from selling adjacent products where it faces stiffer competition. This means squaring off against Salesforce in customer service management, Microsoft in low-code/AI applications, and younger upstarts like Rippling in HR solutions. More competition means that ServiceNow may have to spend more on product development or accept lower gross margins to maintain its growth rate.\nThat leads us to our next risk\u2013margins. Our thesis holds that ServiceNow can reduce its expenses as a percentage of revenue as it grows. There\u2019s a chance this doesn\u2019t happen. For example, new products may gain less traction than expected or cost more than anticipated to develop.\nTurning to valuation, ServiceNow isn\u2019t conventionally cheap based on current earnings. It has a lofty P/E ratio, implying the market expects many years of growth ahead. That makes it vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and sentiment around high-growth businesses.\nUltimately, we\u2019re comfortable with these risks because of ServiceNow\u2019s dominance, reputation, products, financial strength. We expect many years of healthy growth in revenue, profits, and free cash flow.\nClosing Thoughts\nWe\u2019re excited about ServiceNow at this stage in its evolution. Software is still eating the world, and within software, ServiceNow is an elite asset in terms of its products and financials. Please note that members of StockStory hold shares in ServiceNow.

      "text": "MongoDB (MDB)\nWe aren\u2019t fans of MongoDB. Strike one is it barely generates cash, and strike two is its cash conversion is expected to get even worse.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy MongoDB Is Not Exciting\nNamed after \"humongous database,\" reflecting its ability to handle massive data loads, MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) provides a flexible document-based database platform that helps developers build, deploy, and maintain modern applications more efficiently.\n- Rapid expansion strategy came at the expense of operating margin profitability\n- Ability to fund investments or reward shareholders with increased buybacks or dividends is restricted by its weak free cash flow margin of 7.6% for the last year\n- A bright spot is that its ARR growth averaged 25.1% over the last year, showing customers are willing to take multi-year bets on its software\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than MongoDB\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than MongoDB\nMongoDB\u2019s stock price of $219.99 implies a valuation ratio of 7.5x forward price-to-sales. The current valuation may be fair, but we\u2019re still passing on this stock due to better alternatives out there.\nWe\u2019d rather invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with more reliable earnings growth.\n3. MongoDB (MDB) Research Report: Q1 CY2025 Update\nDatabase software company MongoDB (MDB) beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q1 CY2025, with sales up 21.9% year on year to $549 million. The company expects next quarter\u2019s revenue to be around $550.5 million, close to analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.46 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nMongoDB (MDB) Q1 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $549 million vs analyst estimates of $527.5 million (21.9% year-on-year growth, 4.1% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: -$0.46 vs analyst estimates of $0.66 (significant miss)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $87.43 million vs analyst estimates of $56.36 million (15.9% margin, 55.1% beat)\n- The company slightly lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $2.27 billion at the midpoint from $2.26 billion\n- Management raised its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $3.03 at the midpoint, a 19.8% increase\n- Operating Margin: -9.8%, up from -21.8% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 19.3%, up from 4.2% in the previous quarter\n- Customers: 57,100, up from 54,500 in the previous quarter\n- Billings: $509.4 million at quarter end, up 23.3% year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $15.73 billion\nCompany Overview\nStarted in 2007 by the team behind Google\u2019s ad platform, DoubleClick, MongoDB offers database-as-a-service that helps companies store large volumes of semi-structured data.\nThe standard relational databases function like Excel on steroids, they store data in rows and columns across different tables. This works well if you need to store a lot of data that has a similar structure, but it can create potential inefficiencies if the structure of the data you are storing varies a lot. MongoDB instead stores data in records called documents, which, similarly to a patient\u2019s documents in a doctor\u2019s office, have all the data for one entity in one folder, even though what is in the folder can vary a lot between entities.\nSimilar to other businesses like Elastic (ESTC), MongoDB is built on a business model that combines free open source software with paid offerings. The paid product has features valuable for enterprise customers and offers a fully hosted service, but developers can also download and use the limited version of MongoDB for free, which makes it really easy to try and evaluate.\n4. Data Storage\nData is the lifeblood of the internet and software in general, and the amount of data created is accelerating. As a result, the importance of storing the data in scalable and efficient formats continues to rise, especially as its diversity and associated use cases expand from analyzing simple, structured datasets to high-scale processing of unstructured data such as images, audio, and video.\nCompetitors include database providers such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as well as cloud offerings provided by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n5. Sales Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, MongoDB\u2019s 29.1% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was impressive. Its growth beat the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nThis quarter, MongoDB reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 21.9%, and its $549 million of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 4.1%. Company management is currently guiding for a 15.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 11.9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is above the sector average and suggests the market sees some success for its newer products and services.\n6. Billings\nBillings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called \u201ccash revenue\u201d because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract.\nMongoDB\u2019s billings punched in at $509.4 million in Q1, and over the last four quarters, its growth was impressive as it averaged 23.7% year-on-year increases. This alternate topline metric grew faster than total sales, meaning the company collects cash upfront and then recognizes the revenue over the length of its contracts - a boost for its liquidity and future revenue prospects.\n7. Customer Base\nMongoDB reported 57,100 customers at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of 2,600. That\u2019s a little better than last quarter and quite a bit above the typical growth we\u2019ve seen over the previous year. Shareholders should take this as an indication that MongoDB\u2019s go-to-market strategy is working well.\n8. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it\u2019s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability.\nIt\u2019s relatively expensive for MongoDB to acquire new customers as its CAC payback period checked in at 387.1 months this quarter. The company\u2019s slow recovery of its sales and marketing expenses indicates it operates in a highly competitive market and must invest to stand out, even if the return on that investment is low.\n9. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like MongoDB, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nMongoDB\u2019s gross margin is better than the broader software industry and signals it has solid unit economics and competitive products. As you can see below, it averaged a decent 72.9% gross margin over the last year. That means for every $100 in revenue, roughly $72.89 was left to spend on selling, marketing, and R&D.\nIn Q1, MongoDB produced a 71.2% gross profit margin, marking a 1.6 percentage point decrease from 72.8% in the same quarter last year. MongoDB\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 1.6 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs.\n10. Operating Margin\nMongoDB\u2019s expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 8.1% over the last year. Unprofitable, high-growth software companies require extra attention because they spend heaps of money to capture market share. As seen in its fast historical revenue growth, this strategy seems to have worked so far, but it\u2019s unclear what would happen if MongoDB reeled back its investments. Wall Street seems to be optimistic about its growth, but we have some doubts.\nOver the last year, MongoDB\u2019s expanding sales gave it operating leverage as its margin rose by 6.8 percentage points. Still, it will take much more for the company to reach long-term profitability.\nThis quarter, MongoDB generated a negative 9.8% operating margin. The company's consistent lack of profits raise a flag.\n11. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nMongoDB has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last year, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 7.6%, subpar for a software business.\nMongoDB\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $105.9 million in Q1, equivalent to a 19.3% margin. This result was good as its margin was 5.8 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends trump fluctuations.\nOver the next year, analysts predict MongoDB\u2019s cash conversion will slightly fall. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 7.6% for the last 12 months will decrease to 7.1%.\n12. Balance Sheet Assessment\nOne of the best ways to mitigate bankruptcy risk is to hold more cash than debt.\nMongoDB is a well-capitalized company with $2.45 billion of cash and $37 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $2.42 billion net cash position is 14.9% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n13. Key Takeaways from MongoDB\u2019s Q1 Results\nWe were glad MongoDB raised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance. We were also impressed by how significantly the company beat analysts' revenue and adjusted operating income expectations. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 14.3% to $228.46 immediately after reporting.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy MongoDB?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:01 PM EDT\nAre you wondering whether to buy MongoDB or pass? We urge investors to not only consider the latest earnings results but also longer-term business quality and valuation as well.\nMongoDB doesn\u2019t top our investment wishlist, but we understand that it\u2019s not a bad business. To kick things off, its revenue growth was strong over the last three years. And while MongoDB\u2019s operating margins are low compared to other software companies, its splendid ARR growth shows it\u2019s securing more long-term contracts and becoming a more predictable business.\nMongoDB\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 7.5x. While this valuation is fair, the upside isn\u2019t great compared to the potential downside. We're pretty confident there are more exciting stocks to buy at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $272.21 on the company (compared to the current share price of $219.99)."

      "text": "DigitalOcean (DOCN)\nDigitalOcean doesn\u2019t excite us. Its weak revenue growth and gross margin show it not only lacks demand but also decent unit economics.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy DigitalOcean Is Not Exciting\nBuilt for simplicity in a world of complex cloud solutions, DigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) provides a simplified cloud computing platform that enables developers and small businesses to quickly deploy and scale applications.\n- Gross margin of 59.7% is way below its competitors, leaving less money to invest in areas like marketing and R&D\n- Net revenue retention rate of 98.8% shows it has a tough time retaining customers\n- On the bright side, its healthy operating margin shows it\u2019s a well-run company with efficient processes, and its profits increased over the last year as it scaled\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than DigitalOcean\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than DigitalOcean\nAt $31.76 per share, DigitalOcean trades at 3.3x forward price-to-sales. This is a cheap valuation multiple, but for good reason. You get what you pay for.\nIt\u2019s better to pay up for high-quality businesses with higher long-term earnings potential rather than to buy lower-quality stocks because they appear cheap. These challenged businesses often don\u2019t re-rate, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. DigitalOcean (DOCN) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nCloud computing provider DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 13.6% year on year to $218.7 million. Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was better than expected at $226.5 million at the midpoint, 1.4% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.59 per share was 26.2% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nDigitalOcean (DOCN) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $218.7 million vs analyst estimates of $216.6 million (13.6% year-on-year growth, 1% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.59 vs analyst estimates of $0.47 (26.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $89.47 million vs analyst estimates of $85.17 million (40.9% margin, 5% beat)\n- The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $890 million at the midpoint from $880 million, a 1.1% increase\n- Management raised its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $2.08 at the midpoint, a 9.2% increase\n- Operating Margin: 16.3%, up from 11.6% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was $57.02 million, up from -$821,000 in the previous quarter\n- Net Revenue Retention Rate: 99%, down from 100% in the previous quarter\n- Annual Recurring Revenue: $875 million at quarter end, up 13.6% year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $2.46 billion\nCompany Overview\nStarted by brothers Ben and Moisey Uretsky, DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN) provides a simple, low-cost platform that allows developers and small and medium-sized businesses to host applications and data in the cloud.\nDigitalOcean offers a range of cloud computing options for developers and small businesses. Hyperscalers Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform are the dominant providers of the cloud infrastructure that has become the standard for companies today.\nFor individual developers and small and medium businesses, the large cloud platforms present some hurdles to adoption: the actual onboarding and implementation processes can be difficult, pricing models can be complex and at times unpredictable, and there is a relatively low level of support for SMBs, as the cloud giants are focused on serving enterprise customers.\nDigitalOcean focuses mainly on less application and website hosting use cases and differentiates itself from the hyperscale platforms through the intuitive simplicity of its user interface, which allows customers to spin up \u201cDroplets\u201d (their term for a virtual machine) in under a minute. The company offers a high level of live-person customer support regardless of spend levels, and utilizes open source software to keep costs low. For context, DigitalOcean\u2019s bandwidth prices are a fraction of its hyperscale rivals.\n4. Data Storage\nData is the lifeblood of the internet and software in general, and the amount of data created is accelerating. As a result, the importance of storing the data in scalable and efficient formats continues to rise, especially as its diversity and associated use cases expand from analyzing simple, structured datasets to high-scale processing of unstructured data such as images, audio, and video.\nDigital Ocean\u2019s main competitors are the hyperscale cloud providers: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud Platform (NASDAQ: GOOGL). IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) round out the larger players. A second set of rivals are niche cloud providers that target certain verticals or geographies such as OVH, Vultr, Linode, and Heroku, which is owned by Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Over the last three years, DigitalOcean grew its sales at a 19.2% annual rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell slightly short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds.\nThis quarter, DigitalOcean reported year-on-year revenue growth of 13.6%, and its $218.7 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1%. Company management is currently guiding for a 14.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 13.1% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. Still, this projection is commendable and indicates the market is baking in success for its products and services.\n6. Annual Recurring Revenue\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nDigitalOcean\u2019s ARR punched in at $875 million in Q2, and over the last four quarters, its growth slightly outpaced the sector as it averaged 13.3% year-on-year increases. This performance aligned with its total sales growth and shows the company is securing longer-term commitments. Its growth also contributes positively to DigitalOcean\u2019s revenue predictability, a trait long-term investors typically prefer.\n7. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it\u2019s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability.\nDigitalOcean is extremely efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 13.6 months this quarter. The company\u2019s rapid sales cycles stem from its strong brand reputation and self-serve model, where it can onboard many small customers with little to no oversight. These dynamics give DigitalOcean more resources to pursue new product initiatives.\n8. Customer Retention\nOne of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time.\nDigitalOcean\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 98.8% in Q2. This means DigitalOcean\u2019s revenue would\u2019ve decreased by 1.2% over the last 12 months if it didn\u2019t win any new customers.\nDigitalOcean has a weak net retention rate, signaling that some customers aren\u2019t satisfied with its products, leading to lost contracts and revenue streams.\n9. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like DigitalOcean, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nDigitalOcean\u2019s gross margin is substantially worse than most software businesses, signaling it has relatively high infrastructure costs compared to asset-lite businesses like ServiceNow. As you can see below, it averaged a 59.7% gross margin over the last year. Said differently, DigitalOcean had to pay a chunky $40.33 to its service providers for every $100 in revenue.\nThis quarter, DigitalOcean\u2019s gross profit margin was 59.9%, marking a 1.1 percentage point decrease from 61% in the same quarter last year. On a wider time horizon, however, DigitalOcean\u2019s full-year margin has been trending up over the past 12 months, increasing by 1.4 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest better unit economics due to more leverage from its growing sales on the fixed portion of its cost of goods sold (such as servers).\n10. Operating Margin\nWhile many software businesses point investors to their adjusted profits, which exclude stock-based compensation (SBC), we prefer GAAP operating margin because SBC is a legitimate expense used to attract and retain talent. This metric shows how much revenue remains after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to sales and R&D.\nDigitalOcean has been a well-oiled machine over the last year. It demonstrated elite profitability for a software business, boasting an average operating margin of 15.7%. This result was particularly impressive because of its low gross margin, which is mostly a factor of what it sells and takes huge shifts to move meaningfully. Companies have more control over their operating margins, and it\u2019s a show of well-managed operations if they\u2019re high when gross margins are low.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, DigitalOcean\u2019s operating margin rose by 4.7 percentage points over the last year, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage.\nIn Q2, DigitalOcean generated an operating margin profit margin of 16.3%, up 4.7 percentage points year on year. The increase was encouraging, and because its gross margin actually decreased, we can assume it was more efficient because its operating expenses like marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead grew slower than its revenue.\n11. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nDigitalOcean has shown impressive cash profitability, driven by its cost-effective customer acquisition strategy that gives it the option to invest in new products and services rather than sales and marketing. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 14.3% over the last year, better than the broader software sector.\nDigitalOcean\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $57.02 million in Q2, equivalent to a 26.1% margin. This result was good as its margin was 6.6 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends carry greater meaning.\nOver the next year, analysts predict DigitalOcean\u2019s cash conversion will improve. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 14.3% for the last 12 months will increase to 18.6%, it options for capital deployment (investments, share buybacks, etc.).\n12. Balance Sheet Assessment\nDigitalOcean reported $387.7 million of cash and $1.76 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $348.3 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view DigitalOcean\u2019s 3.9\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $4.07 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n13. Key Takeaways from DigitalOcean\u2019s Q2 Results\nThis was a beat and raise quarter. We were impressed by DigitalOcean\u2019s optimistic full-year EPS guidance, which blew past analysts\u2019 expectations. We were also glad its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. On the other hand, its net revenue retention declined. Overall, we think this was still a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 12.8% to $30.50 immediately following the results.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy DigitalOcean?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:15 PM EDT\nBefore investing in or passing on DigitalOcean, we urge you to understand the company\u2019s business quality (or lack thereof), valuation, and the latest quarterly results - in that order.\nDigitalOcean isn\u2019t a bad business, but we have other favorites. Although its revenue growth was mediocre over the last three years and analysts expect growth to slow over the next 12 months, its efficient sales strategy allows it to target and onboard new users at scale. Be wary, however, as DigitalOcean\u2019s software has low switching costs and high turnover.\nDigitalOcean\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 3.3x. While this valuation is fair, the upside isn\u2019t great compared to the potential downside. We're fairly confident there are better investments elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $41.60 on the company (compared to the current share price of $31.76)."

News\n2. Summary\nWhy Commvault Is Interesting\nBorn from the need to create ironclad protection in an increasingly dangerous digital world, Commvault (NASDAQ:CVLT) provides data protection and cyber resilience software that helps organizations secure, back up, and recover their data across on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.\n- Billings have averaged 26.5% growth over the last year, showing it\u2019s securing new contracts that could potentially increase in value over time\n- Prominent and differentiated software culminates in a premier gross margin of 82%\n- One pitfall is its annual revenue growth of 10.3% over the last three years was below our standards for the software sector\nWhy Is Now The Time To Buy Commvault?\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy Is Now The Time To Buy Commvault?\nCommvault\u2019s stock price of $181.04 implies a valuation ratio of 6.9x forward price-to-sales. Commvault\u2019s current multiple might be below that of most software peers, but we think this valuation is warranted after considering its business quality.\nThis could be a good time to invest if you think there are underappreciated aspects of the business.\n3. Commvault (CVLT) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nData backup provider Commvault (NASDAQ:CVLT) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 25.5% year on year to $282 million. Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was better than expected at $273 million at the midpoint, 0.7% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.01 per share was 4.1% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nCommvault Systems (CVLT) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $282 million vs analyst estimates of $268 million (25.5% year-on-year growth, 5.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $1.01 vs analyst estimates of $0.97 (4.1% beat)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $58.25 million vs analyst estimates of $56.21 million (20.7% margin, 3.6% beat)\n- The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $1.16 billion at the midpoint from $1.14 billion, a 2.5% increase\n- Operating Margin: 8.9%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 10.6%, down from 27.7% in the previous quarter\n- Annual Recurring Revenue: $996.2 million at quarter end, up 24.1% year on year\n- Billings: $299.4 million at quarter end, up 28.2% year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $7.28 billion\nCompany Overview\nOriginally formed in 1988 as part of Bell Labs, Commvault (NASDAQ: CVLT) provides enterprise software used for data backup and recovery, cloud and infrastructure management, retention, and compliance.\nIn today\u2019s digital economy, companies rely on data to predict customer behavior, guide operational efficiency, and drive corporate strategy. The trouble is, your data grows, morphs, and fragments \u2013 digital bits and bytes in a constant state of movement and evolution. And data moves from on premise data centers to the cloud and back. Corporate data needs to be protected in case of disasters or from cyber criminals. And it needs to be done in a cost effective and easy to use manner.\nCommvault Intelligent Data Services help enterprises drive greater efficiency by transforming how they protect, store, and use data. Commvault offerings are organized into three categories - Data Protection, Data Insights and more recently Storage. All of its products operate through a single simple to use interface on the Commvault Command Center, where IT professionals identify content and data they want to protect, and run automated backups. In 2020 Commvault acquired Hedvig and Metallic to expand their storage capabilities to include public cloud architectures, containers, and virtual machines.\n4. Data Storage\nData is the lifeblood of the internet and software in general, and the amount of data created is accelerating. As a result, the importance of storing the data in scalable and efficient formats continues to rise, especially as its diversity and associated use cases expand from analyzing simple, structured datasets to high-scale processing of unstructured data such as images, audio, and video.\nCommvault\u2019s public competitors include IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and VMware (NYSE:VMW) while its private company rivals include Cohesity, Rubrik, Veeam, Veritas Technologies, Arcserve, and Acronis.\n5. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last three years, Commvault Systems grew its sales at a 10.3% compounded annual growth rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds.\nThis quarter, Commvault Systems reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 25.5%, and its $282 million of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 5.2%. Company management is currently guiding for a 17% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 10.8% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection is above average for the sector and indicates its newer products and services will help support its historical top-line performance.\n6. Annual Recurring Revenue\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nCommvault Systems\u2019s ARR punched in at $996.2 million in Q2, and over the last four quarters, its growth was impressive as it averaged 20.8% year-on-year increases. This performance aligned with its total sales growth and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company\u2019s technology. Its growth also makes Commvault Systems a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.\n7. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period measures the months a company needs to recoup the money spent on acquiring a new customer. This metric helps assess how quickly a business can break even on its sales and marketing investments.\nCommvault Systems is efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 37.8 months this quarter. The company\u2019s relatively fast recovery of its customer acquisition costs gives it the option to accelerate growth by increasing its sales and marketing investments.\n8. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like Commvault Systems, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nCommvault Systems\u2019s robust unit economics are better than the broader software industry, an output of its asset-lite business model and pricing power. They also enable the company to fund large investments in new products and sales during periods of rapid growth to achieve higher profits in the future. As you can see below, it averaged an excellent 82% gross margin over the last year. Said differently, roughly $81.95 was left to spend on selling, marketing, and R&D for every $100 in revenue.\nThis quarter, Commvault Systems\u2019s gross profit margin was 82%, in line with the same quarter last year. Zooming out, the company\u2019s full-year margin has remained steady over the past 12 months, suggesting its input costs have been stable and it isn\u2019t under pressure to lower prices.\n9. Operating Margin\nCommvault Systems has been an efficient company over the last year. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the software sector, boasting an average operating margin of 7.6%. This result isn\u2019t surprising as its high gross margin gives it a favorable starting point.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Commvault Systems\u2019s operating margin decreased by 1.1 percentage points over the last year. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\nThis quarter, Commvault Systems generated an operating margin profit margin of 8.9%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s cost structure has recently been stable.\n10. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nCommvault Systems has shown robust cash profitability, driven by its attractive business model and cost-effective customer acquisition strategy that enable it to invest in new products and services rather than sales and marketing. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 18% over the last year, quite impressive for a software business.\nCommvault Systems\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $29.8 million in Q2, equivalent to a 10.6% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 8.9 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, prompting us to pay closer attention. Short-term fluctuations typically aren\u2019t a big deal because investment needs can be seasonal, but we\u2019ll be watching to see if the trend extrapolates into future quarters.\nOver the next year, analysts\u2019 consensus estimates show they\u2019re expecting Commvault Systems\u2019s free cash flow margin of 18% for the last 12 months to remain the same.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nBusinesses that maintain a cash surplus face reduced bankruptcy risk.\nCommvault Systems is a profitable, well-capitalized company with $363.2 million of cash and $29.62 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $333.6 million net cash position is 3.9% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from Commvault Systems\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Commvault Systems blew past analysts\u2019 billings, ARR, EPS, and EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad it lifted its full-year revenue guidance. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 4.7% to $171.21 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Commvault?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:26 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Commvault.\nThere are some positives when it comes to Commvault\u2019s fundamentals. Although its revenue growth was weak over the last three years, its growth over the next 12 months is expected to be higher. On top of that, Commvault\u2019s admirable gross margin indicates excellent unit economics, and the company\u2019s splendid ARR growth shows it\u2019s securing more long-term contracts and becoming a more predictable business.\nCommvault\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 6.9x. Looking at the software landscape right now, Commvault trades at a pretty interesting price. For those confident in the business and its management team, this is a good time to invest.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $208.09 on the company (compared to the current share price of $181.04), implying they see 14.9% upside in buying Commvault in the short term."
