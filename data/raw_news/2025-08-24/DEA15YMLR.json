      "text": "Lucky for Life\u00ae is a multi-state draw game. Drawings are held at 9:30 p.m. CT every day. Note: Draw sales end at 8:30 p.m. CT. Five numbered balls are drawn from 1 to 48, and one Lucky Ball number is drawn from 1 to 18. If all your numbers match those that are chosen, you win the top prize, which is $7,000 a week for life. The second-level Lucky for Life\u00ae prize is $25,000 a year for life. Each Lucky for Life\u00ae play is $2.\nLUCKY FOR LIFE\u00ae FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\nPlaying Lucky for Life\u00ae\nQ: Where is Lucky for Life\u00ae drawn?\nA: Lucky for Life\u00ae drawings are held in Des Moines, IA. Previous draws are available to watch online at www.luckyforlife.us.\nQ: Is it possible for the Lucky Ball number to be the same as one of the five white ball numbers?\nA: Yes. The five white ball numbers and the one Lucky Ball number are drawn from separate sets of balls, so the Lucky Ball number could be the same as one of the white ball numbers.\nQ: Which has better odds \u2013 picking my own numbers or requesting a Quick Pick?\nA: Whether you pick your own numbers or have the terminal randomly select numbers for you, the odds of winning are the same.\nPoints for Prizes\u00ae\nQ: Can I enter non-winning Lucky for Life\u00ae tickets in Points for Prizes\u00ae?\nA: Yes. Winning and non-winning numbers from terminal-generated games like Lucky for Life\u00ae are eligible. Visit https://theclub.aslplayerservices.com/pia to enter and add Points for Prizes\u00ae points to your account. Points for Prizes\u00ae codes from terminal-generated games not associated with a draw must be entered within 180 days of purchase date whereas draw related games are based on the last draw date printed on the front of the ticket. Look for the 20 digit Points for Prizes Code.\nPurchasing Tickets\nQ: How much do Lucky for Life\u00ae tickets cost?\nA: Lucky for Life\u00ae tickets cost $2 per play.\nQ: Can I purchase Lucky for Life\u00ae tickets in advance?\nA: To play multiple upcoming draws, request from 2 to 20 Multi Draws either on the playslip or through the retailer. Multi Draws will include the next upcoming draw and be consecutive from that draw. Draws cannot be skipped.\nQ: How late can I purchase Lucky for Life\u00ae tickets on a draw night?\nA: Lucky for Life\u00ae sales are suspended at 8:30 p.m. CT.\nQ: Can a Lucky for Life\u00ae ticket be voided or canceled?\nA: No. Once a Lucky for Life\u00ae ticket has been printed, it cannot be canceled.\nQ: Can I buy Lucky for Life\u00ae tickets online or by mail?\nA: No. Lucky for Life\u00ae tickets must be purchased from a licensed lottery retailer.\nPrizes and Claims\nQ: Do Lucky for Life\u00ae tickets expire?\nA: Prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the draw date on which the prize was won.\nQ: Do I have to match the Lucky for Life\u00ae numbers in the exact order drawn?\nA: No. The order of the five white balls drawn does not matter, but the one Lucky Ball number drawn must match the Lucky Ball number on your ticket.\nQ: Can I redeem a winning Lucky for Life\u00ae ticket in any state?\nA: Although the winning numbers are the same in all Lucky for Life\u00ae states, a ticket must be redeemed in the state in which it was purchased.\nQ: I lost my ticket. Can I claim a prize with a playslip or store receipt?\nA: Lucky for Life\u00ae prizes can only be claimed with a ticket printed from the lottery terminal. Playslips or store receipts will not constitute proof of purchase. Lottery tickets are bearer instruments, meaning the person who presents the ticket for claim will be presumed to be the owner. Always sign the back of any lottery ticket immediately. If you lose a ticket before you sign it, you no longer have valid ownership of the ticket.\nLucky for Life\u00ae Top Prize\nQ: What happens if more than one person wins the Lucky for Life\u00ae top prize?\nA: If there is more than one Lucky for Life\u00ae top prize-winning ticket, the prize may be split equally among the winners. This may apply to multiple prize tiers. See official game rules for more details.\nQ: Why does a top prize winner receive a smaller amount than the advertised prize?\nA: The advertised annuitized Lucky for Life\u00ae top prize is paid less appropriate taxes and withholdings. See official game rules for more details.\nQ: What happens if a prize is not claimed?\nA: If a prize is not claimed within the time frame set by the jurisdiction in which it was won (180 days in Arkansas), the prize funds will be returned to the states based on each state\u2019s proportion of the sales that contributed to the prize.\nQ: What happens if an annuity prize winner dies?\nA: A single Lucky for Life\u00ae top prize winner will be paid for the natural life of that individual. For more than one winner, Lucky for Life\u2019s top prize will be paid for 20 years. Certain limitations may apply. See official game rules for more details.\nFor more information, please visit www.luckyforlife.us."

Prior to or upon shipping, Jackpocket will provide you with an email containing the tracking information for your Winning Ticket.

You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Jackpocket for any claims, losses, expenses and all other liabilities Jackpocket incurs as a result of your failure to comply with these Terms of Service.\nd. Winning Ticket is a Bearer Instrument. Note that your ticket is held in trust by Jackpocket as the courier, and a Ticket is a bearer instrument within the meaning of all applicable law, such that the holder of the ticket is presumed to be the owner of the ticket with all applicable rights in the ticket and its proceeds. Therefore, if you obtain possession of your Winning Ticket, do not lose your Ticket or allow others to possess your Ticket. Jackpocket attempts to mitigate this risk by placing the winning customer's name on the back of the Ticket following the ticket being deemed a Winning Ticket, however Jackpocket cannot be held responsible for any lost or stolen tickets or other tickets that, for whatever reason, are not in the winning customer's possession.\n9.
