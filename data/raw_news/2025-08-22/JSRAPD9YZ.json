  "title": "Arizona doesn't do nearly enough to prevent child abuse",
  "description": "A sole focus on investigating child abuse reports won't keep children safe. Arizona needs a stronger system to support families before crisis occurs.",
  "content": "The deaths of Arizona children Rebekah Baptiste, Emily Pike and Zariah Dodd are unacceptable tragedies. No child should experience abuse, and no family should suffer such loss.\n\nWhen abuse is suspected, it must be reported.\n\nBut focusing only on reporting and investigation does not keep children safe. Nor does over-reporting prevent harm to children. It overwhelms the system, drives unnecessary investigations and erodes trust, making families less likely to seek the help that could prevent crises.\n\nArizona needs a stronger, better-connected system that links families to support before crisis occurs. We know what works: strategies like affordable childcare, accessible health care and Family Resource Centers, which are hubs of support for people raising children.\n\nThese proven solutions not only protect kids, they yield massive economic and social returns.\n\nOur attention shouldn\u2019t all be on improving DCS. Policymakers \u2014 and all of us \u2014 share the responsibility to create conditions that allow families to thrive.\n\nPrevention is possible, and it\u2019s the best way to keep children safe. It not only avoids unimaginable tragedy, but also creates an Arizona that is a great place to be child.\n\nAre the DBacks even a Major League team?\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks, as they have become prone to do, blew another lead to the last-place Colorado Rockies. Without relief pitching, it is a stretch to call them a Major League team.\n\nRegarding The Arizona Republic story, \u201cIn Arizona's 'New Age Capital,' Sedona spiritualists are turning to Trump and the right:\u201d\n\nIs it that difficult to believe?\n\nThe MAGA movement wants smaller government and less interference. It wants to talk with our adversaries and avoid war. It sees big-government establishment people as profiteers making money off \u201cpublic service.\u201d\n\nWhen MAGA took over the House, Senate and White House, today\u2019s rebels were replacing the establishment. Party affiliation is not all that relevant.\n\nSo, the \u201cGolden Age\u201d is not too far removed from the \u201cNew Age.\u201d\n\nBark beetles are kind of like Trump\n\nIn 1998, our family owned a cabin northwest of Payson. One afternoon as we pulled into the driveway, my wife pointed out that the needles at the top of a 60-foot ponderosa pine had turned brown. Three smaller trees were in the same condition.\n\nIn 2016, during his first campaign for president, Donald Trump said that news stories that cast him in a bad light were just fake news. We should only believe what he tells us to believe, he said.\n\nI thought, this guy doesn\u2019t have a chance. The second time around, Mr. Trump said we wouldn\u2019t need to worry about the next election if he won this one. What did that mean?\n\nMAGA gobbled up the U.S. Senate and House. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a get out of jail free card. And, on the president\u2019s orders, masked men started dragging people off city streets.\n\nWhat would be next, I wondered, troops?\n\nBack in 1998, when the tree specialist schooled me on the bark beetle, I asked, what can I do to save the other trees?\n\nHe looked at me sideways and shook his head.\n\nYou don\u2019t know it yet, but those trees are already dead.\n\nNasty WNBA game stunt is all about attitude\n\nThis was unusual for me, but E.J. Montini's column \u201cYou can bet how many sex toys will land on WNBA courts. That\u2019s the problem\u201d brought me over to his side with his insights about the young man who made a stunt out of throwing a sex toy on the court.\n\nHis motive? He thought \u201che would give it a try.\u201d\n\nFortunately, he was arrested, even though his aim was terrible and he didn\u2019t hit the court. Rather, he missed and hit a fan in the head. Talk about missing the broadside of a barn. Apparently, he has some manhood issues.\n\nBut Mr. Montini, I think, missed some points.\n\nThis man, whose name is hidden for some reason, will say or perhaps has said he is sorry. He will look contrite, his eyes looking down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your honor. I didn\u2019t think this through, and I didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone ... blah, blah, blah.\u201d\n\nMore letters: If Arizona still needs a gas pipeline in 2029, we're all cooked\n\nI\u2019m guessing he won\u2019t mean it. And were you to follow him around since his incident and watch him look at his friends, there would be hidden smiles.\n\nThat is the issue. His attitude is probably ingrained, and he won\u2019t change.\n\nThe story of Peoria restaurant owner Kelly Yu (\u201cKelly Yu, Peoria restaurant owner, facing deportation under Trump administration\u201d) says a lot about what is wrong with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies. It also says a lot about what is wrong with us.\n\nKelly Yu did come to this country illegally. But since, she has given birth to a U.S. citizen daughter, got married, started a successful business that employs many people, followed all the rules towards achieving citizenship and gave back to her community.\n\nAnd her reward for all that effort?\n\nSitting in a detention center in Eloy awaiting deportation. That makes no sense.\n\nI don\u2019t think people who have U.S. citizen children should be eligible for deportation unless they commit a serious crime. I also don\u2019t think we should deport people whose contributions to our country outweigh any illegal entry decades ago.\n\nThere needs to be some calculation of the cost of removal. In other words, what are we losing by removing someone from our country and their community?\n\nWith Kelly Yu, it seems like we are losing a lot. A mother, a wife, a taxpayer who employs dozens of other taxpayers, a popular restaurant owner, a community participant.\n\nShe seems like someone we should recruit to be here.\n\nWhat\u2019s on your mind?

      "text": "You can bet how many sex toys will land on WNBA courts. That's the problem | Opinion\nIt's happening because we are living at a time and in a country where our toxic 'bro' culture makes the morons among us feel comfortable doing so.\n- Individuals have thrown sex toys onto the court during WNBA games, prompting discussion about motivations and cultural implications.\n- The act is an attempt to humiliate female athletes and is linked to broader issues of sexism and misogyny in sports.\n- Online betting sites have offered wagers related to the incidents, further highlighting the normalization of such behavior.\nThe idiots who\u2019ve tossed sex toys onto the basketball court during WNBA games will never be able to adequately explain why they did it.\nOr tried to do it.\nOn a few occasions the toy tossers actually came up short. (Feel free to insert perpetrator insult here.)\nThe 18-year-old arrested for having tried to throw a sex toy onto the court during a game between the Phoenix Mercury and the Connecticut Sun \u2014 and who ended up hitting a spectator \u2014 said he saw the stunt talked about on social media and decided to give it a try.\nIn other words, he did it because he could. He did it because he lives at a time and in country where our toxic \u201cbro\u201d culture made him feel comfortable doing so.\nThrowing sex toys is an attempt to humiliate\nAs Shannon Ryan wrote in The Athletic, \u201cHumiliation, often lewd or sexual, has long been used as an attempt to make women feel uncomfortable in sports or diminish their place in this space.\n\u201cIn these recent incidents, it\u2019s a stretch to argue targeting the WNBA wasn\u2019t strategic and intentional. Making a sex toy the focal point of games in a league that has perhaps the most openly gay and queer players doesn\u2019t seem like an accident either.\u201d\nNo, it does not.\nReports also indicate that a group of crypto creeps used the initial incident to try to boost the value of a memecoin, the kind of monetary exchange when an internet meme becomes traded in real online markets.\nIt\u2019s an area of the financial industry that has gotten a big boost from President Donald Trump.\nWNBA calls it 'unacceptable.' That's the wrong word\nWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert calls what\u2019s happening \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Although, \u201cunacceptable\u201d might be the wrong word.\nOne of the ways we learn these days about what is accepted, or not accepted, is if it can be wagered on.\nOnline betting operations have been taking wagers on what has happened at WNBA games. The site Polymarket said that $460,000 was bet on whether another sex toy would be thrown at a WNBA game by Aug. 8.\nAnother site featured a series of proposition bets that included an over/under on how many sex toys would hit the court over the course of the season (7.5) and other equally gross hypotheses.\nThat says a lot about how comfortable we are with sexism and misogyny.\nLuckily, those creeps aren't dealing with Taurasi\nMinnesota Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve said, \u201cThis has been going on for centuries \u2026 The sexualization of women is what\u2019s used to hold women down, and this is no different. This is its latest form, and we should write about it in that way.\u201d\nYeah, we should.\nBut in the end I\u2019d also prefer the counteraction proposed by the now-retired Phoenix Mercury great Diana Taurasi.\nAsked how she would have responded to a sex toy landing on the court while she was playing, Taurasi said, \u201cI would have picked that thing up and thrown it right back at them.\u201d\nReach Montini at ed.montini@arizonarepublic.com.\nLike this column?

      "text": "At least an Arizona senator is asking why kids have died on DCS' watch | Opinion\nBefore Emily, Zariah and Rebekah, there were Anndreah, Liana and Za'Naya. Please, God, let's not go there again.\n- Arizona's Department of Child Safety (DCS), created to replace the inadequate Child Protective Services (CPS), is failing to protect vulnerable children.\n- The recent deaths of three girls, Emily Pike, Zariah Finley Dodd and Rebekah Baptiste, should be our wake-up call.\n- Sen. Carine Werner has launched a task force to investigate and propose solutions.\nIt\u2019s been 11 years now since the state dismantled the woeful Arizona Child Protective Services and in its place created the Arizona Department of Child Safety.\nAfter decades of horror stories and graveyards full of dead kids, it was, I hoped, a new day for vulnerable children in Arizona.\nYes, I still see you, Anndreah and Isaac and 2-year-old China Marie, who endured 15 broken bones over time before finally dying in 1993, just two weeks after a state child-welfare official declared that she was \u201cthriving.\u201d\nThe day when the right of a child to grow up would supersede the right of a lousy parent to get a second or third or fourth chance to screw up.\nDCS failed kids then and is again now\nI still see you, too, TaJuana and Emily and 20-month-old Liana, your broken body wired to a rock and tossed into a canal in 2001 after CPS found no evidence of abuse.\nThe day when a black eye would be cause for prompt and decisive action \u2026 or at least some hard questions asked.\nAnd you, Odessa, 5, and your 3-year-old brother Henry, beaten to death and stuffed down a sewer hole in 1994 after at least six reports to CPS.\nThe day when the agency, tasked with a tough job, would confront its own shortcomings and err on the side of the children they are there to protect.\nSadly, that day has not yet come. Or it came and now, tragically, has gone again.\nNow, there is a new generation of children beyond our help, failed either by DCS or by other agencies and contractors charged with protecting children.\nKids like Emily Pike, 14\nThe San Carlos Apache Tribal Social Services Department placed Emily in a DCS-licensed group home in Mesa in 2023 after she was sexually assaulted by a relative.\nEmily, who had lived all her life in the tiny eastern Arizona town of Peridot, was reportedly home sick and unhappy. But the right hand didn\u2019t talk to the left hand when it might have mattered, and in January she left.\nBecause Emily was in the custody of the tribe, certain reporting requirements aimed at quickly finding out where she might have gone didn\u2019t apply to her.\nPerhaps it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Children who go missing from group homes often are considered runaways. They\u2019ll turn up, or so the thinking seems to go.\nEmily did eventually turn up 18 days later. Her dismembered remains were found in two black garbage bags dumped along a highway near Globe.\nKids like Zariah Finley Dodd, 16\nZariah was 5 when DCS came into her life. She\u2019d been pushing her infant brother down the street in his stroller, knocking on doors and asking for food.\nApparently, she\u2019d been taking care of her half-brother for most of a week after their mother disappeared.\nZariah was placed with a foster family, and for 11 months, she got to be a little girl.\n\u201cI get a bed?\u201d she asked her foster mother that first day, when shown her new home.\nBut the foster mother told The Arizona Republic\u2019s Jose R. Gonzalez that DCS prioritized Zariah\u2019s birth family and moved her out of the home 11 months later.\nShe would spend the next decade bouncing around close to 20 foster homes until finally leaving her final group home on July 4.\nHer body was found the next morning in a west Phoenix park. She\u2019d been shot in the head.\nThe 36-year-old man who had gotten her pregnant and another man await trial in her murder.\nKids like Rebekah Baptiste, 10\nDCS was in and out of Rebekah\u2019s life for years and relatives say her parents lost custody due to drug abuse. But she and her two brothers were returned to their father.\nOver the last year or so, the kids\u2019 school called DCS 12 times with concerns about the Baptiste children.\nThe school\u2019s resource officer visited the family\u2019s Phoenix home in April, to see why Rebekah been absent for several days.\nHe found the child with a black eye.\nPhoenix police contacted DCS that day and four other times beginning in 2018.\nRebekah died on July 30. She\u2019d been beaten, burned, starved.\nTortured, as one doctor put it.\nHer short life must have been a living hell, as records show doctors found extensive evidence of long-term abuse, including missing toenails and burn marks.\nHer father and his girlfriend have been arrested.\nDCS is playing duck and cover again\nDCS is, of course, heartbroken, even as it plays duck and cover.\n\u201cTragically, those who intend to harm children can sometimes evade even the most robust systems designed to protect them,\u201d the agency\u2019s statement said, before vowing to investigate itself a la CPS (which always managed to clear itself of any wrongdoing).\nTo investigate a system so \u201crobust\u201d that it managed to ignore a dozen or more calls for help.\nDCS, again echoing a claim I heard over and over again in the bad old days of CPS, claims the school called only five times over the last year and of those, only one met the legal criteria for an investigation.\nPlease. If a school is repeatedly raising a red flag \u2014 and the police as well \u2014 and that\u2019s not enough to prompt a look-see, then exactly how many calls does it take before a child can get help?\nThat would be a good question for Sen. Carine Werner to ask.\nWhile DCS pays CYA, the Scottsdale Republican has convened a task force to discover what went wrong and how to fix it.\n\u201cThe deaths of Emily Pike, Zariah Dodd and Rebekah Baptiste should be a wake-up call for us all,\u201d she said earlier this month. \u201cThese tragedies make it painfully clear that when our child protection systems \u2014 both state and tribal \u2014 fail, the consequences can be horrific. We cannot allow these failures to repeat.\u201d\nAn Arizona senator is stepping in. Good for her\nShe is right. We simply can\u2019t look away.\nNot again.\nNothing changed over the years at CPS until finally a few dogged lawmakers, with a little help from county prosecutors and others, dug in to the agency and dug out the gruesome details that put far, far too many children into early graves.\nLaws were changed, the agency was remade, the mission was clarified and the pressure was on as the eyes of the state focused steadfastly on the children who were going, going, gone.\nYes, I still see you, Jacob and Jhessye and 22-month-old Za\u2019Naya, who starved to death in 2012 while CPS was supposed to be watching.\nAnd Tyler and Ariana and 5-year-old Brandon, who upon his 2007 death on CPS\u2019s watch had scars on his arms and ankles from being tied up and blisters on his feet from having been immersed in scalding water.\nNow there is Emily and Zariah and Rebekah.\nAnd there is Sen. Werner, hoping to stop the latest sad roll call at three.\nGood for you, Sen. Werner. Good for you.\nReach Roberts at laurie.roberts@arizonarepublic.com.

      "text": "Arizona Diamondbacks blow 5-run lead in loss to Colorado Rockies\nDENVER \u2014 The Arizona Diamondbacks coughed up a five-run lead and lost 10-7 to the Colorado Rockies on Saturday, Aug. 16, at Coors Field.\nDown 7-4, the Rockies scored six runs in the bottom of the eighth inning, most of those against reliever Andrew Hoffman. Hoffman (1-1) was charged with four earned runs allowed on two hits and two walks in one-third of an inning.\n\"Didn't execute, pretty simple,\" Hoffman said after the game. \"Walk two guys, you put yourself in a (tough) situation.\nRockies pinch hitter Kyle Farmer drove in the tying run off Diamondbacks reliever Andrew Saalfrank, then the go-ahead run scored on the play when left fielder Lourdes Gurriel Jr. bobbled the ball in the outfield.\nTyler Freeman then hit a two-run home run off Saalfrank to effectively seal a loss for the Diamondbacks (60-64). Freeman turned and flipped his bat without even watching the ball fly over the left field wall.\nDiamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo noted that the bullpen hadn't had a blowup like Saturday's in some time. Over the previous eight games, the relief crew had posted a 1.88 earned run average.\n\"This is tough to absorb,\" he said. \"It is Coors Field. There's no safe lead. At the end of the day, we've got to pitch and catch, throw strikes and make plays. And we didn't at the most critical time of the game.\"\nAdrian Del Castillo hit a two-run home run, Ketel Marte had two doubles and Gurriel Jr. drove in three runs for the Diamondbacks. Del Castillo drove in three runs on the night with a double and his second home run of the season in the top of the seventh inning.\nStarting pitcher Ryne Nelson turned in 6\u2153 innings of work, allowing four runs on eight hits. He struck out four.\n\"They've got some guys who can swing it and put some tough at-bats together,\" Nelson said of the Rockies. \"Playing here as well is a little bit of a different element. So credit to them.\"\nDiamondbacks fans talk about fandom, state of team\nArizona Diamondbacks fans show up at every major league ballpark across the country to support their team.\nThe Arizona Republic met several this week while on the road covering the Diamondbacks' four-game series against the Colorado Rockies. Here's what they had to say about being fans of the team and the current state of the franchise.\nFirst up was Nogales resident Zarette Heredia, 31, who wore the new purple-and-teal Serpientes City Connect jersey while visiting the National Ballpark Museum, just a few steps away from Coors Field in Denver.\nHeredia said she was sad to see Eugenio Suarez get traded to the Seattle Mariners, and that the team needs to fix its pitching. Her favorite Diamondback is Marte. Heredia hopes for fewer injuries next season and looks forward to getting LHP Corbin Burnes back from surgery rehab.\n\"Everyone has been having bad opinions but I stay optimistic about my DBacks,\" Heredia said. \"I'm pretty glad they're doing well, staying in that (wild card) race.\"\nHeredia's favorite memory as a fan was watching the 2001 World Series as a kid with her grandmother on the Mexico side of Nogales. It's what made her a fan, and she has a Luis Gonzalez jersey.\nHeredia makes the 2\u00bd-hour drive north to Phoenix from Nogales many times to watch the Diamondbacks at Chase Field. She's a partial plan season ticket holder for the first time this year, and has already been to 15 games.\nShe also enjoys watching the Diamondbacks on the road, traveling to Tampa, Miami and Boston to see them play last season and New York this season, and plans her Diamondbacks ventures around work.\nHere are two more Diamondbacks fans, including Matthew Griffith of Paradise Valley, who calls himself a \"10 out of 10\" fan of the team.\nThere were plenty of Diamondbacks fans in the seats at Coors Field on Friday, Aug. 15, many sitting behind the visiting team's dugout along the first base side.\nDBacks to add pitcher for start Aug. 17\nLovullo named the starting pitcher for Sunday, Aug. 17, and it will be RHP Nabil Crismatt, who has joined the team in Denver. A corresponding roster move to add him to the active roster had yet to be made Saturday night.\nCrismatt is a veteran who has pitched for four major league teams, including a one-game stint with the Diamondbacks in 2023. He was signed to a minor league deal last week and made one appearance with Triple-A Reno.\nCrismatt made 19 starts at Triple-A Lehigh Valley this year before being released by the Phillies organization on Aug. 4.\n\"He's able to come into this environment and pitch and put balls over the plate, and that's what we're looking for,\" Lovullo said. \"He's pretty stretched out. He's going to go as far as he can.\"\nNo timetable for return of players on injured list\nLovullo said there is no target date for the return of rehabbing players Gabriel Moreno, Pavin Smith, Ildemaro Vargas and pitcher Ryan Thompson, but Moreno, Smith and Vargas continue to play games at Triple-A Reno.\n\"Sooner rather than later, yeah,\" Lovullo said of Moreno, who is catching and hitting in games. \"He could wind up in the series on Monday (home vs. Cleveland) and he could wind up playing with us after the off day.\"\nThe Diamondbacks' next day off is Aug. 21. Lovullo added that he might not play Marte on Sunday, as the manager feels it's risky to play him four straight days in Colorado.\nA forceful Marte swing late in the game was cause for a little concern, but Marte said he felt OK.\nDiamondbacks at Rockies, Aug. 16, 5:10 p.m., Cox, Ch. 34\nDiamondbacks RHP Ryne Nelson (6-3, 3.46) vs. Rockies RHP Chase Dollander (2-9, 6.35).\nAt Coors Field: Nelson has had a loss and three no-decisions since his most recent win on July 19. In his last start, Nelson allowed five earned runs on seven hits in 5\u2153 innings at Texas. ... He hasn't faced the Rockies this season, but has not fared well against them in the past. In two starts, he's allowed 11 earned runs on 17 hits, though Nelson has a win against them. He has allowed two or fewer earned runs in four of his last five starts.. ... Dollander, 23, made his major league debut in April. He's spent parts of this season at Triple-A Albuquerque and has had a stint on the 15-day injured list with forearm tightness. Dollander gave up one run in 4\u2154 innings at Chase Field back in May, a game the Diamondbacks won 1-0.\nComing up\nSunday, Aug. 17: At Colorado, 12:10 p.m., Diamondbacks RHP Nabil Crismatt (0-0, 0.00) vs. Rockies RHP Antonio Senzatela (4-14, 7.34)\nMonday, Aug. 18: At Chase Field, 6:40 p.m. Diamondbacks RHP Zac Gallen (9-12, 5.31) vs. Guardians RHP Gavin Williams (7-4, 3.38).\nTuesday, Aug. 19: At Chase Field, 6:40 p.m., Diamondbacks LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (5-7, 5.40) vs. Guardians RHP Tanner Bibee (9-9, 4.54).\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Diamondbacks-Rockies: Arizona bullpen can't hold lead in loss"

      "text": "In Arizona's 'New Age Capital,' Sedona spiritualists are turning to Trump and the right\n- Sedona, known for its New Age spirituality, sees a shift toward right-wing ideologies among its residents.\n- Mistrust of institutions and experts, along with a desire for personal sovereignty, fuels this political shift.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine skepticism further solidified this alignment with the right.\nSEDONA \u2015 Three years ago, Shelley Evans submitted garbled documents to the Coconino County Recorder\u2019s Office, demanding $12 million for violations of her constitutionally guaranteed rights, in a tactic experts on right-wing radicalization have called \"paper terrorism.\"\nTwo years ago, officials sued her under a statute that punishes wrongful liens, leaving her on the hook for roughly $55,000, a sum she would later report was roughly equal to her net assets.\nShe tried, in the wake of the verdict, to navigate the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process without a lawyer. She failed.\nNine months later, still seized with indignation and figuring out her financial future, Evans invited her discussion group to come together in meditation.\nThe circle of 10 or so people joined hands.\nThey gave thanks for each other and their weekly \u201cconscious conversation\u201d about the state of the world, this time focused on the promise and perils of artificial intelligence.\nThey breathed together, chests rising and falling, as the room darkened with the setting sun.\nFor a moment they were still.\nAt the end of a winding gravel road in Sedona, Evans has repurposed a yoga studio into the headquarters of Ultimate Light Mission, a spiritual hub \u201cwhere all paths converge in a unified vision.\u201d\nThe Sedona chapter of Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group long chaired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., meets there every few weeks.\nA monthly informational session encourages people to put their money into decentralized cryptocurrency ledgers off the mainstream financial grid, out of reach of the government and regulators.\nThey meditate. They make meals in bulk for local shelters. They train in martial arts.\nKnown for its energy-rich vortex sites, Sedona has become an international destination for New Age spirituality, the mystical, peace-loving, pro-environment scene that attracts those who seek a \u201chigher\u201d state of consciousness.\nThe instinct left many adherents wary of politics altogether, or sympathetic to the moral valences of the American left. For a time, its most prominent political voice was Marianne Williamson, the spiritualist whose left-wing bids for president in 2020 and 2024 called for a \u201cradically humanitarian agenda\u201d and took aim at the \u201cmilitary industrial complex.\u201d\nNow, amid tectonic shifts in national politics and the remaking of U.S. conservatism, Sedona\u2019s hippie ranks are finding a new home on the American right.\nMany spiritualists\u2019 long-held hostility toward policy and science experts, penchant for conspiracy, and appetite for personal \u201csovereignty\u201d leave them with more in common with President Donald Trump than with the bohemian social movements that have captured their attention in the past.\nIn many cases, Trump is the first political figure in decades they have actively followed and believed in.\nThough their lifestyles put them on a cultural fringe, the Sedona mystics are among multitudes of Americans nationwide whose mistrust of institutions are pushing them toward the right. Support for vaccines is reaching historic lows, because of attrition from those who identify with or lean toward the GOP.\nThe Democratic Party, meanwhile, has molded its identity around a staunch defense of political and scientific institutions. A decade after Trump's political ascent, the party has failed to answer the feeling, widespread among Americans, that something is wrong.\nSedona spiritualists are crafting their own explanations.\nFor her part, Evans follows in the tradition of \u201csovereign citizens,\u201d the anti-government movement that the FBI considers \u201ca growing threat to domestic law enforcement.\u201d\nEvans declined to talk to The Arizona Republic, \"pursuant legal advice.\"\nAnita Dalton, a psychic and entrepreneur who owns Sedona\u2019s Center for the New Age, saw Trump in the spiritually minded salespeople she\u2019s followed over the years, whose habitual run-ins with larceny and fraud laws didn\u2019t deter them from aggressive marketing schemes.\nAila Arya Anam, formerly Paula Green, spent her 30s in the feminist Goddess movement, an \u201cearth-based, witchy\u201d culture oriented around veneration of the divine feminine. It was during the pandemic that she realized her long-held skepticism toward vaccines left her with unlikely political allies.\n\"That's when all of a sudden I'm like, 'holy crap,'\" she said. \"I'm aligning with the gun-carrying, cowboy conservative, prepper Arizona population, which I always thought were rednecked and religiously fervent, you know?\n\"I think a lot of alignments, and categorization, are just like: Where do I belong? Who am I? What the hell is happening?\"\nSusannah Crockford, an anthropologist at the University of Exeter, immersed herself in Sedona\u2019s spiritual scene for several years while writing her seminal 2021 book, \"Ripples of the Universe.\" She\u2019s observed an overall shift toward \u201cwhat you might call \u2018right-wing-engaged.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only surprising if you didn\u2019t know what their politics were like before,\u201d Crockford said.\nCrystals discounted for '10% tariff sale'\nIf the claims of the New Age movement \u2014 that the world is fallen and in need of a spiritual awakening, recovering wisdom that is at once ancient and new \u2014 seem far-fetched, a person might come closest to believing them in Sedona, the idyllic city nestled at the foot of red rocks and kept picturesque by a skyrocketing housing market that has priced out all but the very wealthy.\nThe spiritual sector isn\u2019t spared from those economic pressures, Crockford said. Even psychics have to pay rent. In fact, that was a starting point for her research.\nIn Sedona, \u201cspirituality offers a way for people to distance themselves from and critique current political and economic norms in America,\u201d Crockford wrote. \u201cYet they still find themselves monetizing their spiritual practice as a way to both \u2018raise their vibration\u2019 and meet their basic needs.\u201d\nThe way its adherents tell the story, Sedona\u2019s business community initially viewed the New Age scene with skepticism, but gradually warmed to it as it generated a steady flow of tourism and business.\nDalton gives herself credit for being one of the pioneers.\nDalton, whose Center for the New Age's purple mural and signage is one of the first things visitors see driving up State Route 179, grew up in New Jersey. She\u2019s the daughter of an Italian mother who worked in aerospace and an Irish father who worked in a funeral home.\nA single mom early in adulthood, Dalton worked as a hairdresser, took some college classes but didn\u2019t finish her degree, and eventually wound up in California, where she worked in real estate and prided herself as one of the first women to work in car sales. She nursed a spiritual practice while building an upper-middle-class lifestyle on the California coast, keeping a big house in San Diego with a Cadillac in the garage.\nAlong the way, she was inspired by figures who blended spirituality with sales.\nShe was drawn to Terry Cole-Whittaker, the reverend who taught her followers to pursue happiness and prosperity as part of a spiritual path.\nShe lights up talking about the \u201cGlobal Information Network,\u201d the brainchild of Kevin Trudeau, the embattled salesman whose eventual 10-year prison sentence a federal appeals court declined to cut short because of the \u201cflagrant and repetitive nature of his contumacious conduct.\"\nDalton, now in her 70s, has built a durable business selling crystals and other spiritual items, and renting small offices upstairs for $1,100 to $1,600 per month.\nLike everyone in the market, Dalton regards herself as a sincere player in a market otherwise corrupted by hucksters and profit-seekers. She embraces the term \u201cNew Age,\u201d which others in Sedona\u2019s spiritual community spurn as a cheap and demeaning label, according to Crockford. She paid good money, $30,000 in fact, for a bonafide \u201caura camera,\u201d which captures the qualities of the person photographed. (Her own aura photo comes back blue, a sign of her psychic abilities.)\nDalton refers to her own religious outlook with self-deprecation (\u201cthis God thing\u201d) and speaks about her life as a set of coincidences that guided her, without her conscious knowledge, to the right place.\nThe core of New Age spirituality, she said, is, \u201cif it feels like truth, embrace it.\u201d\nShe describes Trump in a similar way. Dalton said she was drawn to him from the moment he came down his golden escalator, for reasons she could not and still cannot quite articulate.\nIt was \u201cjust a feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just know when someone\u2019s speaking the truth, or at least, your truth.\u201d\nIn Dalton\u2019s colorful and bejeweled office, the president\u2019s mugshot is framed next to gray molds of a meditating Buddha figure. On her bookshelf, white lettering stands out from a black spine: MELANIA.\nHer Facebook page is a mix of sarcastic swatdowns of Democrats (\u201cI was fired from my job at USAID today. I worked in the woodchuck department. We were so close to finding out how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood. Now we will probably never know\u201d) to A.I.-generated praise of Trump and his allies (\u201cElon Musk turned an abandoned building into a safe haven for 200 orphans. This young dreamer now has a bed, books, and a future\u2026Thanks to Elon\u2019s kindness\u201d).\nIn April, as Trump\u2019s new tariffs roiled markets and raised fears of an economic downturn, Dalton unfurled a sign in front of her store, in the signature purple color of Sedona psychics\u2019 offices: \u201c10% TARIFF SALE.\u201d\nThe tariffs modestly impacted her business. Several suppliers called saying they couldn\u2019t fulfill orders for things like books, tarot cards, and candles. One of her suppliers, a stained-glass company, went out of business.\nThese were \u201ctchotchkes,\u201d Dalton said, waving a hand.\n\u201cIt was stuff you could live without,\u201d she said. \u201cI psychically know tariffs are a good thing.\u201d\nThe centerpiece of Dalton\u2019s politics is opposing the \u201ccorruption\u201d she says is unfolding in plain sight, which she struggled, when asked, to describe in more detail, but believes can explain recent controversies, such as the media\u2019s handling of former President Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive decline, and even the repeated legal action against Trudeau, the Global Information Network salesman whom she still holds in high regard.\nSome liberal political figures are exempt from her scorn. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, for example, is \u201ctoo left\u201d for her taste. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019s corrupt.\u201d\nSome believed 'disease of uncertain origins' validated conspiracy theories, expert says\nArriving in Sedona in 2012, Crockford, the anthropologist, quickly learned not to bring up politics.\n\u201cThey would just be like, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re all the same. They\u2019re all corrupt,\u2019\u201d she said.\nBroaching the topic was seen as spiritually counterproductive.\n\u201cIf you say something like, \u2018I don\u2019t think like the Democrats,\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t think this Republican policy is very good,\u2019 what you\u2019re doing is lowering your vibration. You\u2019re doing something spiritually damaging: Not just to you, but to everyone around you.\u201d\nThat began to change during the COVID-19 pandemic, when political decisions were felt acutely in everyday life.\n\u201cIt sort of proved all their conspiracy theories correct,\u201d Crockford said. \u201cHere was this disease of uncertain origins.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the government, who they\u2019d always been opposed to for various reasons, was telling them was, \u2018stay inside and then get vaccinated,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cThat explicitly went against how they believe health and immunity work.\u201d\nAlex Young is a professor at Arizona State University who studies settler colonialism. He connected Sedona\u2019s right-wing hippies to conservatives\u2019 longtime interest in Indigeneity, from Barry Goldwater\u2019s famous collection of hundreds of Hopi katsina carvings to \u201cQAnon Shaman\u201d Jake Angeli\u2019s horned hat.\n\u201cThat weird slippage between the Indian-identifying hippie and cowboy conservative is one that\u2019s been with American culture a long time, and one that we\u2019ve seen play out in Yavapai County a lot,\u201d Young said.\nFrom feminist to 'unschooling' advocate\nAnam, the feminist-turned-vaccine skeptic, came to alternative wellness by way of poor health.\nShe studied biomedical research in college and, several years into her first job at a laboratory at UCLA, began feeling sick. She was accident-prone, losing her \u201ccognitive abilities,\u201d and spent a year or two in bed on disability.\nIt was in her 30s that she drifted away from politics, and swapped her thoroughly modern employment for the realm of \u201cholistic\u201d medicine. She began the travels that would one day deposit her in Arizona, and became involved in the Goddess movement of the 1970s and '80s, which venerated the feminine ideal.\nShe spent 11 years in a romantic relationship with a woman before drifting more toward the \u201cNew Age\u201d scene, uncovering repressed sexual trauma from her youth and becoming romantically involved with a man. That\u2019s when she moved to Sedona.\nShe gave birth to her daughter in 1999, and skipped most vaccines.\n\u201cIt was not a political issue at all. It was more an intuitive level, and also an experiential level: Because when I was vaccinated, I went into a coma,\u201d she said, referring to her health episode earlier in life.\nAnam\u2019s earliest political memory is around social justice. As a high schooler, she and her parents, both Democrats, protested the Nevada Test Site for nuclear weapons. She remembers doing a 200-mile walk to Mexico \u201cfor the orphanages.\u201d\nNow, at the age of 65, she's focused on \u201cde-schooling.\u201d The promotional materials for her professional services call for a shift away from \"expert\" knowledge, and a paradigm of \"gaining intelligence in increments, going from novice to specialist,\" toward more intuitive learning and reasoning.\nLike Dalton, the touchstone of her politics is \u201ccorruption.\u201d She was put off by Sedona\u2019s handling of a child care policy issue and believed their process for issuing contracts was rigged in favor of larger companies.\nShe briefly fell in with QAnon, the conspiracy movement that believed Trump was working to expose a cabal of child sex traffickers. But she became disillusioned with the movement, saying in that community, too, were corruption and deceit.\nSo instead she is working with Evans to build community at the Ultimate Light Mission.\nThey are two very different people. Anam has chosen not to participate in the political \"sovereignty\" movement that Evans has embraced. Anam is open and chatty, where Evans, navigating bankruptcy and previously the subject of antagonistic media coverage, refused an in-depth interview, citing \"legal advice.\"\nIn their group conversation, Anam was fearful of artificial intelligence, where Evans saw it as a powerful tool.\nYet, staring down what they consider dark and deeply rooted political forces, they feel united by an ineffable bond. It spurs them to action.\n\u201cShelley and I, we are like yin and yang,\u201d Anam said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re blowing the lid off this, not in a political way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are supporting what really matters: Community, seniors, youth, the environment.\u201d"

      "text": "Arizona doesn't do nearly enough to prevent child abuse | Letters\nArizona needs a better system of support for dysfunctional families that abuse or neglect children. Luckily, we already know what works.\nThe deaths of Arizona children Rebekah Baptiste, Emily Pike and Zariah Dodd are unacceptable tragedies. No child should experience abuse, and no family should suffer such loss.\nWhen abuse is suspected, it must be reported.\nBut focusing only on reporting and investigation does not keep children safe. Nor does over-reporting prevent harm to children. It overwhelms the system, drives unnecessary investigations and erodes trust, making families less likely to seek the help that could prevent crises.\nReal prevention happens earlier.\nArizona needs a stronger, better-connected system that links families to support before crisis occurs. We know what works: strategies like affordable childcare, accessible health care and Family Resource Centers, which are hubs of support for people raising children.\nThese proven solutions not only protect kids, they yield massive economic and social returns.\nOur attention shouldn\u2019t all be on improving DCS. Policymakers \u2014 and all of us \u2014 share the responsibility to create conditions that allow families to thrive.\nPrevention is possible, and it\u2019s the best way to keep children safe. It not only avoids unimaginable tragedy, but also creates an Arizona that is a great place to be child.\nClaire Louge, Phoenix\nAre the DBacks even a Major League team?\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks, as they have become prone to do, blew another lead to the last-place Colorado Rockies. Without relief pitching, it is a stretch to call them a Major League team.\nDonald Wechsler, Peoria\nNo wonder Sedona hippies love MAGA red\nRegarding The Arizona Republic story, \u201cIn Arizona's 'New Age Capital,' Sedona spiritualists are turning to Trump and the right:\u201d\nIs it that difficult to believe?\nThe MAGA movement wants smaller government and less interference. It wants to talk with our adversaries and avoid war. It sees big-government establishment people as profiteers making money off \u201cpublic service.\u201d\nWhen MAGA took over the House, Senate and White House, today\u2019s rebels were replacing the establishment. Party affiliation is not all that relevant.\nSo, the \u201cGolden Age\u201d is not too far removed from the \u201cNew Age.\u201d\nCharles Lopresto, Phoenix\nBark beetles are kind of like Trump\nIn 1998, our family owned a cabin northwest of Payson. One afternoon as we pulled into the driveway, my wife pointed out that the needles at the top of a 60-foot ponderosa pine had turned brown. Three smaller trees were in the same condition.\nI called a tree specialist. Bark beetle, he said.\nWhat, I asked, is a bark beetle?\nIn 2016, during his first campaign for president, Donald Trump said that news stories that cast him in a bad light were just fake news. We should only believe what he tells us to believe, he said.\nI thought, this guy doesn\u2019t have a chance. The second time around, Mr. Trump said we wouldn\u2019t need to worry about the next election if he won this one. What did that mean?\nMAGA gobbled up the U.S. Senate and House. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a get out of jail free card. And, on the president\u2019s orders, masked men started dragging people off city streets.\nWhat would be next, I wondered, troops?\nBack in 1998, when the tree specialist schooled me on the bark beetle, I asked, what can I do to save the other trees?\nHe looked at me sideways and shook his head.\nYou don\u2019t know it yet, but those trees are already dead.\nR. C. Nelson, Tempe\nNasty WNBA game stunt is all about attitude\nThis was unusual for me, but E.J. Montini's column \u201cYou can bet how many sex toys will land on WNBA courts. That\u2019s the problem\u201d brought me over to his side with his insights about the young man who made a stunt out of throwing a sex toy on the court.\nHis motive? He thought \u201che would give it a try.\u201d\nFortunately, he was arrested, even though his aim was terrible and he didn\u2019t hit the court. Rather, he missed and hit a fan in the head. Talk about missing the broadside of a barn. Apparently, he has some manhood issues.\nBut Mr. Montini, I think, missed some points.\nThis man, whose name is hidden for some reason, will say or perhaps has said he is sorry. He will look contrite, his eyes looking down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your honor. I didn\u2019t think this through, and I didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone ... blah, blah, blah.\u201d\nI\u2019m guessing he won\u2019t mean it. And were you to follow him around since his incident and watch him look at his friends, there would be hidden smiles.\nThat is the issue. His attitude is probably ingrained, and he won\u2019t change.\nMark Williams, Phoenix\nThe costs of foolish immigration policy\nThe story of Peoria restaurant owner Kelly Yu (\u201cKelly Yu, Peoria restaurant owner, facing deportation under Trump administration\u201d) says a lot about what is wrong with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies. It also says a lot about what is wrong with us.\nKelly Yu did come to this country illegally. But since, she has given birth to a U.S. citizen daughter, got married, started a successful business that employs many people, followed all the rules towards achieving citizenship and gave back to her community.\nAnd her reward for all that effort?\nSitting in a detention center in Eloy awaiting deportation. That makes no sense.\nI don\u2019t think people who have U.S. citizen children should be eligible for deportation unless they commit a serious crime. I also don\u2019t think we should deport people whose contributions to our country outweigh any illegal entry decades ago.\nThere needs to be some calculation of the cost of removal. In other words, what are we losing by removing someone from our country and their community?\nWith Kelly Yu, it seems like we are losing a lot. A mother, a wife, a taxpayer who employs dozens of other taxpayers, a popular restaurant owner, a community participant.\nShe seems like someone we should recruit to be here.\nDan Peel, Scottsdale\nWhat\u2019s on your mind?
