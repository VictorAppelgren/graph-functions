  "title": "Brands might be cooling on satellite features, and that\u2019s bad news for cheaper Androids",
  "description": "Some brands may be rethinking their satellite communication plans, which could slow its arrival on cheaper Androids.",
  "content": "Satellite communication has been one of the most talked-about phone features in the past couple of years, and it\u2019s no longer just for emergencies. Just this week, our APK teardown showed how Google\u2019s Find Hub is getting ready to let you ping your location over satellite, hinting at a future where this tech is more of an everyday tool than a last resort. All that said, there are wider signs that some phone makers seem to be gradually losing interest in the tech.\n\nAccording to a Weibo post from reliable leaker Digital Chat Station, Chinese OEMs are dialing back their satellite communication ambitions, especially for mid-range and iterative flagship models. According to the post, the feature is now being reserved for the very top memory configurations \u2014 and not even all of those. The tipster also noted that previous flagship models that bundled sat-com with maxed-out 16GB RAM and 1TB storage didn\u2019t sell well and ended up being discontinued.\n\nThat\u2019s not great news if you were hoping to see satellite features trickle down to more affordable Androids. Apple already offers it on the iPhone, and Google looks set to equip the Pixel 10 series with it, but in the Android camp, it\u2019s mostly been a flagship perk, like on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. If Chinese mid-rangers won\u2019t bother, all of the biggest manufacturers have even less reason to add it to more affordable models.\n\nFor now, satellite connectivity is still on the slow climb from niche safety net to genuinely useful feature. Until more brands commit to putting it in phones people buy in big numbers, you\u2019ll still need to shell out flagship money to get it.",

Learn more.\nPixel 10 series FCC filing confirms connectivity features, hints at Samsung modem\nJuly 15, 2025\n- The Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro XL have passed through the FCC website.\n- Both phones apparently have satellite support, and there are hints of a Samsung modem once again.\n- Meanwhile, the Pro version has Thread and UWB support while the standard model misses these features.\nGoogle is expected to launch the Pixel 10 series in the coming weeks, and we\u2019ve already seen a steady stream of leaks. However, the latest leak comes via the company\u2019s own regulatory filings.\nThe Pixel 10 (model number GLBWO, GL066, GK2MP), Pixel 10 Pro (G4QUR), and Pixel 10 Pro XL (GUL82) passed through the FCC website this week, revealing a few details about the phones.\nStarting with the XL model, the FCC filing confirms features like wireless charging, Wi-Fi 6E, Thread support, and UWB. However, we also have evidence that the company is indeed using a Samsung modem. The Pixel 10 Pro\u2019s listing also confirms all of these features and hints at a Samsung modem.\nMeanwhile, the standard Pixel 10 filing mentions connectivity features like wireless charging and Wi-Fi 6E. However, Google\u2019s vanilla phone doesn\u2019t seem to offer Thread or UWB connectivity. We see evidence of a Samsung-made modem here, too.\nAll three Pixel filings also mention satellite functionality, also known as NTN (non-terrestrial network) connectivity. This wouldn\u2019t be a surprise as the Pixel 9 series offers satellite connectivity. Check out the screenshots below.\nThese aren\u2019t the only recent Pixel 10 series leaks. A trusted outlet recently revealed EU pricing for the phones, and it looks like Europeans aren\u2019t getting a price hike this year. Leaked specs also suggest bigger batteries for the standard and XL models.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nAndroid and iPhone satellite connectivity: What is it and what are your options right now?\nFebruary 11, 2025\nWhen the iPhone 14 launched, one of its key talking points was its satellite connectivity. In case of an emergency, the iPhone 14 series could connect to a low-orbit satellite and send an SOS message, even when there is no cell signal on the phone. Android, of course, wouldn\u2019t be left far behind either.\nIn this guide we take a closer look at the current state of iPhone and Android satellite messaging, what devices support it, and more. This is especially important right now for those who are unfortunately impacted by Hurricane Milton, as right now consistent phone communications can be hard to come by in certain parts of the US.\nNot sure how these features work? We have a quick guide on how to send emergency messages and use satellite features for the iPhone 14 or newer, the Pixel 9, and other devices.\nWhat is mobile satellite connectivity and how does it work?\nIt\u2019s important to understand that when we\u2019re talking about mobile satellite connectivity we aren\u2019t talking about satellite phones, sometimes called a satphone. While this is also a type of phone that connects to a telephone network through satellites, this older technology is clunkier, more expensive, and exclusively uses satellite tech for connections. In other words, these types of phones are made for those who travel to extremely remote places as they\u2019ll work just about anywhere.\nAs you can tell, this is unlike our modern-day smartphones, which connect to ground-based cell towers. When you move from one cell to another, your phone switches cell towers to latch onto the closest cell tower. However, your phone will lose signal if a cell tower is not nearby. You will not see any network connection on your phone, you will not receive any network services, you will not be able to receive any calls nor send any messages, and you will not be able to access the internet.\nSo what is mobile satellite connectivity then? In short, it\u2019s the ability for a standard mobile phone to connect to a satellite network in the case of emergency situations.\nSatellite connectivity on modern smartphones\nSatellite phones have historically remained a product that served a very narrow niche. Because of their special connection needs, satellite phones need different connectivity hardware than cell phones.\nSmartphones are gaining satellite connectivity primarily for emergency and SOS communication.\nHowever, cell phones have evolved into smartphones that can do more than connect to a cell network and let you call or send text messages. The tech has evolved enough to the point where some level of satellite connectivity can be added to modern smartphones. For instance, smartphones may not entirely replace dedicated communication units on ocean liners, but individuals can use them for emergency communication and distress signaling. We fantasize about a future where the modern smartphone works equally and seamlessly across cellular and satellite networks.\nFor now, though, most of the available or demoed satellite connectivity options on smartphones focus on SOS messages. In the near future, we can expect to see two-way messaging as well, and some months down the line, we hope to see internet data throughput as well.\nCan my current phone or network connect to a satellite for emergencies?\nWhile there are tons of efforts to bring satellite connectivity to Android users, most of these efforts are far from ready for primetime. Right now you pretty much have few paths if you want to use satellite connectivity on a smartphone: get an iPhone 14 or newer, a Samsung Galaxy S25, or the Google Pixel 9.\nIf you own a device with satellite support, you can turn on and use emergency SOS features now, which will enable Android satellite messaging and other basic emergency functions.\nWhat you need to know about Apple\u2019s Emergency SOS via satellite\n- Works with the iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16 series.\n- Available to use since November 2022 in select regions.\nSatellite communication on smartphones became a topic of conversation thanks to Apple. The iPhone 14 and its siblings were the first set of smartphones widely available in the market that support satellite connectivity, though the feature has since come to the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 families as well.\nApple takes a hardware-centric approach instead of a network-centric approach like T-Mobile. You must have one of the eight iPhone 14 or iPhone 15 devices to access this feature. The feature does not work on older iPhones due to the lack of specialized antennas for satellite communication. So, don\u2019t expect the feature to arrive on older iPhones.\nThe feature was available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and France at launch, but more countries have been added since. These include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland. Note that the feature is free for the first two years, and Apple hasn\u2019t detailed what it will be charging after this period. It has partnered with satellite provider Globalstar for this service.\nSince the feature requires a direct line of sight with satellites, Apple also built a special interface to help users position their devices optimally. To use the feature, you must be in a location without a network signal and dialing for an emergency. The iPhone will then suggest emergency SOS via satellite and forward your text and location to the nearest emergency service. There\u2019s also a ground relay service that will call emergency services if they do not accept texts.\nNote that Apple\u2019s Emergency SOS service is a one-way messaging service and does not support receiving responses to the messages sent out. But since the service went live in November 2022, it is indeed the first service to be actually available to consumers in a mass market product.\nWhat you need to know about the Google Pixel 9\u2019s Satellite SOS\n- The Samsung Exynos 5400 modem in the Google Pixel 9 series powers the phone\u2019s Satellite SOS feature.\n- The Pixel 9 also supports Verizon\u2019s emergency SOS solution.\nSamsung has also joined the race with its Exynos modems. The Exynos 5300 modem was the first example, enabling two-way satellite messaging like its industry peers. Despite featuring in the company\u2019s recent flagships, no Samsung phone currently supports satellite connectivity features.\nHowever, Google rolled out Satellite SOS to its flagship smartphone range with the Pixel 9 series, which uses the newer Exynos 5400 modem. The feature allows users to contact emergency services via Google Messages even without coverage. Like Apple\u2019s implementation, Google offers Satellite SOS to Pixel 9 buyers for free for two years, after which a subscription is required.\nWhat you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S25\u2019s satellite features\n- The Samsung Galaxy S25 on Verizon can use the carrier\u2019s emergency SOS service.\n- The device is also the first to support Snapdragon Satellite, the chipmaker\u2019s standards-based satellite connectivity solution.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 series is the first smartphone line to support Snapdragon Satellite. The service demands the Snapdragon X80 modem, found within the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset used on the Galaxy S25. The modem is also found on the standard 8 Elite; however, as of February 2025, only the current crop of Samsung flagships supports the feature.\nThe smartphone series also supports emergency SOS features via Verizon\u2019s solution. Both Snapdragon Satellite and Verizon\u2019s solutions are detailed below.\nAndroid satellite messaging: current and upcoming carrier options\nWhile there aren\u2019t many other solutions, the good news is that plenty of alternatives are on their way or already here, including several efforts by the three major carriers.\nVerizon\n- Who is partnering to provide service? Skylo might not be as well known as Starlink but this NTN communications company will handle satellite emergency connectivity using its unique firmware-based technology. This is the same provider behind the Pixel 9\u2019s sat features, by the way.\n- When can we expect it? Verizon announced the partnership in August and promises it will launch this fall, though there\u2019s no specific timeframe provided.\n- Will I need a specific phone to use it? No, similar to Starlink you can use any phone but the big difference is that the company doesn\u2019t even require special satellites as it uses existing infrastructure.\n- How much might it cost? There\u2019s no word on costs, though it likely will be included with at least some of the more expensive plans. An optional monthly fee for cheaper plans seems likely though.\nVerizon is one of the only carriers that launched this feature to the public and its emergency SOS service is available to those who own a Google Pixel 9 device or a Samsung Galaxy S25 model. The service will essentially connect to satellites from various providers, and pick the provider with the best signal in a given area.\nOne big difference between Verizon and T-Mobile\u2019s solutions is that the former uses traditional satellites in space, while the latter uses low-earth orbit satellites which provide faster connectivity and better reliability. For basic messaging, this likely won\u2019t have a notable impact, but as satellite technology improves and backup satellite data becomes possible, it will certainly matter more.\nT-Mobile\n- Who is partnering to provide service? Starlink is behind T-Mobile\u2019s effort, which means it should be impressive when it launches, but it also means it has been subject to constant delays, something Starlink kind of has a reputation for.\n- When can we expect it? T-Mobile\u2019s Starlink beta program is currently live and is free for all US users until July 2025. The company hasn\u2019t announced a concrete date for the service\u2019s broader rollout.\n- Will I need a specific phone to use it? No, any existing or upcoming 5G smartphone will play nice with the satellite connectivity as it connects to Starlink\u2019s satellites using cellular technology so a specialized satellite modem isn\u2019t required here. T-Mobile notes that \u201cmost smartphones from the last four years\u201d will work. In February 2025, the company also released a lengthy list of devices that are currently compatible with its Starlink beta program, which includes several older Samsungs, Motorolas, iPhones, and the Pixel 9. Find the full list here.\n- How much might it cost? T-Mobile has not expressly detailed any further pricing information on the plan but said it would aim to bundle it for free on T-Mobile\u2019s most popular plans.\nWhen leaks and rumors pointed towards an imminent satellite connectivity launch on the iPhone 14 series, T-Mobile announced its partnership with SpaceX to provide satellite connectivity on smartphones through Starlink satellites. The highlight of this partnership is that you don\u2019t need a dedicated satellite phone or even satellite connectivity tech in your phone to use it.\nT-Mobile\u2019s Starlink service is currently available in beta for users across the US. The service will be free until July 2025. The carrier hasn\u2019t yet issued a broader rollout timeline, though.\nSpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellites will broadcast a new network on T-Mobile\u2019s 1900MHz mid-band spectrum, so your existing 5G smartphone should be able to connect to it just fine. So when a T-Mobile subscriber does not have a ground cell tower nearby, they can connect to this new network, send SMS, MMS, and use \u201cselect messaging apps.\u201d\nVoice and data connectivity are promised to be added in the future, though it would be wise to keep your expectations grounded. A message could take half an hour to go through, so don\u2019t expect it to replace your 5G plan anytime soon.\nAT&T\n- Who is partnering to provide service? AST SpaceMobile will provide space-based emergency services through a partnership that will extend to at least 2030.\n- When can we expect it? AST launched its first five commercial lowe-earth orbit satellites this summer but there\u2019s likely a lot involved before it\u2019s up and running in any meaningful way. At best case we\u2019d say a mid-to-late 2025 launch would be possible, but even longer isn\u2019t unreasonable considering the network is still in the relatively early stages.\n- Will I need a specific phone to use it? Again, no, you won\u2019t need specific equipment for this solution.\n- How much might it cost? AT&T has yet to talk pricing, though we\u2019d say it will likely be free for basic use on certain plans but with charges for more advanced functions or for cheaper plans that don\u2019t include the feature.\nAT&T is the latest to the satellite race, announcing a partnership with AST SpaceMobile back in May of 2024. While the companies have launched the first five test satellites, it\u2019s pretty clear we are still in the early days here. The fact that the partnership extends to 2030 means we\u2019ll likely see these features hit AT&T in the next few years but there\u2019s no guarantees whether it will stay with AST long-term.\nOther current and upcoming mobile satellite messaging systems\nThere are a few other efforts beyond the carriers.\nSnapdragon Satellite\nTechnically, Snapdragon Satellite in its initial form died almost as soon as it was born. The partnership with satellite provider Iridium faltered in 2023. However, Qualcomm noted that it intended to redevelop Snapdragon Satellite as a standards-based solution.\nThe company has now confirmed that the Samsung Galaxy S25 series is the first commercially available device line to support the solution that enables messaging via narrowband satellite within Android. It also confirmed that the Snapdragon X80 modem powers the solution. Interestingly, while it\u2019s found within the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy on the S25 series, the modem is also present within the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite. This leaves the door open for compatibility with more flagships in 2025.\nQualcomm has not yet issued any details about availability or pricing just yet.\nAndroid Satellite connectivity support\nAndroid 15 extends platform support for satellite connectivity. With the Android 15 Developer Preview 2 release, the platform introduced UI elements that are needed to \u201censure a consistent user experience across the satellite connectivity landscape.\u201d As part of these changes, apps can use APIs that allow them to detect when a device is connected to a satellite, which can give the app more awareness of why full network services are unavailable.\nAndroid 15 also provides support for SMS apps and preloaded RCS apps to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages. This means that satellite connectivity will not be limited to emergency uses only.\nInterstingly, there are clues in the Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2 release which indicates that Google is working on bringing satellite connectivity to Android smartphones, in conjunction with T-Mobile.\nThis is what the Satellite Messaging page within Android 15 could look like:\nThe satellite messaging provider is not immediately clear from the screenshot, but the buttons present on the screen lead to a T-Mobile satellite coverage page, suggesting that T-Mobile could be Android\u2019s satellite messaging provider. In turn, T-Mobile is partnering with SpaceX for satellite-to-phone connectivity.\nAs we can see from the strings and the surfaced screenshot, when you add satellite messaging to your T-Mobile plan, you will be able to send and receive text messages to any account (and not just emergency services) when you are in an area with no cell service. You will need a clear view of the sky, and the connection could be impacted by weather and other structures. When you are in the range of a mobile network again, your phone will disconnect from the satellite and reconnect to cellular services again.\nGoogle has announced satellite connectivity for the Android platform but has not yet revealed details about this T-Mobile centric-partnership. You can force invoke the above screen by invoking the android.settings.SATELLITE_SETTING Intent action in Android 15 Developer Preview 2.\nMediaTek\u2019s Satellite connectivity chips\n- Standalone chips can be used irrespective of the brand of the primary SoC.\n- Motorola Defy 2 / CAT S75, Motorola Satellite Link announced, is available for pre-order in some regions.\nMediaTek first showed off two chipsets that can enable two-way satellite communication on smartphones back in 2022. MediaTek\u2019s approach is unique because both are standalone chipsets based on an open, non-proprietary standard. Hence, they do not require smartphones to have a MediaTek CPU. This lets phone manufacturers add satellite connectivity features to any 4G or 5G smartphone, regardless of its primary SoC.\nWe saw this chip on the Motorola Defy 2/CAT S75 and the Motorola Defy Satellite Link. However, the Bullitt Group behind that product has declared bankruptcy and shut down. The stubs below remain for historical purposes. Unfortunately, we haven\u2019t seen much else from MediaTek but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t bring us more devices with the tech in 2025 and beyond.\nDo I need satellite connectivity on my phone?\nAs we established at the beginning of this article, satellite connectivity has important but admittedly niche and limited uses. Right now, it has constraints, and as consumers, the cost will be one of your primary concerns. Satellite connectivity on your smartphone is not going to be cheap: It either comes as an upfront cost of a new device like the iPhone 16 (which is also only free for two years and could be any price after that), or it will be tied to a subscription model that will charge per message. Unlike what you may be used to paying for SMS, this cost may appear exorbitant.\nBut looking at the use cases, they do appear justified. Remember, emergencies don\u2019t show up with an announcement. You never know when you are in an unfortunate situation where you need to dial an emergency number but have absolutely zero cell network. The probability of such a situation is higher if you frequently visit less-populated areas notorious for bad network reception.\nUltimately, whether you should prioritize satellite connectivity on your smartphone will boil down to you as a consumer. If you don\u2019t see yourself leaving the confines of the city, and all your adventures are on the beaten path, satellite connectivity may have very limited utility for you, if at all. On the other hand, having a device that still allows you to contact emergency services can be priceless if you reside on farmland or have a cabin by the woods.\nIf you live in a remote area, or you often venture off the beaten path, then satellite connectivity is for you.\nWe do expect pricing for the tech to rationalize in the coming years. We also expect the tech to become even more accessible than it already is. If the costs appear prohibitive to you today, they may appear worth it down the line for the simple peace of mind.\nFAQs\nYes, the iPhone 14, 15, and 16 series supports satellite connectivity in 16 regions, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and France. The technology is used to enable Emergency SOS features.\nThe Galaxy S23 series does not support satellite connectivity in any region.\nNo, the Galaxy S24 series does not support satellite connectivity in any region.\nAs of right now, satellite connectivity focuses on providing emergency SOS connections through text messages only. Internet usage is outside the current scope of the technology.\nYes, the Pixel 9 series supports the Satellite SOS feature in the US. It utilizes Samsung\u2019s Exynos 5400 modem.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nHere's how Google Find Hub satellite location sharing is going to work (APK teardown)\nAugust 13, 2025\n- Google announced back in May that the newly renamed Find Hub would be adding support for satellite-based location sharing.\n- That\u2019s still not here yet, but a recent app update reveals text strings that hint at how things will work.\n- Users will be able to share their location once every 15 minutes, with a daily limit on maximum shares.\nSatellite support is changing the rules of the game when it comes to mobile connectivity, and we are still right now only in the early days of its evolution. The first hurdle was getting our phones talking to satellites hundreds of miles up in the sky. But with that nut cracked, arguably a larger challenge remains: finding a way to make everyday satellite communication practical, and not something left relegated to emergency uses. That\u2019s already starting to happen, thanks to services like T-Satellite from T-Mobile, and earlier this year Google shared that we\u2019d soon be using satellites to share our location with friends and family.\nAlongside announcing the rebranding of Find My as the new Find Hub, Google said that it planned to integrate satellite-based location tools. But while that sounded all kinds of promising, it also left us with just a ton of practical questions, and little in the way of insight into how Google might actually be thinking of making this plan a reality.\nSatellite features still aren\u2019t available in the Find Hub \u2014 but we\u2019re getting there. Looking through Google\u2019s new version 3.1.399-3 release of the Find Hub app, we\u2019ve identified a number of text strings that quite clearly reference the upcoming support.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\n<string name=\"connect_to_satellite_subtitle\">Connect to satellite to send a one-time location update</string>\n<string name=\"connect_to_satellite_title\">\"You're offline\"</string>\n<string name=\"error_satellite_update\">Not connected to satellite. Try connecting again to update your location.</string>\n<string name=\"satellite_interstitial_connect_button\">Connect</string>\nWe start with some basic messaging that establishes how satellite connectivity will be integrated with Find Hub. When you\u2019re sharing your location with someone else, the app should support using satellites to send a one-off ping with your location \u2014 this isn\u2019t designed for continuous, real-time tracking, and is more like dropping a pin.\n<string name=\"satellite_interstitial_emergencies\">\"For emergencies: If there's no network, try contacting emergency services first. If your call doesn't connect, you'll see an option to use Satellite SOS. Satellite SOS has no daily limits.\"</string>\n<string name=\"satellite_interstitial_one_time_update\">\"To send a one-time location update: Connect to satellite. You can send an update every 15 minutes, up to %1$d times in a 24-hour period at no charge. While connected to satellite, you won't receive location updates from others.\"</string>\n<string name=\"satellite_interstitial_title\">Connect to satellite to send a location update</string>\nFind Hub\u2019s satellite sharing is not going to be a replacement for actually contacting emergency services when you\u2019re in real trouble, and the app will make clear when your best option is to use Satellite SOS.\nWhile you\u2019ll be limited to sending those single location pings to people you\u2019re sharing with, there\u2019s still some limited support for when you\u2019re on the move, with the app letting you re-send that ping every 15 minutes. There does appear to be a daily limit, but we can\u2019t yet see what that is. Given the bandwidth limitations of this communication method, that restriction sounds pretty reasonable.\nWe can\u2019t say for sure just yet, but it also feels like that ability to update your position every 15 minutes will be a fully manual one, and you\u2019ll have to come back to the app and transmit fresh coordinates.\n<string name=\"satellite_location_update_confirmation_subtitle\">You have %1$d of %2$d location updates available. Next available update: %3$s</string>\n<string name=\"satellite_location_update_confirmation_subtitle_with_relative_day\">You have %1$d of %2$d location updates available. Next available update: %3$s %4$s</string>\n<string name=\"satellite_location_update_confirmation_title\">Location updated over satellite</string>\nThe good news there is that the app should tell you just how many updates you have left to send, and inform you how much longer you\u2019ll need to wait before you can get the next one out.\nRight now we\u2019re just able to make a few inferences based on the new strings we found, but we\u2019re already starting to get a much clearer picture of how this new support is going to work. Sure, the devil\u2019s in the details \u2014 and we\u2019re still very curious about exactly where that daily limit lives \u2014 but even based on this early look it\u2019s sounding like this is coming together in a pretty usable, practical way. It\u2019s not a feature we imagine we\u2019ll be using every day, but when the need arises, we bet we\u2019ll be super glad to have it.\nKeep checking with Android Authority for further updates on what we\u2019re able to learn about Google\u2019s satellite plans for the Fund Hub.\nThank you for being part of our community.

  "argos_summary": "Satellite connectivity is moving from a niche emergency tool to a potential everyday feature, but many Android makers are scaling back its inclusion to only high\u2011end flagship models. Chinese OEMs are limiting satellite support to top\u2011tier configurations, and mid\u2011range devices are unlikely to see the feature soon. Apple already offers satellite SOS on iPhones, Google is adding it to the Pixel 10 series and plans to enable one\u2011time location pings via its Find Hub app, while Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra also supports satellite messaging. Overall, satellite connectivity remains a premium, limited\u2011use feature that most consumers will only encounter on flagship phones.",
