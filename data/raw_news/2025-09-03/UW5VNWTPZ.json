  "content": "is right around the corner, launching September 12. But, if you want to get in on the action now, Gearbox Boss Randy Pitchford says the Borderlands: Moxxi's Mysterious Memento comic is what you should be checking out.\n\nSiren Amara from Borderlands 3 and a returning character in Borderlands 4 is looking to \"reclaim the highs of her former heroics.\" Fortunately, recurring character Moxxi has a gig for her. She needs someone to recover a \"mysterious artefact,\" and who better than a former Vault Hunter?\n\nYou can learn more about the comic on the . If you're not convinced, Pitchford's own words may pique your curiosity. \"FYI - This issue has connections with some plot elements of Borderlands 4,\" he tweets. \"We\u2019ve been baking this cake for a LONG time.\"\n\nBoth Amara and Moxxie are characters in Borderlands 4, so it makes sense this comic would have some sort of connection to the game. Especially since the Dark Horse website states this was \"Created in close collaboration with Gearbox Entertainment.\"\n\nSome of the people working on the comic also contributed to Tiny Tina's Wonderlands: Land of the Giants, colorist Heather Breckel and lettering team Deron Bennet & AndWorld Design, so you know this will be a solid offering.\n\nAs for Borderlands 4 itself, the endgame and post-launch roadmap have been revealed . Once you beat the main campaign, you'll be able to start new characters at level 30, so you can get right into the action without having to grind for ages first.\n\nThere are also DLC coming in the future that will be paid and add new missions, bosses, and Legendary gear \u2013 because if there's one thing a Borderlands game needs, it's lots and lots of loot.\n\nWhile you wait, check out the you can play right now.",

      "text": "Borderlands 4: Everything we know so far\nBorderlands 4 launches on PC and console in a matter of weeks, with the Switch 2 debut coming in October\nBorderlands 4 is coming our way very soon, with it's September release date now fast approaching as we make our way through the tail-end of August. And since it was initially announced last year, we've gotten a much better picture of the new Borderlands game, from the fresh setting, to the Vault Hunters we'll be meeting - like Siren, Vex and the playable melee character Rafa - and much more.\nWith progressions systems that are said to draw inspiration from the inspired by the likes of Wolfenstein and Diablo and even a dash of Baldur's Gate 3 for good measure, Gearbox Boss Randy Pitchford even said \"I think they could charge $200 for Borderlands 4\", because \"you can't find a better value in the world for any type of entertainment\", before adding, \"I wish they'd give it away because then everyone would play it.\"\nFrom the likes of a Borderlands 4 Direct back in April revealed more details about the improved co-op systems, to interviews that speak on how the next game is drawing from some of the best Borderlands games, we've broken down everything you need to know about Borderlands 4 as we approach its release date next month.\nBorderlands 4 release date\nThe Borderlands 4 release date is set for September 12, 2025 for PC, Xbox Series X, and PS5, and will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 a month later on October 3, 2025.\n2K announced the amended release date, which brings the launch forward by 11 days, with Borderlands 4 originally slated to arrive on September 23. The title will launch across all platforms simultaneously, with news coming as part of the February PlayStation State of Play.\nBorderlands 4 trailer\nThe first Borderlands 4 trailer doesn't feature any actual gameplay, but it does set the tone for what Gearbox is trying to capture here. You can watch the teaser above, which showcases a fractured planet under siege from the skies. However, below you can also find the latest trailer for Borderlands 4, which was revealed during The Game Awards 2024.\nWhile this second trailer is also mainly cinematics, it does show some gameplay, with players stalking around different environments and shooting at enemies. We also see some platforming in the teaser, as well as some cool abilities being used to crowd-control targets.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nBorderlands 4 platforms\nBorderlands 4 will launch on PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series X. 2K Games has confirmed that the title will launch on both the Epic Game Store and Steam storefronts.\nWhile Gearbox hasn't confirmed this firmly, it looks like Borderlands 4 won't be on PS4 or Xbox One, as the platforms were missing from the reveal trailer. Future Switch 2 owners will be in for a treat, though, as the next generation Nintendo console was confirmed as one of the Borderlands 4 launch platforms we can expect just a month later in October.\nGearbox boss Randy Pitchford did confirm, though, that there will be a download on Switch 2 regardless of whether or not you buy a physical copy, and it's said to run at 30FPS.\nFirst Borderlands 4 gameplay details\nAlongside a Borderlands 4 gameplay trailer (which you can watch above), we also got an 18 minute long gameplay deep dive from Gearbox that gave us an in-depth look at the looter shooter in action. With members of the development team guiding us through the footage, we get to see how the open zones of Kairos can be freely explored, and you can expect to tuck into a variety of new activities - which you can do solo or with pals. One such activity is known as a Silo, which is a location that houses old tech you can hijack.\nAs you \"assume the role of a legendary Vault Hunter\", you'll be blasting your way through \"hordes of enemies in search of new treasures to loot\", with \"the deepest and most diverse skill trees of any Borderlands title yet\". In an interview with us here at GamesRadar+, senior project producer Anthony Nicholson also detailed that the upcoming entry will play around \"the humor and comedic opportunities we explored in Borderlands 2\".\nGearbox is also aiming to give \"an unprecedented level of expression\" to players, with \"billions of weapons and accessories\" to loot and acquire. And speaking of weapons, the upcoming adventure looks set to do things a little differently in that department, with some changes to guns - namely, that there three new manufacturers, and a \"Licensed parts system\":\n\"With the new Licensed Parts system, you can find guns that incorporate the behaviors and abilities from multiple manufacturers into a single weapon, fueling our wildest loot variety yet,\" a PlayStation blog details. \"In addition, Borderlands 4 reworks our approach to the iconic Legendary guns that have unique effects you won\u2019t find on any other piece of gear.\"\n\"In Borderlands 3, Legendaries dropped too often, devaluing them and making other loot feel less special overall. In our new system, not only do all guns feel great, but now Legendary drops will truly be special events.\"\nGearbox has also said that a principal focus for Borderlands 4 is in the balance of approachability and complexity. \"I think our RPG side of the game is so important,\" says creative director Graeme Timmins. \"Just like our first-person side, where we're always looking to expand and add depth, we're doing that on the RPG side, but we don't want to do that at the cost of complexity.\"\nSpeaking with GamesRadar+, lead writer Taylor Clark also spoke on some of the ways the team have set out to improve movement in Borderlands not unlike how Gearbox improved Borderlands 3's gunplay.\nClark explained that the team wanted to take the same focused approach that the studio had on Borderlands 3's combat overhaul, \"but this time for movement and exploration\". How? Well, Clark says there will be \"less borders, more land\", and \"virtually no loading times\", with the opportunity to do the campaign's main missions \"in pretty much any order\".\nBorderlands 4 setting\nThe Borderlands 4 setting has been confirmed, and it's taking us away from Pandora to a new planet known as Kairos. With our first proper look at the setting during the detailed gameplay deep dive, the PlayStation blog post that followed the showcase also sheds more light on the planet.\nSaid to be \"rife with warring factions, deadly fauna, and desperate inhabitants\", Kairos was kept hidden for thousands of years thanks to an oppressive figure known as the Timekeeper, who controlled the world's residents with \"cybernetic implants called Bolts and a synthetic army of soldiers known as The Order\".\nBut things change when a rogue moon, which was teleported from Pandora at the end of Borderlands 3 by famed Vault Hunter Lilith, pierces the protective veil of the planet and kickstarts a whole lot of chaos that you'll get to be a part of.\nIn a video titled \"Welcome to Kairos\", the team at Gearbox went into more detail about the \"prison planet\" as managing narrative director Lin Joyce put it. When we arrive on the world, Joyce says the residents there are \"hungrier than they've ever been to get off Kairos and fight back against the oppression that they've been living under\" there.\nWhile Pitchford has previously confirmed it's not open-world per se, it is set to be the most open and free Borderlands game to date, and it certainly looks expansive. Said to feature \"seamlessly connected spaces\", the world is made up of four zones that you can explore with \"next to no loading times\". Kairos will also feature a dynamic weather system, with lots of side activities to discover.\nBorderlands 4 Vault Hunters\nGearbox has confirmed that Borderlands 4 will feature four new Vault Hunters, with the studio continuing its tradition of cycling new playable characters into the fold.\n\"We think it's important that we switch it up and not do just rote designs, game to game,\" says Timmins.\nWith a look at some of the new Vault Hunters in action during the deep dive gameplay footage, Gearbox has revealed details about two of the playable characters: Vex the new Siren, who uses supernatural phase energy and is able to conjure minions, and Rafa, an Exo-soldier and former Tediore trooper who uses an experimental exo-suit.\nIn gameplay overview videos dropped by Gearbox, we've gotten to see an extensive look at Vex, as we as a more recent look at Rafa, who's described as a \"battle-ready combat veteran\" who serves as a \"great gateway for FPS players to step into the series.\"\nSome familiar Borderlands faces will also return, including Zane, Moxxi, and Claptrap. We can also expect to meet a lot of new characters in the world of Kairos, with the deep dive gameplay video showing off a few, including a drone known as Echo-4 who will joining us on our adventures. The little robot buddy can hack equipment, scan the environment, and also guide us to objectives in the world.\nBorderlands 4 co-op\nBorderlands 4 co-op support has also been confirmed. The upcoming adventure will feature 4-player online co-op, as well as 2-player split screen couch co-op, so you can get stuck into the core campaign with pals.\nWith cross-play support also included - meaning you can play with others across platforms - a lot of emphasis was put on the improved co-op features coming to the latest entry in a big gameplay deep dive from the team at Gearbox:\n\"Co-op has always been at the heart of Borderlands, and we've put a ton of work into making it better than ever,\" says Nicholson. \"Our improved lobby is just the start. You can also set your own campaign difficulty independently of the rest of the party. This way, everyone can tune the experience to their liking.\"\nIf you get split up during your adventures, Timmins also revealed during the deep dive that you can \"easily fast travel to your friends\", and loot is instanced for each player, so you won't have to fight against each other to bag the goods.\nBorderlands 4 development\nBorderlands 4 is being developed by Gearbox Software, the studio responsible for all mainline games in the franchise. The Gearbox CEO says that Borderlands 4 has been in development for \"several years\" \u2013 the studio's last game was Tiny Tina's Wonderlands in 2022.\nBorderlands 4 will be published by 2K Games \u2013 just as it did with the previous titles. This will, however, be the first Borderlands game to release with Gearbox Software operating as an owned and operated 2K studio \u2013 the company was acquired by Take-Two Interactive in 2024.\nBorderlands 4 has long been teased by both Take-Two and Gearbox. The game appeared on the Linkedin page for a former employee of a Gearbox support studio in 2023, and the publisher then confirmed Borderlands 4 to be in active development back in March 2024.\nRandy Pitchford also started name-dropping the game while trying to get out ahead of the film adaptation \u2013 our Borderlands movie review didn't paint a glowing picture. Still, Pitchford then told GamesRadar+ that \"I'm confident that our fans are going to be very, very happy with the next video game project,\" and the studio is certainly on the right track after the initial big reveal and the many looks since then.\nSpeaking on the series in the leadup to the launch of Borderlands 4, Pitchford also reflected back on genre experiment that was the first game, which was initially expected to come and go. Fast forward many years later, and looter shooter has become a genre of its own, with the franchise still going strong, which Pitchford told us is \"kind of humbling\".\nCan I pre-order Borderlands 4?\nBorderlands 4 is now available to pre-order across all platforms, with Gearbox revealing that there will be three editions of the upcoming looter shooter. Pre-ordering any of the editions will also get you a Gilded Glory Pack pre-order bonus, which includes a Vault Hunter skin, one weapon skin, and an ECHO-4 drone skin.\nThe Standard Edition will come in at $69.99, while the Deluxe Edition - that comes with a Bounty Pack which will grant post-launch DLC packs, as well as additional vehicles, weapons and gear, Vault Hunter cosmetics, and a special Fire hawk's Fury weapon skin - costs $99.99.\nFinally, the Super Deluxe Edition clocks in at $129.99 and will come with the Vault Hunter pack. This includes new story packs, two new map regions, new gear and weapons, more Vault Hunter and ECHO-4 cosmetics, and the Ornate Order Pack which comes more with skins and goodies.\nWhy not check out the upcoming PS5 games and upcoming Xbox Series X games we think you should have on your radar right now.\nI started out writing for the games section of a student-run website as an undergrad, and continued to write about games in my free time during retail and temp jobs for a number of years. Eventually, I earned an MA in magazine journalism at Cardiff University, and soon after got my first official role in the industry as a content editor for Stuff magazine. After writing about all things tech and games-related, I then did a brief stint as a freelancer before I landed my role as a staff writer here at GamesRadar+. Now I get to write features, previews, and reviews, and when I'm not doing that, you can usually find me lost in any one of the Dragon Age or Mass Effect games, tucking into another delightful indie, or drinking far too much tea for my own good.\n- Josh WestEditor-in-Chief, GamesRadar+\n- Emma-Jane BettsManaging Editor, Evergreens\n- Jasmine Gould-WilsonStaff Writer, GamesRadar+\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Borderlands 4 endgame and post-launch roadmap revealed: You can start new characters at level 30 after beating the campaign, there are weekly challenges, and the first story pack is \"cosmic horror\" with \"a bloodier, darker tone\"\nThe first few months of post-launch Borderlands 4 updates include a revamped Ultimate Vault Hunter mode, \"Weekly Wildcard\" missions, and much more\nGearbox has lifted the lid on its plans for Borderlands 4's endgame and post-launch roadmap, and I wasn't expecting there to be so much horror.\nBut before we get into that relatively niche component of the Borderlands 4 roadmap, let's talk about endgame stuff. The big highlight is the \"reimagined\" Ultimate Vault Hunter mode. Previous Borderlands games would make you go through the whole campaign again after beating it the first time in order to access the endgame mode; now, it'll be unlocked right after your first campaign completion, and you'll rank up by running through increasingly difficult levels.\nBetter yet, you can actually start brand new characters at level 30 if you've beaten the story. Having to play through the campaign twice to get to the endgame was a huge barrier in past Borderlands games, so it's good to hear high rank gear will be a lot more accessible in the new game.\nBorderlands 4's endgame will also include \"Weekly Wildcard\" rotating missions that end with a boss fight and guaranteed Legendary drop. Maurice's Black Market Machine is back, sending players around the world looking for gear. All of these activities support online matchmaking too, so you can team up with friends or make new ones while gearing up in the endgame.\nIn terms of post-launch content, the first update is a free \"mini event\" coming in October called Horrors of Kairos, and participating in that will give you a shot at new Legendary weapons, new cosmetics, and a new weather variant.\nNext on the roadmap for 2025 is the first paid Bounty Pack DLC, which'll add new missions, a new boss, new Legendary gear, a bundle of new cosmetics, and a new vehicle. Also releasing before the end of the year is the game's first Invincible boss, a souped-up variant offering new Legendary weapons and another level in the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode to climb.\nStarting off 2026 is another Bounty Pack with more new missions, another new boss, more new Legendary gear, more new cosmetics, and another new vehicle.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nWhat I'm most excited for personally is the first story pack, releasing sometime in early 2026. It's called Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, focusing obviously on Ellie but featuring a \"bloodier, darker tone\". There will be a whole new region of Kairos to explore, the game's first new playable Vault Hunter, new Legendary gear, and hopefully, a scary good story told through new main and side missions.\nAfter Q1 2026 the details are a lot murkier, but Gearbox teases two more Bounty Packs, another story pack, and more Invincible bosses.\nAfter earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side. I got my big break here in 2019 with a freelance news gig, and I was hired on as GamesRadar's west coast Staff Writer in 2021. That means I'm responsible for managing the site's western regional executive branch, AKA my home office, and writing about whatever horror game I'm too afraid to finish.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Randy Pitchford says Borderlands 4 is intended to \"bring new people in\" to the series, and I can only hope it's better at that than the Borderlands movie and its $110 million loss\nBut don't worry - Gearbox wants to \"look after\" old fans too\nBorderlands 4 is fast approaching, and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford says \"it's a perfect entry point\" for anyone who's never played a game from the series before.\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Pitchford says that the devs are aiming for Borderlands 4 to \"take care of the people that have been with us but also bring new people in.\" By the time the new looter shooter releases, it'll have been almost six years to the day since Borderlands 3's launch, so it makes sense that Gearbox would want to cater for the players that never caught up with the series all those years ago. There's past evidence to support this idea, too.\n\"We saw, for example, between Borderlands 2 and 3, that about a third of the people that played Borderlands 3 were new to the franchise,\" explains Pitchford. \"So, we wanted to make sure that we made the game accessible to people that have never played a Borderlands game before, but also make it familiar.\"\nIt's also worth keeping in mind the success \u2013 or rather, lack thereof \u2013 of last year's Borderlands movie adaptation. With a reported $115 million production budget and an extra $30 million on marketing and distribution (thanks, Variety), the worldwide box office revenue of around $33 million (via Box Office Mojo) meant it didn't even come close to breaking even, let alone making a profit. With an estimated loss of around $112 million, it's safe to say that the movie didn't exactly give the franchise a massive boost of new fans Gearbox might have been hoping for, so now it's on Borderlands 4 to do some heavy lifting.\nIn the Rolling Stone interview, Pitchford reiterates that \"if this is your first Borderlands, it's a perfect entry point,\" so it definitely sounds like Gearbox is keen to welcome new players with the latest entry. Given its release across PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and even Switch 2, Borderlands 4 definitely seems well positioned to do that, but for now only time will tell how successful it is.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nI'm GamesRadar+'s Deputy News Editor, working alongside the rest of the news team to deliver cool gaming stories that we love.

      "text": "The 25 best FPS games to play in 2025\nShoot sharp in the best FPS games of all time, from Half-Life to Halo 2\nCounting down through the best FPS games is no easy task. It's one of most expansive genres out there, being a label that can be attached to any game where you pick up a gun and shoot it from a first person perspective. But hunting for quality over quantity is made all the tougher for the sheer plethora of options on the table - which is where this list will come in handy.\nFrom the best Call of Duty games to PvE adventures and a zombie horde shooter, we've gathered the 25 best FPS games out there to hone your aiming skills with before Borderlands 4 lands later in 2025. Being such a sweeping genre, our selection does come with a few caveats. We've focused on spotlighting titles that put gunplay front and center, which means you won't find games like Deathloop and Fallout 4 below \u2013 which, while both being excellent experiences in their own right, have the unfair advantage of incorporating action, adventure, and RPG systems to support their core mechanics. For more of those, you'll want to find our ranking of the best shooter games on the market.\nFor now, though, eyes down for the best FPS games the genre has to offer, no matter your platform of choice!\nThe top 25 best FPS games to play in 2025 are...\n25. Splitgate\nDeveloper: 1047 Games\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X\nA snappy and ultra-slick shooter, Splitgate answers the question: \u201cWhat would happen if Halo and Portal had a baby?\u201d Well, not only would the tyke have a seriously twitchy trigger finger, but it would also behave far better than you would ever think.\nWith an impactful arsenal that matches the Master Chief's armory at its best, Splitgate's frenzied free-to-player multiplayer mayhem always feels satisfying. Yet it's the additions of those portals that add a layer of strategy and bristling chaos to what's already becoming an iconic FPS. With the first Splitgate proving a breakout success in 2019 and Splitgate 2 planning to launch in 2025, there's no better time to polish your portal-sniping skills.\n24. Valorant\nDeveloper: Riot Games\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nValorant is Riot Games' attempt to take CS:GO's competitive FPS crown. It's like a mix of Valve's tactical shooter and Overwatch's over-the-top heroes. It is, at its heart, still a tactical FPS in which positioning is king and every character is dangerously squishy, but each Agent has flashy skills and abilities that can turn the course of a round. If you've not taken some time away, you may be surprised by just how powerful some of these skills have become in the years since launch.\nValorant is more colorful than CS:GO, but the clean visuals prove that the emphasis is on substance over style. The fact it's made the leap to platforms such as PS5 and Xbox are testaments to how much polish Riot put into its design and how balanced its maps and heroes are - and if you're looking for a shooter that demands as much brain as brawn, you'll find few as engaging as Valorant.\n23. Back 4 Blood\nDeveloper: Turtle Rock Studios\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X\nA modern take on Valve's classic Left 4 Dead, Back 4 Blood remains popular with players who want more customization between levels. While solo play only offers bog-standard zombie-slaying thrills, the action is oh-so elevated by a fantastic co-op mode (which we shout out in our Back 4 Blood review) that delivers equal measures of camaraderie and chaos.\nBack 4 Blood's B-Movie charm and smart card system deliver dollops of slapstick and strategy to a game that makes you cherish every last gasp dive to that safe room\u2026 whether you make it there with your spleen intact or not. Although updates on this gory gem have ceased as of 2023, servers remain up, which means this is a particularly good game to dive into with friends who have perhaps rinsed Left 4 Dead a bit too much.\n22. Battlefield 1\nDeveloper: DICE\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One\nBattlefield 1 is a WW1 shooter that showcases a terrifying amount of carnage. It's got all the familiar BF modes that we've grown to love, including Conquest, Rush, and Domination. But this game adds the formidable Operations mode that takes the push and pull of war to new heights. In fact, the game works so well as a multiplayer shooter because of how finely it's balanced - there's no class, weapon, or tactic that gives an unfair advantage over others. Trust us, there's a reason why we gave it such a high score in our Battlefield 1 review!\nThough the Battlefield series has marched on since this entry, post-launch updates turned Battlefield 1 into something of a late bloomer after launch, to the point where it's arguably now better than it's ever been. If you want to mix things up from Battlefield 2042 or simply didn't gel with EA's modern shooter, this is the perfect recommendation for anyone who wants a historical shooter with a little more texture than your usual Call of Duty match.\n21. Dusk\nDeveloper: New Blood Interactive\nPlatform(s): PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4\nPlenty of modern FPS games capture the feeling of playing Quake or Doom for the first time, but Dusk is the smoothest, the fastest, the goriest. It's like the best of the '90s but with a few modern-day twists that make it stand out, like detailed reload animations and inventive level design. Maps are varied and keep you guessing: one minute, you're in a spooky old farm, clearing out barns with a shotgun, the next you're in a science lab that twists back on itself, the walls becoming the floor when you turn your head.\nLike the best old-school shooters, it's simply bloody good fun. Beefy weapons turn enemies into a fine red mist, and you zoom through levels as if on roller skates, only pausing to line up the perfect shot. It's topped off by a metal soundtrack that refuses to let you quit.\n20. Half-Life 2\nDeveloper: Valve\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One\nIt may be old enough to drive and gamble a young Gordon's student loan fees under a bus, yet despite its age, Half-Life 2 still has a touch of G.O.A.T. status. This is an all-time shooter masterpiece. Whether you played it on a cutting-edge rig on a debuting Steam in 2004 or first sampled its City 17 delights courtesy of Valve's brilliant Orange Box bundle, the core of Half-Life 2's greatness remains unblemished.\nIt's a true test of time game that earned a near-perfect score in our Half-Life 2 review. Few other shooters before or since show such a level of masterly pacing. If you haven't played before, we'd recommend checking Half-Life 2 out to see why it was all the rage in its heyday. Plus, the level set in zombie-infested Ravenholme remains one of the best levels to ever take place in an FPS - if you haven't bisected an enemy with flying sawblades, have you ever really lived?\n19. Far Cry 6\nDeveloper: Ubisoft\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X\nIt may not be one of the best Far Cry games in the series, but Far Cry 6 is still a superior shooter. Does it still lean heavily on a lot of well-worn Ubisoft tropes? Of course. Yet look past the dinky dachshund sidekicks named after a Spanish sausage and the typically assured, if samey, stealth, and you'll find an FPS that feels like a much-needed turning point for Far Cry.\nNew additions like the Supremo Backpacks open up creative new avenues for both sneaky and explosive chaos, further enlivening Far Cry's already intoxicating power fantasy. Better yet? With the introduction of freedom fighter Dani \u2013 who you can actually see, listen to, and emote alongside in third-person cutscenes \u2013 Far Cry has finally given us a protagonist who's actually worth rooting for. And all it took was half a dozen entries. When it comes to sandbox shooters, few do madcap spectacle better than this FPS. Check out our Far Cry 6 review for more information!\n18. Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition\nDeveloper: People Can Fly\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch\nNever has a game so intelligent tried so hard to look like an idiot, or been so screamingly funny with it. On Bulletstorm's surface, you'll find a brash, knowing, don't-give-a-fuck attitude, sitting on a layer of the most gloriously creative cursing you've ever heard in a video game. Beneath, you'll find one of the densest, most detailed, widest-branching FPS systems ever devised.\nThe genius of Bulletstorm lies in its Skillshots. Imagine if a new Tony Hawk's game served up tricks but replaced every Ollie and kickflip with increasingly gruesome ways of mangling mutants, and you're pretty much there. Boot a dude in the balls, then kick his head off. Launch some men into orbit with an alt-fire rocket, then pick them out of the sky like they were clay pigeons. Sadly, we'll probably never see such a brash, bright, or commendably crude FPS like this again. Read our five-star Bulletstorm review if you're after more details!\n17. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6\nDeveloper: Treyarch\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S\nWhen it comes to the best Call of Duty games, this is both the latest and (one of the) greatest. As stated in our Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review, 2024's entry to the series boasted a return to form on all fronts. Whether you're craving a surprisingly creative campaign, multiplayer bolstered by the addition of Omnimovement, or the best Zombies mode since 2010's Black Ops, Black Ops 6 is the game to go with.\nThat's the funny thing about Black Ops 6: regardless on what you're in the mood for, it has something for every FPS fan. '90s babies will appreciate the sprinkling of capital-C Culture here - there are needle drops for Faith No More and Nine Inch Nails sprinkled throughout the multiplayer and campaign - but really, it's the movement system and Treyarch's extra-punchy guns that make this one a winner. If you've taken a longer-than-usual break from Call of Duty, Black Ops 6 is the best possible time to pick things back up where you left 'em: two kills off a chopper gunner.\n16. Borderlands 3\nDeveloper: Gearbox\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch\nHow to describe Borderlands 3\u2026 you could say it's the underlying principles of the first and second Borderlands wrapped up in a more pristine shell. Or you could call it World of Warcraft: The First-Person Shooter. With its heavy emphasis on loot, loot, and more loot, Borderlands 3 drowns players in a sea of guns with varying abilities and stats, conveniently color-coded by rarity. The colorful characters break away from the traditional \"fighter, wizard, rogue\" archetypes, and each hero is memorable in their own right.\nThat said, the one snag about the game that we mentioned in our Borderlands 3 review is that it doesn't quite have the character of Borderlands 2. We miss Krieg. Oh, Krieg, you crazy barbarian poet. And none of Borderlands 3's villains fill us with anger the way Handsome Jack did. But in terms of shooting and looting, preferably in co-op, it still stands as the zenith of the Borderlands formula.\n15. PUBG: Battlegrounds\nDeveloper: PUBG Corp\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X\nPUBG is the game that spawned the battle royale craze. Technically, it wasn't the first battle royale game, but it popularized the staples of the genre we all recognize: randomized gear spread out on a big map; a starting plane from which players parachute; and an ever-shrinking play zone. A lot has changed since it first came out, and now it's more polished, with a variety of maps that cater to all play styles, and it's free-to-play at a baseline.\nOn the biggest maps, you might go long stretches without seeing another player, and it's that pacing and the lethality of the realistic bullet physics that set PUBG apart from the crowd. You can play with a squad of friends and experience why this is one of the best multiplayer games around, but it's always those nail-biting, stealthy solo moments that stick with me. And yes, you can technically play PUBG in third-person - but good luck getting that chicken dinner if you're not shooting in first-person.\n14. Counter-Strike 2\nDeveloper: Valve\nPlatform(s): PC, PS3, Xbox One\nDespite changing its name from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Valve's king of shooters remains in top form on Steam. This tactical FPS is as crunchy as ever, with the added benefit of a modern-day visual overhaul, meaning it's a wonderful entry (or re-entry) for taking your shooting skills into a more competitive environment. Although custom servers allow for more casual experiences, the real draw of CS2 is its Terrorists vs. Counter-Terrorists game modes without respawns.\nHere, Counter-Strike's emphasis on paying attention to sounds and communicating with your allies shines. There's nothing like the tension that sits at the beginning of each round, as both teams secretly select their tactics and wait for them to collide with their opponents' own gambit. Each map is meticulously crafted to allow for myriad tactics, and the lovingly modeled guns in your expansive arsenal all have minutiae in their firing rates and recoil. This game sticks with you, and it's hard to see this shooter going anywhere for a long time. Read our Counter-Strike: Global Offensive review for more details!\n13. Wolfenstein 2: New Colossus\nDeveloper: MachineGames\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch\nThis Nazi murder sim is smarter than it sounds. The guns are big, loud, and turn members of the Third Reich into bloody pulps, and the more bullets you pump out, the better. The ability to dual-wield any two weapons also makes New Colossus feel different from other old-school shooters. Most impressive of all is the narrative.\nYou get to know more about the series' broken hero, BJ Blazkowicz, than ever before through an origin story that's not afraid to get dark, and a talented cast somehow manages to pull off a tale that pirouettes between the serious and the absurd. This title is a must-play when it comes to our list of the best FPS games, and we stand by giving it a close-to-perfect score in our Wolfenstein 2: New Colossus review.\n12. I Am Your Beast\nDeveloper: Strange Scaffold\nPlatform(s): PC\nLet's be honest: whether your FPS is meant to be a slow tactical crawl or daft arcade-y, fun, killing every enemy in seconds is a massive flex. I Am Your Beast, an indie shooter from Strange Scaffold, gets this.\nA revenge thriller with the tightly-choreographed action sequences of a feature film, I Am Your Beast is all about making you feel like the strongest, slickest star in any single fight. You'll often be outnumbered, frequently outgunned, but never outmatched: after all, any character capable of clubbing a guard and catching their gun in the same second - yes, you can really do that - deserves their main character status. This may have flown under your radar at launch, but don't let it sneak any further away.\n11. Metro Exodus\nDeveloper: 4A Games\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X\nWe called it the best shooters of 2019 for a reason in our Metro Exodus review. The Metro series is known for blending stealth and shooting in oppressive environments filled with ravenous mutants that want to rip your throat out. Exodus is built from the same DNA, but finds a new level of polish and ambition. From Moscow, you take a train through the Russian wilderness, stopping off in desert towns, snowy tundras, and military bases, each filled with secrets to find and enemies to blow to bits.\nYou conduct missions alone, and venturing from the safety of your party is nerve-wracking. Thankfully, you have an armory of inventive, upgradable weapons to keep you safe, from crossbows to revolvers. Back on the train, you'll get to know the endearing cast, who will make you genuinely care about protagonist Artyom's fate. If you're looking for pure action, Exodus's careful pace might turn you off, but the cross-country travel gives you a constant sense of progress.\n10. Superhot\nDeveloper: SUPERHOT Team\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch\nTime only moves when you move. That's the elevator pitch for Superhot, a cerebral FPS from an independent studio out of Poland, and it's a perfect distillation of what makes Superhot so intoxicating. And all that slow-mo obviously helps, too. Cooler than Keanu in the original Matrix taking the ice bucket challenge, this effortlessly slick FPS is as much a puzzler as it is a shooter.\nWhile the act of pointing and pulling the trigger is simple enough \u2013 it's hard to miss when you're moving slower than a tortoise in treacle \u2013 the order you take enemies out is an entirely trickier issue. Many levels must be completed with Swiss watch-levels of precision, and killing a dude at the wrong time can make the whole slow-motion house of bullet-strewn cards tumble. That's the central appeal of Superhot: it's an FPS that's as clever as it is cool. Check out our Superhot review for more information on this gem.\n9. Apex Legends\nDeveloper: Respawn Entertainment\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Andriod, IOS, Nintendo Switch\nThe battle royale for those who want to go faster. Your movement is as important as your aim in Apex Legends: you can parkour across roofs, shimmy up ledges, and slide down hills, scrabbling for positional advantage. The character classes and their abilities make Respawn's shooter feel unique in the genre. One hero can see trails of enemy footsteps, another creates portals, and another can clone themselves to bamboozle their opponents.\nIn a squad of three, which is how it was designed to be played, you can combine these abilities inventively to outfox enemy teams. The two maps are bright and varied, with plenty of ways to help you take the high ground, and Respawn is constantly tweaking the formula with new weapons and heroes. If you haven't played it since the early wave of enthusiasm, it's time to return. In our Apex Legends review, we gave the game a massive five-star rating, so yeah, it's top-tier.\n8. Black Mesa\nDeveloper: Crowbar Collective\nPlatform(s): PC\nIt's what you get when you take one of the most beloved shooters of all time, Half-Life, revamp the entire disastrous ending and add prettier visuals. Black Mesa is fan-made (and Valve-approved), but you wouldn't know it: every room is crafted with the kind of care you don't see from many AAA teams. This is more than just a remake of a classic \u2013 it's a complete overhaul that brings one of the greatest shooters ever and one of the greatest protagonists, Gordon Freeman, into the modern era.\nEverything you love about Half-Life remains. You'll shoot headcrab zombies, alien monsters, and human soldiers with an array of weapons, from a beefy shotgun to the prototype energy Gluon Gun, which melts enemies in seconds. But it's the new additions that stand out. In the original Half-Life, the Xen locale was lifeless. Here, it's bursting with color, and every craggy rock and bizarre clump of plants is rebuilt from scratch. It's far bigger and feels like a completely different game. Half-Life is finally whole.\n7. Titanfall 2\nDeveloper: Respawn Entertainment\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One\nTitanfall 2 is an undisputed high-ranker when it comes to the best FPS games. The weightlessness that comes with perfectly mastered wall-running makes you feel like you're doing some sort of deadly ballet, letting you sail past your foes at impossible speeds, catching them unawares. The unforgettable BT-7274 and unbridled creativity dominate Titanfall 2's campaign, whether it involves you switching between decades in the blink of an eye, walking through a moment frozen in time, or simply ripping other Titans apart when you step into titanic bot boots of BT-7274.\nRewarding you for using the environment to your advantage, you can feel the moment when you start thinking differently, realizing the possibilities a map offers. The physics-twisting Quake-like mechanics of its multiplayer mode strengthen an already sensational shooter package. But it's that remarkable campaign that makes Titanfall 2 such an enduring shooter. Let's cross BT's colossal droid digits so that we eventually see a Titanfall 3. In the meantime, you can read our Titanfall 2 review for a deeper look at this classic.\n6. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege\nDeveloper: Ubisoft\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\nRainbow Six Siege has quietly become one of the best Tom Clancy games around, combining the intensity and replayability of Counter-Strike with the unique abilities and personality of Overwatch. But the real star of Siege is the impressive destructibility of your environment: walls and ceilings can all be destroyed, so you need to smartly choose which flanks to cover and which walls to reinforce, lest someone blast through them with sizzling thermite.\nYou and your squadmates choose from a variety of highly skilled Operators, each with their own specialties that can complement each other for a rock-solid team comp, though your propensity for sneaking and aiming a gun are what matter most. As mentioned in our Rainbow Six: Siege review, every round becomes a tactical, incredibly tense game of cat-and-mouse, as one team protects an objective while their opponents try to scout out danger and survive a breach.\n5. Halo: The Master Chief Collection\nDeveloper: 343 Industries\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X\nThis is the ultimate serialized tale of John 117 and the go-to choice for players looking to find all the best Halo games in one place. Halo: The Master Chief Collection is all but unrecognizable from the Spartan car crash that launched in 2014. After years of server fixes, technical tweaks, and graphical upgrades, this is now the definite way to experience golden era Halo.\nWhether experiencing the best second level in all of the shooters in the original Combat Evolved or blasting buddies in PvP on Halo 3's all-time classic Guardian map at a blistering 120 frames per second on an Xbox Series X, Halo has rarely felt more essential. We're tickled (Needler) pink Chief got the redemption act he deserves. Is cramming a bunch of games into one entry cheating? Sure, but if you read our Halo: The Master Chief Collection review, you'll understand why we had to bend the rules in this case.\n4. Half-Life: Alyx\nDeveloper: Valve\nPlatform(s): PC\nIf VR headsets were issued at birth, there's a chance Half-Life: Alyx would be our favorite FPS of all time. Sadly, the barrier for entry to enjoy this virtual reality wonder at its very best is loftier than the off switch on a Strider. Even if you merely 'settle' for experiencing this perfectly paced, incredibly atmospheric shooter on a Meta Quest rather than Valve's painfully expensive Index, you're still looking at dropping a huge chunk of change for a ten-hour game.\nAnd yet, the absolute highest praise we can heap on Alyx? We'd seriously consider paying the price of a PS5 or Xbox Series X to play this one sensational shooter. Not only is it one of the best VR games on the market, but the shooting controls make you feel like you are the star of your own action movie. Check out our Half-Life Alyx review for more detailed information on this modern staple.\n3. Doom Eternal\nDeveloper: id Software\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch\nThough we didn't exactly shower Doom Eternal with praise fresh out the gate, in retrospect, this really is at the pinnacle of the FPS genre. This is everything that the genre is about, distilled into one glorious roar. It's also a remarkably elegant experience in motion, especially for a game that makes you garrote a demon every 17 seconds. Like Mario 64 or Mirror's Edge, Eternal feels flawless when you tap into its joyous rhythm.\nEvery gun feels perfectly tuned, each level impeccably paced, while every monster dragged screaming from the depths of Hell has clearly been designed to coax just the right measure of aggression out of the Doom Slayer. Amazingly, it's brilliant on pretty much every modern platform, too. Whether you're playing on an OG Xbox One, ripping Cacodemon eyes out at 120 frames per second on a cutting-edge PC, or yanking spines on the impressively assured Switch port, Doom Eternal kicks ass whatever your choice of format. Read our Doom Eternal review next- though we have changed our mind about it since!\n2. Call of Duty: Warzone 2\nDeveloper: Infinite Ward, Raven Software\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X\nArguably, the best of the best battle royale games. For years, three games had a stranglehold on the genre: Fortnite, PUBG: Battlegrounds, and Apex Legends. But Call of Duty: Warzone has blown it wide open by twisting every element of the genre into something that feels exciting but accessible. The new stuff: when you die, you get one shot to respawn by taking on another dead foe in a 1v1 fight. You get cash from completing contracts spread across the map, hunting down enemies, searching for chests, or defending an area.\nThen there are the old, comforting bits: the ever-shrinking play zone, a flawless \u201cping\u201d system to flag items for your teammates, and vehicles to transport you to distant circles. It's like the greatest hits of the genre so far, all backed by Call of Duty's tried and tested low-recoil gunplay. You can play it solo, but jumping in with friends in Duos, Trios, or even the chaotic four-soldier squad mode is where the real Warzone fun is found. For a deeper dive into this iconic shooter, read our Warzone 2 review.\n1. Destiny 2\nDeveloper: Bungie\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\nNo one expected Destiny 2 to be as good as it is. And we really, really love this game, if you couldn't tell already by our five-star Destiny 2 review. Instantly making the first game look like a set of prototypes, this title improves in every area. Actually, scratch that. It evolves, taking the seed of the first game's MMOFPS idea and building a whole new, entirely richer, deeper, and broader experience around it. But that is only the start.\nWith a simplified, streamlined leveling system running through every one of Destiny 2's vastly expanded activities - from story-driven side-quests to multi-part Exotic Questlines, to treasure hunting and tactically reworked Crucible PvP \u2013 every single thing you want to do, however, you want to play, will push you forward. And then there's the far more freeform approach to load-outs, further energized by more creative and expressive weapon design. Even better, with the dawn of Destiny 2 New Light, you can access a lot of the action for free, while regular die-hards can pay for The Witch Queen: the best Destiny expansion ever.\nAfter more hits?

      "text": "A Claptrap volume slider is just the start, Borderlands 4 boss Randy Pitchford says there are \"so many things we are holding back from everyone until launch. So. Many. Things\"\nSo many things\nGearbox CEO Randy Pitchford is tweeting again, and this time, it's to tell us that there's plenty more to come in Borderlands 4 that we haven't seen yet.\nWe've all been chomping at the bit to learn as much as we can about the upcoming looter shooter, but don't worry, there will be more to come once we actually get our hands on the game.\n\"So many things we are holding back from everyone until launch,\" Pitchford tweets. \"So. Many. Things.\" This is in response to a fan replying to a tweet of his, hoping there will be some secrets left for launch.\nSo many things we are holding back from everyone until launch. So. Many. Things.July 2, 2025\nThe tweet they're replying to is one of Pitchford's remarks about coverage of Claptrap's volume slider, a new option coming to Borderlands 4 that you can use to shut the robot's trap if you find him too annoying.\nNarrative director Sam Winkler says they \"wrote some lines just for this feature, and it includes maybe the dumbest, most niche reference to a certain terrible accent in a certain classic immersive sim,\" so be sure to try it out when you play.\nThat's not all Pitchford has been asking on Twitter lately, either. Pitchford recently asked, \"Would you pre-order Borderlands 4 on you [sic] favorite platform if you knew that would influence exclusivity decisions?\" He claims \"suits\" are considering offering exclusives on Steam and the Epic Game Store, but only 2.7% of respondents claim they'd buy it on Epic's storefront.

  "argos_summary": "Borderlands 4\u2019s CEO Randy Pitchford is teasing a new comic, \"Borderlands: Moxxi's Mysterious Memento,\" which ties into the game\u2019s story, and has been promoting it as a key pre\u2011launch hook. The comic, created with Gearbox, follows Siren Amara and Moxxi on a quest for a mysterious artefact, and Pitchford hints that it contains plot elements that will surface in the game. He also highlighted that the comic was developed in close collaboration with Gearbox and that it will be available before the game\u2019s September 12 release. Pitchford\u2019s tweets suggest that the comic is part of a broader strategy to build anticipation and provide fans with additional lore leading up to the launch.\"}",
