  "description": "Extension delays migration but increases risk",
  "content": "Microsoft\u2019s decision to extend security updates for Windows 10 offers welcome breathing room for businesses still navigating complex migration paths. The move aligns with the tech giant\u2019s long-standing pattern of accommodating the slower pace of enterprise IT change, giving organizations time to budget, plan and maintain operational continuity.\n\nFor many IT teams, this extension helps manage short-term risk and avoid disruption, particularly for those still reliant on existing infrastructure or specialist applications. But while this reprieve buys time, it does also delay the inevitable, potentially compounding the challenge.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen with previous extensions, each delay risks the loss of critical internal knowledge, as the people and vendors who originally managed these systems move on.\n\nOver time, what could have been a straightforward application and data migration becomes a complex, costly rescue mission. The longer businesses wait, the more they risk accumulating technical debt, becoming dependent on expensive external partners and missing out on innovation. As such, organizations must treat the extension as a final window to take action before the real cliff edge arrives.\n\nHere I explore the pros and cons of the recent Windows 10 security update extension and what considerations businesses should be contemplating over the forthcoming months.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious. An extension provides extended breathing room and gives organizations more time to plan and execute a migration strategy without immediate pressure. Concurrently, this reduces short-term risk, as continued security updates help mitigate vulnerabilities while businesses remain on Windows 10.\n\nThis provides operational continuity and avoids any disruption for businesses still dependent on existing, well-established applications or IT infrastructure.\n\nMore broadly, the extension offers budget flexibility. IT departments can spread out migration costs over a longer period, which can help with financial planning, especially in a climate of ongoing budget pressures.\n\nIt also provides alignment with past practices, keeping consistent with Microsoft\u2019s historical approach of offering extended support to accommodate slow-moving enterprise migrations.\n\nThe cons (and the real risks)\n\nAn extension may provide breathing room, but this also creates a false sense of security. More time can encourage complacency, delaying necessary upgrades and strategic planning.\n\nEven more importantly, it can contribute to a loss of internal knowledge. As time passes, key personnel with migration experience may leave, and vendor support may disappear - this makes future transitions harder and riskier.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, while short-term savings might be gained, there can be increased long-term costs. Maintaining older infrastructure often becomes more expensive than upgrading it, especially when emergency migrations are needed.\n\nCrucially, delays mean companies accumulate technical debt; by not performing migrations, organizations can end up with a backlog of compatibility issues, unsupported applications and outdated hardware.\n\nThe combination of losing internal knowledge and maintaining unsupported systems means businesses can become increasingly reliant on expensive external partners to manage complex migrations and increases the chance of vendor lock-in and dependency.\n\nUltimately, staying on older systems can prevent organizations from leveraging new features, performance improvements, and security enhancements in Windows 11 or alternative operating systems.\n\nThe issue with deadlines and extension periods is that they signify an eventual point of completion. In this case, a completed migration project. While they are of course necessary for encouraging organizations to update their Windows applications, they also create the mindset that the process is then a done deal.\n\nBut technology quickly evolves and IT infrastructure requires continuous modernization. Having this mentality also avoids companies delaying projects when extensions are provided.\n\nAt the same time, existing Windows applications can be critical to operations and not modernizing them before the deadline will bring serious risks. So, how can organizations maintain operational continuity but also modernize over the coming months?\n\nThe \u2018Rs\u2019 approach \u2013 including AWS\u2019 \u20187Rs\u2019 and Gartner\u2019s \u20185Rs\u2019 \u2013 presents several strategies. This industry standard process is used by cloud providers and encompasses different ways for companies to carry out migrations for unsupported applications. \u2018Retiring\u2019, for instance, involves identifying applications that are no longer useful and can be turned off. Each method has its purpose for various contexts.\n\nBut large IT estates can be too unique or complex to use such methods alone. In these cases, external cloud specialists can provide companies with vendor-neutral platforms that allow them to maintain their existing Windows 10 applications but redeploy them onto managed operating systems or cloud environments.\n\nThis means applications remain fully operational and secure but can continue to receive security patches, support and software updates. It acts as a smarter alternative to complex migration strategies or the costly redevelopment of applications.\n\nThis extension is not a solution, but a grace period. It gives IT teams more time to manage short-term risk. But all an extension really does is delay the same situation repeating itself.\n\nTime and time again we have seen this occurrence take place: a business delays its migration for a year, and then another year, and then - all of a sudden - Microsoft stops the extension of the extension.\n\nThe pattern often ends with a scramble when the final deadline hits - by which time the cost, complexity and risk have all increased, internal knowledge to migrate quickly and safely has disappeared, and vendors no longer exist.\n\nSo while there are pros to the extension, the cons present very real risks - and they emphasize why businesses need to adopt a mindset of continuous modernization.\n\nThe technology and providers are available to help companies maintain their existing Windows 10 applications but move them onto supported operating environments.\n\nIn the coming months, rather than delaying the inevitable scramble, IT teams can build ongoing modernization.\n\nWe've featured the best IT management tools.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best small business app of 2025\nAndroid and iOS apps for business\nWe list the best small business apps, to make it simple and easy to manage your business, whether you're working from home, the office, or on the go.\nSmall business owners know the need to remain agile and efficient. Mobile devices almost certainly play an everyday role, but choosing the best apps for them can be tricky.\nThis is especially as you will only want to have one type of office software on your phone or tablet and not have to transfer documents between different apps just to be read them on different devices.\nAdditionally, your time will be at a premium, so you'll need a good range of apps to cover the most important eventualities. It doesn't matter if we're talking about calendar apps to networking apps, and a whole host of free cloud apps.\nIn this guide, we've focused on the most useful applications for small to medium businesses. All of these offer important functionality while also delivering on value for money.\nHere then are what we think are the best small business apps currently available.\nHubSpot is designed to help you build a frictionless customer experience. It brings all communication channels - from email inboxes, live chat, forms, and Facebook messenger - together into one place and enriches client data with its CRM tool.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nWe've also highlighted the best web hosting services for small businesses.\nThe best small business apps of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest small business office app\nReasons to buy\nThere are many different office software platforms, but despite fierce competition on price and features, Microsoft's Office 365, recently re-branded as Microsoft 365, remains the leading suite and must-buy for small business, and ranks as our best small business software.\nYou may remember the days when Microsoft Office was something you bought as a software package and installed on your PC. While that still remains possible, there are now app versions for Android and iOS, so you can use Microsoft 365 on Android and Apple devices.\nMicrosoft 365 includes the 3 big office software apps you're going to need: Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. OneDrive is also available for online backups as part of the part and worth using, even if you already use another cloud provider such as Google Drive or Drop Box - keeping your data safe is key and there's no harm in having multiple backup options.\nThen there are the other software applications included in Microsoft 365, such as Outlook (online version), and for PC use only there are also Publisher and Access. Microsoft Teams is also bundled in, though you can download and use this as a standalone product anyway.\nAs mentioned previously, there are alternatives to Microsoft Office, but the simple fact is that they are not so good: features tend to be limited, and there can be problems converting key office files to alternative formats, which you absolutely do not need the stress of dealing with when running your own business.\nThere are a number of different editions available, depending on whether you need to buy a license for just yourself, or also a package for staff. For enterprise users there additional corporate service and management options.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nBest small business phone app\nReasons to buy\nRingCentral MVP is our preferred choice when it comes to the best business phone system. It's not just that it comes with a lot of features and possibilities, but also pricing can be very reasonable, too.\nWhat you get is a cloud-based phone system that is built around business services, so it's perfectly fine to use it on any device with a browser, whether a Windows PC, or Apple iPad, or Android smartphone.\nBasic plans include call management and phone system administration, as well as phone rental options for conference phones and even desks. However, it's the pricing tiers above this where RingCentral MVP really comes into its own with a comprehensive set of features that should be integral to any modern phone service.\nRingCentral also provides Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) as well as Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS), meaning that it can provide the enterprise experience for even small businesses.\nOn top of this, RingCentral can also deliver a Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS), which means access to a developer network which allows you to use APIs to truly customize and integrate your phone system with other software you use.\nOverall, though, which the cheaper plan probably delivers enough to satisfy the smallest businesses, it will be mid-sized and larger that will probably get the most from the incredible wealth of features that RingCentral MVP can provide.\nRead our full RingCentral MVP review.\nBest small business accounting app\nReasons to buy\nFreshBooks is a popular cloud-based accounting service designed specifically for small business owners, and ranks top of our list of best accounting software for small business.\nThe package has plenty of features \u2013 invoicing, expense tracking, time tracking, a host of business reports, even an option to take credit card payments \u2013 but a straightforward interface aimed at non-accountants ensures you'll be up-and-running right away.\nDespite the simplicity, there's real depth here. You can bill in any currency, save time by setting up recurring invoices, allow customers to pay via credit card by checking a box, and even automatically bill their credit card to keep life simple for everyone.\nIf you need more power, the system integrates with many other services, including PayPal, MailChimp, Basecamp, WordPress, Gusto, Zendesk and more.\nManagement hassles are kept to a minimum. You're able to access and use the system from your desktop or its free iOS and Android apps, and because it's a cloud-based system there's no need to worry about backups. If this sounds appealing, you can try FreshBooks for 30 days without using a credit card.\nThe basic plan gives you invoices, estimates, time tracking, expenses, plus the ability to accept online credit card payments and import expenses from your bank account, but only covers you for a limited number of clients. Paid plans increase this, while also adding the ability to send proposals, and saves you time by providing recurring invoices and the option to automatically send payment reminders.\nRead our full FreshBooks review.\nBest small business antivirus app\nReasons to buy\nAvast Business Antivirus is an excellent business endpoint security software suite, giving you various tools such as antivirus, Firewall, email protection, anti-spam and the ability to sandbox applications for complete security. Avast Business Antivirus Pro (as opposed to the standard Avast Business Antivirus) also includes Sharepoint and Exchange protection, as well as a number of tools for your servers, and ranks top of our best business antivirus.\nThe AV protection you get is generally rated as good by independent testing, with Avast's engine blocking 99.7 per cent of threats in AV-Comparative's Real-World Protection report.\nThe free version of this security package has long been considered one of the best, but If value for money and simplicity are key factors, Avast Business Antivirus could be a sensible choice.\nRead our full Avast Business Antivirus Pro Plus review.\nOur EXCLUSIVE Avast business antivirus deal\nAvast Business Antivirus Pro Plus | From $59.99 $48.74 (\u00a340.19 \u00a332.66)\nThis is Avast's biggest and best business antivirus. That means the usual standard of protection, with a tonne more bells and whistles. If you want to be confident that your office infrastructure is as safe as possible, then hit that 'View Deal' button (or click here if you're in the UK).\nBest small business online payments app\nReasons to buy\nPayPal has become the ubiquitous payment portal for many online businesses due to the simple reason that it\u2019s so easy to use, and ranks as our top pick for best credit card processing service.\nPayPal has made integration into payment gateways simple for major e-commerce platforms, often requiring little more than a couple of clicks and an email address \u2013 often the most complex part of setting up PayPal processing is copying and pasting a supplied API key to get started.\nThere are no monthly fees for the small business product, Web Payments Standard, with transaction fees dependent on sales volume. Although many shopping carts are built to accommodate PayPal from scratch, it can even be used as a standalone service for taking individual payments from clients, just by pasting a payment button code into an email. Subscription payments are also available by default.\nPayPal also offers additional features to grow into, such as taking in-store payments through a card reader. With no hidden costs or monthly charges, PayPal is one of the most accessible options for startups and small businesses.\nRead our full Paypal review.\nBest small business sales and marketing app\nReasons to buy\nHubspot is a platform that provides a range of tools for content management, sales and marketing, and social media advertising. Hubspot goes way beyond simply setting up a website and editing its content, as much as delivering a wide-ranging toolkit to help improve conversions, and ranks as our top pick for best content marketing tools as well as features in our best CRM software.\nIt does this by offering options for split testing, content hosting, communications within a sales team and with customers, along with goals and targets that can be tracked using Hubspot's analytics software.\nThere are also a number of additional integrations available, not least Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365.\nAll in all, Hubspot probably isn't the best at any individual feature that it offers, but the comprehensive set that it does offer makes it a clear market leader, and the best at what it does.\nEven better, there's a free tier for trying out Hubspot.\nRead our full HubSpot CRM review.\nBest small business project management app\nReasons to buy\nAsana is a project management solution you may have heard of \u2013 even if you haven\u2019t used the service in the past. While it offers a ton of handy features to boost productivity, there\u2019s a bigger emphasis placed on tracking, and ranks as our best project management software.\nThe app lets you create to-do lists and reminders so you always meet deadlines, plus you can add due dates, colleagues, instructions to tasks, and comment on items. You can even share images from other apps (like Google Drive) directly to Asana. And more importantly, you can actually track everything you and your colleagues work on in a bid to ensure the project is running smoothly and to schedule.\nIf you\u2019re concerned with who is working on certain projects, then you can bring up a list of teams and individuals, and there\u2019s also a search functionality so you can find completed tasks easily.\nAsana offers a free Basic tier, with limited functionality and dashboards. Step up to the Premium tier, and you get unlimited usage with no team member limit, and more functionality including the new timeline feature as well as custom fields.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest small business cloud storage app\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIDrive offers continuous syncing of your files, even those on network drives, and ranks top of our best cloud storage solutions. The web interface supports sharing files by email, Facebook and Twitter. Cautious or click-happy users will be pleased to hear that files deleted from your computer are not automatically deleted from the server, so there's less danger of removing something important by accident. Up to 30 previous versions of all files backed to your account are retained.\nAnother thing to note is that IT admins have access to IDrive Thin Client application, which allows them to backup/restore, manage settings, and more for all their connected computers via a centralized dashboard.\nFor photos, you have a neat facial recognition feature that helps you to automatically organize them as well as syncing them across all your linked devices. IDrive also offers IDrive Express which sends you a physical hard disk drive if you lose all your data, allowing for the swift restoration of all your backed up files. That applies to the newly introduced disk image backup feature.\nA business version exists and offers priority support, single sign-on as well as unlimited users and server backup. Furthermore, IDrive Cloud, an enterprise-class cloud object storage is also available.\nRead our full IDrive review.\niDrive 5TB plan for just $3.98\nBig files can quickly fill up your local hard drive and slow down your computer, so why not use a cloud storage provider like iDrive to save them online instead so you\u2019ll have more room for your next big project.\nWe've also featured the best business smartphones.\nBest small business app FAQs\nWhich small business apps is best for you?\nWhen deciding which small business apps to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes free platforms may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, free and budget software options can sometimes prove limited when it comes to the variety of tools available, while higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require.\nHow we tested the best small business apps\nTo test for the best small business apps we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

The result is the list of the best five such services that we\u2019ve compiled.\nWe've also featured the best virtual machine software.\nThe best IT infrastructure management service of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest IT infrastructure management service for incident management\n1. PagerDuty\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPagerDuty is an IT infrastructure management platform catering primarily to incident management. It offers an effective real-time alerting and monitoring system for all your IT hardware and software components. You can receive automatic alerts via SMS or push notifications each time a component goes down. You can also receive alerts via email; you'll provide the mobile phone numbers or email addresses to contact when problems occur.\nPagerDuty allows you to design an automatic response for IT incidents using a no-code builder. As we\u2019ve mentioned, you can provide contact information for alerts in case of specific incidents. For example, if a server goes down, you can send alerts to the team in charge of that specific server. If it\u2019s networking equipment, you can send alerts to the relevant team. You can set up all these instructions from your PagerDuty dashboard.\nThe main drawback we observed with PagerDuty is its cluttered user interface. Many customers complain about the interface being confusing to navigate and set up, although they frequently commend PagerDuty\u2019s effective incident management system.\nBest IT infrastructure management service for analytics\n2. Datadog\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDatadog is a popular infrastructure management platform. It\u2019s an excellent tool for monitoring servers, applications, databases, or any other IT component that needs monitoring.\nDatadog gives you deep visibility into your infrastructure; you can monitor important metrics from a central dashboard.

This platform has an intuitive interface that makes it enjoyable to use. The main drawback is that Datadog is a famously expensive tool; pricing starts from $15 monthly per host.\nBest IT infrastructure management service for IT automation\n3. ConnectWise\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nConnectWise is a well-known IT remote management platform. This platform is famous for its IT automation features; it comes with pre-loaded scripts to automate many important IT tasks, e.g., software updates. Automation reduces your IT staff\u2019s workload and frees up time for them to focus on more important tasks.\nConnectWise supports automatic asset recovery, so you can always track and detect any device connected to your IT network. This feature helps you monitor every device to ensure it's functioning as usual. It also makes it easy to detect any intruding device and eliminate it from your network.\nConnectWise provides an effective incident response management solution. A good thing about this platform is that you can contact external cybersecurity analysts to help you investigate any breaches, although this doesn't come cheap. You'll get formal analysis reports and 30 days of post-incident monitoring to prevent the problem from happening again.\nConnectWise doesn\u2019t have standard pricing; you\u2019ll have to contact the sales team for a quote. This platform is known to be expensive, which makes it suitable for large organizations with equally large IT budgets.\nBest IT infrastructure management service for ease-of-use\n4. New Relic\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNew Relic is best known as a platform for monitoring websites and mobile applications. But it also offers an infrastructure monitoring service that\u2019s easy to use.\nA good thing about New Relic is that it offers a free albeit limited plan. This free plan lets you collect up to 100 GB of data each month and only supports one account. If you surpass 100 GB on this plan, you'll have to pay $0.30 for each extra GB monthly. You can also add new accounts for between $49 and $99 monthly.\nNew Relic allows you to monitor your entire IT infrastructure from a central dashboard. You can keep tabs on all your hosts, containers, and virtual machines and track performance metrics for each one. You can visualize the relationships and dependencies between different IT components so that you can detect the root cause of any issues faster.\nThis platform has integrations with popular cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. It helps you optimize the performance and billing of all your cloud resources. Unfortunately, New Relic doesn\u2019t offer an on-premise solution.\nBest free IT infrastructure management tools\n5. Spiceworks\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSpiceworks is best known as an online community where IT professionals collaborate and seek help from each other and is also a marketplace for IT products. This platform offers a free network monitoring tool for its user base. The tool isn\u2019t as sophisticated as other rivals on this list, but it does its job well.\nYou can use Spiceworks' software to monitor critical web applications and services. You'll get an alert any time your web platform goes down so that you can quickly fix it.\nThe Spiceworks dashboard is easy to install and integrate with your web service. This platform has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate.\nSpiceworks offers additional free IT tools, including a Help Desk solution to manage support tickets, an Inventory solution to scan devices connected to your network, and a tool to track IT contracts. Spiceworks offers direct support to free users, which is a notable advantage. However, it doesn\u2019t offer as many infrastructure management features as you\u2019ll get with the other services on this list.\nWe've also featured the best cloud orchestration services.\nBest IT infrastructure management service FAQs\nHow to choose an IT infrastructure management service\nCost\nPricing is the first thing to consider when choosing any platform. Different IT infrastructure management services have different costs, and you need to pick one that suits your budget. Pricing usually depends on how many devices your organization operates and its custom technical infrastructure.\nYou should estimate beforehand what you expect to pay and ensure it\u2019s a price you can afford in the long term. Always read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs, e.g., extra support costs as some software vendors charge.\nCustomer support\nCustomer service is another critical aspect of any software platform. You need a platform with a good reputation in this consideration. This way, you can always seek help from knowledgeable support personnel when an inevitable bug or glitch arises. You should also have access to detailed documentation that you can consult when facing any issues.\nEase of use\nYou need a tool that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. It should have an intuitive interface that your IT staff can easily work around. Any platform that\u2019s challenging to use is bound to cause frustration and potentially costly mistakes.\nEssential features of an IT Infrastructure Management service\n1. Real-Time Monitoring\nYour management service should allow you to monitor every IT component in real time. You should be able to look at the state of every device connected to your network from a central dashboard. This way, you can easily identify which device is having any issues, e.g., a server that has gone down or a route that\u2019s not resolving to the internet.\nYou should also be able to receive alerts and notifications when specific issues occur. For example, the platform can automatically ping your mobile phone when a critical server is down.\n2. Automation\nThe platform should enable you to automate some of your important IT maintenance tasks. For example, you should be able to automatically deploy software updates for every server or PC connected to your network. Similarly, you should be able to adjust server loads according to customer demand; this feature ensures your infrastructure is always ready to deliver when there\u2019s a traffic spike.\n3. Integration\nThe platform should facilitate seamless integration between your IT and workplace collaboration tools. For example, you can integrate it with Slack so that you\u2019ll receive an alert on the app when a critical component is down. Third-party integrations make infrastructure management easier for your IT staff.\nMore IT infrastructure management services\nThe best IT infrastructure management services make it simple and easy to manage and administrate IT tasks without compromising security.\nThis is important, because managing your IT infrastructure can be a challenge. Servers, cloud services, and business applications- working with them as an integrated whole can be complicated, and made worse if you inevitably have legacy software systems running as well.\nThen there are infrastructure-specific needs such as APM tools, DevOps, SecOps, as well as general ITSM tools, and CMMS software.\nHowever, there are solutions available that can map your full IT infrastructure to the cloud, allowing you to monitor everything from a single dashboard. This can display everything from the different OS, software versions, and storage use, as well as provide malware protection as part of endpoint security and even monitor energy consumption and costs.\nMore importantly, a good infrastructure management solution (IMS) will allow you to pinpoint bottlenecks through network monitoring, allowing you to zoom into any code causing errors, allowing you to identify workarounds and solutions. Usually alerts can also be provided in the event of any technical failure, allowing you to react quickly via push notifications, SMS, email, or even automated calls.\nIt doesn't stop there - why have your IMS work as a standalone? Often integrations are available to enhance team communications, collaboration, and even work with the best CRM software platforms so that you can ensure everyone in the business cycle affected by an issue can be kept updated, and notified once a solution is in place.\nHow we tested the best IT infrastructure management service\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service. We also analyze whether there are collaboration features for multiple users, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best data migration tool of 2025\nTransfer your data securely\nThe best data migration tools help manage backing up data across hard disk (HDDs) or solid state drives (SSDs). If needed, some of these support passive periodic synchronisation - so you can leave it to do its own thing once you've set it up.\nThese tools will come in handy if you've got a new business laptop and need to transfer all of the data from your old one to the new one, or you've want to make a backup to a new external hard drive.\nData disruption is all to common nowadays, so its always a good idea to have a plan for swapping over. This list is just for data migration though, so if you need help with the best cloud backup software solutions recommendations, then we have a list for you too.\nNote that we'll only be exploring apps and services that migrate data in this list \u2013 we won't be including any of the that lack data migration functionality, nor will we be covering solutions that only clone disks to a file without actually migrating the data.\nReader offer: 20% off any Acronis True Image license\nAcronis offers all-in-one protection, combining anti-malware, antivirus, and backup solutions. It's your one-stop shop for safeguarding valuable data and fortifying your cyber defenses. Use code TECHRADAR20 for an exclusive 20% off.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nWe've also listed the best data recovery software.\nThe best data migration tools of 2025 in full:\nBest data migration tool overall\n1. Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAcronis Cyber Protect Home Office, formerly known as Acronis True Image, is a software suite that will do everything from backing up folders and files to replicating local backups in the cloud.\nWhen it comes to data migration, the software offers Active Disk Learning, a feature that creates an exact replica of a Windows or Mac system while the operating system is in use, removing the need to stop what you are doing and reboot the machine in order to migrate data.\nThis makes transferring your digital life to another disk as easy as it gets - from configuration files all the way up to an entire operating system - which we love.\nWhat we liked less is that licencing additional machines will cost extra, regardless of the price tier that you opt for. Additional security features, such as automatic backups, malware and identity theft protection, plus cloud backup, are also locked behind additional pricing tiers.\nWe've previously spotted limited time offers offering 50% off all plans, so Acronis is absolutely one to watch.\nRead our full Acronis Cyber Protect review.\nBest data migration tool for partitions\n2. Minitool Partition Wizard Free\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUsed by tens of millions of people, MiniTool Partition Wizard mainly offers partition-related support.\nMinitool Partition Wizard supports migrating data from every version of Windows starting with XP, with supported file systems including FAT 12/16/32, exFAT, NTSF and Ext2/3/4.\nUnfortunately, the oldest version of Windows that it will actually run on is 7. Even that is arguably ancient at this point, but true legacy support would be appreciated.\nFunctionality of the free version is basic. For example, a Migrate OS to SSD function, sure to optimise performance as you'll no longer be dependent on a mechanical drive, will require, at minimum, a $59 annual Pro subscription, or a $159 Pro version offering 'lifetime upgrades, data recovery, and a 5 PC licence'.\nOn the face of it, this sounds fair, and free software serving as an ad for a paid upgrade, or shareware, is nothing new.\nHowever, MiniTool partition wizard takes pricing tiers to a new level, offering, on top of the Pro version, a Pro Premium subscription, on top of Pro Platinum and Enterprise subscriptions, on top of Pro Ultimate, Server and Technician lifetime licences. Good grief.\nWhile these plans are largely constant in terms of feature sets, the rub here is the amount of licences provided, and whether free upgrades to the software are included. We highly recommend consulting Minitool's own comparison spreadsheet (!) to check which plan meets your needs.\nRead our full MiniTool Partition Wizard review.\nBest advanced data migration tool\n3. Paragon Hard Disk Manager\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nParagon Hard Disk Manager covers the full range of disk duties, including disk cloning of the entire drive, and advanced activities such as cloning by the partition, and can even resize the partition while copying it, or copy a hard drive to another with a dissimilar sector size.\nIt also features some cool, additional features, such as being able to create a virtual clone of your PC to a USB drive, that can then run portably from another PC, or creating recovery media to be able to boot a non bootable PC with the included Recovery Media Builder.\nIt may not be the best option for everyday users, but software from a respected developer that simply does it all (albeit at a fairly pricey but one-off fee of $79.95 for the Home version) sounds pretty great on our end.\nDo note, however, that for business use , you'll need another version of the software called 'Business Workstation'. Licences for it only cover one computer instead of the Home version's three, while being priced at $99.\nRead our full Paragon Hard Disk Manager review.\nBest one-click solution data migration tool\n4. EaseUS Todo PCTrans Free\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEaseUS's PCTrans Free software offers a one-click solution to automatically migrate files from one computer to another without data loss. It supports files belonging to several popular application suites, including: Microsoft Office; Photoshop; Adobe software; QuickBooks; Google Chrome; Firefox and more.\nAs always, the free version is essentially an advertisement for the 'Pro' version. The free version only allows for migration of 2GB of data and 5 programs: practically nothing in this day and age. Thankfully, however, Todo PCTrans has a fairly simple price-tier model that doesn't carve up features or licence terms.\nThere's a monthly plan ($49.95), a yearly plan ($59.95) and a lifetime purchase option ($69.95). All purchases are for one license that covers two machines, and purport to offer the same feature sets and access to live chat / email support.\nWe think that's very fair, especially compared to some of the other data migration products we've reviewed, and even those we recommend.\nWhat we like less is that EaseUS hide temporary flash deals for their software within their website. Not only is this an intrusive practice that plays on a user's fear of missing out, but it makes it hard to recommend buying the software at the given price.\nBy just sticking around on the website for a while, you can get a far better deal, which sticks in our craw a bit. For example, we spotted a 1-month plan for $39.95, or $59.95 for a lifetime purchase.\nRead our full EaseUS Todo PCTrans Professional review.\nBest data migration tool for app transfer\n5. Laplink PCmover Ultimate\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe only data migration tool recommended by Microsoft and Intel, companies that happen to have collaborated on the software, Laplink PCmover makes it easy to transfer apps, files and settings between two PCs.\nDesigned with ease of use in mind, simply install the software on both PCs, click a few buttons, and everything will transfer across in a matter of hours.\nIf you get stuck, you can connect with one of Laplink's PC migration experts, who are available 24 hours a day, for help; though that's only once you've bought a software license.\nAlternatively, you can opt to be shipped a physical copy of PCmover - very much a rarity these days - that includes a high-speed transfer cable and additional free SafeErase software.\nWhat we really loved about this software is its cost: a one off payment of around $60 / \u00a355 / AU$90: that's also a rare proposition in the era of software-as-a-service (SaaS).\nAlso consider these data migration tools\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nA free app for Android users, Samsung Smart Switch is the best data migration solution for transferring data between smartphones that are running Google's mobile OS. It's cross-platform, so it doesn't matter which Android device you own, and you have the option of transferring data wirelessly or with the use of a USB cable.\nWindows 10 Accelerator from Ivanti will prove a huge time-saver for those that deploy anywhere up to thousands of machines. The software takes a snapshot of user profiles and local files from older Windows installations to port them across to a modern ones. Everything is maintained - from personalization choices such as desktop wallpaper to applications, to folder and file structures - meaning users can continue exactly where they left off.\nZinstall will help you to transfer all of your programs, documents, music, pictures, emails and more to a new computer. Compatible with every combination of Windows version ranging from XP to Windows 10, Zinstall is designed with simplicity in mind. Once your old and new machines are connected to the internet, simply run it, choose what you want to transfer, and the application does the rest.\nAOMEI Backupper Standard makes it easy to transfer to a desktop PC or laptop, and is offered as a free version with reduced functionality. It lets you clone a smaller hard disk drive to a larger HDD for a disk upgrade, or you can clone a HDD to an SSD for better performance. Its other features include the choice of backing up entire HDDs, SSDs or specified partitions as duplications.\nWe've also listed the best data loss prevention services.\nBest data migration tools FAQs\nWhat are data migration tools?\nData migration tools are pretty self explanatory, but essentially, they help you move your information over from one device to the next.\nFrom shrinking HDDs to fit on SSDs to cloning and transferring operating systems wholesale, data migration tools can remove the need to set up an entire machine again in different ways, which anyone who has had to upgrade their work laptop will know, is a fair hassle.\nWhich data migration tool is best for you?\nThe best way to find the data migration software for you is to break them down: compare the features you absolutely need with those offered by each data migration tool.\nSome software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your data migration tool.\nHow we tested the best data migration tools\nTo test for the best data migration tools we first set up an account with the relevant software platform. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used with different files and folders, from different devices, in different situations. The aim was to push each data migration platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "It only took four years, but Windows 11 is now the most popular desktop OS - and time is running out for Windows 10\nThe support deadline for Windows 10 is close now - but there isn't the same sense of urgency to upgrade that there once was\n- Windows 11 has finally overtaken Windows 10 for market share\n- 52% of those using Microsoft's desktop operating systems are now on Windows 11\n- That's a hefty swing of almost 10% away from Windows 10\nAt long last, Windows 11 is present on more PCs globally than Windows 10, at least according to one set of figures from an analytics firm.\nStatCounter provided fresh statistics for July which show that Windows 11 has accelerated to account for 52% of all Windows versions worldwide, leaving Windows 10 in its wake on 44.59%.\nThat's quite a shift from the previous month where Windows 10 remained just in the lead on 48.76% with Windows 11 on 47.98%. So, Windows 11 was not far off a full percentage point behind in June, but is now in the lead by 7.4%, a swing of near 10%.\nCould this be the start of a mass exodus of Windows 10 stalwarts fleeing for the shores of Windows 11? Well, that can't be ruled out, and it's clear that time is running short when it comes to the looming deadline for the end of support for Windows 10, which is October 2025 - which is only three months away now.\nHowever, I'm not convinced that there will be a stampede of migrators, because while I've argued in the past that you should be making the upgrade to Windows 11 early - assuming you can (due to your PC's spec) - there's no longer quite the same sense of urgency in this matter.\nWhy not? Let's go over that next.\nAnalysis: Support and scrapheaps\nSomething changed with Windows 10's extended support program for consumers recently, and it's worth recapping in case you missed it. Microsoft decided to offer an alternative to the $30 fee that was previously required to get an extra year of security updates for Windows 10 (through to October 2026).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSo, instead of stumping up that cash, you can now elect to have the Windows Backup app sync all your PC's settings to the cloud. If you allow that to happen - via signing in with a Microsoft Account - then you can get the extra year of all-important security updates at no cost. This gives you a lot more breathing space to work out what you might want to do next, which is great for those who can't upgrade to Windows 11 due to its loftier system requirements (or those who simply refuse).\nOf course, 'free' is not usually completely free, and the cost here, as it were, is allowing your settings to be synced. Due to this, some online commenters have accused Microsoft of almost a kind of 'blackmail' in terms of getting access to your data. However, I should note that the wording of Microsoft's offer is important here, and you're not syncing all your personal data to OneDrive or anything - all you have to sync are your Windows settings.\nAnd having those settings synced should help in the future, too, if you want to make the transition to Windows 11 (or the following version of Windows) at a later date on a new PC. Microsoft's hope, it seems, is this will make that transition easier, and so folks are therefore more likely to tread that path.\nI don't think there's any underlying motive from Microsoft here to get its claws into your personal data as some are suggesting, so in my book, this all seems fair enough. If you're not convinced, however, that's equally fair - you don't have to take Microsoft up on this option. You can pay instead (or redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points, if you have them, which is another alternative), or just go ahead and switch from Windows 10 come its End of Life in October 2025.\nWhatever you do, don't stay on Windows 10 without security updates - never mind worrying about Microsoft's nose potentially being in your data, a hacker could really make your life a misery by compromising your PC due to an unpatched vulnerability because your system doesn't have security updates.\nTaking a broader perspective, I've half-convinced myself that Microsoft may even offer more than a year of additional support to consumers (in the same way it treats businesses).\nMainly because this new Windows Backup-related offer has come in at the last minute, largely I suspect to assuage some of the fears of the 'towering scrapheap of Windows 10 PCs' activists who are (rightly) concerned about the environmental impact of Microsoft's Windows 11 system requirements. (Those that prevent a lot of would-be upgraders from moving to the newer OS, due to having an older CPU, or the lack of a specific security feature, TPM 2.0).\nAnd so I don't think it's unimaginable that Microsoft might offer a second year of extended support for consumers, and I very firmly believe the company should do so. We shall see, but for now, with an extra year of support on the table for free (effectively), there's no need to rush to abandon Windows 10 for many folks. Not unless your trust in Microsoft is particularly low, or you don't have a Microsoft account and don't want to sign up for one (to sync your settings).\nThere are, of course, other options aside from Windows - the main one being a switch to Linux. Of course, in that case, you need to be prepared to leave Microsoft's ecosystem and put up with some of the limitations that one of the best Linux distros will come with (mainly around compatible software, particularly PC games).\nMeanwhile, we can expect further spikes in adoption for Windows 11 in the near future, although perhaps not to the same extent that some people might expect, given those extra choices Microsoft has just introduced.\nYou might also like...\n- No, Windows 11 PCs aren't 'up to 2.3x faster' than Windows 10 devices, as Microsoft suggests \u2013 here's why that's an outlandish claim\n- macOS Tahoe 26: here's everything you need to know about all the new features\n- Can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11?

      "text": "Best alternative operating systems of 2025\nLook beyond Windows, MacOS, and Linux\nCheck out these unique alternative operating systems you can install on your computer, from the sublime to nostalgic to the bizarre.\nWhether you're fed up with Windows, Linux, or macOS, or you just want something new to experience or play with, you'll be happy to know there are some great alternative desktop operating systems worth exploring.\nWhile there are no absolute definitive answers here \u2013 everyone's use case is different, after all \u2013 we've discovered a number of distinct examples that fall outside the usual bounds.\nOur list even includes a few true outsiders, independent operating systems built from the ground up which serve mainly to prove just how difficult it is to create an entire functioning OS without a large number of brains working on it.\nEverything here can be tested reasonably within a virtual machine, so if something grabs your interest don't hesitate to download and give it a try.\nCheck out the best web hosting services in the world right now.\nThe best alternative operating systems of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest alternative operating systems: ArcaOS\n1. ArcaOS\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nArcaOS is an operating system based on the last IBM release for OS/2. While OS/2 barely survives as a legacy system, even after being extended for a while as eComStation, ArcaOS 5.1 is still being actively developed. The English edition will be released first with the Spanish, German and other language editions to follow.\nArcaOS includes a robust Unix compatibility subsystem, featuring a variety of ported Linux apps and some drivers, but still features the OS/2 Workplace Shell.\nArcaOS is a 32-Bit OS that runs on the x86 processor architecture, so should be compatible with some particularly old PCs. This means it can run 16 and 32-Bit OS/2 applications as well as certain 32-Bit Windows apps. It can also run most DOS programs including games. Though its native file system is JFS, it ships with drivers for the FAT32 file system.\nThere are two editions available: Personal, which retails for $129 per license, and Commercial, which retails at $229 per license, though volume discounts are available. The personal edition includes 6-months support and maintenance, while the commercial edition includes one-year of priority support and maintenance.\nBest alternative operating systems: Haiku\n2. Haiku\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWe're a bit sad that BeOS didn't take off. A stylish multitasking OS that introduced a whole host of features that Windows, Linux and macOS would later adopt for their own, BeOS was a true multimedia innovator that left the market with a whimper when its rights were sold to Palm in 2001.\nThe spirit of the closed source BeOS lives on in the form of Haiku, an open source re-implementation which began development immediately after Be's demise, and it has been in development since.\nBuilt from the ground up but designed to be backward-compatible with its classic quarry, Haiku follows BeOS' lead in its entirely modular design, allowing different components of the OS to be developed concurrently. Technically Haiku is still considered to be under development so there's no stable release. The second Beta release (R1) came out in December 2022 around 18 months after the previous beta.\nIt's worth playing with just for the cleanness of its desktop, and there are working web browsers and media players, although it's still rather experimental and many of the features of BeOS haven't quite been fully realized as yet.\nBest alternative operating systems: ReactOS\n3. ReactOS\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLinux, as you may know, is a ground-up reinterpretation of UNIX. ReactOS does the same for the Windows NT architecture upon which all modern Windows versions are based. It's completely open source, uses no proprietary Windows code, yet ReactOS is designed to be (and in some cases actually is) compatible with Windows drivers and applications.\nYour mileage may vary \u2013 it's certainly not going to play nice with high-end games or software, and ReactOS isn't quite up to the Windows 11 level yet. It's currently aiming at full compatibility with Windows Server 2003.\nSo it's clearly a bit behind the times, but ReactOS does have its uses. Incorporating parts of noted Windows emulator Wine. The latest version (0.4.14 can also emulate the Japanese series of NEC PC-9800 computers).\nIt runs LibreOffice, Firefox, Opera and more quite happily, and can even manage some earlier versions of popular commercial applications like Adobe Photoshop. Furthermore, ReactOS now natively supports more file systems than all Windows versions combined. For instance it can boot 64-Bit Linux system using the \"Freeloader\" utility.\nGiven that it's free, it's certainly worth a test to see if any of your older business-critical applications are compatible \u2013 setting up workstations without Windows licensing is a tempting prospect, although we can't vouch for its resistance to attacks.\nBest alternative operating systems: FreeDOS\n4. FreeDOS\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nA ridiculous amount of business software relies on MS-DOS, even to this day. We're still seeing bespoke, newly-developed text-mode apps that run directly from the shell, probably because the complexity and potential for disaster that graphical interfaces add to the mix is not worth the risk in situations that demand 100% uptime.\nThat business-critical software may rely on MS-DOS, but it\u2019ll run just as happily on a FreeDOS shell. As its name suggests, FreeDOS is a fully-compatible but completely free and open source remake of DOS that can handle just about everything its proprietary counterpart can. That does, of course, mean no multitasking, no protected mode, no GUI, but it'll run your games and can even manage Windows 3.1 as long as you're running it in standard mode.\nAs you might expect, it's not a static recreation of the final commercial DOS release in 1995, and indeed hasn't been static since it first emerged in 1998. In fact, FreeDOS remains in active development, and features a number of integrated improvements compared to its rather archaic ancestor. The latest release (1.3 is available as a \"live\" bootable CD or USB). The 'Lite' version is less than 32MB, so is perfect for test-piloting with your system. There's also a 'Legacy' version for older machines.\nBest alternative operating systems: Wayne OS\n5. Wayne OS\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWayne OS comes from a Korean startup that forked the open source Chromium OS (from which Google derives its Chrome OS) to create an OS for regular 64-bit machines instead of Chromebooks.\nOriginally called Chromic OS, the project changed its name to Wayne OS in 2019. Instead of a traditional installation, the distro is designed to be installed in bootable USB flash drives.\nWayne OS is meant for all kinds of end-users. To install it, simply download its compressed installer and then extract the executable installer from the archive and fire it up. This will bring up the Wayne OS installer. The project's YouTube channel has some helpful video tutorials on how to install Wayne OS both to a USB stick and a PC.\nSelect the version you want to install and then point the installer to the USB disk you want to install it on. Wait for the installer to download and copy the necessary files to the USB disk. You can choose to unplug the now bootable USB disk and use it to run Wayne OS on any 64-bit computer.\nWayne OS also now supports an \"Improved Live USB\" which allows you to use the drive as removable storage in Windows/macOS. The system partitions are also hidden.\nBest alternative operating systems: OpenIndiana\n6. OpenIndiana\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSun Microsystems' SunOS \u2013 which evolved into the rechristened Solaris \u2013 began as a proprietary UNIX distribution designed to support Sun's SPARC processors. Its list of supported hardware widened as it grew, and in 2005 Sun released the source code in the form of OpenSolaris, leading to advanced community development. And then Oracle purchased Sun, renamed the OS once more to Oracle Solaris, and decided to cease source releases, effectively closing the source once again.\nSometime after this move, the community took it upon themselves to maintain OpenSolaris. They decided to ditch its development tools and processes and created the OpenIndiana Hipster branch to modernize the OS. Hipster is compiled with GCC instead of Sun Studio and follows a rolling release model and the release team puts out installable snapshots every six-months.\nWhat makes OpenIndiana (OI) approachable to new users is that it runs familiar apps on its desktop. It uses the Mate desktop along with its cache of tools as well as a handful of mainstream productivity apps such as Firefox, Thunderbird and Pidgin. While there is not much to write home about OI\u2019s default cache of apps, one that caught our eye was the TimeSlider app for taking incremental ZFS file system snapshots. It isn\u2019t enabled by default, but is fairly intuitive to setup and use.\nBest alternative operating systems: KolibriOS\n7. KolibriOS\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKolibriOS is written in the FASM assembly language and based on the source code of the MenuetOS operating system. It boots in a flash and gives you access to a number of useful apps. There\u2019s no installation involved, though you\u2019ll have to make sure you select the option to save the changes you made during the session when you shut it down.\nThe OS supports FAT and NTFS file systems and ships with drivers for popular audio, video and Ethernet hardware. The desktop is fairly intuitive to operate, and new users aren\u2019t reprimanded for casually exploring the desktop and its various apps.\nThere are over 200 applications available for KolibriOS but the productivity apps aren\u2019t really mature enough for everyday use. The lack of a package manager doesn\u2019t help its case either. On the other hand, if you like retro gaming there\u2019s no better OS, as KolibriOS supports games including Tetris, Sokoban and a respectable Space Invaders clone.\nBest alternative operating systems: Icaros Desktop\n8. Icaros Desktop\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNostalgic open source fans can still get their dose of Amiga-esque goodness through Icaros. This is a distribution of Aros, which is an OS based on the AmigaOS API. It\u2019s important to note that this isn\u2019t a clone of AmigaOS, but an implementation of its API in a new operating system. Unless you\u2019re familiar with the AmigaOS of yore, you\u2019ll have a pretty tough time getting to grips with Icaros.\nIt\u2019s tricky to install, and it\u2019d be a frustrating experience to even attempt to explore the OS without first reading its user guide. First-time users should appreciate the fact that the OS is distributed as an installable live CD to whet their appetite. Click on the eye icon in the panel to get an Applications menu, or on the filing cabinet to get a selection of manuals.\nYou can also install Icaros in 'hosted' mode as a standalone app within your existing system. The OS can also be booted within a virtual machine.\nIcaros has pretty decent hardware support, but still don\u2019t expect it to work with fancy graphics cards and all wireless network hardware. Icaros has all the apps you need to use it as a regular desktop, but its real specialty is retro gaming, and that\u2019s one area in which it really shines. The built-in Janus-UAE emulator provides binary compatibility to Amiga programs, games and demos.\nBest alternative operating systems: Visopsys\n9. Visopsys\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe goal of Visopsys is to create a fully functional OS for Computer Science students and alternate OS enthusiasts like us. Considering the fact that it\u2019s primarily an educational system, it surprised us with its usability.\nThe OS boots in a snap and gives you the option to either launch the installer or boot into a Live session. The inclusion of a very capable partitioner in the installer is another pleasant surprise.\nThe desktop is fairly simple to navigate and includes a handful of essential apps, plus handy administration and configuration utilities. But attempts to use it for regular desktop tasks won\u2019t take you very far.\nThere's a basic image editor and you can play Minesweeper and Snake. However, the OS is missing a web browser and there\u2019s only a basic text editor. There's also no package management to help you pull in additional apps and utilities.\nVisopsys does a nice job of masquerading as a regular desktop, but it really is a very capable CS project and should be treated as such.\nGone but not forgotten: other Operating Systems\nGone but not forgotten: other Operating Systems\nIt's worth noting that there have been a number of other operating systems that were previously popular but have since been discontinued. One of the most famous of which is AmigaOS, used in Amiga personal computers during the 1990's and which had a reputation for solid stability.\nHowever, here are a few more that you may or may not have come across before now.\n10. eComStation\nOS/2 may not have set the world on fire, but it actually maintained a decent industrial and commercial install base long after its desktop aspirations died. eComStation was a derivative OS that uses classic OS/2 technologies on modern hardware.\nMuch like its ancestor it's been developed with security and stability in mind for commercial applications. We see the claim 'zero downtime' repeated all over the place, and while it's theoretically possible to lock up your hardware with the wrong application, this is something that could have been a real killer feature.\nThere's a host of open source software ported to eComStation including Firefox, OpenOffice, VLC and more, and it's capable of running DOS, Java and OS/2 applications. You almost certainly don't need it, but if there's something system-critical and OS/2-only that your business relies on, running this on bare metal is a much more reliable idea than setting up a VM.\nAs eComStation hasn't been updated for some years, if you're looking for OS/2 support and development it might be best to look at ArcaOS in the above list.\n11. Syllable Desktop\nDeveloped between 1994 and 2001, AtheOS \u2013 initially planned as a clone of AmigaOS but later following its own path \u2013 was the work of a lone Norwegian programmer, Kurt Skauen. After Skauen abandoned the project, its GPL-licensed source code was picked up by the community and Syllable Desktop was born.\nThe majority of it is composed of unique code, although certain components have been pulled from the vast library of open source Linux programs; there's also a Server version, which is more traditionally Linux.\nSyllable's key selling point \u2013 ignoring the fact that it's free \u2013 is its speed and lightness. The creators recommend a Pentium CPU with 32MB of RAM, which should give you an idea of how lightweight it is. Slap this on a modern PC and you'll likely never have seen an OS so quick.\nSyllable does lack the ports that make other indie operating systems attractive, though it contains a number of native apps for web browsing, email, VNC and more. We're not entirely positive that it's still active \u2013 the last official update was some time in 2012 \u2013 but if there's a very, very old PC you need to resurrect with reasonably modern system architecture, try this.\n12. SkyOS\nThe development of SkyOS has sadly been halted, but it's still worth looking at as an example of an OS constructed from scratch. Developed initially as an open source project by coder Robert Szeleney, SkyOS was based on concepts gleaned from other platforms but didn't originally borrow their code.\nThat said, a few components are based on other packages \u2013 there's no sense, for example, developing an entirely new compiler when GCC already exists, and the SkyFS filesystem is forked from OpenBFS. Later in its life, Szeleney appears to have experimented with a version of SkyOS built on top of a Linux kernel in an attempt to help with driver compatibility.\nThe source was closed midway through its life, and Szeleney continued development based on feedback from a popular (paid) public beta program. Unfortunately the struggle to keep up with ever-diversifying computing standards became too much for the lone coder, and development was halted in 2009, with the most recent beta made publicly available in 2013.\nIt's obviously incomplete, and not suitable for any kind of business environment, but as a curio to run within a VM it's very interesting.\n13. TempleOS\nWhether the extreme religious doctrine behind it interests you or not, TempleOS is an interesting example of a completely independent, unique OS. It was made and maintained with extreme dedication by one man, Terry A. Davis, over the course of ten years.\nTempleOS \u2013 programmed entirely using Davis' own language, the excellently named HolyC, which you also use to interact with its shell \u2013 deliberately includes no networking and absolutely no hardware support beyond that which forms the core PC system. So what's the point?\nTempleOS has been built from the ground up with what seems like no hang-ups on existing operating systems. The entire thing is hyperlinked, meaning you can quickly burrow down to the source of a program just as easily as you can find its dependencies, and it's super-quick; there's no paging, so the whole OS gets up and running within a second or two.\nIt's unlikely you'll be able to use TempleOS for anything solid, and Davis' well-documented mental health struggles didn't help its standing in the community. But it includes a huge number of interesting ideas, particularly the blurring of the division between document and program, which could impact more traditional operating systems. Which is why, despite TempleOS\u2019s development having ceased with Terry\u2019s passing in 2018, the OS is still available for the curious lot out there.\n14. FuryBSD\nWhile FreeBSD is a highly complete and very reliable operating system, it doesn't come with a graphical user interface by default. This is where FuryBSD stepped in to deliver a much more usable FreeBSD using a combination of a familiar graphical desktop environment with some additional tools and functionalities.\nThe OS was available with two desktop environments in separate ISO images, with one based on Xfce that performed well on under-equipped machines, while the other with KDE Plasma was meant for well-stocked computers.\nHowever, FuryBSD ended development in 2020\nAlso check out the best web design software.\nAlternative operating system FAQs\nWhich alternative operating system is best for you?\nWhen deciding which alternative operating systems to download and use, first realize that whichever type you're choosing will probably be quite limited in terms of what you can use it for. Without support for major software tools alternative operating systems tend to be more oddities that are fun to use rather than serious business platforms. Therefore we recommend you simply look to experiment and play with any alternative operating systems, rather than look to use them in a general business role.\nHow we tested the best alternative operating systems\nTo create this list of the best alternative operating systems we downloaded the software for each and set them up on an ordinary desktop computer, either as a second operating system, or else used virtual machine software to run it. In each case we had a good play around with the OS and any bundled software, just to get an idea of how it worked and what it was like as a user experience.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "'It's obvious that users are frustrated': consumer rights group accuses Microsoft of not providing a 'viable solution' for Windows 10 users who can't upgrade to Windows 11\nPIRG believes Microsoft still isn't doing enough to help those stuck on Windows 10\n- Microsoft recently threw a lifeline to consumers, offering alternatives to paying $30 for extended support for Windows 10\n- PIRG thinks this doesn't go far enough in terms of avoiding an impending e-waste calamity\n- The organization suggests Microsoft considers providing longer-term support for Windows 10, or relaxes the spec requirements for Windows 11\nMicrosoft's recent lifeline to help those stuck on Windows 10 \u2013 due to not meeting the stricter hardware requirements for a Windows 11 upgrade \u2013 simply isn't enough, according to a consumer rights group.\nThe Register reports that it has spoken to Lucas Rockett Gutterman, who leads the Designed to Last campaign for the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) in the US.\nAs you may be aware, PIRG has a mission to combat obsolescence and e-waste. The organization has previously levelled accusations at Microsoft of its Windows 11 requirements effectively shoving hundreds of millions of otherwise perfectly serviceable PCs into landfill, come the end of Windows 10 in October 2025. (The organization isn't alone in that, either.)\nYou may have seen that last week, Microsoft made a concession on this front. We've long known that one option for consumers will be to pay $30 for an additional year of security updates (something that's never been offered before), but now Microsoft just introduced some other choices too.\nInstead of forking out cash, you can elect to use the Windows Backup app to sync all your settings to the cloud (OneDrive). Alternatively, you can redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.\nHowever, Gutterman remains distinctly unimpressed with the new choices, telling The Register that: \"Microsoft's new options don't go far enough and likely won't make a dent in the up to 400 million Windows 10 PCs that can't upgrade to Windows 11.\"\nGutterman adds that: \"What [Microsoft hasn't] done is commit to automatically providing longer support for Windows 10 or loosening the hardware requirements for Windows 11.\"\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n\"It's obvious that users are frustrated,\" Gutterman concludes. \"They feel yanked around and don't think this [latest] announcement provides a viable solution.\"\nAnalysis: thinking beyond a one-year extension\nTo be fair to Microsoft, I think that giving Windows 10 users a couple of new options to avoid paying $30 to keep security updates going for an extra year (through to October 2026) is actually a very positive move \u2013 especially because simply using the Backup app isn't a particularly hefty imposition.\nI can see where Gutterman is coming from with the points he makes, but the suggestion that Microsoft might consider loosening the system requirements for Windows 11 is, I feel, rather a waste of breath. That isn't going to happen at this point, and I think the software giant has been pretty clear on that.\nFor me, the key point raised is providing Windows 10 support beyond an extra year for consumers, and this is something I've been harping on for some time. While businesses can get a three-year program of extended security updates (if they want that much), so far Microsoft is only offering consumers a single year.\nPerhaps the software giant feels that this is enough, but it really isn't \u2013 not when it comes to keeping all those olds PCs off the scrapheap. Why isn't Microsoft looking at extending support for multiple years for consumers too, from an eco-friendly angle?\nJust a second additional year of support would be some welcome extra breathing room, even if Microsoft charged for it rather than offering any kind of alternative angle like using the Backup app. Of course, a non-paying option would be better. I'd even suggest making Windows 10 ad-supported to keep those security updates coming for two or three years.\nWhat do you mean that's already happened and ads are all over the place? Ahem \u2013 in all seriousness, I think allowing Microsoft to push more ad notifications (in a still limited fashion) within Windows 10 would be a compromise many would take, rather than paying extra to keep their non-Windows 11 compatible PC alive through to 2027 or 2028. At least suffering the adverts would have a plus side to it in this scenario, and if you can't stand the idea of yet more ads, you can stump up the $30.\nWhatever the case, I fully agree with PIRG that a one-year extension for consumers isn't good enough in terms of Microsoft's responsibilities towards preventing excessive e-waste \u2013 and hopefully the company will see the sense in further extended updates for consumers, too, not just businesses.\nYou might also like...\n- No, Windows 11 PCs aren't 'up to 2.3x faster' than Windows 10 devices, as Microsoft suggests \u2013 here's why that's an outlandish claim\n- Windows 11's hidden PC migration feature proves Microsoft isn't messing around when it comes to killing off Windows 10\n- Can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11?

      "text": "Time\u2019s up for Teams: Why the end of Teams Classic support demands immediate enterprise action\nMicrosoft\u2019s decision to end support for Teams Classic on 1st July is more than just a routine update deadline\nMany companies, including some of the UK\u2019s largest banks, major retailers, and government departments, are still grappling with the fallout from legacy software. Compatibility issues and security risks tied to aging platforms remain widespread. This familiar pattern means migration projects are often postponed until the last minute, increasing the risk of costly disruptions and avoidable security vulnerabilities.\nMicrosoft\u2019s decision to end support for Microsoft Teams Classic on 1st July is more than just a routine update deadline; it represents a critical juncture for enterprise IT teams. For many organizations, this is a firm cutoff with serious operational and security implications.\nDirector at Cloudhouse.\nStopgap measures bring their own challenges\nThe impact of these delays is already evident. Many enterprises are paying for Extended Security Updates (ESUs) to buy extra time, while others are accelerating hardware refresh cycles, replacing laptops and desktops earlier than planned just to keep pace. Yet these stopgap measures bring their own challenges. Rushed rollouts often trigger user frustration, operational hiccups, and technical setbacks, complicating what should be a straightforward upgrade.\nSecurity concerns are particularly acute. Recent breaches at major UK retailers such as Marks & Spencer and the Co-op were directly linked to weaknesses in legacy systems. These incidents underline a stark reality that running unsupported software is a liability that can have serious consequences for both security and reputation.\nWindows 10 complications\nThe October deadline for Windows 10 support compounds the challenge. While Microsoft will continue offering paid ESUs for Windows 10, these only provide a temporary patch rather than a long-term solution. Organizations relying on extended support risk developing a false sense of security. Without a full platform upgrade, vulnerabilities pile up, documentation becomes obsolete, and the loss of staff familiar with legacy systems makes future migrations more complex and expensive.\nFor IT teams facing the double challenge of migrating both Teams and Windows 10 within months, the situation is stressful. Budgets are tight, resources limited, and the window to complete a compliant and smooth transition is rapidly closing.\nOften, delaying migration comes down to competing priorities, constrained budgets, and a lack of clear understanding about how legacy systems interact with current business processes. Legacy environments are typically poorly documented, and over time, institutional knowledge is lost as experienced staff leave. This makes migration projects time-consuming and costly, not only in terms of software upgrades but also in mapping the impact on security and compliance.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nPostponing these migrations carries hidden costs too. Every month that passes increases the risk of security breaches, operational failures, and regulatory penalties. Delaying upgrades becomes an increasingly risky gamble.\nSuccessfully navigating this challenge\nSuccessfully navigating this challenge demands urgent action and careful planning. One lesson from past migrations is clear in that scheduling rollouts thoughtfully and having robust rollback alternatives in place are crucial to minimize disruption. The old adage \u201cplan for success but prepare for failure\u201d rings especially true here. Working closely with users throughout the process helps manage expectations and surface issues early on.\nAnother key priority is capturing institutional knowledge before critical staff move on. Documenting legacy configurations, workflows, and vendor agreements is vital to maintain continuity and enable effective troubleshooting during migration. Testing compatibility thoroughly in controlled environments is also crucial to spot potential problems before they affect users. Planning phased rollouts with clear fallback procedures helps manage risk and keeps disruptions to a minimum.\nAt the same time, clear communication and user training can\u2019t be overlooked. Engaging with end users early reduces resistance and confusion, helping teams adapt smoothly to the new platform without unnecessary setbacks.\nEnd of support\nThe end of Teams Classic support should serve as a clear warning that last-minute fixes and reliance on extended support aren\u2019t sustainable. In an era where digital transformation and cyber threats are accelerating, organizations need to take control of their technology lifecycles. Early, comprehensive planning combined with cross-team collaboration is the only way to ensure timely migration while maintaining security and operational stability.\nThose organizations that act now will not only meet critical deadlines but will also reduce risks and build resilience for the future. For those that continue to delay, the risks of costly disruptions, breaches, and compliance failures will only grow.\nWith time running out on both Teams Classic and Windows 10 support, the path forward requires decisive, well-coordinated action to safeguard security and prepare organizations for the challenges ahead.\nWe've compiled a list of the best patch management software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best cloud computing provider of 2025\nVirtual IT infrastructure for Digital Transformation\nWe list the best cloud computing services, to make it simple and easy to manage your computing in the cloud to help with digital transformation.\nCloud services have revolutionized computing, not least through IaaS, PaaS, and especially SaaS, which have allowed businesses to develop virtualized IT infrastructure and deliver software through the cloud, independent of a user's operating system.\nEven better still, businesses can also mix and match cloud services from different providers to ensure maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness. For larger businesses especially the economic benefits can be significant.\nBecause cloud services are run through software platforms and virtualized networks, it means that it's easy to access and analyze data for the purposes of analytics as well as for business intelligence purposes. The result is IT infrastructure management that allows for insights that would have previously been much more difficult to access.\nCloud computing services also offer the advantage of being scalable, which means not only can you access additional resources exactly as you need them, but you are also charged only for the services you use so there's no need to buy in extra hardware for additional redundancy.\nThis especially applies to when storing data, as online cloud storage can be treated as effectively limitless. Even though you might be using cloud databases for your structured data, you can also archive everything else into massive data lakes for additional processing using AI and machine learning for greater insights.\nAltogether, cloud services offer unparalleled potential for improving business performance and increasing profits, and here we'll look at the best cloud computing service provider.\nKamatera cloud computing: Start free trial with $100 credit\nKamatera\u2019s cloud computing services offer scalable infrastructure, flexible pricing, and enterprise-grade reliability. With globally distributed data centers and always-on tech support from live humans, you can deploy, manage, and scale your cloud resources without paying for unnecessary features.\nThere are endless cloud computing services out there, and choosing the best one can be an uphill battle. It\u2019s essential to select an ideal one based on your requirements. Otherwise, you might find it strenuous to build and maintain your platform.\nThere are many things to consider including cost, pricing, security, features, ease of use, etc. We tested various cloud computing vendors and selected the best ones for you. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages but, overall, are some of the best cloud platforms you can find.\nWe've featured the best business cloud storage.\nThe best cloud computing service of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest cloud computing provider for reliability\n1. Amazon Web Services\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the world\u2019s biggest cloud computing provider. It kickstarted the cloud revolution and has occupied the number one spot for a long time.\nAWS has the largest data center network of all cloud providers, so it\u2019s very reliable and offers solid performance. You can host your application in the region where your customers are closest. For instance, if you\u2019re in the U.K. and observe that most of your customers come from the U.S., you can choose a U.S.-based data center to offer faster speed.\nAWS is known for being user-friendly. It's built for quick and easy access, and you can monitor or modify your data just when you want. This cloud platform offers a lot of web application services, so you have a broad choice of features to adopt. You can choose the best server operating system depending on which programming languages power your app.\nAWS is also known for being very safe and secure. The platform has had few noteworthy security incidents since its founding in 2006.\nHowever, there are some drawbacks. A common customer complaint is that AWS\u2019s billing system is confusing, leaving users prone to making mistakes that increase their costs. Another complaint is the high costs of dedicated support from AWS experts.\nBest cloud computing provider for scalability\n2. Microsoft Azure\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAzure is a cloud computing service offered by Microsoft, the American tech giant best known for its Windows operating system. It allows you to build and run your applications on the cloud with ease.\nAzure has a large network of over 200 data centers spread across the globe. This network guarantees high availability and redundancy, with Azure offering a service level agreement (SLA) of 99.95% (roughly 4.38 hours of downtime per year).\nAzure has invested a lot of resources into security. It offers built-in controls for detecting and thwarting cyber threats; it applies artificial intelligence and machine learning to aid this process. The company has a team of over 3,500 cybersecurity experts working to safeguard its cloud network.\nScalability shouldn't be a worry when using Azure. You can start with small computing resources and increase them as your business grows. The platform uses the pay-as-you-go method, making it cost-effective as you scale.\nBut a notable drawback of using Azure is its complex user interface. You\u2019ll likely find it more difficult to navigate Azure than AWS and some other rival platforms.\nTake a look at our Microsoft discount codes for the best Microsoft offers and savings.\nBest cloud computing provider for Google\n3. Google Cloud\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Cloud is an eponymous cloud computing service offered by Google, the tech company best known for its search engine. Google got into the cloud game later than most competitors but nonetheless has built a strong customer base.\nGoogle Cloud dedicates a lot of resources to security. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to detect and counter cyber threats. Users have access to a host of cybersecurity features to keep sensitive data secure.\nThis platform is famous for its high performance. Ask many customers the best thing about choosing Google Cloud, and you\u2019ll likely hear about performance. Google has a lot of hardware and software expertise that it leveraged to design servers and server management software that works as fast as possible.\nAnother good thing you\u2019ll hear about Google Cloud is that the platform makes it easy for multiple users to collaborate within the same interface and access the same features. This platform also offers comprehensive support resources, including tutorials, how-to articles, an online community, and human support.\nThe main complaint that you\u2019ll hear about Google Cloud is that it\u2019s expensive, which is true. It costs more to use Google Cloud than rival platforms like AWS and Azure, but many people think the tradeoff for high performance is worth it.\nBest cloud computing provider for enterprises\n4. IBM Cloud\nReasons to buy\nIBM Cloud is a cloud computing service offered by the eponymous tech giant IBM. The solution offers PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS.\nAs hardware and virtual-based servers are combined into one on demand cloud-platform, you have complete control. IBM refer to their hardware servers as \u2018bare metal\u2019. These provide clients with sole access to their entire server. This reduces the \u2018noisy neighbor\u2019 effect and greatly improves performance.\nIBM Cloud is integrated and managed by a single system that can be controlled via web portal, API (Application Programming Interface) or mobile apps. IBM Cloud\u2019s Bluemix developing solution has a wide range of cloud SaaS management tools.\nIBM Cloud also offers full server customization. This means that everything that is included in the server is handpicked by you. This way you do not have to pay for features that you might never use.\nBest distributed cloud computing provider\n5. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nReasons to buy\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure offers two main service provisions available: cloud architecture, and storage data.\nCloud architecture includes data management, cloud databases, and applications, while the Oracle Data Cloud is primarily for driving big data analytics for business intelligence insights. Oracle also provides a range of SaaS platforms such as HCM, EPM, SCM, and social media tools.\nFor those who do sign up, aside from a 30-day free trial, Oracle Cloud also offers a free service tier which includes unlimited access to two autonomous databases which come with Oracle Application Express (APEX) and Oracle SQL.\nBest open source cloud computing OS\n6. CloudLinux\nReasons to buy\nCloudLinux isn't so much a cloud computing provider, but rather a cloud platform you can build across your own servers. This means that if you'd prefer to have tight control over your cloud network rather than going with third-parties, you can host it yourself. While this presents a different set of challenges, it also offers a range of benefits, especially for those companies already heavily invested in their own IT infrastructure.\nCloudLinux is a distro of specifically built for virtualized cloud operations to power shared hosting services, by allocating and limiting server resources to each tenant. Additionally, each tenant is partition from each other, in other to create a more secure environment. The result is a hosting platform that has built in redundancy, stability, and security, in order to provide a better hosting environment.\nAll cloud services require a degree of technical knowledge to work with, so for those with extensive expertise CloudLinux offers the opportunity to be far more in control of your own services and how they are configured.\nBest cloud computing provider for Europe\n7. OVHCloud\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOVHcloud is a French cloud computing provider focused on European customers. It is the largest cloud hosting provider in Europe and the third-largest globally based on physical servers.\nOVHcloud gives you access to virtual private servers or dedicated servers. You can choose the type you want and the region you want it to be in. Your choice depends on the type of online platform you're hosting, as some servers are faster than others.\nThis platform has the largest data center network in Europe, so it\u2019s an ideal choice if most of your customers are based in this region. Furthermore, OVHcloud is affordable compared to most rival platforms.\nWhen testing OVHcloud, we observed that its customer support wasn\u2019t as good as what you\u2019d get on rival platforms. You need to pay a significant sum for dedicated human support, which puts it at a disadvantage.\nBest cloud computing provider for cost-effectiveness\n8. DigitalOcean\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDigitalOcean is one of the most popular low-cost cloud providers. It doesn\u2019t offer as much sophisticated features as you\u2019d find on rival platforms like Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. It focuses more on offering simple cloud computing features for an affordable price and does its job well.\nDigitalOcean has 15 data centers worldwide, much smaller than the network of the likes of AWS and Azure. Its reliability and performance are good but not as good as what you\u2019d get on these rival platforms. The attraction of DigitalOcean is trading lower costs for fewer features and performance.\nIt's pretty easy to spin up cloud servers on DigitalOcean to host your application. The platform is easy to navigate, so you shouldn\u2019t face difficulties navigating it. You can choose different types of managed cloud databases, clusters, and APIs. You can also access complementary features such as security firewalls, load balances, and a DNS management system.\nBest cloud computing provider FAQs\nHow to choose a cloud computing provider\nCost\nCost is the number one consideration in selecting a provider. It\u2019s essential to pick something that you can afford to avoid running into trouble in the future. Cloud services are unique such that they don\u2019t usually have a straightforward pricing structure. What you\u2019ll pay depends on the features that you select. The good thing is that cloud services offer their pricing details beforehand so that you can have a good estimate of what you\u2019ll pay.\nSecurity\nYou\u2019ll be storing a lot of sensitive data on your cloud provider. Thus, it must have advanced security features to prevent data leaks or theft. Losing customer data can hamper your reputation and even bring about legal lawsuits. Similarly, losing sensitive business data can harm your competitive advantage, so your cloud platform must be secure.\nFeatures\nWhat features do the platform offer? Can you choose the type of servers you want? Can you spin up GPUs? Does it offer complementary services such as domain names and DNS management? Etc.\nEase of use\nYou need a platform that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. Otherwise, you can get frustrated or make costly mistakes by choosing features you didn\u2019t intend to choose.\nWhat are the essential features of a cloud provider?\nOn-demand self-service\nYou should be able to spin up cloud instances and use them without external help. You should be able to monitor the servers you've rented and their allotted storage capacities. External help can always be a complementary feature, but the important thing is that every good cloud provider must offer a self-serve option.\nSolid uptime\nA cloud provider should have their servers up and running as faultlessly as possible. Of course, no platform is perfect, so you may experience occasional downtimes. However, every cloud provider should offer at least 99.9% uptime. Otherwise, you may lose money because of unnecessary server issues preventing your online platform from working.\nAnalytics\nAn ideal cloud computing platform should let users analyze what features they\u2019ve used and give them a breakdown of how it affects their costs. This way, a user can easily identify which features are generating high costs and which ones aren\u2019t, and use this information to optimize their spending.\nPay-As-You-Go\nPay-as-you-go is the best pricing structure because you only pay for the computing features you use. This way, you avoid paying for unnecessary things that you may not use, and you save significant sums in the long run.\nHow we tested the best cloud computing providers\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what range of business type and size the cloud computing service would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant services, such as security perimeters and user apps. We also looks at pricing models and flexibility, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "The best internet security suites for 2025: ranked and rated by the expert\nThe best internet security suites for PCs, Macs and mobile devices, reviewed by the experts\n- Top 3 internet security suites\n- Best overall internet security suite\n- Best internet security suite for families\n- Best internet security suite for multiple devices\n- Best internet security suite for beginners\n- Best value internet security suite\n- Best internet security suite with VPN\n- Best configurable internet security suite\n- Fastest internet security suite\n- Internet security suites FAQs\nThe best internet security suites are one of the best ways to protect a whole household of devices. Offering coverage across multiple platforms and operating systems, these comprehensive packages often provide the best antivirus, firewall protection, parental controls, a VPN, password manager, and so much more.\nMy team of experts here at TechRadar Pro have spent tens of thousands of hours testing and reviewing hundreds of security products, so we'd like to think we know a thing or two about what makes a good cybersecurity tool.\nIn our reviews, we look at AV-TEST scores for each antivirus package, before going on to examine just how each part of the internet security suite ticks. Whether its VPN server count, inclusion of ransomware protection, or insurance included with identity theft protection.\nBitdefender Total Security remains my top pick for most people, thanks to it's near-perfect scoring across multiple antivirus and security evaluations, attractive price point, and extra features.\nTop 3 internet security suites in 2025\nIn a hurry? Here are our top 3 picks for internet security suites:\n1. Bitdefender Total Security: best overall internet security suite\nOur top recommendation, Bitdefender Total Security offers the best-in-class security for you and your devices.\nFeatures include multi-layered ransomware protection, parental controls, firewall, a Wi-Fi security advisor, a secure browser for online banking, a file shredder, a vulnerability scanner and more.\nPlus with a 30-day free trial, you can give Bitdefender Total Security a go, risk-free.\n2. Norton 360 Deluxe: best internet security suite for families\nNorton 360 Deluxe is a great choice for families as it offers not only parental controls but also a VPN, online backup and dark web monitoring in addition to 50GB of online backup storage.\nNorton 360 Deluxe offers this top-class protection for to 5 devices, and has offerings for both iOS and Android.\n3. Avast One: a great all-round internet security suite\nAvast One offers protection against malicious software, webcam security and data breach monitoring, all wrapped up in one easy-to-use interface.\nNot only that, with Avast One you can protect up to 30 devices with web protection, a VPN, and Avast's Sensitive Data Shield, which adds an extra layer of protection to your private data.\nBest overall internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a whole host of features.\n\u2714\ufe0f You use devices across a range of operating systems - Bitdefender can be used on iOS, Android, Mac and Windows.\n\u274c You have an older CPU as its performance may be impacted.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with advanced PC maintenance tools.\nBitdefender Total Security is the well-respected security firm\u2019s top-of-the-range package and tops the lot when it comes to all-singing all-dancing internet security suites.\nTotal Security is a suite that\u2019s positively bristling with features. You get \u2013 deep breath \u2013 standard antivirus tools plus impressively capable multi-layered ransomware protection, a firewall, a Wi-Fi security advisor, a secure browser (Safepay) for online banking, a file shredder, a vulnerability scanner (to check for missing apps and OS updates), password manager, email spam filter, parental controls, webcam and microphone defenses, and more besides including a superb web protection module for blocking malicious URLs.\nAs well as security features, Total Security provides various PC maintenance and optimization tools. These are somewhat useful in themselves, for cleaning out superfluous files and streamlining boot times \u2013 but more importantly, Bitdefender\u2019s flagship package also covers more than just Windows devices.\nIn fact, an app is provided for Mac users (the software is compatible with M1 Macs, and has been improved to run faster virus scans), as well as clients for iOS and Android mobiles. The Android app also has the capability to block more link-based mobile threats.\nAs it\u2019s only a bit more expensive than Bitdefender Internet Security \u2013 the firm\u2019s mid-tier security suite \u2013 I'd say it\u2019s certainly worthwhile upgrading to Total Security if you have multiple devices across various platforms to protect. (You can see what we think of the range in our full Bitdefender review).\nThere is further good news in that Bitdefender has a minimal impact on system performance, going by independent and my own testing (some rivals do a touch better in this department, but it\u2019s not a difference you\u2019ll ever notice in real-world use).\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s a 30-day free trial of this suite, with no payment details needed; you just have to supply an email address. That means you can try out Bitdefender for a full month before committing to buying and see first-hand for yourself exactly what\u2019s on offer here.\nBest internet security suite for families\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with an integrated VPN.\n\u2714\ufe0f You're looking for an internet security suite for the whole family.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite that doesn't use a lot of resources.\n\u274c You have more than 5 devices you want to use the internet security suite on.\nWhen I evaluated all of NortonLifeLock\u2019s security suite options, I picked out Norton 360 Deluxe as the best value all-around choice for anyone who\u2019s looking to protect more than a single device \u2013 which is likely the majority of folks.\nNorton delivers good basic protection \u2013 although some of the independent test lab results have been a little mixed \u2013 alongside a wealth of features, including webcam protection and dark web monitoring (for users in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and a few other countries), an impressively smart firewall, plus a system of parental controls.\nThe parental controls are top-notch, by the way, including in-depth monitoring systems to keep an eye on what your kids are doing online, and even GPS tracking for their mobile devices. Norton\u2019s very strong in this department.\nThere are some truly worthwhile extras included here, too, like a fully integrated Norton VPN that massively adds to the value proposition of this suite (assuming you don\u2019t have a VPN already, of course), and 50GB of cloud backup storage that's another handy bonus.\nAs for negative points, a flaw worth bearing in mind is that I found Norton 360 Deluxe had more of a drag on system performance than most internet security suites in my own testing. That said, it\u2019s rated as about average in this department by independent test lab AV-Comparatives, and odds are you likely won\u2019t even notice any impact on the speed of your system in everyday usage.\nNorton 360 Deluxe covers up to five devices, either Windows or Mac PCs, plus there are mobile apps for Android and iOS. Pricing is highly competitive compared to rivals, particularly given that bundled VPN, so you should definitely consider this Norton package (compare it to the company\u2019s other offerings with our guide to choosing your Norton plan) \u2013 especially for family usage with those very thorough parental controls.\nBest internet security suite for multiple devices\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a top-rated antivirus engine.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want your internet security suite to cover a lot of devices.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with a fast VPN service.\nAvast One is the trusted security outfit\u2019s revamped suite which offers an umbrella of protection across various bases. That means not just antivirus and ransomware defenses, but also a firewall, webcam protection, data breach monitoring, and a software updater to keep apps patched up with no need for user intervention.\nOn top of that, Avast One provides a full VPN (with unlimited data \u2013 although it\u2019s not the fastest I\u2019ve ever seen, by any means), and some device speed-up and maintenance tools.\nThere are also some more unusual features like a Sensitive Data Shield which scans drives for files that may contain sensitive info like passwords and phone numbers and stops other users of a device from accessing these. In short, you get a lot with the paid subscription of Avast One (there\u2019s a free version which is impressive, too, but it drops a number of features, and the VPN function is limited).\nAll this is wrapped up in a smart and easy-to-use interface which has been thoughtfully redesigned for Avast One, and the cherry on top is the strength of the protection delivered. Avast\u2019s antivirus engine is rated as excellent by the independent test labs, and its web protection is among the best around, too. Furthermore, system slowdown is negligible when running this suite.\nOverall, Avast One packs in a lot of features, and while some of these capabilities may not be as robust as the top performers in this roundup, the sheer weight of what you\u2019re getting means this is one of the best all-rounders out there.\nBest internet security suite for beginners\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with great ransomware protection.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a user-friendly interface.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with configuration options for experts.\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about Trend Micro\u2019s flagship security suite \u2013 Trend Micro Maximum Security \u2013 not the least of which is its polished and user-friendly interface, backed up by superb virus protection. Trend Micro is highly ranked by the independent testing labs, and it offers sterling multi-layered anti-ransomware defenses, too.\nThe package also gives you first-class URL filtering for safer web browsing, further bolstering the overall defenses provided here. That said, one slight weak point with Trend Micro\u2019s offering is that there isn\u2019t a huge amount of low-level control \u2013 such as virus scan options \u2013 so more demanding users may find it lacking here.\nMaximum Security provides parental controls, social media privacy features and PC maintenance tools, although the latter isn\u2019t its strongest suit. It also boasts data theft prevention countermeasures, a secure vault for storing sensitive files, and a decent integrated password manager.\nLess tech-savvy types will appreciate the ease-of-use here, which also goes for the capable mobile apps. There\u2019s a 30-day trial as well, so you can thoroughly check all this out for yourself before pulling the trigger on a purchase.\nBest value internet security suite\n5. McAfee Total Protection Multi-Device\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a high-quality spam filter.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a good value internet security suite.\n\u274c You want a robust malware protection.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with an advanced VPN.\nAs the name suggests, McAfee\u2019s basic security product, Total Protection Individual, only covers one individual device. And if you\u2019re thinking of buying that, and you own more than just a Windows PC, then you\u2019re almost certainly better off purchasing McAfee Total Protection Multi-Device.\nFor not much more money at all you get a sound internet security suite which protects up to five Windows, ChromeOS, or Mac computers, and Android or iOS devices. US customers also benefit from a useful additional extra in the form of identity theft protection.\nMcAfee\u2019s interface is simple and streamlined, which keeps things easy for beginners, although it\u2019ll likely be too sparse for more experienced users. The UI also suffers from some annoying quirks, but nothing too frustrating.\nIndependent test lab reports suggest McAfee Total Protection offers solid enough defenses, if not class-leading. Indeed, evaluations of McAfee\u2019s antivirus engine vary, with some being more scathing than others.\nOverall, McAfee\u2019s suite represents reasonable value and a decent choice in the Multi-Device package, with some nifty extras for boosting web browsing and app performance, plus an integrated (but very basic) free VPN that\u2019s commendably user-friendly.\nBest internet security suite with VPN\n6. Avira Prime\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that covers up to 25 devices.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a built-in VPN.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with robust cyber security features.\nThis is an interesting one in that Avira\u2019s top-level package is missing some of the core security features you might find in other internet security suites, but it more than makes up for this in other ways which might be tempting depending on your own personal needs and use case.\nSo, while a firewall and parental controls might be missing from Avira Prime \u2013 or a backup facility (save for a contacts backup feature on the iOS app) \u2013 you do get some nifty stuff instead. That includes a decent VPN and some seriously high-quality PC maintenance tools.\nIf you want those speed-up tools, and/or have been considering getting a VPN as well as a new security suite, then Prime could be a perfect fit. In fact, in the latter case, Avira Prime works out as storming value for money, providing a solid engine to keep you safe, and that Avira VPN on top to keep you safer still online. Others, however, may miss the aforementioned core suite features like parental controls, of course.\nBest configurable internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that is highly configurable.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with with cloud analysis that picks up undetected threats.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with robust, powerful security features.\nESET Smart Security Premium packs in a lot of features including parental controls, webcam protection, network monitoring, additional network protection, and an anti-theft feature for Windows devices allowing for location tracking is an interesting bonus. Furthermore, Linux systems are covered here, as well as Windows and Mac computers.\nHowever, while ESET delivers lots of features, their quality can be variable. For example, the system of parental controls is very barebones, but the password manager is well fleshed out. ESET also offers plenty of configuration options, which will please experts, although computing novices may find it tricky to get to grips with in some respects.\nESET\u2019s antivirus protection seems solid, albeit with some mixed evaluations from independent testing labs. It\u2019s also worth noting that the suite\u2019s defenses have recently been bolstered with Live Guard, an extra layer of cloud analysis to detect newly emerged threats.\nSmart Security Premium provides some interesting extras, too, including the aforementioned password manager, and a secure, encrypted file vault to protect any sensitive data on your PC, which some folks will doubtless find very useful additions.\nThat said, unless you really want this additional functionality, it\u2019s not the best value for money internet security suite out there.\nFastest internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that covers up to 25 devices.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a built-in VPN.\n\u274c You want to use the it on iOS.\n\u274c You want top-of-the-range antivirus protection.\nWebroot majors in being incredibly lightweight and fast-performing. Indeed, it has a minuscule memory footprint, and takes up next to no space on your system drive, as the product\u2019s virus definitions are all stored in the cloud.\nYet despite this minimal impact on your machine, Webroot Internet Security Plus comes with plenty of features. There\u2019s online banking protection, an Identity Shield to prevent data theft from the likes of keyloggers, ransomware defenses, an accurate anti-phishing system, a smart firewall, plus a password manager as you get a LastPass subscription bundled.\nDownsides? Well, you might get lightning quick malware scans, but Webroot hasn\u2019t fared very well in recent antivirus testing by the independent labs (or at least one of them, as the other big players don\u2019t evaluate this product). The accuracy of its engine is mixed at best, so that\u2019s a somewhat worrying question mark at the time of writing.\nStill, Internet Security Plus is a well-rounded package, and as we pointed out in our review, Windows users could always run it alongside the free Microsoft Defender to get the benefit of Webroot\u2019s bonus features, while doubling up on protection. The company\u2019s 70-day \u2018no questions asked\u2019 money-back guarantee is also noteworthy, showing Webroot\u2019s confidence in its suite.\nFind the best deals on Webroot products with our Webroot promo codes.\nMarch 2025 Update - I have updated this guide to reflect accurate pricing and capabilities, alongside devices-per-license and compatibility. Bullguard Premium Protection used to appear on this list. However, Bullguard products were removed from the market on July 25, 2022 after the company was acquired by Norton. Kaspersky Total Security Anti-Virus used to appear on this list. Considering the current climate however, we've taken the decision to remove the provider. Although much of the company's core processes are now take place in Switzerland, the fact that its headquarters remain in Moscow and there have been previous allegations around government coercion, it feels prudent to use the provider with caution. And, when there are so many other excellent providers to choose from, it's impossible to whole-heartedly recommend Kaspersky at this time.\nInternet security suites FAQs\nWhat is the best internet security suite for 2025?\nWhile there are excellent internet security suites out there from names such as Norton, Avast and Trend Micro, we think Bitdefender Total Security is the best you can get right now.\nAvailable to use on up to 10 devices (including Windows, Macs, Android and iOS) Total Security combines super string virus protection with numerous extra features that genuinely add value to the package.\nFor example, a single subscription includes ransomware protection, firewall, Wi-Fi security advisor, secure browser. file shredder, vulnerability scanner, password manager, email spam filter, parental controls, webcam, microphone defenses and more!\nIt's also really easy to set up and use, while not even being that expensive.\nWhat should I look for in an internet security suite?\nAll of the products on this list offer effective capabilities, so the difference is in additional capabilities. If there is a particular type of threat that concerns you, such as ransomware or phishing, check to see if there are specific protections included.\nBanking safeguards, firewalls and parental controls are also areas you should consider \u2013 especially if there are multiple users on your computer. And of course, you should consider whether you need protection across multiple devices, such as smartphones.\nThe number of additional features and devices may impact cost though.\nFinally, think about usability and the impact on system performance. Do you want a high level of customization or do you want an easy-to-use interface and do you want a program that is capable of fast scans or one that requires minimal system resources?\nDo I really need an internet security suite?\nIt\u2019s certainly true that a good entry-level antivirus will deliver strong core defenses against malware, so why would you want to think about getting one of the best internet security suites?\nAfter all, don\u2019t all apps from the same vendor use the exact same antivirus engine, giving you the same fundamental protection \u2013 while a suite demands a heftier price tag?\nOf course, you\u2019ll get more features with internet security suites, but one perception is that these maybe aren\u2019t all that critical to protect your device. And in some cases, this is true; they\u2019re just nice extras to have.\nBut in other cases, you might get capabilities like secure file vaults for your sensitive data, or a secure browser with which to engage in the likes of online banking \u2013 all of which provide worthwhile additional safeguards. Then there are elements like a password manger, or bundled VPN, which again really bolster online security beyond core measures, if you don\u2019t already have these things.\nFeatures like a free VPN could add to the value proposition of an internet security suite in a big way \u2013 depending on your existing software and needs \u2013 and while we mentioned paying more for a suite compared to a basic antivirus, sometimes security vendors don\u2019t charge much more. Indeed, when deals and discounts come into play, it can be the case that there\u2019s barely any difference in price \u2013 and don\u2019t forget, internet security suites usually support a fair few more devices (which can be a major consideration if you need coverage for family members as well as yourself).\nWhat's the difference between antivirus and internet security suites?\nWhile antivirus software provides a basic level of protection for your system, full internet security expands on capabilities such as scanning files and software, activity monitoring and vulnerability search with features tailored for Internet use.\nIndeed, many internet security products are marketed as \u2018suites\u2019 because they contain several different programs that can be accessed by a single interface.\nThese might include a firewall, anti-spam controls, ad blockers, webcam protection, keylogger protection, parental controls and credit card safeguards. There might also be additional protection against web-specific types of malware such as spyware and adware.\nHowever running so many different types of program might mean that internet security suites use more of your system resources than conventional AV.\nCan I create my own free internet security suite?\nThere are many advantages to purchasing a premium internet security suite from a trusted vendor, but it is perfectly possible to create your own modular suite by picking the most suitable free products.\nWhile this might mean you save money, it does mean you have to do much of the work yourself. You will have to identify the best components, whether its virus protection, firewall or backup software, and fix any problems yourself.\nThe more components you introduce will increase complexity and system resource use. You will also suffer from the pitfalls of using free services such as frequent adverts urging you to upgrade.\nUsing a premium internet security suite means the vendor integrates several services into a single package that can be managed from a single interface. What\u2019s more, they might cover several different types of device and offer different tiers of protection.\nIf you do want to build out your own suite, then you can pick the best of individual components in the following advice guides:\n- Rescue disk\n- Encryption software\n- Anonymous browsing\n- Firewall\n- Cloud antivirus\n- Endpoint protection\n- Online cyber security courses\nIn our latest round of updates, we overhauled this page's layout and structure by adding a quick menu, boxouts to give you the pros and cons of the internet security suites on offer and clearer headings. We also double-checked the pricing, deals, server locations, and unblocking capabilities to make sure the information on this page was as accurate and up-to-date as possible.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBenedict has been writing about security issues for over 7 years, first focusing on geopolitics and international relations while at the University of Buckingham.

However, this delay may lead to complacency, loss of internal knowledge, and increased technical debt, complicating future transitions. Organizations are urged to view this extension as a final opportunity to modernize their systems and avoid the pitfalls of relying on unsupported software.",
