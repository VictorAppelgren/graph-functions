      "summary": "Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg has reversed the company’s decline, raising 737 output, securing major orders, and boosting the stock by 39% over the past year. Yet Boeing remains unprofitable, lags Airbus in the single‑aisle market, and faces costly union strikes, debt, and delayed certification of new jets. Ortberg’s next priorities are to accelerate 737 MAX production, revive the defense and space division, and secure federal support for the new F‑47 fighter. Political pressures from President Trump and trade policy add complexity to the turnaround effort.",
