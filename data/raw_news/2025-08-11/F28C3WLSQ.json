  "description": "President Donald Trump has taken control of the District of Columbia\u2019s law enforcement and ordered National Guard troops to deploy onto the streets of the nation\u2019s capital.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump has taken control of the District of Columbia\u2019s law enforcement and ordered National Guard troops to deploy onto the streets of the nation\u2019s capital, arguing the extraordinary moves are in response to an urgent public safety crisis.\n\nEven as district officials questioned the claims underlying his emergency declaration, the president promised a \u201chistoric action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\u201d His rhetoric echoed that used by conservative politicians going back decades who have denounced American cities, especially those with majority non-white populations or led by progressive politicians, as lawless or crime-ridden and in need of outside intervention.\n\n\u201cThis is liberation day in D.C., and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump promised Monday.\n\nBut for many residents, the prospect of federal troops surging into the district\u2019s neighborhoods represents an alarming violation of local agency. To some, it echoes uncomfortable historical chapters when politicians used language to paint historically or predominantly Black cities and neighborhoods with racist narratives to shape public opinion and justify aggressive police action.\n\nApril Goggans, a longtime Washington resident and grassroots organizer, said she was not surprised by Trump\u2019s actions. Communities had been preparing for a potential federal crackdown in the district since the summer of 2020, when Trump deployed National Guard troops during racial justice protests after the murder of George Floyd.\n\n\u201cWe have to be vigilant,\u201d said Goggans, who has coordinated protests and local civil liberties educational campaigns for nearly a decade. She worries about what a surge in law enforcement could mean for residents\u2019 freedoms.\n\n\u201cRegardless of where you fall on the political scale, understand that this could be you, your children, your grandmother, your co-worker who are brutalized or have certain rights violated,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to White House officials, National Guard troops will be deployed to protect federal assets in the district and facilitate a safe environment for law enforcement to make arrests. The administration believes the highly visible presence of law enforcement will deter violent crime.\n\nIt is unclear how the administration defines providing a safe environment for law enforcement to conduct arrests, raising alarm bells for some local advocates.\n\n\u201cThe president foreshadowed that if these heavy-handed tactics take root here, they will be rolled out to other majority-Black and Brown cities, like Chicago, Oakland and Baltimore, across the country,\u201d said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s D.C. chapter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen before how federal control of the D.C. National Guard and police can lead to abuse, intimidation and civil rights violations \u2014 from military helicopters swooping over peaceful racial justice protesters in 2020 to the unchecked conduct of federal officers who remain shielded from full accountability,\u201d Hopkins said.\n\nConservative lawmakers have for generations used denigrating language to describe the condition of major American cities and called for greater law enforcement, often in response to changing demographics in those cities driven by nonwhite populations relocating in search of work or safety from racial discrimination and state violence. Republicans have called for greater police crackdowns in cities since at least the 1965 Watts Riots in Los Angeles.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon won the White House in 1968 after campaigning on a \u201claw and order\u201d agenda to appeal to white voters in northern cities alongside overtures to white Southerners as part of his \u201cSouthern Strategy.\u201d Ronald Reagan similarly won both his presidential elections after campaigning heavily on law and order politics. Politicians ranging from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to former President Bill Clinton have cited the need to tamp down crime as a reason to seize power from cities like Washington for decades.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump\u2019s takeover of the local police force \u201cunsettling\u201d but not without precedent. The mayor kept a mostly measured tone during a Monday news conference following Trump\u2019s announcement but decried the president\u2019s reasoning as a \u201cso-called emergency\u201d and said the district\u2019s residents \u201cknow that access to our democracy is tenuous.\u201d\n\nTrump threatened to \u201ctake over\u201d and \u201cbeautify\u201d the nation\u2019s capital on the campaign trail and claimed the district was \u201ca nightmare of murder and crime.\u201d He also argued the city was \u201chorribly run\u201d and said his team intended \u201cto take it away from the mayor.\u201d The president repeated comments he\u2019d previously made about some of the nation\u2019s largest cities during his news conference, including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Oakland, California, and his hometown of New York City. All are currently run by Black mayors.\n\n\u201cYou look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities in a very bad, New York is a problem. And then you have, of course, Baltimore and Oakland. We don\u2019t even mention that anymore. They\u2019re so far gone. We\u2019re not going to let it happen,\u201d he said.\n\nCivil rights advocates see the president\u2019s rhetoric as part of a broader political strategy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a playbook he\u2019s used in the past,\u201d said Maya Wiley, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n\nThe president\u2019s rhetoric \u201cpaints a picture that crime is out of control, even when it is not true, then blames the policies of Democratic lawmakers that are reform- and public safety-minded, and then claims that you have to step in and violate people\u2019s rights or demand that reforms be reversed,\u201d Wiley said.\n\nShe added that the playbook has special potency in the capital because the district\u2019s local law enforcement can be directly placed under federal control, a power Trump invoked in his announcement.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions in Washington and comments about other major American cities sent shock waves across the country, as other cities prepare to respond to potential federal action.\n\nDemocratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Trump\u2019s plan \u201clacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous\u201d in a statement and pointed to a 30-year-low crime rate in Baltimore as a reason the administration should consult local leaders rather than antagonize them. In Oakland, Mayor Barbara Lee called Trump\u2019s characterization of the city \u201cfearmongering.\u201d\n\nThe administration already faced a major flashpoint between local control and federal power earlier in the summer, when Trump deployed National Guard troops to quell protests and support immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles despite opposition from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nCivil rights leaders have denounced Trump\u2019s action in Washington as an unjustified distraction.\n\n\u201cThis president campaigned on \u2018law and order,\u2019 but he is the president of chaos and corruption,\u201d said NAACP President Derrick Johnson. \u201cThere\u2019s no emergency in D.C., so why would he deploy the National Guard? To distract us from his alleged inclusion in the Epstein files? To rid the city of unhoused people? D.C. has the right to govern itself. It doesn\u2019t need this federal coup.\u201d",
