  "title": "Man Utd star has two reasons to force transfer away next week after Fulham draw",
  "description": "Ruben Amorim has given one of last season's Man Utd mainstays a decision to make ahead of the transfer deadline.",
  "content": "Andre Onana may not officially be a member of the Manchester United 'bomb squad', nor is his limited role in Ruben Amorim's plans as glaringly obvious as Rasmus Hojlund. However, with eight days of the summer transfer window remaining, the goalkeeper may need to take matters into his own hands after United's 1-1 draw against Fulham on Sunday. Onana has made 101 appearances for the Red Devils across two seasons since completing a \u00a347million transfer from Inter Milan in 2023. He arrived as one of the most highly-rated goalkeepers in world football after playing a central role in Inter Milan's run to the Champions League final.\n\nA series of high-profile blunders to pour fuel onto the fire that was two of the club's worst seasons in recent memory has made that stock plummet. Now, he may have lost his place. Onana's absence from the United squad when Arsenal visited Old Trafford in last weekend's Premier League opener was understandable. The 29-year-old missed the entirety of pre-season after suffering a hamstring injury in training and only took part in three sessions before the 1-0 defeat. Altay Bayindir started against the Gunners, but his unattractive role in the winning goal sparked questions over his status for the Fulham trip. For the latest breaking stories and headlines, sign up to our Daily Express MUFC newsletter, or join our WhatsApp community here.\n\nOnana was among the travelling party that caught the train down to London, raising further questions about his potential return. But Amorim stuck with Bayindir at Craven Cottage, a decision that felt notable, considering how favoured the Cameroonian has been since 2023. Bayindir was, again, unconvincing from corners but made some eye-catching contributions against Fulham. The Turk denied Josh King and Alex Iwobi with strong saves in the first half, raising confidence in his shot-stopping ability. He should have also recorded an assist through a pinpoint long ball for Matheus Cunha, who brought it down brilliantly but fired an effort straight at Bernd Leno. For the latest breaking stories and headlines, sign up to our Daily Express transfer newsletter.\n\nMeanwhile, in the background, United are closing in on the signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens after agreeing on personal terms. The M16 giants are in advanced talks with Antwerp over a transfer fee, and Lammens missed their 2-1 win against Mechelen earlier on Sunday to prevent the risk of injury. Once the 23-year-old arrives at Old Trafford, Onana could find himself third in Amorim's goalkeeper pecking order. That is the last place he wants to be with the Africa Cup of Nations coming up this winter and the World Cup on the agenda next summer. Between Bayindir's current superior status and Lammens' inevitable arrival, Onana has something to think about over the coming week.",
