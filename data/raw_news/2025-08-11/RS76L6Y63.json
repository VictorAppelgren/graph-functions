  "content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nThe big picture: Researchers from the Universities of Birmingham and Warwick in the United Kingdom estimate that roughly 80 websites selling cheats for online video games generate between $12 million and $73 million annually. Although some cheats can bypass robust (and often unpopular) anti-cheating software, these tend to be more expensive.\n\nBattlefield 6 open beta players on PC have encountered cheaters despite the game's controversial requirement that users enable Windows Secure Boot. While the situation might make strict anti-cheat solutions seem ineffective, recent research suggests they still help by increasing the cost of cheating.\n\nThe researchers analyzed public forums for Engine Owning, Sky Cheats, and numerous other cheat storefronts. They found that between 30,000 and 174,000 customers pay between $10 and $240 per month for software that gives them an unfair advantage in games such as Fortnite, Call of Duty, Rainbow Six Siege, Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, Escape From Tarkov, and other popular titles.\n\nEngine Owning is the most popular, receiving around 500,000 visitors each month \u2013 likely because it offers some of the cheapest cheats, priced between $10 and $20. Notably, the difficulty of circumventing a game's anti-cheat protections has more influence on a cheat's price than the game's popularity.\n\nThis data may support the use of the strictest anti-cheat measures in upcoming titles such as Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Both games will require Windows Secure Boot, and Black Ops 7 will also require TPM 2.0. These methods check for anomalies upon system startup, effectively serving as kernel-level anti-cheat.\n\nSome players oppose kernel-level anti-cheat because granting any program access to the deepest layer of a PC's operating system significantly increases the risk to users if the software is compromised or if developers make an error. The recent CrowdStrike disaster, which prompted Microsoft to reconsider allowing kernel-level security, is a notable example.\n\nAlthough even kernel-level anti-cheat cannot completely eliminate cheating, Battlefield publisher EA still considers it worthwhile. Players began sharing footage of cheating almost immediately after the open beta launched, but EA reported catching around 330,000 cheaters, detecting tens of thousands daily.\n\nThe company says it never intended the Secure Boot requirement to be a cure-all, and recent research suggests it may still help curb cheating by making it more costly.",

      "text": "[UPDATE] Battlefield 6 Update: On Secure Boot & Cheats\nHey folks,\nAC from the SPEAR Anti-Cheat Team here, hope everyone's having fun in the Battlefield 6 Open Beta!\nI wanted to take a moment to acknowledge some of the feedback around cheating in the game, especially around Secure Boot.\nOn Secure Boot, I want to be clear that Secure Boot is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet. Secure Boot is how you're helping us build up our arsenal. It\u2019s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do.\nThere are certain signals that we can only trust when Secure Boot is enabled, which we spoke of before in our previous posts, like here https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/600785827026563959/.\nOne example, Secure Boot prevents your machine from running with vulnerable drivers enabled. So if Secure Boot is running and we see those drivers loaded, we know something's a bit off.\nI also wanted to thank you all for taking the time to report cheaters, cheat programs and specific clips to us. Your reports help us zero in and lead us to finding up and coming cheat communities, reporting one actual cheater often can lead to new detection techniques and help us keep them from impacting your experience.\nSince Open Beta Early Access\u2019s launch:\n- Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls.\n- You\u2019ve reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today.\n- We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters.\nAnti-Cheat isn't one and done, it's an ever evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn't always work in all of them.\nI hope this helps, and please keep the reports coming in - we'll continue cleaning up the cheaters so you can have a fair game.\nWe\u2019re looking forward to the Open Beta tomorrow, and if you need to, the best way to help combat cheaters in Battlefield 6 is by reporting them via their profiles on the score screen.\nSee you on the Battlefield!\n- AC"
