  "title": "The Repair Shop's Will Kirk leaves new home as he goes 'back on the road'",
  "description": "The Repair Shop star Will Kirk has become a fan favourite on the BBC series.",
  "content": "The Repair Shop's Will Kirk has revealed he's \"back on the road\" during a journey to Scotland. The TV personality and carpentry specialist relocated to Surrey with his wife, Polly Snowdon, and their children last year, bidding farewell to their London residence. He has shared occasional glimpses of himself renovating their new property and subsequently posted a message on Instagram telling followers that he was \"adjusting to life in the country.\" However, it appears Will is travelling once more - temporarily - due to his involvement with the BBC programme. The presenter shared photographs on Instagram of The Repair Shop van against a magnificent lake and countryside backdrop. In the post, he included an image of Scotland's flag and penned, \"Back on the road.\" Whilst Will didn't specify his activities, it's believed he was in Scotland for The Repair Shop, as he included hashtags such as \"#therepairshopontheroad\" and \"lochness\" in his post, reports Gloucestershire Live.\n\nThe programme is typically recorded at The Repair Shop workshop, though it also ventures out on location. Will and the fellow specialists use their expertise on a variety of thrilling assignments rather than having the work done for them. The presenter, 40, has also been occupied with parenthood after he and Polly welcomed their second child last year. The couple had a daughter in July 2022, and their baby boy arrived in October 2024.\n\nWill revealed his son's birth on social media, accompanied by photographs of him holding the newborn's foot in his hands and of him carrying the infant from the hospital in a car seat. \"Three become four,\" he shared with his Instagram followers. \"I'm very proud of my lovely wife for the last nine months. \"Mum and baby are doing well, including an incredibly excited big sister.\" The Repair Shop is available to watch on BBC iPlayer.",
