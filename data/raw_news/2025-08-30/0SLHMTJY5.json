  "content": "Gold Reserve Provides Update on U.S. Government\u2019s Statement of Interest Supporting Venezuelan Opposition Government in Litigation Regarding Validity of 2020 PDVSA Bonds\n\nGold Reserve Ltd. (TSX.V: GRZ) (BSX: GRZ.BH) (OTCQX: GDRZF) (\u201cGold Reserve\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces that on August 29, 2025, the U.S. Government filed a Statement of Interest in the pending New York federal court litigation regarding the validity of the 2020 PDVSA bonds.\n\nThe key question in the litigation is whether the 2020 PDVSA bonds are invalid under Venezuelan law and, if so, the consequences of this invalidity. The 2020 PDVSA Bonds were issued by the Maduro regime in October 2016, but the 2015 National Assembly of Venezuela has issued multiple resolutions supporting the conclusion that the 2020 bonds are invalid under Venezuelan law.\n\nIn its Statement of Interest, the U.S. Government \u201caffirmed its recognition of, and firm support for, the 2015 National Assembly of Venezuela as the government of Venezuela,\u201d and stated that the \u201c2015 National Assembly is the only government duly elected by the Venezuelan people.\u201d Accordingly, the views of the 2015 National Assembly regarding Venezuelan law should be given \u201crespectful consideration\u201d by the New York court. In conclusion, the U.S. Government stated:\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the United States respectfully (1) advises the Court of its recognition of and support for the 2015 National Assembly as the government of Venezuela; (2) urges the Court to accord respectful consideration to the Republic\u2019s views as required by Animal Science Products; and (3) takes no position on the legal issues in the parties\u2019 pending cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nA copy of the Statement of Interest can be found here.\n\nThis release contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of applicable U.S. federal securities laws and \u201cforward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities laws and state Gold Reserve\u2019s and its management\u2019s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions for the future. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management at this time, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies.
