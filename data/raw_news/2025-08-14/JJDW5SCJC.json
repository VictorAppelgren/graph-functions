  "content": "Washington, D.C., Police Chief Pamela Smith issued an executive order giving limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities on Thursday.\n\nThe move comes after the recent federal takeover of the department and the sending of National Guard troops to curb crime and homelessness in the capital.\n\nAccording to the order, Metropolitan Police Department officers can now help with \"sharing information about persons not in MPD custody\" such as during \"traffic stops\" and can provide \"transportation for federal immigration agency employees and detained subjects,\" according to NBC 4 Washington.\n\n\u2018RADICAL\u2019 DC OFFICIALS TREATED OFFICERS \u2018LIKE CRAP,\u2019 POLICE LEADER SAYS \u2013 7 ATTACKS THAT LED TO TRUMP TAKEOVER\n\nHowever, the order says personnel cannot \"make any inquiry through any database solely for the purpose of inquiring about an individual's immigration status.\"\n\n\"Members shall not make inquiries into any person's immigration status for the purpose of determining whether they have violated the civil immigration laws or for the purpose of enforcing civil immigration laws,\" the order stated.\n\n\"Members shall not arrest individuals based solely on federal immigration warrants or detainers as long as there is no additional criminal warrant or underlying offense for which the individual is subject to arrest,\" the order continued.\n\nI SUPPORT TRUMP TAKING CONTROL OF DC POLICE \u2014 THE CONSTITUTION IS ON HIS SIDE\n\nThe capital is considered a sanctuary city, which Mayor Muriel Bowser tried to get scrapped earlier this year, according to Axios.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE\n\n\"Excellent news. America\u2019s capital city should not be a sanctuary for lawlessness,\" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, tweeted.\n\nThe federal takeover of the police department was announced by President Donald Trump on Monday, and there\u2019s been a heightened law enforcement presence throughout the city, including the National Guard at places like Union Station.\n\nAG PAM BONDI MEETS WITH DC MAYOR AS TRUMP DISPATCHES NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS IN CAPITAL\n\nOn Wednesday night alone, there were 45 arrests, and 29 of them were people in the country illegally, as numerous federal agencies are taking part in the major crackdown.\n\nWhile the takeover has been praised by Republicans and some D.C. residents, many Democrats have been vocally opposed. The move was prompted in large part by juvenile criminal activity throughout the city in recent months.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The Administration\u2019s actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful. There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year,\" D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb posted to X on Monday. \"We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.",

  "summary": "Washington, D.C., Police Chief Pamela Smith has issued an executive order limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This follows the recent federal takeover of the department and the deployment of National Guard troops to combat crime and homelessness in the capital. The order allows for officers to assist in sharing information about individuals not in custody and providing transportation for federal immigration agency employees and detained subjects. However, it also stipulates that they cannot make inquiries into individuals' immigration status based solely on federal immigration warrants or detainers. The move has been praised by Republicans and some D.c. residents, but many Democrats have voiced opposition.",

      "text": "Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser and the city's police chief traveled to Justice Department headquarters on Tuesday to meet with Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior administration officials to discuss the temporary National Guard takeover in the nation's capital.\nThe meeting came hours after President Donald Trump announced plans Monday to temporarily federalize law enforcement in the nation's capital, both through deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops, and taking control in the near-term of the city's local police force.\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting, Bowser said the sit-down was focused on coordination and strategy with the federal government.\n\"What I\u2019m focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have,\" Bowser said. \"We have the best in the business with [Metropolitan Police Chief] Pamela Smith to lead that effort, and to make sure that the men and women who are coming from federal law enforcement are being well-used, and that if there\u2019s National Guard here they\u2019re being well-used.\"\nIS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nThe meeting with Bondi and other senior Trump officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and U.S. Marshals Service Director Gady Serralta, came after Trump on Monday announced plans to use a 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act provision to send National Guard troops to D.C., as part of an effort to \"reestablish law order and public safety\" and temporarily federalize the city.\nD.C. officials, for their part, also urged calm on Tuesday, with Chief Smith stressing to reporters that they regularly work alongside federal law enforcement officials. \"I think this is going to be a good effort,\" she said Tuesday.\n\"It's going to be an effort that's supported by both teams, the Metropolitan Police Department, as well as our federal partners,\" she said.\n\"What we've done at this point is we have provided the team \u2013 the administrator \u2013 with a strategic plan on how we will provide resources around our city,\" she said.\n\"I think it's something that is doable. We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our streets, and if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better.\"\nFBI OUSTS FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, AGENT INVOLVED IN J6 PROSECUTIONS, WITH MORE EXPECTED\nThe effort was separately praised by Bondi, who described the sit-down with Bowser on social media as \"productive.\"\n\"We agreed that there is nothing more important than keeping residents and tourists in Washington, D.C., safe from deadly crime,\" Bondi said on Tuesday. \"At President Trump\u2019s direction, @TheJusticeDept will work closely with D.C. city government and [the] @DCPoliceDept to make Washington, D.C. safe again.\"\nTrump has long vowed to \"clean up\" D.C., a goal he has stressed since his first term in office.\nTrump in March signed an executive order, \"Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force,\" designed to address issues with a city he has long derided as \"filthy,\" \"horribly run\" and \"crime-ridden,\" among other things.\n\"We want to have a great, safe capital,\" he told reporters earlier this year. \"And we\u2019re going to have it. And that includes cleanliness and it includes other things.\"\nBowser stressed at a press conference Monday that crime rates have fallen in the city, pointing to preliminary figures compiled by the D.C. Police Department and released earlier this year.\nSince then, \"We haven\u2019t taken our foot off the gas,\" Bowser said Monday. She said D.C. is continuing its efforts to fight violent crime, even without the authorities of a full state.\n\"I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised\" by the Trump administration's efforts, Bowser said during the press conference Monday. \"I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMeanwhile, the DC Police Union also said Monday that it supported the administration taking over the police force, but stressed they backed the move only so long as it is a \"temporary measure.\""

      "text": "President Donald Trump announced Monday that his administration would take over the District of Columbia police and also deploy 800 national guard soldiers and new federal law enforcement units in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\"This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\" Trump said at a White House news conference flanked by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior administration officials. \"It\u2019s going to be a model. And then we\u2019ll look at other cities also. But other cities are studying what we\u2019re doing,\" Trump said. \"We\u2019re going to have a safe, beautiful capital, and it\u2019s going to happen very quickly.\"\nDemocratic leaders responded with their usual eloquence. \"Violent crime in Washington, D.C. is at a thirty-year low. Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., posted on X.\nRepeating the same talking point as many other elected Democrats, Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., questioned Trump\u2019s move by comparing it to his delay in calling out the National Guard to step the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\nUS ATTORNEY PIRRO SAYS ADMINISTRATION WON\u2019T TOLERATE \u2018OUT OF CONTROL\u2019 CRIME IN THE NATION\u2019S CAPITAL\nDespite Democratic complaints, few should question the need for greater public safety in our nation\u2019s inner cities. But under our federal system, crime remains the purview of the states. \"The regulation and punishment of intrastate violence\u2026 has always been the province of the States,\" the Supreme Court observed in United States v. Morrison (2000). As the great Chief Justice John Marshall declared a century ago, Congress \"has no general right to punish murder committed within any of the States,\" and it is \"clear [that] congress cannot punish felonies generally.\"\nCriminal justice sits at the very core of the states\u2019 police power \u2013 their general right to regulate the people and activity within their borders \u2013 aside from the specific, narrow areas (such as regulating interstate commerce) delegated by the Constitution to the federal government.\nAll laws in the District of Columbia are federal laws. If the mayor and city officials are allowing rising crime, especially because of lenient laws and policies toward offenders, the president should intervene.\nBut that is not the case with Washington, D.C. The Constitution specifically creates the District of Columbia as a city beyond the power of any state. As James Madison explained in Federalist No. 43, the \"seat of government\" must fall only under the power of the nation. Otherwise, he warned, \"the public authority might be insulted, and its proceedings interrupted with impunity,\" and the state where the capital resided \"might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonourable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other [states].\" The Framers wanted the national government located in a city that would not be under any partisan control.\nTRUMP ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO ADDRESS \u2018TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL\u2019 CRIME IN WASHINGTON\nBut in 1973, Congress passed a Home Rule Act (with President Richard Nixon\u2019s support) that created a mayor, a city council, and some limited rights to self-government.\nThis was a constitutional error.\nUnder the Constitution, there is no true local government in D.C.; the entire city is but a subdivision of the national government. Trump\u2019s takeover of the D.C. police and his deployment of troops and federal law enforcement does not intrude on any rights of local government because, unlike the case with deployment of troops in Los Angeles earlier this year, there is no need to pay respect to a state\u2019s sovereignty.\nThe president needs no state\u2019s permission to deploy U.S. troops and federal law enforcement to protect federal property, facilities, and personnel.\nEven if D.C. home rule did not run contrary to the Framers\u2019 design for the nation\u2019s only federal city, Trump would still have authority to take Monday\u2019s action. The president has an obligation to ensure public safety in D.C. Under Article II of the Constitution, the president has the duty to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\"\nAll laws in the District of Columbia are federal laws. If the mayor and city officials are allowing rising crime, especially because of lenient laws and policies toward offenders, the president should intervene. He has the constitutional responsibility to restore common-sense law enforcement methods that will protect those who work and live in Washington.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe 1973 Home Rule Act itself, even if it is constitutional, recognizes the president\u2019s authority. It allows him to take over the D.C. police for 30 days in the case of an emergency. The president could declare the high number of murders \u2013 the capital city has always had one of the nation\u2019s highest murder rates, and currently sits at the fourth highest \u2013 an emergency. While murders in 2024 fell, they were coming down from a pandemic high; murders in D.C. are still far higher than the 2012 low. In any event, the Home Rule Act provision only applies to the D.C. police; the Act does not \u2013 and could not \u2013 limit the president\u2019s authority to deploy troops or the FBI to protect the federal city.\nPresident Trump\u2019s decision to restore law and order in the District of Columbia is only the first step. He can take the necessary second step by working with Congress to end home rule and restore the control of the elected branches of government over the District.\nJust as he has asserted his control over the bureaucracy by firing agency heads, he could test the constitutional waters by removing the mayor and other D.C. officials. They, too, are only assistants to the president who help him fulfill his responsibility to execute federal law; if they fail to perform, he can and should replace them.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA half-century ago, Congress and the president gave in to the misguided idea that residents of D.C. had a democratic right to manage their own affairs. But the Framers did not want D.C. to fall under anyone\u2019s partisan control, especially those who would use their control of the District to influence the federal government itself (recall the harassment of Trump officials that went unpunished during his first term).\nTrump and Congress should admit that home rule has failed and start making D.C. the great federal city it should be."

      "text": "Immigration: What to know about border security, US immigration policy and more\nImmigration in the United States has become a controversial topic in the political arena. There are several steps one must take to become a U.S. citizen, which are outlined on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. These steps include preparing an application for naturalization, paying fees, completing an interview and taking the oath of allegiance to the United States.\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration prioritized securing the border and cracking down on the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the country. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is the federal agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws. Since beginning his second term in the White House, Trump has worked to initiate the deportation of undocumented immigrants.\nThousands of people gathered in downtown Los Angeles for protest demonstrations over immigration. The scene turned from peaceful to violent as rising unrest prompted police to deploy tear gas. The Los Angeles immigration protests were among other nationwide protests against federal immigration raids conducted by ICE agents. California Gov. has continued to blame Trump for the escalating protests, claiming that they were peaceful demonstrations before the National Guard and Trump's rhetoric intensified the conflict.\n\u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d the nation's newest detention facility for undocumented immigrants, is located in the Florida Everglades and surrounded by swampland teeming with alligators and pythons. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis authorized the construction of the detention center on a 30-square-mile property in the swamplands of Miami-Dade County under an emergency order in June 2025. The property, a former airport, has been outfitted with sturdy tent structures to house 5,000 undocumented immigrants amid the Trump administration's deportation blitz to remove the millions of migrants who entered the country during the Biden administration."

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Monday moved to federalize policing in the nation's capital, following years of unchecked violent crime in Washington, D.C.\nThe polarizing move has caused an uproar from opponents, and celebrations from supporters who want to see an end to violence in the city. The move comes after Washington has garnered national attention with a string of high-profile incidents in recent months and years that precipitated Trump's move.\nHowever, not everyone agrees with Trump's new plan.\nFox News contributor and former D.C. homicide detective Ted Williams is among those who oppose the federal intervention. \"While the president may mean well, this is going nowhere fast,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"D.C. is not a war zone. The lawsuits for constitutional violations are coming. This is overkill.\"\nHe also said criminals will just wait out the federalization, and return when National Guard troops are pulled from the streets.\n\"Jo Jo and his boys are going on vacation and will return after this crazy experiment ends.\"\nNational Fraternal Order of Police President Joe Gamaldi likes Trump's plan.\n\"Their average homicide rate has doubled in the last 10 years. They used to average less than 100 homicides. Now they average over 200,\" Gamaldi said, a claim which is backed up by the city's own data.\n\"And it's because you have a radical element on that city council that has defunded their police. They have embraced revolving door criminal justice policies. And frankly, they treated the hardworking men and women of law enforcement in that town like crap. So, of course, they need help. You have to do something, otherwise it's going to get out of control.\"\nBelow is a list of some of the most notorious crimes the city has seen.\n1. Ex-DOGE staffer beaten by teens in attempted carjacking\nIn the early morning hours of Aug. 3, an ex-Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer was beaten during an attempted carjacking in the city's Logan Circle neighborhood.\nEdward Coristine, known as \"Big Balls,\" was confronted by a group of teens while out with his significant other. Police said he pushed the woman into his vehicle to protect her and bore the brunt of the wrath of the criminals.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nNearby patrol officers intervened, and the attackers escaped on foot, but not before Coristine was left bloodied.\nA 15-year-old male and a 15-year-old female have been arrested in connection with the crime. They face charges of unarmed carjacking.\n2. Congressional intern shot dead\nEric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, was shot June 30 on the 1200 block of 7th Street, Northwest. He died a day later. He was a student at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst and was interning for Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan.\nSeveral people exited a vehicle and began firing shots. The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) said Tarpinian-Jachym was not the target of the shooting.\nA 16-year-old male and an adult female were shot, but both survived. The FBI is assisting MPD in the case's investigation. No suspects have been captured.\n3. Two Israeli Embassy staffers shot and killed\nOn May 21, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot and killed while leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum.\nThe victims were Yaron Lischinsky, an Israeli, and Sarah Milgrim, an American.\nElias Rodriguez, 31, of Chicago was captured immediately. He has been charged not only with the murders, but with federal hate crimes. He allegedly shouted \"Free, free Palestine!\" while in custody.\nTRUMP TO HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE ON DC CRIME AFTER FEDERAL AGENTS HIT STREETS\n4. Roving teen mob wreaks havoc in Navy Yard neighborhood\nOn the night of May 17, a mob of about 100 teenagers terrorized the Navy Yard neighborhood a block from Nationals Park.\nIt was the second such teen takeover in less than a month.\nAt about 8 p.m., police began receiving calls about disorderly conduct, but the situation quickly turned violent. One group of teens beat two bystanders, punching them, knocking them to the ground and then stomping on them, according to WUSA9.\nA similar fight broke out later. Fox News Digital obtained video of the incident:\n5. Senior congressional staffer carjacked, robbed in Navy Yard\nOn May 9, a staffer from California Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs' office was the victim of an armed carjacking in the Navy Yard neighborhood.\nThe staffer, who remained unnamed, was robbed of a government-issued iPhone, MacBook, ID and Capitol parking pass.\nThe next day, the car was recovered, and a 15-year-old juvenile male of Washington was charged with armed carjacking, and a 14-year-old juvenile male of Maryland was charged with carrying a pistol without a license and unauthorized use of a vehicle.\n6. House Democrat carjacked at gunpoint in Navy Yard\nIn late 2023, Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, was carjacked by armed, masked men outside an apartment building that is a popular residence for members of congress, also in the Navy Yard neighborhood.\nAt the time, Cuellar said he made the conscious decision not to fight back for his own safety.\nHe condemned the crime, calling the criminals \"punks with guns,\" and touched on soft-on-crime policies, noting that if criminals are put in jail, \"you've got to lock them up and keep them there.\"\n7. House Democrat assaulted in apartment elevator\nIn February 2023, Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., was attacked in the elevator of her apartment in the nation's capital.\nPolice identified 26-year-old Kendrick Hamlin as the suspect. Craig said Hamlin punched her in the chin and grabbed her by the neck.\nCraig said she fended him off with the hot cup of coffee she was carrying.\nTRUMP ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO ADDRESS \u2018TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL\u2019 CRIME IN WASHINGTON\nOther recent violent crimes include the 2023 beating death of a homeless man with a metal pipe near the Ellipse in Washington's downtown, and a Metropolitan Area Transit Authority police officer who was stabbed in the face near the D.C.

Police Chief Pamela Smith has issued an executive order allowing limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities, following President Trump's federal takeover of the police department to address rising crime and homelessness. The order permits Metropolitan Police officers to share information during traffic stops but prohibits them from inquiring about immigration status or making arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. This move has sparked mixed reactions, with supporters praising efforts to enhance public safety, while opponents argue it undermines local governance and civil rights.",
