  "content": "Prince William\u2018s reluctance to call a truce with his estranged brother Prince Harry stems from lingering concerns about Meghan Markle, according to a royal expert who spoke to Fox News in an August 19 report.\n\nIngrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, described the 43-year-old Prince of Wales and other family members as harboring a \u201cpersistent lack of trust\u201d toward the 44-year-old Duchess of Sussex. The royal expert called Meghan \u201cthe flea in the ointment\u201d in the brothers\u2019 fractured relationship, noting fears that private family conversations could later become public or be exploited for commercial purposes.\n\nSeward pointed to what she sees as a troubling pattern in Meghan\u2019s own family. The expert told the outlet that due to the duchess\u2019s estrangement from her own father, Thomas Markle, he has never met his grandchildren \u2014 Prince Archie, 6, and Princess Lilibet 4 \u2014 and that raises broader concerns about her character. (Royal watchers will recall Meghan cut her father off after learning he staged paparazzi photos of himself in the days leading up to her 2018 wedding.)\n\nThe rift between the brothers deepened significantly after Harry, 40, and Meghan stepped back from royal duties in 2020 and relocated to Montecito, California. The couple subsequently aired their grievances through high-profile interviews, a Netflix documentary series, and Harry\u2019s memoir Spare.\n\nAdding to the ongoing tensions, the Suits alum\u2019s Netflix lifestyle series \u201cWith Love, Meghan\u201d returns for Season 2 on August 26, potentially reigniting media attention around the couple\u2019s high-profile brand-building efforts.\n\nIn spite of the bad blood, \u201cI feel that [the royal rift] won\u2019t go on forever,\u201d added Seward. \u201cI just feel that at some stage\u2026 they will begin to come together.\u201d",

      "text": "Meghan Markle is said to be a major factor in the ongoing feud between Prince William and Prince Harry.\nThe claim was made by Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and author of \"My Mother and I.\" Seward, who has been writing about the royal family for over 20 years, claimed to Fox News Digital that William, heir to the British throne, is aware of how supporters of the monarchy in the U.K. feel about the Duchess of Sussex.\nFox News Digital reached out to Kensington Palace for comment.\n\"The flea in the ointment really is very much Meghan,\" Seward claimed to Fox News Digital. \"She\u2019s disliked intensely by a large number of the monarchists of this country. They see her as being very\u2026 damaging to the royal family. And also, I think a lot of people in America feel the same. They don\u2019t like that Meghan [reportedly] dissed her husband\u2019s family and dissed her own family.\"\n\"It\u2019s just extraordinary to think that her children have not met their grandfather,\" Seward shared, referring to former Hollywood lighting director Thomas Markle.\n\"I think people in the States find that extremely odd, and [we] find it very odd here. And I think that\u2019s a real black mark against Meghan\u2019s character. I think she hasn\u2019t been able to embrace\u2026 her own family, however much she feels about them. I mean, Harry\u2019s never even met her father, which is extraordinary.\"\n\"There are a lot of difficult emotions [to] get over there,\" Seward added.\nBritish royal expert Hilary Fordwich also told Fox News Digital that many in the U.K. have \"an unfavorable\" view of the Duchess, 44.\n\"Persistent lack of trust is the main reason why senior royals remain reluctant to engage in reconciliation efforts,\" she claimed. \"Their concerns are well-founded, that any private family discussions could become public or be used for commercial projects\u2026 [Meghan]\u2026 has no sense of duty toward the British public nor the institution.\"\nWATCH: PRINCE WILLIAM\u2019S MISTRUST OF MEGHAN MARKLE STALLS PEACE WITH PRINCE HARRY: AUTHOR\nSeward and Fordwich\u2019s claims came shortly after People magazine reported in a cover story that William and Harry continue to go \"on separate paths\" with no communication between them.\n\"The rift is very profound and very long-lasting,\" Robert Lacey, author of \"Battle of Brothers,\" told the outlet. \"It will not be changed, in my opinion, until Harry makes a move and apologizes.\"\nInsiders also told the outlet that Harry\u2019s calls and messages to William had gone unanswered.\nSeward pointed out to Fox News Digital that William has \"taken a firm stance\" in keeping his distance amid the couple\u2019s tell-alls in recent years. However, Harry has made it clear that his brother was \"unpleasant\" to Meghan, she argued.\n\"Harry thinks that William insulted Meghan,\" said Seward. \"I think when you have that kind of animosity, it\u2019s really hard to [get around it]. I just don\u2019t see any kind of reparation. I just don\u2019t see it at this moment.\"\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior royals in 2020, citing the unbearable intrusions of the British press and a lack of support from the palace. Following their move to California that year, the couple aired their grievances in interviews and documentaries.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\nIn 2023, Harry wrote a memoir, \"Spare,\" where he recounts a long-standing sibling rivalry that worsened after he began a relationship with the former American actress, whom he married in 2018.\nHe said that during an argument in 2019, William called Meghan \"difficult\" and \"rude,\" then grabbed him by the collar and knocked him down. Harry suffered cuts and bruises from landing on a dog bowl.\nNeither Buckingham Palace nor Kensington Palace have commented on any of the allegations.\nRoyal expert Richard Fitzwilliams claimed to Fox News Digital that \"a mistrust of Meghan\" is \"a major reason\" why William won\u2019t engage with his brother, but only one of many.\n\"William feels Harry has betrayed the royal family,\" Fitzwilliams explained. \"Given\u2026 the personal attacks on him in the memoir \u2018Spare,\u2019 reconciliation is likely to be a tough call with the [Prince of Wales].\"\n\"There are some things which are not forgotten,\" Fitzwilliams warned. \"Of course, reconciliation is desirable and being in exile, which Harry is, is often very sad\u2026 The last time the brothers were together, at the memorial service for Lord Fellowes last August, they reportedly didn\u2019t speak. I doubt much has changed.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\nIn May of this year, Harry said he wanted to reconcile with his family after losing a court battle over his publicly funded security. The 40-year-old said his father, who is battling an undisclosed form of cancer, wouldn\u2019t speak to him.\n\"I would love reconciliation with my family. There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight anymore,\" said Harry. \"I don\u2019t know how much longer my father has.\"\nSeward said there\u2019s a good reason the king, 76, has also been keeping his distance.\n\"I think that Harry is\u2026 very saddened by the fact that he has failed to reconcile at least with his father,\" said Seward. \"But it is not that his father doesn\u2019t love him. It\u2019s because his father doesn\u2019t trust his son not to repeat what he says. He can\u2019t have that happen. So it\u2019s easier for [the royal family] to avoid the issue.\n\"It\u2019s human nature, really, to just avoid confrontation. If you can\u2019t deal with it, and you don\u2019t know how to deal with it, or if there\u2019s no way of dealing with it, you just avoid it. And you can do that easily when you have a very, very busy life.\"\nRoyal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital he remains hopeful the two families can eventually come together.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I believe it to be totally correct that members of the royal family do not trust Meghan,\" he said. \"And of course, she does not trust some members of the royal family in return\u2026 Also, if every member of the royal family [doesn\u2019t trust Meghan], then why did King Charles instigate a meeting with his senior advisor and that of Harry and Meghan\u2019s team? Is it all the royal family or is it perhaps William?\"\n\"I hope that Harry and Meghan are warmly welcomed back to Britain with their children,\" he added.\nBut Seward doesn\u2019t see Meghan, who is raising two children in California, returning to the U.K. anytime soon. The Duchess of Sussex is gearing up to launch Season 2 of her Netflix lifestyle series, \"With Love, Meghan.\"\n\"I don\u2019t think that Meghan has any intention of wanting to come back and live in the U.K.,\" she said. \"Why should she? She\u2019s got a beautiful house in Montecito. She\u2019s got a lot of work in LA. Her friends are there. Her life is there. Why would she want to come back here? No reason at all. I certainly wouldn\u2019t if I were her. Why would you come back to a country where people really didn\u2019t like you or want you?\"\nStill, Seward noted that Princess Diana \"would\u2019ve hated the idea that her boys weren\u2019t speaking to each other.\" Harry\u2019s glamorous mother died in August 1997 at age 36 from injuries she sustained in a car crash.\n\"I think she would\u2019ve been the one person that could have brought them together, possibly,\" said Seward.\n\"They never would\u2019ve fallen out. But\u2026 Harry has always been very conscious of the fact that he\u2019s \u2018the spare.\u2019 As we know, he wrote a book about it. And not just that, but he kept mentioning it. And William has always been rather jealous that Harry had all the fun without the responsibility of being a future monarch.\"\n\"I feel that [this] won\u2019t go on forever,\" said Seward. \"I just feel that at some stage\u2026 they will begin to come together.\"\nPeople magazine reported that Harry is expected to be back in the U.K. in September. He\u2019ll be supporting WellChild, a charity that helps children with life-limiting conditions. It\u2019s unknown whether Harry will reunite with at least his father.\n\"This is the sadness of it \u2013 [the brothers] aren\u2019t supporting each other like they should be,\" a source close to the royal household told the outlet. \"That\u2019s what any mother would want \u2013 that they are there for each other.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "Royal experts say Prince William\u2019s hesitation to reconcile with Prince Harry stems largely from lingering mistrust of Meghan Markle, whom they describe as a \u2018flea in the ointment\u2019 that could turn private family talks into public or commercial fodder.  They point to Meghan\u2019s estrangement from her own father and her children\u2019s lack of contact with their grandfather as evidence of character concerns, and note that the brothers\u2019 rift deepened after Harry\u2019s 2020 departure and subsequent memoir.  Despite the tension, some experts remain hopeful that the brothers will eventually mend ties, while others predict the feud will persist until a significant gesture from Harry or a change in public sentiment.  The situation has been amplified by Meghan\u2019s Netflix series and ongoing media coverage of the couple\u2019s brand\u2011building efforts.",
