  "content": "Investors appear to be expecting another extension of the China deadline-anything other than that could be a shock.\n\nGold logs biggest daily price drop in 3 months, as Trump says it won't be subject to tariffs\n\nGold prices fell in anticipation of Monday's clarification from the White House on excluding gold from tariffs.\n\nAlmost every investor in this survey says U.S. stocks are overvalued as 70% expect stagflation\n\nSeven in 10 investors say the economy is heading for stagflation, though their investment choices are not entirely consistent with a mix of higher inflation and low growth.\n\nCar Buyers Are Showing Up to Auto Lots With Cash to Spend\n\nThe consumer economy is cooling and car prices remain vastly higher from just a few years ago. But there is little sign that sticker shock at dealers' lots is straining affordability, according to the head of auto lending at JPMorgan's commercial bank.\n\nAmerican Companies Are Buying Their Own Stocks at a Record Pace\n\nBuybacks are expected to top $1.1 trillion in 2025, led by big banks and tech firms.\n\nCustomers have been spared most of the tariff costs so far, Goldman Sachs finds\n\nA new analysis finds that U.S. consumers have absorbed only a small portion of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration - but Goldman Sachs expects that to change in the months ahead.\n\nThe alternative blueprint to end the war comes after Russia demanded major territorial concessions and President Trump said he would meet with Vladimir Putin this week.\n\nChinese property stocks rose after Beijing scrapped longstanding restrictions on the number of homes city residents can buy in suburban areas.\n\nThe proposed semiconductor tariffs-and exemptions-don't line up with their supposed purpose.\n\nA New Generation of 'Buy the Dip' Investors Is Propping Up the Market\n\nThe resilience of individual investors may signal something more than just misplaced optimism.\n\nInflation Up or Down? What About Jobs? The Agency That Should Know Is on the Rocks\n\nTrump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' leader compounds a yearslong struggle to modernize methods and maintain resources.",

  "summary": "Investors are expecting another extension of the China trade deal deadline, with gold prices falling in anticipation of the White House's decision to exclude gold from tariffs. A survey by nearly every investor in the survey found that U.S. stocks are overvalued and 70% expect stagflation. The consumer economy is cooling and car prices are higher, but there is little sign of sticker shock at dealers' lots. American companies are expected to buy their own stocks at a record pace, with total stock buybacks expected to exceed $1.1 trillion in 2025. The proposed semiconductor tariffs and exemptions don't align with their intended purpose.",

A significant majority of investors believe U.S. stocks are overvalued and foresee stagflation, although their investment strategies reflect mixed signals. Meanwhile, American companies are engaging in record stock buybacks, and consumers have largely avoided the burden of tariffs so far, according to Goldman Sachs.",
