  "description": "What tea will Newsom, Padilla spill on our stage?",
  "content": "TALK OF THE TOWN \u2014 POLITICO is hosting the hottest ticket in town this afternoon with its first-ever California policy summit featuring a host of the state\u2019s most important political minds.\n\nOur agenda features in-depth conversations about the top challenges facing the Golden State, including its redistricting wars, the 2026 race for governor, artificial intelligence safety and the housing shortage. Don\u2019t miss this special event: Register here to watch the livestream starting at 12:30 p.m.\n\nAmong the powerbrokers and policy experts joining us onstage:\n\nThe governor, a likely 2028 presidential contender who has embraced a provocative new social media persona to get under President Donald Trump\u2019s skin, will sit down with Christopher Cadelago for a wide-ranging discussion.\n\nNewsom has little more than a year left in his term as governor, but he\u2019s hardly a lame duck. He\u2019s leading the campaign for Proposition 50, California\u2019s ballot initiative to counter Texas Republicans\u2019 gerrymandered congressional map. He\u2019s repeatedly accused Trump of being an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d leader as he fights the president\u2019s ICE sweeps and troop deployments on U.S. soil. And he\u2019s suing to block Trump\u2019s see-sawing tariffs.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla: Could he upend the governor\u2019s race?\n\nPadilla will speak with David Siders, a conversation that comes amid rumblings that Padilla is contemplating a bid for California governor. As our colleagues broke this week, the senator hasn\u2019t ruled it out and a prominent political entity in Sacramento is polling with his name included. Padilla, who\u2019s generally kept a low profile in the Senate, made national headlines when he was tackled by federal agents at a Department of Homeland Security news conference in June.\n\n\n\nPorter, a front-runner in the governor\u2019s race, will speak with Melanie Mason. The former representative has seized momentum in the race since former Vice President Kamala Harris announced she wouldn\u2019t run. Porter is trying to keep it that way as she looks to smooth over her relationships with tech executives and others who helped sink her Senate bid last year. But can Porter, the white-board-wielding prosecutor of corporate CEOs, move to the middle without alienating her more liberal-leaning base?\n\nFormer HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra: Trying to break through\n\nBecerra, the former Health and Human Services secretary and former state attorney general, will also speak with Melanie, a conversation that comes as he competes for oxygen in an extra-crowded governor\u2019s race. He\u2019s leaned into his resume on health care issues, including his work to lower drug prices. Still, Becerra trails Porter in both early polling and fundraising.\n\nFormer Fox News host Steve Hilton: Can he break Democrats\u2019 grip?\n\nHilton, a conservative author and candidate for governor, will speak with Dustin about why he thinks California needs to break its trend of electing Democrats to solve its most intractable problems, from homelessness to crushing unaffordability. California hasn\u2019t elected a Republican statewide since 2006, when then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger won a second term. Hilton is known for his wonk-like focus on policy issues like the state\u2019s housing crisis and business regulations \u2014 and he\u2019s eager to put the party in power on notice.\n\nGOOD MORNING.

Or drop us a line at [email protected] and [email protected], or on X \u2014 @DustinGardiner and @jonesblakej.\n\nHOF DRAMA \u2014 Alumni of Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s administration gathered at the California Museum on Monday expecting to hear their former boss would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame, our Jeremy B. White writes.\n\nBut the Republican former governor\u2019s name was conspicuously absent from the list Newsom read off during a reception previewing the incoming class, according to an attendee granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive situation \u2014 a seeming omission that raised questions about whether Schwarzenegger\u2019s vocal opposition to Newsom\u2019s gerrymandering push was a factor in the delay.\n\nNewsom spokesperson Bob Salladay declined to confirm who is on the list but said a planned unveiling of the full class had been delayed, likely until November \u2014 which would almost certainly mean after a Nov. 4 special election on a new House map drawn to squeeze out Republicans. A California Museum spokesperson directed inquiries to the governor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s being snubbed,\u201d Salladay said. \u201cThe list remains the same, and we\u2019re going to have a public announcement in a few months.\u201d\n\nBut the development stunned people in Schwarzenegger\u2019s orbit, some of whom had been invited to the event with the understanding that the former governor was going to be announced as an inductee. Read more from Jeremy\u2019s report. \n\n\n\n\u2018TWO-STATE SOLUTION\u2019 \u2014 Republican secession efforts are back in California, this time with some \u2026 interesting branding.\n\nAssembly Republican leader James Gallagher is proposing that red, inland swaths of California split off into a separate state, calling it a \u201ctwo-state solution.\u201d That is, of course, a term usually used to describe proposals to create separate Israeli and Palestinian states.\n\n\u201cThe people of inland California have been overlooked for too long,\u201d Gallagher said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a two state solution.\u201d\n\nAs our Nicole Norman reports, Gallagher plans to brief reporters on the plan this morning.\n\nGOP activists have in the past advocated for splitting off Republican territory from California\u2019s liberal coast, but the endorsement of the typically fringe movement from a top party official is rare. Gallagher\u2019s highly unlikely but attention-grabbing proposal would cut 35 counties from the state, leaving densely populated liberal bastions untouched.\n\n\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: WILL FOR INFILL \u2014 Reps. Laura Friedman (D-Calif.) and Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.) plan to introduce legislation today to exempt urban infill housing construction from the National Environmental Protection Act.\n\nThe proposal, summarized in a one pager obtained early by Playbook, would suspend the federal environmental rules for vacant city lands of 20 acres or less \u2014 aiming to speed development in housing-poor city centers. It would maintain required environmental assessments built into a different law and apply only to land mostly surrounded by development.\n\nFriedman\u2019s support for reduced environmental rules is the latest example of Democrats trying to balance their environmental bona fides with California\u2019s burgeoning YIMBY movement fueled by angst over its steep cost of living.\n\nShe has historically been an environmental stalwart, earning near perfect marks from the California Environmental Voters and voting against some YIMBY-backed housing bills during her time as a state legislator in Sacramento. But the infill exemption push punctuates a recent (if not total) alignment with YIMBY groups.\n\nIn July, she penned an Op-Ed with Rep. Scott Peters in which they pushed for California to reduce barriers to building housing near transit, even if she did not explicitly endorse a contentious proposal pending in the statehouse aimed at doing just that. (The head of her district\u2019s largest city, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, is opposed to the bill.)\n\n\u201cRep. Friedman has long been a staunch advocate of policy that focuses our growth near high quality mass transit,\u201d her communications director Zach Florman told Playbook in a statement when asked about the bill.\n\n\n\nOIL SLICK \u2014 California regulators are poised to shelve one of their most potent tools to bring the oil industry to heel \u2014 a profit cap on refiners. Read last night\u2019s California Climate to understand why environmental groups have been surprisingly muted, even as petroleum leaders celebrate the move.\n\n\n\nRAINING FRAUD ALLEGATIONS \u2014 Bill Pulte, a Floridian and home builder, has been the driving force behind Trump\u2019s campaign to inundate his political enemies with allegations of mortgage fraud. As the Los Angeles Times reports, Pulte is a fierce Trump loyalist who courted the president with campaign contributions and social-media praise before landing a role as head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n\nHe has used the position to refer multiple complaints of mortgage fraud against Trump\u2019s foes to the Justice Department, including allegations targeting Sen. Adam Schiff. The senator has denied any wrongdoing. A spokesperson said Schiff has always been transparent about splitting his time between his homes in California and the Washington suburbs, noting he wants to be able to raise his children near him in the capital.\n\nLONE STAR SUIT \u2014 California is not alone in facing lawsuits from opponents of its gerrymander. The NAACP and the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law are suing Texas Gov. Greg Abbott over his state\u2019s new Republican-favoring congressional maps, The Texas Tribune reports. The redraw, they argue, is racially discriminatory and would dilute the power of Black voters.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Dozens of undocumented Santa Ana residents could receive a quarter of a million dollars in immigration legal defense services under a contract recently approved by the City Council. (Voice of OC)\n\n\u2014 The law firm that helped Los Angeles maintain control of its homeless programs is looking for another $5 million. (LA Times)\n\n\u2014 Seven former students at a choir academy in Oakland allege that their Grammy-winning director sexually harassed and abused them \u2014 and that administrators ignored complaints. (San Francisco Chronicle)\n\n\n\nSPOTTED: CAP WEEKLY\u2019S 100 PARTY \u2014 Former Assembly Speakers John Perez and Bob Hertzberg, Sen. Tom Umberg, Assemblymember Gregg Hart, Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California President Jodi Hicks, redistricting expert Paul Mitchell, Donna Lucas of Lucas Public Affairs, Teri Holoman of the California Teachers Association, Brown administration alum Evan Westrup.\n\nKudos to our own Christopher Cadelago, who was named No. 89 on the list this year!\n\nPEOPLE MOVES \u2014 Jordan Dennison, former deputy finance director for the CA GOP and senior account manager at Axiom Strategies, is joining The Rosales Agency as public affairs & political director.\n\n\u2014 Eddie Mendoza has joined Sen. Adam Schiff\u2019s Senate office as policy and political adviser. A Hollywood native and founder of Pa\u2019lante Campaigns, Mendoza previously served in the offices of both the California Senate president pro tem and the Assembly speaker.\n\n\u2014 Chad E. Firetag, a retired judge for the Riverside Superior Court, has joined the panel at JAMS, the arbitration and mediation provider.\n\n\u2014 Juan Carlos Mora has joined the House Natural Resources Committee under Ranking Member Jared Huffman. He previously worked on the House Judiciary Committee under Ranking Member Jamie Raskin and is an alum of the offices of Sen. Padilla, Rep. Mike Thompson and former state Sen. Bill Dodd.\n\nIN MEMORIAM \u2014 Jeff Macedo, the longtime Sacramento communications pro who served Gov. Schwarzenegger, the California Charter Schools Association and Sutter Health, has passed away.\n\nWANT A SHOUT-OUT FEATURED? \u2014 Send us a birthday, career move or another special occasion to include in POLITICO\u2019s California Playbook.

      "text": "A Trump donor, now a regulator, leads effort to accuse president\u2019s foes of mortgage fraud\n- Share via\n- FHFA chief Bill Pulte has publicly accused individuals of potential criminality before a full, independent investigation has taken place.\n- A spokesperson for Sen. Adam Schiff said he has always followed the law \u2014 and advice from House counsel \u2014 in arranging his mortgages.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Behind a White House effort to saddle President Trump\u2019s political foes with accusations of mortgage fraud is a 37-year-old home construction executive with a deep partisan past.\nBill Pulte, a Florida native, rose in Trump\u2019s orbit toward the end of his first term. After courting Trump for years on social media and through generous donations, he now runs the Federal Housing Finance Agency \u2014 a perch that has allowed him to target prominent figures who have crossed the president.\nIn the last five months, Pulte has referred three claims of mortgage fraud against Trump\u2019s foes to the Justice Department, leveled against Letitia James, the attorney general of New York; Adam Schiff, the Democratic senator from California; and this week, Lisa Cook, a governor on the board of the Federal Reserve.\nEach has denied wrongdoing. Trump announced on Monday night that he was moving to fire Cook.\nIt is an unusual role for a director of the FHFA, which regulates Fannie Mae \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest company by assets \u2014 and Freddie Mac. The two mortgage financing organizations, which support nearly half of the U.S. residential mortgage market, were taken over by the FHFA during the 2008 economic crisis.\nThe grandson of one of Michigan\u2019s wealthiest and most prolific home builders, Pulte made a name for himself on Twitter in 2019 with public cash giveaways to individuals in need. He dubbed himself the \u201cinventor of Twitter philanthropy,\u201d vowing to give two cars away in exchange for a Trump retweet that year, which he received. He subsequently built a following of over 3 million.\nRecords show Pulte donated substantially to Trump, the Republican National Committee and related super PACs leading up to the 2024 election.\nPulte\u2019s letters to Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi have been tightly and cautiously written. But his social media posts, celebrating the targeted attacks, have not.\n\u201cTrump becomes the first president ever to remove a sitting Federal Reserve governor,\u201d he wrote on X, between retweets of right-wing commentators praising the move. \u201cMortgage fraud can carry up to 30 years in prison.\u201d\nIn another post on X, quoting a CNN headline, Pulte wrote that Trump\u2019s firing of Cook was \u201cescalating his battle against the central bank\u201d \u2014 seeming to acknowledge that targeting Cook was motivated by Trump\u2019s ongoing grievances with Fed leadership.\nBill Pulte at the Federal Housing Finance Agency is hitting Democrats with criminal mortgage fraud charges. Here\u2019s why they look ginned-up.\nCook\u2019s firing is legally dubious, and her attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that Cook plans on suing the administration while continuing to perform her duties for the Fed. Lowell also represents James in her defense against the Justice Department case.\nWhile the Supreme Court ruled in May that Trump may fire individuals from independent federal agencies, the justices singled out the Fed as an exception, calling it a \u201cuniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\u201d The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 states that the president may fire a member of its leadership only \u201cfor cause.\u201d\nBut cause has not been definitively established to fire Cook, with Pulte writing in his letter to Bondi that the Fed governor had only \u201cpotentially\u201d committed mortgage fraud, accusing her of falsifying bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms.\nPulte has accused Cook of listing two homes \u2014 in Ann Arbor, Mich., and in Atlanta \u2014 as her primary addresses within two weeks of purchasing them through financing. Cook said she would \u201ctake any questions about my financial history seriously\u201d and was \u201cgathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\u201d\nPulte\u2019s other accusations, against James and Schiff, have been similarly superficial, publicly accusing individuals of potential criminality before a full, independent investigation can take place.\nAnd whether those investigations will be impartial is far from clear. Earlier this month, Bondi appointed Ed Martin, a conspiracy theorist who supported the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement after Joe Biden\u2019s election victory over Trump in 2020, as a special prosecutor to investigate the James and Schiff cases.\nPulte accused James \u2014 who successfully accused Trump of financial fraud in a civil suit last year \u2014 of falsifying bank statements and property records to secure more favorable loan terms for homes in Virginia and New York. He made similar claims weeks later about Schiff, who maintains residences in California and the suburbs of Washington, D.C.\nAfter President Trump alleged Tuesday that California Sen. Adam Schiff had committed mortgage fraud, Schiff dismissed the claim as a \u2018baseless attempt at political retribution.\u2019\nSchiff, who led a House impeachment of Trump during the president\u2019s first term and has remained one of his most vocal and forceful political adversaries since joining the Senate, dismissed the president\u2019s claims as a \u201cbaseless attempt at political retribution.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Schiff said he has always been transparent about owning two homes, in part to be able to raise his children near him in Washington, and has always followed the law \u2014 and advice from House counsel \u2014 in arranging his mortgages.\nIn making his claims, Trump cited an investigation by the Fannie Mae \u201cFinancial Crimes Division\u201d as his source.\nA memorandum reviewed by The Times from Fannie Mae investigators to Pulte does not accuse Schiff of mortgage fraud. It noted that investigators had been asked by the FHFA inspector general\u2019s office for loan files and \u201cany related investigative or quality control documentation\u201d for Schiff\u2019s homes.\nInvestigators said they found that Schiff at various points identified both his home in Potomac, Md., and a Burbank unit he also owns as his primary residence. As a result, they concluded that Schiff and his wife, Eve, \u201cengaged in a sustained pattern of possible occupancy misrepresentation\u201d on their home loans between 2009 and 2020.\nThe investigators did not say they had concluded that a crime had been committed, nor did they mention the word \u201cfraud\u201d in the memo."

This reality makes clear just how critical this program is, and we commend the city for prioritizing this investment,\u201d Jacome said on Zoom at the meeting.\n\u201cOutreach is especially critical for communities like Southeast Asian refugees who face unique challenges and disproportionate targeting for deportation.\u201d\nSoon some immigrant families in neighboring Costa Mesa could benefit from the same type of support as local leaders are contemplating launching their own immigration defense fund amid pressure from residents and activists to take a stand on the deportation sweeps.\n[Read: Costa Mesa Donates $100K for Immigration Aid; Explores Joining Lawsuit Against ICE Sweeps]\nSanta Ana\u2019s Immigration Legal Defense Fund\nSanta Ana officials first started contracting with Immigrant Defenders Law Center in 2017 when they launched the fund and entered into three different contracts with the legal group since then \u2013 with the recent contract expiring at the end of January.\nAccording to the city website, city officials opened a search at the end of 2024 looking again for a law firm to defend Santa Ana residents from deportation under a $300,000 a year contract as part of the city\u2019s deportation defense fund that started in 2017.\nImmigrant Defenders were the only group to bid to provide the city\u2019s immigration legal defense services again, according to a staff report.\nUnder the new contract, the law center must service 12 new clients annually while maintaining any active Santa Ana cases initiated under the previous contract with a maximum cap of 70 active cases.\nTo view the new contract, click here.\nIt comes after some activists raised concerns earlier this year that Immigrant Defenders was allegedly not taking on complex deportation cases and not serving the Vietnamese and Asian community.\n[Read: Santa Ana Looks to Boost Immigrant Protections Amid Federal Crackdown]\nThe law center did not respond to emailed questions Wednesday.\nImmigrant Defenders is also one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit filed on behalf of five people arrested in Los Angeles County and immigrant rights organizations alleging federal immigration officers are racially profiling people to make warrantless arrests.\nSanta Ana, Anaheim, Irvine and Fullerton either voted to join the lawsuit against the ICE raids or are looking at supporting the legal efforts to end the raids\nCosta Mesa City Council members are expected to consider signing onto the legal challenge spearheaded by the ACLU at their next meeting.\nHosam Elattar is a Voice of OC reporter.

      "text": "Law firm that sent L.A. a big bill in homeless case wants $5 million more for its work\n- Share via\nThe high-powered law firm that racked up big bills working to keep the city of Los Angeles from losing control over homeless programs is now looking to increase its contract by $5 million.\nCity Atty. Hydee Feldstein Soto has asked the City Council to increase the city\u2019s contract with Gibson Dunn & Crutcher to $5.9 million, up from the $900,000 approved three months ago.\nGibson Dunn has been defending the city since mid-May in a lawsuit filed by the nonprofit LA Alliance for Human Rights, which resulted in a settlement agreement requiring the construction of new homeless housing and the removal of street encampments. The group alleges that the city has repeatedly violated the agreement.\nThe Times reported last month that Gibson Dunn billed the city $1.8 million for about two weeks of work, with 15 attorneys charging $1,295 per hour and others charging lower amounts.\nBy Aug. 8, Gibson Dunn had racked up $3.2 million in billings in the case, according to a confidential memo sent to the council by Feldstein Soto, a copy of which was reviewed by The Times. Those invoices have arrived during a difficult financial period for the city, caused in part by a surge in expensive legal payouts.\nGibson Dunn, the firm representing the city, racked up the legal bills while fighting a legal attempt to take control over homelessness from Mayor Karen Bass.\nMuch of the firm\u2019s work was focused on its preparation for, and participation in, a lengthy hearing before a federal judge who was weighing the group\u2019s request to hand control of the city\u2019s homeless initiatives over to a third party.\nGibson Dunn was retained by the city one week before the hearing, which lasted seven court days, at eight or more hours per day, ending June 4.\n\u201cThe evidentiary hearing was more extensive than anticipated, with the plaintiffs calling more than a dozen witnesses and seeking to compel City officials to testify,\u201d Feldstein Soto wrote in her memo.\nThe City Council is scheduled to consider Feldstein Soto\u2019s request Wednesday.\nAn aide to Feldstein Soto declined to answer questions from The Times, saying the office \u201ccannot comment due to work product and attorney-client privileges.\u201d\nThe city attorney has repeatedly defended Gibson Dunn\u2019s work, saying the firm kept the city\u2019s homeless initiatives from being turned over to a receiver \u2014 a move that would have stripped authority from Mayor Karen Bass and the council.\nGibson Dunn also prevented several elected officials \u2014 a group that includes Bass \u2014 from having to take the stand, Feldstein Soto said in her memo.\nCity Councilmember Monica Rodriguez said she would vote against a request to spend an additional $5 million on Gibson Dunn. That money would be better spent on ensuring that the city complies with its legal obligations in the case, which include the construction of 12,915 homeless beds and the removal of 9,800 encampments, she said.\nRodriguez, who also voted against the initial round of funding for Gibson Dunn, said $5 million would be enough to cover \u201ctime limited\u201d housing subsidies for at least 500 households in her northeast San Fernando Valley district for a year.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re here to house people,\u201d she said. \u201cSo let\u2019s spend the resources housing them, rather than being in a protracted legal battle.\u201d\nMatthew Umhofer, an attorney who represents LA Alliance, called the request for nearly $6 million \u201cludicrous,\u201d saying the city should focus on compliance with the settlement agreement.\n\u201cGibson is a very good firm. Lawyers cost money. I get it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the city has hundreds of capable lawyers, and the notion that they need to spend this kind of money to prevent a court from holding them to their obligations and their promises, it raises real questions about the decision-making in the city on this issue.\u201d\n\u201cFor a city that claims to be in fiscal crisis, this is nonsense,\u201d Umhofer added.\nIn her memo, Feldstein Soto said the additional $5 million would cover Gibson Dunn\u2019s work in the case through June 2027, when the city\u2019s legal settlement with the group is set to expire.\nIn a 62-page ruling, judge says that \u2018this is not the time\u2019 to hand over Los Angeles\u2019 roughly $1 billion in homelessness programs to a court-appointed third party.\nDuring that period, Gibson Dunn would pursue an appeal of an order by U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, arguing that the judge \u201creinterpreted\u201d some of the city\u2019s obligations under the settlement agreement, Feldstein Soto said in her memo. The law firm also would seek to \u201creform\u201d the settlement agreement, Feldstein Soto said.\nTheane Evangelis, a Gibson Dunn attorney who led the firm\u2019s LA Alliance team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Her firm has played a huge role in redefining the way cities are permitted to address homelessness.\nRepresenting Grants Pass, Ore., the firm secured a landmark ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court upholding laws that prohibit homeless people from camping in public spaces.\nThe firm brought a new, more pugnacious approach to the LA Alliance case, issuing hundreds of objections throughout the seven-day hearing and working to undermine the credibility of key witnesses.\nA month later, Carter issued a 62-page order declining to turn L.A.\u2019s homeless programs over to a third party. However, he also found that the city had failed to comply with the settlement agreement.\nIn addition to pursuing the appeal, Gibson Dunn would help produce the quarterly reports required by the settlement agreement."

      "text": "Superfund: CERCLA Overview\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund, was enacted by Congress on December 11, 1980. This law created a tax on the chemical and petroleum industries and provided broad Federal authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or the environment. Over five years, $1.6 billion was collected and the tax went to a trust fund for cleaning up abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA):\n- established prohibitions and requirements concerning closed and abandoned hazardous waste sites;\n- provided for liability of persons responsible for releases of hazardous waste at these sites; and\n- established a trust fund to provide for cleanup when no responsible party could be identified.\nThe law authorizes two kinds of response actions:\n- Short-term removals, where actions may be taken to address releases or threatened releases requiring prompt response.\n- Long-term remedial response actions, that permanently and significantly reduce the dangers associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances that are serious, but not immediately life threatening. These actions can be conducted only at sites listed on EPA's National Priorities List .\nCERCLA also enabled the revision of the National Contingency Plan (NCP). The NCP provided the guidelines and procedures needed to respond to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. The NCP also established the National Priorities List.\nCERCLA was amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act on October 17, 1986."

      "text": "Fresh off Texas Senate\u2019s approval, new congressional map is target of lawsuits\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nHours after the Texas Senate approved a new congressional map early Saturday morning that more heavily favors Republicans \u2014 legislation Gov. Greg Abbott plans to \u201cswiftly\u201d sign into law \u2014 a lawsuit against the governor was filed, alleging that the redrawn districts are racially discriminatory.\nThe 67-page complaint against Abbott and Secretary of State Jane Nelson supplements legal action filed by LULAC in 2021 challenging the state\u2019s original maps and argues that redrawing districts mid-decade is unconstitutional.\nRedistricting usually happens at the start of the decade after U.S. census data comes out. The complaint argues that because the new map was drawn based on the same data used for the initial map passed by the Legislature in 2021, the measure was a violation of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause.\n\u201cEven if racial and partisan considerations are an unavoidable part of redistricting, there is no need for legislatures to take those considerations into account a second time in a single decade,\u201d the complaint reads.\nThe complaint, which is expected to be followed by others targeting House Bill 4, was filed by two law firms on behalf of 13 Texas residents collectively called \u201cthe Gonzales plaintiffs.\u201d The bulk of their argument is that the new congressional map \u201cdismantles majority-minority districts\u201d by prioritizing Republican representation in Congress.\nThe NAACP, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Mexican American Legislative Caucus joined LULAC in two additional supplemental suits against Abbott on Monday and Tuesday, also calling the maps unconstitutional and \"intentionally discriminatory.\"\nAbbott\u2019s office defended the maps, stating that it allows \u201cmore Texans to vote for the candidate of their choice,\u201d Andrew Mahaleris, the governor\u2019s press secretary, said Monday in a prepared statement.\n\u201cVoters, especially Hispanic Texans, are increasingly moving away from Democrats and deserve to vote for candidates who better align with their values,\u201d Mahaleris added, later calling claims that the maps discriminatory \u201cabsurd.\u201d\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nOn the Senate floor Friday, Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford who carried HB 4 in the upper chamber, said the plan \u201cmeets the critically important goals of legality, of political performance for Republicans and of improved compactness,\u201d and that he did not consider racial population data while crafting it.\nRepublicans pushed for the new map with their eyes set on gaining five more seats in Congress after pressure from President Donald Trump, who wants to preserve the GOP\u2019s slim U.S. House majority in the 2026 midterms. But the complaint says that effort came at the cost of Latino and Black communities, which have largely supported Democratic candidates.\nThe new lines squeeze more Democratic voters in Houston and Dallas into districts the minority party already controls \u2014 a strategy known as \u201cpacking.\u201d The Republican-backed map also \u201ccracks\u201d left-leaning communities by splitting voters who supported Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024 into Republican districts, according to an analysis by The Texas Tribune.\nThe complaint was filed by two law firms, The Law Office of Max Renea Hicks and the Elias Law Group, the firm of prominent Democratic attorney Marc Elias. They also allege that the new maps violate the Voting Rights Act for not creating enough Latino-majority districts to match the growth of Texas\u2019 Latino population.\nFor example, the complaint points to Harris County, where the new map carves out only one district that\u2019s majority Latino, although the county is nearly half Latino, according to the latest U.S. census.\nThe census also confirmed that Latinos make up the largest share of Texas\u2019 population, and that Texans of color made up 95% of the state\u2019s population growth in the last decade \u2014 but that\u2019s not reflected in the new congressional map, the complaint alleges.\nWith the new district lines, the lawsuit charges, lawmakers are \u201cintentionally destroying majority-minority districts and replacing them with majority-Anglo districts.\u201d\nDemocratic lawmakers have waged a lively battle to fend off the GOP\u2019s proposed map since Abbott announced that the first special session in July would include redistricting. House Democrats fled the state halfway through the first session, breaking the lower chamber\u2019s quorum and halting all operations. But the members returned to Austin at the start of the second session.\nAnd on Friday, state Sen. Carol Alvarado, D-Houston, signaled her intention to filibuster the map well into Saturday. Republicans, however, ended the debate on HB 4, killing her effort. Lawmakers also listened to hours of hearings from Texans across the state who pleaded with them to leave their districts alone.\nThe complaint and others that are sure to follow are a sign that Democrats and civil rights groups will continue to fight the implementation of the maps ahead of the 2026 election.\nThe National Redistricting Foundation, which brought LULAC\u2019s initial lawsuit, is also directing this new case.\n\u201cTexas\u2019s existing map already dilutes the voting power of communities of color,\u201d Marina Jenkins, the foundation\u2019s executive director, said in a news release.\n\u201cIn spite of that, the state has doubled down with an even more extreme racial gerrymander that goes even further to pack and crack communities of color and minimize the number of congressional districts where minority voters have the ability to elect candidates of their choice,\u201d she later said. \u201cThe court has already agreed to consider expediting this case, and we are confident that justice will be delivered for Texans.\u201d\nMore all-star speakers confirmed for The Texas Tribune Festival, Nov. 13\u201315!

      "text": "Each morning, millions of Californians face an impossible choice: Endure hours in traffic and spend 20 percent or more of their incomes on car expenses, or spend more than half the median household income of $96,000 on housing near their jobs and transit. As members of California\u2019s Congressional delegation, we\u2019ve approached this challenge from different angles \u2013 but reached the same conclusion:\nCalifornia\u2019s disconnect between our public transit investments and our housing policies is failing our communities \u2013 and we urgently need reform.\nThe sad truth is that, even as we continue to ramp up public investments in expanded and improved bus, train, and light rail services, most of the new housing built in our state over the past two decades has been far from our public transit stations. In Los Angeles County, multi-family housing is illegal to build in all but a few neighborhoods, and in San Diego, the Trolley and Coaster run through neighborhoods where new apartments are often prohibited, limiting the ability of San Diegans to live near the services they paid for.\nMeanwhile, Californians feel the effects of the shortage of at least 3 million homes in their pocketbooks.\nThe solution is clear: the state must allow more housing near transit. The benefits of this approach are substantial and proven.\nFor starters, according to the Mineta Center at San Jose State University, California residents who live near transit typically spend 40 percent less per year on transportation than residents who are more car-dependent. In addition to the immediate boost to family finances, allowing more residents to live near transit also drives regional economic growth: Transit stations occupy less than one percent of urban land \u2013 but attract more than 20 percent of new regional jobs. And by building housing near transit stops, we provide a greater return on investment for taxpayers, as farebox returns improve with increased ridership.\nIn essence, making it easier to build homes near our transit stations is a win-win that gives us more resources to invest \u2013 in our families, our communities and infrastructure, and even in safer, more frequent and reliable mass transit.\nThis is how public investments should work. Transit stations solve an urgent problem: the need to make life more affordable, reduce traffic and pollution, and give hard-working parents more time to spend with their families by cutting commutes \u2014 all while creating jobs and opportunities that more than pay for the investment in the process.\nWhile California is usually at the front of the pack for common-sense, pro-family, pro-clean air reforms, we are actually lagging far behind on matching transit investments with housing development. States like New Jersey, Colorado and Utah are advancing policies that encourage more homes near transit; Washington state is considering similar legislation, and communities across Maryland, Texas, and Florida are advancing the idea that public transit investments should be accessible to all.\nWe understand why the existing residents of communities with access to public transit have concerns about neighborhood change. Our experience in local government taught us the importance of community input. Effective legislation can preserve local control and ensure rigorous design standards, while also making sure that housing is built where it\u2019s needed most.\nMake no mistake \u2014 sky-high housing costs are the leading reason tens of thousands of hard-working Californians are leaving our state. It\u2019s a crisis draining our workforce, hollowing out communities, and threatening our future. We cannot fail to meet this moment.\nNo one city can solve this problem on its own. Each layer of government must play its role.\nWithout action, these problems will only intensify. Hospital administrators and school principals regularly tell us their staff can\u2019t afford to live in the communities they serve. Businesses are relocating to states with more affordable housing, taking jobs and tax revenue with them. The state risks losing billions in federal funding for services as other states attract residents seeking a more reasonable cost of living.\nWe\u2019ve each worked to address this gap. In Congress, we\u2019ve launched the bipartisan YIMBY Caucus and proposed the Build More Housing Near Transit Act, which would tie federal transit funding to housing production. In Sacramento, legislation like AB 2097 eliminated parking mandates near transit stations, reducing housing costs by tens of thousands of dollars per home. Yet despite these efforts, the fundamental problem persists. We invest billions in transit while actively preventing housing nearby.\nCalifornia\u2019s future depends on fixing this disconnect. We can no longer invest billions on public transportation while artificially constraining who gets to live close enough to use it. By aligning these essential policies, we\u2019ll create more affordable, sustainable communities where all Californians can thrive.\nLaura Friedman represents California\u2019s 30th congressional district.

Concurrently, California lawmakers and local governments grapple with housing policy reforms, including infill exemptions and transit\u2011oriented development, amid rising legal costs for the city of Los Angeles and a federal lawsuit challenging Texas\u2019s new congressional map.
