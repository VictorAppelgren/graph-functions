  "description": "Six states work to connect Michigan to South Carolina while navigating complex financing challenges in an era of Highway Trust Fund shortfalls.",
  "content": "This map shows the route of a proposed interstate highway system that would connect Michigan and South Carolina by way of Ohio. Proponents say it would stimulate economic development and growth in areas along the route. Transportation Advocacy Group of Northwest Ohio\n\nWASHINGTON - Funding speedbumps in constructing interstate highways have replaced the aggressive federal push of the 1950s, forcing today\u2019s states to navigate complex financing challenges and prove projects are worth billions before breaking ground.\n\nThe tighter funding picture complicates the task of planners in six states who have worked for decades to create a new interstate highway that would connect Michigan to South Carolina by way of Ohio, stitching together existing roadways and planned construction into a transportation corridor that could reshape regional economic development.\n\nThe shift in the funding picture stems largely from the Highway Trust Fund\u2019s chronic shortfalls. Federal fuel taxes haven\u2019t been increased since 1993, while construction costs have soared and fuel efficiency has reduced per-mile tax collections.\n\nThe fund now faces recurring deficits, forcing Congress to repeatedly transfer money from general revenues to keep highway programs operating. This financial squeeze has fundamentally changed how states approach major interstate projects.\n\nCurrent highway spending is around $80 billion yearly while revenue, without General Fund transfers, is hovering around $42 to $43 billion each year creating a massive structural imbalance that forces difficult choices about which projects get federal dollars.\n\nOhio is currently conducting a $1.5 million feasibility study to examine feasibility and possible routes for a new Interstate 73 corridor that would connect underdeveloped parts of the state to a nearly 1,000-mile transportation network.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation study, scheduled for completion by the end of 2026, reflects broader changes in how major highway projects get funded in an era where \u201cstates don\u2019t want to pledge state money until there\u2019s federal money\u201d and \u201cthe federal government doesn\u2019t want to fund until they have state buy in,\u201d according to advocates working on the multi-state project.\n\nThe ODOT feasibility study represents a critical first step in determining whether Ohio should commit resources to the Interstate 73-74-75 corridor, which would run from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, passing through Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina.\n\nAccording to Ohio Department of Transportation documentation, the study\u2019s key objective is providing \u201can objective, transparent analysis of what it would take to construct I-73\u201d while emphasizing \u201cthis is not a commitment to build the interstate\u2014but strictly informational.\u201d The research \u201carms the state\u2019s decision makers with data so they can execute accordingly\u201d and \u201chelps determine where scarce funding can be most effectively allocated.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio section of the proposed interstate would largely follow U.S. Route 23, running south from Toledo, through Columbus, and all the way to the Kentucky/West Virginia border near Chesapeake, Ohio.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings \u201cwill help decide the project\u2019s future, its allocation of state funding, and guide potential routes,\u201d ODOT says.\n\nJimmy Gray, president of the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce and executive director of the I-73, I-74, I-75 Corridor Association, says the funding challenges reflect broader changes in federal infrastructure investment, with the U.S. government not pushing interstate highway construction as it did during the 1950s.\n\n\u201cWe deal at times with a chicken or the egg issue,\u201d says Gray. \u201cStates don\u2019t want to pledge state money until there\u2019s federal money. The federal government doesn\u2019t want to fund until they have state buy in.\u201d\n\nGray says the project has been discussed for almost 30 years, with members of the group working to build the highway meeting regularly with congressional representatives in six states to discuss progress and strategize on securing funding.\n\nEach of the six states has designated portions of the route as priority corridors, but progress varies between them. South Carolina has completed permitting and environmental reviews for its segment and is \u201cshovel ready,\u201d with permits approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and right-of-way purchased.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting on money,\u201d says Gray. \u201cThat is the holdback.\u201d\n\nIn South Carolina\u2019s Horry County, voters approved a referendum dedicating $450 million toward Interstate 73 construction - about half the estimated $900 million cost for that segment, demonstrating the creative financing mechanisms states are exploring, including local sales taxes and federal grants.\n\nU.S. Rep. Dave Taylor, whose district would be served by the highway, introduced a congressional resolution last month supporting construction of Ohio\u2019s portion, citing growing defense-related industries in the region.\n\nA statement from Taylor said southern Ohio needs infrastructure to support businesses like a growing uranium enrichment site in Piketon, and a defense technology company building an advanced manufacturing facility to make military drones and autonomous air vehicles in Pickaway County.\n\n\u201cAn interstate through southern Ohio would not just help connect rural communities to the modern economy but would enhance our national security because of multiple key facilities and defense-related companies along the route,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nTaylor sought support for the project from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy at a recent House Transportation Committee hearing, where Duffy said he\u2019d be happy to discuss USDOT\u2019s role with Taylor.\n\n\u201cWe have too many communities that don\u2019t have adequate infrastructure, and most of them are oftentimes rural,\u201d Duffy said at the hearing.\n\nGray regards the prospective highway as more of an economic development engine than a tourism enhancement, estimating it would cut driving time from Ohio to Myrtle Beach by hours.\n\n\u201cIf you look at these six states, they are states with a lot of residential and commercial growth,\u201d says Gray. He says communities that lack interstate highway access often lose out on economic growth opportunities because it\u2019s a key factor companies consider when deciding where to build.\n\nThe corridor would connect major population centers and industrial hubs, from Michigan\u2019s manufacturing base through Ohio\u2019s defense and technology facilities to the tourism economy of the Carolinas.\n\nToledo\u2019s Tom Kovacik, executive director of the Transportation Advocacy Group of Northwest Ohio, has been working on Ohio\u2019s portion for 25 years. He says eliminating bottlenecks that prevent free-flowing traffic between Toledo and Columbus is a big priority, particularly creating a bypass for U.S. 23 in Delaware, Ohio, where 38 traffic lights in 20 miles impede through traffic.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a trucking company trying to get from Toledo to Columbus, you\u2019re stuck in a 20-mile stretch with nearly 40 red lights,\u201d Kovacik said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an expressway\u2014it\u2019s a logistical nightmare.\u201d\n\nThe planned bypass would connect U.S. 23 directly to Interstate 71 north of Columbus, eliminating the congested passage through Delaware entirely. Kovacik estimates any one of the potential routes would probably cost hundreds of millions of dollars but believes it would be worth it.\n\n\u201cA lot of these distribution centers locating in Ohio, a lot in Columbus,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just got a new Intel factory. That is just outside Columbus. The route from Columbus to Northwest Ohio is critical.\u201d\n\nOnce the Delaware bypass is completed, Kovacik said he will have accomplished his goal of ensuring a direct route from Myrtle Beach to Mackinaw, Michigan. \u201cI will be one of the first people on that bypass,\u201d he said.\n\nDarren LeBrun, Scioto County engineer, described his part of southern Ohio as caught in a \u201cblack hole,\u201d with a lack of interstate connections that hampers economic development. The region sits surrounded by Interstates 71, 70, and 77 but lacks direct connections.\n\n\u201cPortsmouth is a rust belt town built on manufacturing,\u201d LeBrun says. \u201cWhenever developers come in to put in a factory or big development, if interstate access isn\u2019t there, they keep looking and we\u2019re not considered. It is a handicap for us.\u201d\n\nBecause of a lack of local employment that he hopes an interstate highway might remedy, he said a significant proportion of his county\u2019s residents commute to Columbus daily, facing 90 minutes to two hours of driving each way. An interstate corridor could reduce that commute by at least 30 minutes while improving safety, he estimates.\n\nLeBrun acknowledged the project would require phased construction over many years due to its massive scope and cost. The ODOT feasibility study will determine preferred alignments and associated costs for each option, providing the technical foundation needed to secure future funding.\n\n\u201cThe big thing is to get the plan upfront, and then you can build it in pieces,\u201d he said, comparing the approach to North Carolina\u2019s Interstate 74, which took more than 20 years to complete.\n\n\u201cThese communities were once home to thriving steel mills and shoe factories,\u201d says LeBrun. \u201cWe have able-bodied people, we have rail, we have Ohio River access\u2014we just don\u2019t have the interstate. That\u2019s the piece that\u2019s been missing.\u201d\n\nDespite the funding challenges, Gray remains optimistic about the project\u2019s eventual completion.\n\n\u201cI remain confident it is a necessary project in each of these corridor states,\u201d says Gray. \u201cIt is going to happen because it is a good project.\u201d\n\nThis story was drafted with assistance from artificial intelligence.",

      "text": "This Week on America Builds: The Highway Trust Fund\nOn Tuesday April 29, the U.S. House Transportation & Infrastructure Subcommittee on Highways and Transit met for a hearing entitled, \u201cAmerica Builds: The Need for a Long-Term Solution for the Highway Trust Fund.\u201d Members called on several witnesses to provide insights on the status, issues, and policy solutions regarding the highway trust fund (HTF). The witnesses brought state DOT, industry, and association perspectives and among the witnesses was the Eno Center\u2019s very own, Jeff Davis.\nWitness List\nCarlos Braceras, P.E., Executive Director, Utah Department of Transportation; on behalf of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)\nTy Johnson, President, Fred Smith Company; on behalf of the National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA)\nJeff Davis, Senior Fellow, Eno Center for Transportation\nBrian Burkhard, P.E., Vice President and Global Principal for Advanced Mobility Systems, Jacobs\nAdie Tomer, Senior Fellow, Brookings Metro\nThe Highway Trust Fund in 2025\nThe goal of this hearing was to review the current state of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) and the contributing factors that have led to this point, a topic that the Eno Center, and Jeff Davis in particular, has written about extensively. The HTF was created in 1956 to provide a dedicated source of federal funding for the construction and operation of public roads in the United States. Like other trust funds, the HTF follows the \u201cuser-pay, user-benefit\u201d principle. The basic premise of this principle is that users of the highway system pay into the trust fund, through various taxes, and the taxes fund operations and improvements of the roadways. Revenue for the HTF comes from five main excise taxes. There are taxes on gasoline, diesel, and on heavy-duty tires. The other two are taxes on sales of new trucks and on the use of heavy trucks.\nIn the first 50 years of its existence, revenue and spending were almost equal for the trust fund, and it did not require federal government bailout transfers. The story of the HTF changed in the early 2000s, when spending increased faster than revenue increased, creating a gap. To alleviate this gap, the federal government began transferring money from its General Fund into the HTF to ensure stability between revenue and spending.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the red line denotes spending (or outlays) and the blue, orange, and silver columns denote revenue from each of the component taxes. The green column denotes the annual shortfall, which has been covered by transfers from the General Fund beginning in 2008 and totaling $275 billion to date. The chart projects the spending and revenue until FY2035, at which point the annual gap between spending and revenue reaches almost $40 billion. Current spending is around $80 billion while revenue, without General Fund transfers, is hovering around $42 to 43 billion. Davis made it clear in his testimony that the government must bring the spending line down or the revenue line up, if it wants to reduce the gap and reliance on General Fund transfers.\nFigure 1. Highway Trust Fund- FY 2007-2024 (Actual), FY 2025-2034 (CBO Jan. 2025 Baseline)\nSource: Testimony of Jeff Davis, April 29, 2025.\nThere are three factors that help explain the state of the HTF in 2025. During the 1950, 60s, and early 70s, total vehicle miles-traveled (VMT) increased by around 4.5 percent per year. The number of miles that people drove each year increased at a rate that allowed spending to increase while keeping the HTF solvent. In later decades, growth of VMT slowed and since 2007, the annual increase in VMT has been around 0.5 percent, which is not enough to keep up with spending increases. Second, vehicles became more fuel-efficient, reducing the spending power of the gas tax as time progressed. Third, Congress last raised the gas tax in 1993, and it has never been tied to inflation, reducing the purchasing power of the gas tax in the past 30 years.\nJeff Davis testifying before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, April 29, 2025\nThis is the current state of the Highway Trust Fund: increased spending without sufficient HTF revenues to cover it, and an increasing reliance on General Fund transfers. As a result, the HTF has lost reliability as a source that can fully fund surface transportation projects. Members and witnesses were in a consensus that the current state of the HTF is worrisome and requires significant effort to provide stability in dedicated surface transportation funding.\nIssues of Concern\nGiven the consensus that the HTF is losing strength, members voiced a number of issues they felt were appropriate to consider as part of the conversation on ensuring stable surface transportation funding.\nDedicated Funding\nThe HTF serves as a dedicated source of surface transportation funding. Witnesses including Johnson and Braceras pointed to that function of the HTF as an invaluable benefit. Certainty of funding provides state DOTs, local governments, and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) the chance to plan projects and continue to invest in roadway improvements. Witnesses noted that inadequate and unreliable transportation funding creates uncertainty that is a particular challenge in rapidly growing states. States like Utah, Arizona, and North Carolina are fast growing states, with populations in major metro areas increasing significantly. Between 2020 and 2024, the Salt Lake City metro area grew by 3.4 percent, the Phoenix metro area grew by 6.9 percent, and the Raleigh-Cary metro area grew by 10.2 percent. Braceras noted that the ability to plan and deliver surface transportation projects is critical for fast growing populations area in Utah. Rep. Greg Stanton (D-AZ) voiced a similar sentiment that Arizona is growing quickly and that the amount of funding coming from the HTF to the state is not enough.\nLosing a dedicated source of funding has two implications. One, there is less funding for transportation. Two, there is less certainty in transportation funding. State DOTs, local governments, and MPOs would be limited in the projects they can fund currently and in the planning for future projects. Throughout the hearing, witnesses and members alike urged for continued dedicated transportation funding.\nNegative Outcomes of Reduced Funding\nResponding to Rep. Stanton, Johnson stated that the biggest mistake Congress could make regarding the future of the HTF is to do nothing. The impact of reduced funding from the HTF could be seen in a variety of ways. Delays in project delivery would increase costs for projects and transportation companies. Higher costs may be passed on to the public or could lead to a reduced workforce. Additionally, reduced funding restricts state DOTs and local governments\u2019 ability to address congestion through roadway improvements. Congestion is a daily part of people\u2019s lives, and something that is only increasing, as highlighted by Rep. Laura Friedman (D-CA). The witnesses discussed that ensuring the stability of transportation funding is paramount, and there are a variety of policy solutions to keep the HTF stable. In any case, there is a need to do something, and keeping the HTF as it is will not be provide a sustainable source of funding. The witnesses bring expertise and efforts from across the transportation industry that are valuable in improving transportation policy, particularly in this context of transportation funding. In particular, Rep. Stanton gave a shout-out to the Eno Center for its work in bipartisan and comprehensive transportation policy research.\nMass Transit\nThe HTF has two accounts: one for highways and one for mass transit. About 20 percent of HTF spending goes towards transit and non-highway projects. Several members voiced support for continued mass transit funding, as an important part of improving the transportation system and providing options for the traveling public. The concern over mass transit is regarding the idea of eliminating the mass transit account from the HTF. In 2015, then presidential candidate Marco Rubio proposed to eliminate the Mass Transit account as a part of a transportation plan. Rep. Eleanor Holmes-Norton (D-DC) and Jerry Nadler (D-NY) sought further explanation from the witnesses on the continued importance of mass transit funding and whether eliminating the account would have any impact. Responding to Rep. Holmes-Norton, Davis noted that even if Congress removed the non-highway programs from the HTF, revenue would remain below spending levels, with a $9.5 billion gap.\nChanges to House Rules\nRep. Julia Brownley (D-CA) suggested a change to the House rules as a partial solution to the HTF challenges. The U.S. House Committee on Ways & Means has jurisdiction over taxes, customs revenues (or tariffs) and over \u201cdeposit of public monies,\u201d which includes trust funds. Ways & Means has not held a hearing on the HTF in some time. The suggestion would be shifting the jurisdiction from Ways and Means to the U.S. House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, giving the Committee more power to make changes in the HTF taxes structure.\n(Ed. Note: In 1955, Speaker Rayburn actually let the Public Works Committee write its own taxes for the Interstate Highway Bill, bypassing the Ways and Means Committee entirely. It was a controversial move, and may have contributed to the House defeating the bill and going home for the year. (See Richard Weingroff\u2019s article \u201cKill the Bill.\u201d When they came back in 1956, they put Ways and Means back in charge, and we got the Interstate Highway Act/Highway Revenue Act combo out of it.)\nPolicy Recommendations\nTuesday\u2019s hearing was an opportunity to voice concerns about the HTF and discuss the merits of various policy solutions to keep the HTF stable.\nIncreasing the Gas Tax\nAs mentioned, the gas tax has remained unchanged since 1993 and is not indexed to inflation. The tax per gallon paid in 2025 is the same amount as in1993, which means it has significantly lost purchasing power as construction costs have increased. Increasing the gas tax would increase revenues going into the HTF in the short term, but with more fuel-efficient vehicles and more people buying electric cars and hybrids, the long-term reliability of the gas tax comes into question. The projection shown in Figure 1 indicates that the revenues from the gas tax are expected to start declining around 2027. An increase in the gas tax may increase revenue, but that does not guarantee that gas tax revenues will not still decline over time.\nEV Fees\nElectric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly present on roadways. Total registered EVs (including battery electric and plug in hybrid) in 2021 was around 2.13 million, compared to around 100,000 in 2012. As EVs do not use gas or diesel, EVs do not contribute to the HTF and therefore, EV drivers are using the roadway but not contributing to the federal transportation funding the same way a driver of an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle does. In following the user-pay, user-benefit principle, there are calls to implement a fee on EVs that would go into the HTF. Several members voiced support for the idea of an EV fee. Rep Dusty Johnson (R-SD) highlighted that an EV fee would create an environment where EV drivers pay into the HTF and that would fall in line with the user-pay, user-benefit principle. As part of the reconciliation plan, Republican House members proposed several annual registration fees for certain vehicles. The proposed plan would instate a $200 annual fee for EVs, $100 fee for hybrids, and a $20 fee for ICE vehicles. On Wednesday, Republicans changed their plan and took out the annual fee for ICE vehicles and raised the proposed EV fee to $250.\nVMT/RUC/MBUF\nA vehicle miles-traveled (VMT) fee, also known as a road user charge (RUC) or mileage-based user fee (MBUF) is a proposed policy where drivers pay a fee based on how many miles they drove each year. This policy is an alternative to the gas tax. Rather than paying into the HTF through gallons of gas, some see the MBUF as a more direct tax on how much a driver \u201cuses\u201d the system, based on miles. Utah is one state that has a RUC program, which implements a RUC for all drivers. The program includes two elements: an annual EV fee of $140 and a RUC based on miles driven. EV drivers could opt into the RUC and waive the EV fee, so they only pay the RUC. This was a policy decision to provide an alternative to the gas tax and provide EV drivers the option to not pay the EV fee given their participation in the RUC.\nSeveral members voiced concerns over a milage-based fee, suggesting that rural drivers would face a heavier burden than urban or suburban drivers on account of the fact that vehicle-miles traveled can be higher in rural areas.\nNational Infrastructure Bank\nRep. Daniel Webster (R-FL) asked about what value a national infrastructure bank would have on surface transportation funding. A national infrastructure bank would be a government body that provides loans to various entities for financing infrastructure projects. Responding to the representative, Burkhard noted that a national infrastructure bank would be a useful supplemental tool in addition to current funding. According to the conversation, an infrastructure bank would be privately funded rather than from taxes. This model would be an opportunity for increased public-private partnerships and signal an openness from the government to working with the private sector.\nImpacts on the Public\nRep. Emilia Sykes (D-OH) reminded the committee that the efforts to fix the HTF ought to be mindful of the public. Transportation costs account for around 15 percent of household income on average in 2022. The transportation cost as part of household income is higher in lower-income households compared to higher-income households. Increases in the gas tax, establishing an EV fee, or having a MBUF could mean a higher cost for transportation for some. Additionally, all of these policies are built on the premise that one has a car. Car ownership by itself can be a significant cost for people, and the representative urged the witnesses and other members to reflect on how to justify these policies to the American people.\nBraceras responded with the notion that transportation is foundational for everyone and that it is critical to connect the costs associated with transportation with its benefits. Davis and Johnson noted that HTF is an important resource for funding projects designed to keep roads, bridges, and transit in good condition. Burkhard added that an efficient movement of goods and freight on the roadways keeps the economy thriving. Echoing an earlier sentiment, Tomer emphasized understanding the returns in transportation investments, including improved mobility."

      "text": "WASHINGTON - Ohio is examining ways to put underdeveloped parts of the state on the road to prosperity by constructing a new interstate highway.\nIt\u2019s joining a decades-long effort to create a new interstate highway that would connect Michigan to South Carolina, stitching together existing roadways and planned construction across six states into a transportation corridor that could reshape regional economic development.\nThe Interstate 73-74-75 corridor would run nearly 1,000 miles from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. On the way, it would pass through Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina.\nThe Ohio section of the proposed highway would largely follow U.S. Route 23, running south from Toledo, through Columbus, and all the way to the Kentucky/West Virginia border near Chesapeake, Ohio.\nThe project aims to upgrade existing routes and connect bypasses into a seamless interstate system - pulling together scattered segments into a unified whole over years of coordinated effort.\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation is conducting a $1.5 million feasibility study on the project scheduled for completion by the end of 2026. Its findings will help decide the project\u2019s future, its allocation of state funding, and guide potential routes, ODOT says.\nU.S. Rep. Dave Taylor, whose district would be served by the highway, introduced a congressional resolution last month supporting construction of the Ohio\u2019s portion.\nA statement from Taylor said southern Ohio needs infrastructure to support businesses like a growing uranium enrichment site in Piketon, and a defense technology company building an advanced manufacturing facility to make military drones and autonomous air vehicles in Pickaway County.\nThe Clermont County Republican said the new interstate would help workers in the region commute to work, and its growing industries transport their wares.\n\u201cAn interstate through southern Ohio would not just help connect rural communities to the modern economy but would enhance our national security because of multiple key facilities and defense-related companies along the route,\u201d Taylor said.\nTaylor sought support for the project from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy at a recent House Transportation Committee hearing, where Duffy said he\u2019d be happy to discuss USDOT\u2019s role with Taylor.\n\u201cWe have too many communities that don\u2019t have adequate infrastructure, and most of them are oftentimes rural,\u201d Duffy said at the hearing.\nMulti-State Coordination Spans Decades\nJimmy Gray, president of the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce and executive director of the I-73, I-74, I-75 Corridor Association says the project has been discussed for almost 30 years.\nMembers of the group working to build the highway meet regularly with each other and their congressional representatives in six states to discuss their progress and strategize on ways to secure funding.\nThe corridor would connect major population centers and industrial hubs, from Michigan\u2019s manufacturing base through Ohio\u2019s defense and technology facilities to the tourism economy of the Carolinas, he says.\n\u201cIf you look at these six states, they are states with a lot of residential and commercial growth,\u201d says Gray.\nHe says communities that lack interstate highway access often lose out on economic growth opportunities because it\u2019s a key factor companies look at when they decide where to build.\nHe regards the prospective highway as more of an economic development engine than a tourism enhancement, though he says Myrtle Beach would love for the highway to bring in more Ohio tourists. He estimates the highway would cut the time it takes to drive from Ohio to Myrtle Beach by hours.\nEach of the six states has designated portions of the route as priority corridors, but he says progress varies between them. Gray says Michigan has made the most progress, with portions of Interstate 75 already serving the corridor\u2019s northern terminus, near the border with Ontario.\nHe says South Carolina has completed permitting and environmental reviews for its segment and is \u201cshovel ready,\u201d with permits approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and right-of-way purchased.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting on money,\u201d says Gray. \u201cThat is the holdback.\u201d\nHe says the funding challenges reflect broader changes in federal infrastructure investment, with the U.S. government not pushing interstate highway construction as it did during the 1950s.\nHe says states are exploring creative financing mechanisms, including local sales taxes and federal grants, with federal agencies now typically looking for matching state and local investment.\n\u201cWe deal at times with a chicken or the egg issue,\u201d says Gray. \u201cStates don\u2019t want to pledge state money until there\u2019s federal money. The federal government doesn\u2019t want to fund until they have state buy in.\u201d\nIn South Carolina\u2019s Horry County, where Myrtle Beach is located, voters approved a referendum dedicating $450 million toward Interstate 73 construction - about half the estimated $900 million cost for that segment, Gray says.\nThe approach leverages tourism revenue, as the area hosts nearly 18 million visitors annually. Gray noted an additional urgency: hurricane evacuation, describing the challenges of evacuating up to 700,000 people during peak season on existing two-lane roads.\nDespite the years-long slog of constructing different segments of the highway across six states and stringing them together, Gray has faith the highway will eventually become reality because it would bring so much growth to the states it would serve.\n\u201cI remain confident it is a necessary project in each of these corridor states,\u201d says Gray. \u201cIt is going to happen because it is a good project.\u201d\nOhio\u2019s Critical Missing Links\nOrganizations in northern and southern Ohio who seek the highway\u2019s construction hope it will better link them with other parts of the state.\nToledo\u2019s Tom Kovacik, executive director of the Transportation Advocacy Group of Northwest Ohio, has been working on Ohio\u2019s portion for 25 years. He says the project would help eliminate bottlenecks that prevent free-flowing traffic between Toledo and Columbus.\nA big priority is creating a bypass for a section of Route 23 in Delaware, Ohio, where 38 traffic lights in 20 miles impedes through traffic, Kovacik says.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a trucking company trying to get from Toledo to Columbus, you\u2019re stuck in a 20-mile stretch with nearly 40 red lights,\u201d Kovacik said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an expressway\u2014it\u2019s a logistical nightmare.\u201d\nHe says the planned bypass would connect Route 23 directly to Interstate 71 north of Columbus, eliminating the congested passage through Delaware entirely.\nKovacik said ODOT is currently investigating multiple possible routes for the bypass, looking at different ways to connect the two highways.\nHe estimates any one of them would probably cost hundreds of millions of dollars, but believes it would be worth it to provide a better route for goods between Columbus and Toledo.\nThe route improvements are exponentially important for Ohio, Kovacik said, given the concentration of industry and distribution centers in and around Columbus, plus major transportation intersections in the Toledo area, where Interstate 75 and the Ohio Turnpike cross.\n\u201cA lot of these distribution centers locating in Ohio, a lot in Columbus,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just got a new Intel factory. That is just outside Columbus. The route from Columbus to Northwest Ohio is critical.\u201d\nOnce the Delaware bypass is completed, Kovacik said he will have accomplished his goal of ensuring a direct route from Myrtle Beach to Mackinaw, Michigan. \u201cI will be one of the first people on that bypass,\u201d he said.\nRural Ohio\u2019s Economic Imperative\nDarren LeBrun, Scioto County engineer, described his part of southern Ohio as caught in a \u201cblack hole,\u201d with a lack of interstate connections that hampers economic development. The region sits surrounded by Interstates 71, 70, and 77 but lacks direct connections.\n\u201cPortsmouth is a rust belt town built on manufacturing,\u201d LeBrun says. \u201cWhenever developers come in to put in a factory or big development, if interstate access isn\u2019t there, they keep looking and we\u2019re not considered. It is a handicap for us.\u201d\nHe likens the completed interstate to a \u201cheart stent\u201d that would allow an easy path between Interstates 270 and 64, providing his region with easy access to both roads.\nBecause of a lack of local employment that he hopes an interstate highway might remedy, he said a significant proportion of his county\u2019s residents commute to Columbus daily, facing 90 minutes to two hours of driving each way.\nAn interstate corridor could reduce that commute by at least 30 minutes while improving safety, he estimates.\nLeBrun acknowledged the project would require phased construction over many years due to its massive scope and cost. The ODOT feasibility study will determine preferred alignments and associated costs for each option, providing the technical foundation needed to secure future funding.\n\u201cThe big thing is to get the plan upfront, and then you can build it in pieces,\u201d he said, comparing the approach to North Carolina\u2019s Interstate 74, which took more than 20 years to complete.\nHe expects it would be built as a series of bypasses of congested areas that would eventually be linked together. Some segments are already in place, such as the Veterans Memorial Highway bypass around Portsmouth.\n\u201cThese communities were once home to thriving steel mills and shoe factories,\u201d says LeBrun. \u201cWe have able-bodied people, we have rail, we have Ohio River access\u2014we just don\u2019t have the interstate. That\u2019s the piece that\u2019s been missing.\u201d"
