  "title": "Todd Chrisley back at Florida prison ahead of its closing: What's next for reality TV star",
  "description": "Todd and Julie Chrisley served time in Kentucky and Florida prisons for tax evasion and bank fraud. They were pardoned in May 2025 by Donald Trump.",
  "content": "\"Was it weird? Was it awkward?\"\n\nThose are the questions people had been asking Julie Chrisley about reuniting with her husband Todd Chrisley weeks after the reality TV couple's prison release.\n\nThose same questions could have applied to Todd Chrisley's return to prison as a guest speaker \u2212 and not as an inmate.\n\nOn Thursday, Aug. 14, almost three months after Todd Chrisley left Federal Prison Camp Pensacola, thanks to a full pardon from President Donald Trump, the \"Chrisley Knows Best\" reality TV star was invited back there to speak at the final residential drug abuse program (or RDAP) graduation ceremony before FPC Pensacola closes (see below).\n\nThough the graduation ceremony was not open to the news media, the Pensacola News Journal interviewed Chrisley just outside the guarded gate at NAS Saufley Field.\n\n\u201cMy time in Pensacola (before) was not a great experience, but what I've seen today, the people have been lovely,\u201d said Todd Chrisley, who turned himself in to FPC Pensacola in January 2023 after being convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud. His wife and \"According to Chrisley\" co-star Julie Chrisley served time at FMC Lexington in Lexington, Kentucky, from January 2023 to May 2025.\n\nTodd Chrisley told the Pensacola News Journal, a USA TODAY Network newspaper in Florida, that he had worked on his speech for the graduation ceremony for about a month, and he had intended for it to be uplifting: \"I wanted to instill hope in these men, my friends, and, but I also want it to be very revealing,\" Chrisley said. \"I want to give them the credit for the sacrifices that they've made to go through this program because this program is not an easy program.\"\n\nThis time, Todd Chrisley was a guest at the prison camp in Pensacola. What he said about his return visit\n\nA month after Todd and Julie Chrisley were released from their respective prisons, Lara Trump, daughter-in-law of President Donald Trump, sat down with the Chrisleys at their home in Nashville, Tennessee, for an episode of her Fox News show, \"My View with Lara Trump.\" It was their first return to TV since they were convicted in 2022 and imprisoned in 2023. The couple opened up about their experience in prison and the recent pardon and the \"28 months\" they had gone without speaking to each other. Said Todd Chrisley: \"It's amazing. ... You know, you go to bed and you're in a prison, and you wake up the next day and President Trump has sent you home.\"\n\nBelow is information about Todd and Julie Chrisley, their life in prison and the Trump pardon.\n\nWho are Todd and Julie Chrisley? When were 'Chrisley Knows Best' reality TV stars released from prison?\n\nFor years, Todd and Julie Chrisley portrayed themselves as real estate tycoons on the USA Network series \u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d which documented the Chrisleys' lavish lifestyle in Atlanta and Nashville. The show drew in more than 2 million viewers by its eighth season and inspired spinoffs such as \"Growing Up Chrisley\" and \"According to Chrisley.\"\n\nHowever, their image as savvy real estate tycoons was sullied in June 2022, when the pair was found guilty of tax evasion and defrauding community banks out of more than $30 million in fraudulent loans, which funded their luxurious lifestyle. Julie Chrisley was additionally convicted of obstruction of justice and wire fraud.\n\nOn May 28, 2025, Donald Trump, a former reality TV star himself, issued a full pardon for Todd and Julie Chrisley. The couple exited their respective prisons the next day.\n\nTodd Chrisley had originally received a 12-year sentence, with seven years for Julie Chrisley. Todd Chrisley was released from a federal prison in Pensacola, and Julie Chrisley was released an hour later from federal custody in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\n\u27a4 'According to Chrisley' stars timeline: From reality TV to prison to pardon for Todd and Julie\n\nWhy is FPC Pensacola, a Florida prison where Todd Chrisley served time, closing?\n\nThe federal government says FPC Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida, is closing due to safety concerns over staffing shortages and crumbling infrastructure. The Navy is expected to demolish the buildings used there once the camp is closed.\n\nDuring his time there, Todd Chrisley sounded the alarm about what he said were poor conditions at the camp including black mold and asbestos, as well as \u201ccorrupt\u201d staff that lead to people not getting decent food or medical care, among other issues.\n\nHe supports the program but is glad to see this camp closed.\n\n\u201cWe had a hand in it, but I like to say that God closed it,\u201d Todd Chrisley said during an Aug. 14 appearance at FPC Pensacola. \u201cI think that more will come. We as a country incarcerate more individuals, our own people, than anywhere else in the world. Yet we have the highest recidivism rate of anywhere else in the world. So that should tell you there, just by looking at numbers that what we're doing is not right. It\u2019s not working.\u201d\n\nAfter prison release and Trump pardon, what's next for reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley?\n\nIn the Lara Trump interview on Fox News Channel, the reality TV stars confirmed a return to the small screen: \"We're coming back to television,\" Todd Chrisley said.\n\nWhen Donald Trump's daughter-in-law asked what was next for the embattled reality TV couple, Todd Chrisley responded: \"It's amazing that those that walked away from you are the first ones knocking at the door again. So we're coming back to television, and I think that we're heading back home. We're heading back to South Carolina where we came from, and we're going to open a hotel there, and we're going to create a show around it, and we're going to hopefully be grandparents at some point.\"\n\nSangalang is a lead digital producer for USA TODAY Network.

      "text": "Todd Chrisley released from Florida prison, Julie from Kentucky. What to know about Trump pardon\n- Todd and Julie Chrisley were released from prison after receiving a pardon from President Trump.\n- The Chrisleys were convicted of bank fraud, tax evasion, and other charges in 2022.\n- The pardon has sparked controversy, with some criticizing it as favoritism towards the wealthy.\nReality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley are back on the streets after being pardoned by President Donald Trump.\nSoon after Trump signed off on a full pardon for their convictions of tax evasion and fraud, Todd Chrisley was released from a federal prison in Pensacola. Julie Chrisley was released from federal custody in Lexington, Kentucky an hour later.\nThe couple's middle daughter, Savannah Chrisley, was on hand to welcome her father to freedom.\n\"Honestly, this process has been absolutely insane and I... I'm just so grateful that I'm going to leave here with my dad,\" she told the press outside of FPC Pensacola Wednesday.\nTrump called Savannah Chrisley, 27, who has been advocating for her parents' release in interviews, on her podcast and even onstage at the 2024 Republican National Convention, to let her know the news.\n\"It's a great thing because your parents are going to be free and clean and I hope we can do it by tomorrow,\" Trump on May 27 said.\nThe Chrisleys, who were depicted on their USA Network show as real estate tycoons in the South, were found guilty in June 2022 of conspiring to defraud community banks in Atlanta out of more than $36 million in fraudulent loans, defraud the IRS and commit tax evasion. Julie Chrisley was additionally convicted of obstruction of justice and wire fraud.\nTodd Chrisley was sentenced to 12 years in prison, while Julie Chrisley received a seven-year sentence. Their show ended when they began their respective sentences in January 2023.\nSavannah Chrisley has also been defending her parents against accusations that they should still be behind bars.\n\"You forgot a few details,\" she told Sen. Elizabeth Warren in a post on X, who called the pardon a \"get-out-of-jail-free card for the rich & famous who cozy up to Trump.\" Savannah Chrisley said her parents were never convicted of tax evasion, the IRS admitted they owed nothing, and other claims.\nThe Chrisleys were technically never convicted of tax evasion, but they were convicted of conspiracy to commit tax evasion, along with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, and wire fraud.\nThe couple's pardon came amid a flurry of high-profile pardons from Trump, including a former Republican congressman, a Republican Connecticut governor, a rapper known as \u201cNBA YoungBoy,\u201d a former Chicago gang leader, and an Army lieutenant who was convicted for flaunting COVID regulations. Trump also said he was looking at pardoning the men convicted in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\nWho are Julie and Todd Chrisley?\nFrom 2014 to 2023, Todd and Julie Chrisley gained fame with their USA Network reality show \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" which followed their tight-knit, boisterous family and their lavish lifestyle in Atlanta and Nashville. By the show's eighth season it was drawing more than 2 million viewers and it inspired spin-offs such as \"Growing Up Chrisley\" and \"According to Chrisley.\"\nDespite their legal troubles, the shows featuring the Chrisleys continued to air up until the couple was sentenced to prison. Prosecutors said the Chrisleys were driven by greed as they engaged in an extensive bank fraud scheme and then hid their wealth from tax authorities.\nWhy were Julie and Todd Chrisley, reality TV stars, in prison?\nAfter a three-week trial, Todd Chrisley, 56, and Julie Chrisley, 52, were found guilty on all counts of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and tax evasion after prosecutors said they used falsified financial documents to secure more than $36 million in loans from community banks.\n\"The Chrisleys spent the money on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate, and travel \u2013 and used new fraudulent loans to pay back old ones,\" the Justice Department said. After spending the money, the Chrisleys filed for bankruptcy to avoid more than $20 million in repayments.\nThe couple kept corporate tax accounts under Julie Chrisley's name to evade delinquent taxes in Todd Chrisley's name, the DOJ said, and then moved them to a relative to \"further conceal their income from the IRS.\" The Chrisleys failed to file tax returns or pay any taxes for the 2013, 2014, 2015, or 2016 tax years, the DOJ said.\nJulie Chrisley was additionally convicted of obstruction of justice after submitting a false document in response to a grand jury subpoena. Their accountant, Peter Tarantino, was convicted of multiple tax-related convictions.\nThe couple was first sentenced to 12 and seven years in prison, respectively, in November of 2022. In addition to their prison sentences, they each received an order of 16 months probation. Both had thei sentences slightly reduced later.\nContributing: Christopher Cann, Jay Stahl, KiMi Robinson, USA TODAY"

      "text": "Reality stars' prison release dates, from Julie and Todd Chrisley to a 'Housewives' star\nA reality television to prison pipeline? It's more common than you might think.\nFrom \"Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\" star Jen Shah's involvement in a telemarketing scheme to the \"Chrisley Knows Best\" stars charges on tax evasion and bank fraud, plenty of personalities have gone from TV screens to behind bars.\nIn at least one case, the plea for their release has reached the highest office in the land: Savannah Chrisley, daughter of disgraced reality stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, has appealed to President Donald Trump's administration for their pardon. Savannah, 27, spoke at the Republican National Convention in July 2025.\nAs of May 12, 2025, the Chrisleys are still in their respective prisons.\nWho are the other reality stars who are serving time in prison? Here's a closer look.\nJulie and Todd Chrisley from 'Chrisley Knows Best'\nIt's been more than two years since Julie and Todd Chrisley began their prison sentences for bank fraud. But instead of the respective seven- and 12-year sentences, each has had their prison time slightly reduced.\nThe Chrisleys gained fame on the USA Network reality show \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" which followed their tight-knit, boisterous family and lavish lifestyle in Atlanta and Nashville. The show drew in more than 2 million viewers by its eighth season and inspired the spinoffs \"Growing Up Chrisley\" and \"According to Chrisley.\"\nHowever, their image as savvy real estate tycoons was sullied in June 2022, when the pair was found guilty of tax evasion and defrauding community banks out of more than $30 million in fraudulent loans.\nIn January 2023, the Chrisleys traded their luxurious lifestyle for prison time. Prosecutors said the reality TV couple was driven by greed as they engaged in an extensive bank fraud scheme and then hid their wealth from tax authorities.\nJulie Chrisley, 52, is serving her prison sentence at the Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky, with an expected release date of Jan. 8, 2028.\nTodd Chrisley is serving time at FPC Pensacola and is expected to be released April 7, 2032, more than two years before his original 12-year sentence was supposed to be up.\nBrittish Williams of VH1's 'Basketball Wives'\nFormer \"Basketball Wives\" star Brittish Cierrah Williams found herself in hot legal water last year when authorities apprehended her over a series of scams.\nOn Oct. 24, 2023, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Autrey sentenced Williams, 35, to four years in prison for committing $564,000 worth of frauds, including tax frauds, bank fraud, insurance fraud and three separate pandemic fraud schemes, according to a release from the US Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Missouri.\nWilliams, then a radio personality in St. Louis, pleaded guilty to 15 felonies in May 2023.

Todd and Julie Chrisley timeline\nBelow is a timeline of Todd and Julie Chrisley and their road from reality TV success to prison to their presidential pardon.\n2014: Todd and Julie Chrisley portray themselves as real estate tycoons, gaining fame with their USA Network reality show \"Chrisley Knows Best.\" The docuseries followed their tight-knit, boisterous family and the Chrisleys' lavish lifestyle in the Atlanta suburbs. Season four documented the Chrisleys' move from Atlanta, Georgia, to Nashville, Tennessee.\n2017: Todd Chrisley made headlines after he addressed speculation that he's gay. \"Chrisley Knows Best\" was renewed for a sixth season, and USA Network orders eight episodes of an aftershow program called \"According to Chrisley.\" The aftershow followed a late-night talk show or variety show format with Todd Chrisley as host.

The 12-count indictment accused Todd and Julie Chrisley of bank fraud and wire fraud conspiracy.

Despite the Chrisleys' legal troubles, \"Chrisley Knows Best\" continued to air on USA Network.\n2022: \"Chrisley Knows Best\" was picked up for a 10th season, while \"Growing Up Chrisley\" was renewed for a fourth. E! also announced the franchise was moving forward with a new dating series, \"Love Limo,\" hosted by Todd Chrisley, days before the trial was set to begin. All three shows involving the Chrisley family were canceled.\nThe embattled reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley were found guilty in June 2022 of tax evasion and defrauding community banks out of more than $30 million in fraudulent loans, which funded their luxurious lifestyle.

FMC Lexington is an \u201cadministrative security federal medical center with an adjacent minimum security satellite camp,\" the prison's website says.\nShe was originally slated to serve her time in the federal prison camp in Marianna, Florida, about two-and-a-half hours away from Pensacola, where her husband, Todd Chrisley, 54, began serving his 12-year sentence Tuesday afternoon, court records say. It is not clear why she was instead rerouted to the Kentucky facility.\nTodd and Julie Chrisley found guilty: Daughter Lindsie speaks out on verdict\nThe Chrisleys, who portrayed themselves as real estate tycoons, gained fame with their USA Network reality show \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" which followed their tight-knit, boisterous family. They were found guilty in June of tax evasion and defrauding community banks out of more than $30 million in fraudulent loans, which funded their luxurious lifestyle. Julie Chrisley was additionally convicted of obstruction of justice and wire fraud.\nMore: Todd Chrisley says he forgives estranged daughter Lindsie, calls out children for 'greed'\n\"The Chrisleys have built an empire based on the lie that their wealth came from dedication and hard work,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cThe jury\u2019s unanimous verdict sets the record straight: Todd and Julie Chrisley are career swindlers who have made a living by jumping from one fraud scheme to another, lying to banks, stiffing vendors and evading taxes at every corner.\"\nThe Chrisleys spent millions on designer brand clothes, luxury cars and real estate, including two mansions in Nashville, Tennessee, reportedly worth about $9 million.\nThey are appealing their conviction.\nContributing: The Associated Press"

      "text": "Reality TV star Todd Chrisley back at prison camp in Pensacola, but not as inmate\n- Reality TV star and former Federal Prison Camp Pensacola inmate Todd Chrisley was back at camp to speak to final Residential Drug Abuse Program graduates.\n- Chrisley served just over two years at the Federal Prison Camp in Pensacola before being released following a pardon from President Donald Trump last May.\n- The federal government says the camp is closing due to safety concerns over staffing shortages and crumbling infrastructure.\nTodd Chrisley - media personality, entrepreneur and former inmate of Federal Prison Camp Pensacola at Naval Air Station Saufley Field \u2212 was back at the prison camp on Aug. 14, this time as an invited guest.\nChrisley spoke at the final Residential Drug Abuse Program Graduation Ceremony at Federal Prison Camp Pensacola (FPC Pensacola) at the invitation of the director of the bureau of prisons.\nThe News Journal caught up with Chrisley on Thursday afternoon just outside the guarded gate at NAS Saufley Field, when he stopped to speak with the media on his way in to speak to the graduates.\nChrisley served just over two years at the Federal Prison Camp in Pensacola before being released following a pardon from President Donald Trump last May.\nChrisley said he worked on his speech to the graduates for about a month and he intended for it to be uplifting.\n\"I wanted to instill hope in these men, my friends, and, but I also want it to be very revealing,\" Chrisley said. \"I want to give them the credit for the sacrifices that they've made to go through this program because this program is not an easy program.\"\nThe federal government says the camp is closing due to safety concerns over staffing shortages and crumbling infrastructure. In fact, the U.S. Navy is expected to demolish the buildings used at FPC Pensacola once the camp is closed.\nDuring his time there, Chrisley sounded the alarm about what he said were poor conditions at the camp including black mold and asbestos, as well as \u201ccorrupt\u201d staff that lead to people not getting decent food or medical care, among other issues.\nHe supports the program but is glad to see this camp closed.\n\u201cWe had a hand in it, but I like to say that God closed it,\u201d Chrisley said. \u201cI think that more will come. We as a country incarcerate more individuals, our own people, than anywhere else in the world. Yet we have the highest recidivism rate of anywhere else in the world. So that should tell you there, just by looking at numbers that what we're doing is not right. It\u2019s not working.\u201d\nChrisley and his wife, Julie, were convicted of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud and tax evasion. In 2023, Chrisley was sentenced to 12 years in prison and Julie was sentenced to seven years before being released.\nThey rose to fame on the USA Network series Chrisley Knows Best, where Todd became known as the family patriarch with flamboyant taste and sharp wit. The couple\u2019s \u201chelicopter\u201d parenting style was another signature part of the show.\nTodd and his daughter, Savannah Chrisley, who has a podcast, now advocate for prison reform, drawing from their personal experiences with the justice system and incarceration.\n\u201cWithout Savannah, Julie and I would not be here to have this interview,\u201d Chrisley said. \u201cI say every day that I thank God for God. I thank God for him being in our life and for instilling faith in us to where we eliminated fear, and I thank President Trump, and I thank my daughter who was tireless and who never gave up. But now the hard work starts for the men that I left behind, for the women that my wife left behind.\u201d\nChrisley is highlighting issues like unfair treatment, lack of programming for certain inmates, and the need for improved prison conditions.\nHe is encouraging others to reach out to him about issues they see in the prison system because he believes being the voice of incarcerated individuals is a calling he feels compelled to answer regardless of how popular the message is.\n\u201cIt is something that I'm passionate about,\u201d Chrisley said. \u201cI think that you go through life, and you struggle to find out where you're fitting in and you find your space. Television was my space and still is, but my true mission in life is now the incarcerated individuals of this country because they have a voice. So, if it's repeated to me, then I'm going to tell it to the masses whether they want to hear it or not.\u201d\nWhile he missed out on seeing the sights in Pensacola the last time he was here as an inmate, this time around Chrisley said he did get a chance to briefly see beautiful Pensacola Beach and he enjoyed lunch at another iconic Pensacola spot.\n\u201cMy time in Pensacola (before) was not a great experience, but what I've seen today, the people have been lovely,\u201d Chrisley said. \u201cWe rode by the beach and ate lunch at McGuire\u2019s. The people at McGuire's are lovely, so I'm sure that's a lovely, lovely place.\u201d\nThe Chrisleys are working on a new show for Lifetime that will feature their experiences, including their first meeting after prison and their plans for a hotel in South Carolina."

      "text": "Press Release\nTelevision personalities sentenced to years in federal prison for fraud and tax evasion\nFor Immediate Release\nU.S. Attorney's Office, Northern District of Georgia\nATLANTA \u2013 Todd and Julie Chrisley have been sentenced to 12 and seven years, respectively, in federal prison after a jury convicted them of bank and tax fraud offenses following a nearly three-week jury trial.\n\u201cOver the course of a decade, the defendants defrauded banks out of tens of millions of dollars while evading payment of their federal income taxes\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan. \u201cTheir lengthy sentences reflect the magnitude of their criminal scheme and should serve as a warning to others tempted to exploit our nation\u2019s community banking system for unlawful personal gain.\u201d\n\u201cAs this sentencing proves, when you lie, cheat, and steal, justice is blind to your fame, fortune, and position,\u201d said Keri Farley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \u201cThe FBI is proud to work with our law enforcement partners at the IRS and the U.S. Attorney's office to pursue and prosecute individuals that are driven by greed to evade the law.\u201d\n\u201cThe Chrisleys defrauded financial institutions and the Federal Government through tax evasion and other fraudulent means in an effort to minimize their tax liability, but project an image of wealth,\u201d said James E. Dorsey, Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation, Atlanta Field Office. \u201cThis sentencing serves notice that no matter a person\u2019s celebrity status, there are severe consequences for defrauding the American tax system.\u201d\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Buchanan, the charges and other information presented in court: Todd and Julie Chrisley conspired to defraud community banks in the Atlanta area to obtain more than $36 million in personal loans. The Chrisleys, with the help of their former business partner, submitted false bank statements, audit reports, and personal financial statements to Georgia community banks to obtain the loans. The Chrisleys spent the money on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate, and travel \u2013 and used new fraudulent loans to pay back old ones. After spending all the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from more than $20 million of these fraudulently obtained loans.\nLater, while earning millions from their TV show, Todd and Julie Chrisley, along with their accountant, Peter Tarantino, conspired to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Throughout the conspiracy, the Chrisleys operated a loan-out company. To evade collection of half a million dollars in delinquent taxes owed by Todd Chrisley, the Chrisleys opened and kept the corporate bank accounts only in Julie Chrisley\u2019s name. But after the IRS requested information about bank accounts in Julie Chrisley\u2019s name, the Chrisleys transferred ownership of the corporate bank account to a relative to further conceal their income from the IRS.\nIn addition, the Chrisleys failed to file tax returns or pay any taxes for the 2013, 2014, 2015, or 2016 tax years. As a part of the tax evasion scheme, Tarantino was convicted of filing two false corporate tax returns for the loan-out company, which falsely claimed that the company earned no money and made no distributions in 2015 and 2016.\nThe Chrisleys also attempted to obstruct justice before being charged as well as during the trial. After learning of the grand jury investigation, Julie Chrisley submitted a fraudulent document in response to a grand jury subpoena to make it appear that the Chrisleys had not lied to the bank when they transferred ownership of the loan-out company\u2019s bank account to their relative.\nOn June 7, 2022, a jury convicted the Chrisleys on all counts of a superseding indictment, including conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit tax evasion. The jury convicted Julie Chrisley of an additional charge of obstruction of justice. Tarantino was also convicted of multiple tax-related violations.\nU.S. District Judge Eleanor L. Ross sentenced the defendants as follows:\n- Todd Chrisley, 54, of Brentwood, Tennessee, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release.\n- Julie Chrisley, 49, of Brentwood, Tennessee, has been sentenced to seven years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release.\n- Peter Tarantino, 60, of Alpharetta, Georgia, has been sentenced to three years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release.\nAs part of sentencing, the Court ordered both Todd and Julie Chrisley to pay restitution and will determine the exact amount at a later date.\nThis case was investigated by the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigations.\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas J. Krepp, Annalise K. Peters, Alex R. Sistla, Sekret T. Sneed, Vivieon K. Jones, and Amy Palumbo prosecuted the case.\nFor further information please contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Public Affairs Office at USAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.gov or (404) 581-6016.

The couple was convicted in 2022 and turned themselves into prison in January 2023 for a 12-year sentence for Todd Chrisley and seven-year sentence for Julie Chrisley.\nDonald Trump, former star of \"The Apprentice\" on NBC, issued a full pardon May 28, 2025.\nTodd Chrisley was released from a federal prison in Pensacola, and Julie Chrisley was released an hour later from federal custody in Lexington, Kentucky.\nIn an interview for \"My View with Lara Trump\" on Fox News, the embattled reality TV couple opened up about their experience in prison and the recent pardon.\nLara Trump traveled to Nashville on June 23 to film an episode for her Fox News show with the \"Chrisley Knows Best\" stars. Though Todd Chrisley appeared at a press conference in Nashville, Tennessee, two days after his release from prison (see video from the Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network, with this story), their guest spot on \"My View with Lara Trump\" will be the first television interview for Todd and Julie Chrisley since they left FMC Pensacola and FMC Lexington.\nFor the segment, Lara Trump also interviewed the couple's children, Savannah Chrisley and Grayson Chrisley.

The Chrisley episode of \"My View with Lara Trump\" will air at 9 p.m. ET Saturday, June 28, 2025, on Fox News Channel.\nWhen will Todd and Julie Chrisley prison, pardon interview be on TV?\nTodd and Julie Chrisley, stars of \"Chrisley Knows Best\" and \"According to Chrisley,\" appear on \"My View with Lara Trump\" at 9 p.m. ET Saturday, June 28, 2025, on Fox News Channel.\nBelow is a snippet of the interview, provided by Fox News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" A video excerpt of the interview is included with this story.\nLara Trump: \"Tell me about the first time you saw each other.\"\nJulie Chrisley: \"It was surreal but people have asked, was it weird, was it awkward? It really wasn't.\"\nTodd Chrisley: \"Because I think for me, I was never away from her because she was in my spirit the entire time. I thought of her every second of my day. And so when I hugged her the first time, it was like I was home. It was not like I had been missing or I knew I was coming home to the same woman that I left. Now, when I say the same, I'm talking about in my heart spiritually. We have changed. And if we did not change in these 28 months, it would have been wasted.\"\nOn finding out they were pardoned by President Donald Trump:\nJulie Chrisley: \"I called Savannah one more time. And she said, he did it, he signed it. And I just started busting out crying. And everyone was looking around. And then I just hung up. I was so nervous, I just hung up. It was the craziest thing and everybody was just looking at me because unfortunately, most of the news that you get in prison is bad news. You know, so they're like, are you OK? I'm like, I am. I'm getting out of here. I'm getting out of here.\"\nTodd Chrisley: \"This guy stops me and goes, 'man, I think you just got pardoned.' And I said, 'Yeah, okay.' And I just kept on walking. And so when I went into my dorm, one of the guys, the COs, he came by and he goes, 'Are you good?' And I said, 'As good as I can be.' And he said, 'Todd, you just got pardoned. They sent me down here to make sure you're okay.' And I said, 'Well, they don't need to be worrying about me now. Hell, if I'm pardoned, I'm great.'\nWe owe thanks to God \u2026 and God touched President Trump's heart. God led the people to advocate for us. And so I'm grateful because every night I would pray that God would return me home to my wife and my children. And he did that, so I'm grateful.\"\nOn advocating for their fellow inmates now that they are free:Julie Chrisley: \"I have a dear friend in there who's 77 years old. And that, unless God intervenes, she's going to die in there. I mean she could be any of our grandmothers. I mean, and when I tell you the best lady that you would ever, ever meet. But not just that, there's so many young women who are young mothers who got these crazy sentences, never been in trouble in their life. You know, it's just, I'm not walking away. That's something, a pledge that I've made to them and to myself.\"\nTodd Chrisley: \"And I stay in touch with the ones that I've sent out of there before I left and have now gotten on the visitors list of the ones I left behind. Because those kids deserve a second chance. You know, you've got kids in prison for selling marijuana. But now it's almost legalized everywhere. But yet we don't make that retroactive for these young men. These young men still have a chance. They're in their 20s, 30, 33 years old. Let them come home. Let them get on a job. Let them pay taxes. And if they mess up again, well, listen, the prison doors are wide open.\"\nHow to watch 'My View with Lara Trump'\nYou can watch \"My View with Lara Trump\" at 9 p.m. ET Saturdays on Fox News Channel, which you can get through such live TV services as Hulu+ Live TV, YouTube TV and Fubo.\nWatch 'My View with Lara Trump' on Fubo\nYou can also stream episodes after they've aired on the Fox News website and Fox Nation, which is Fox News's streaming service.\nContributing: Lianna Norman, USA TODAY Network-Florida\nSangalang is a lead digital producer for USA TODAY Network.
