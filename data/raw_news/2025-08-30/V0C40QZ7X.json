  "content": "MBTA hopes to cut down on fare evasion with new gates at South Station\n\nMBTA hopes to cut down on fare evasion with new gates at South Station\n\nMBTA hopes to cut down on fare evasion with new gates at South Station\n\nThe MBTA will begin installing fare gates for Commuter Rail riders at Boston's South Station next week, expanding a system already in place at North Station for the past few years.\n\nThe electronic gates require riders to tap their tickets or passes before boarding and again when exiting. The MBTA said the system is designed to improve fare collection and efficiency while also reducing fare evasion, which has cost tens of millions of dollars over the years.\n\n\"Installing fare gates at South Station, our busiest station, will help ensure fares are appropriately collected,\" said MBTA General Manager and CEO Phillip Eng. \"These fares support our operations budget and are important to continuing the delivery of safe, reliable and more frequent rail service.\"\n\nWhile it's been the status quo at North Station, some commuters have described the gates as inconvenient if no staff are nearby to help with issues, while others say they understand the need to better enforce fare payment.\n\n\"There's good and bad with them. But I do understand that the government has to make their money,\" Suzy Thorne told WBZ-TV.\n\nAt South Station, 40 new fare gates will be installed and are expected to be operational by winter. The MBTA says construction will cause minimal impacts to Commuter Rail service.\n\nRiders will have a chance to test the gates before they are fully in use, and staff will be available to answer questions during and after construction.\n\n\"I think it's going to make things more efficient versus going and scanning everyone's badge on the train. So that way, you know, people can check their tickets right away,\" said commuter Robin Hokanson.\n\nThe fare gates are part of a broader push by the MBTA to make fare collection more consistent and efficient across the system. Beginning next month, staffers will also start issuing warnings, and eventually citations, to fare evaders at T stations.\n\nProject updates are available on the MBTA's website.",

If it is a round-trip ticket, you will need to keep the ticket and scan again to re-enter for your return trip.\nNote: Commuter Rail fare gates cannot accept payment by contactless debit/credit card, phone, or watch with a mobile wallet. However, conductors can accept those payment methods for tickets purchased onboard.\nScan the QR code on your mTicket at a fare gate reader, holding it to the scanner for 2-3 seconds.\nTap your card at the fare gate.\n- CharlieCards must have a printed zone and date to be accepted on the Commuter Rail and at Commuter Rail fare gates.\n- Stored-value CharlieCards will not be accepted.\n- Monthly LinkPasses are not accepted on the Commuter Rail. You can purchase a Zone 1A pass for the same price.\nFor riders with reduced fare benefits:\n- Fare gates are able to accept Blind Access CharlieCards and Student M7 passes. Riders using other reduced fare CharlieCards will need to purchase a separate ticket or pass for their specific zone.\n- Inbound riders using reduced fare CharlieCards will need to either purchase their ticket in advance or on board from a conductor. Outbound riders can purchase their ticket from the ticket office.\nTap your CharlieTicket at the fare gate.\n- Single, round trip, or monthly CharlieTickets with a printed Zone are accepted.\n- A monthly LinkPass with a printed date is also accepted.\n- Stored-value CharlieTickets will not be accepted.\nFor paper tickets purchased on board or at ticket offices, scan the barcode at a fare gate.\nThe following paper tickets are accepted:\n- $10 weekend tickets (with a barcode)\n- On-board paper receipt tickets\nScan the barcode on your digital or paper ticket at the fare gate.\nScan the barcode on the front of your active Department of Defense Common Access Card at the fare gate.\nExpired cards will not be accepted.\nChildren 11 and under ride free. When you're traveling with children, alert a staff member so they can open a gate for them free of charge.\nHow Fare Gates Will Impact Your Trips\nThe new fare gates will have little impact on your trips. The gate layout at each Commuter Rail station has been designed to accommodate that station\u2019s ridership, and to grow as ridership increases.\nHere are some key things to know:\n- Traveling through stations with fare gates is different with the new gates. Riders tap or scan tickets or passes when they enter and exit the station.\n- You will still need to show your ticket to conductors on board who will verify your ticket zone.\n- You must keep your ticket with you to exit the concourse area. Riders who arrive without tickets must purchase them through the mTicket app or from a staff member stationed at the gates.\nIn an emergency, the gates will open automatically to allow passengers and staff to leave the station.\nPhoto Gallery\nShare Your Feedback\nWe're asking the public to help guide our decisions as we roll out the Fare Transformation project over the next several years.\nBuilding a Better T\nAs part of our $9.6 billion, 5-year capital investment plan, we're renovating stations, modernizing fare collection systems, upgrading services for our buses, subways, and ferries, and improving the accessibility of the entire system.\nShare Your Feedback\nWe're asking the public to help guide our decisions as we roll out the Fare Transformation project over the next several years."

      "text": "MBTA to crack down on fare evasion around Boston starting in September\nThe MBTA announced that it will begin cracking down on fare evasion starting in September.\nSpecially trained MBTA employees called the \"fare engagement representatives\" will be located on trains and at T stations throughout service areas to make sure that fares are being paid.\n\"It's pretty common, I think even the Commuter Rail has the kind of situation where you just get on and sometimes they check and sometimes they didn't,\" said rider James Rodriguez.\n\"Our riders deserve a safe and reliable mass transportation system that is available for them when they need it. With strong support, we are making significant progress, but to sustain it, we owe it to our riders and the public at large to do our part and collect all appropriate fare revenue,\" MBTA general manager and CEO Phillip Eng said in a statement.\nThe company said that the staff members will begin by giving riders an official warning if they haven't paid their fare. This requires a rider to give a form of physical or verbal identification. They will then be issued a formal written warning. After that, citations will be issued, starting at $50.\n\"If a rider refuses to cooperate with MBTA personnel, provide identification, or provide their contact information, they may be asked to exit the station at that time,\" The MBTA said in a press release.\nCitations can also be issued if someone is using another person's reduced fare card. However, if someone thinks they were unfairly given a citation, they can appeal here.\nRiders can pay for the train and buses with their phone, a contactless card, cash, a ticket, or a CharlieCard.\n\"I've never gotten off a train before and actually had to present a ticket to get out of the station,\" said rider Joe Forebush. \"That's the first time that's happened for me. It was a moment of, oh no, do I have it? And then I was fine.\"\nMBTA fare checks\nThe MBTA said that the representatives will be placed throughout the system based on rider patterns so that they can \"avoid a disproportionate presence in any one community.\" They will be wearing a distinctive blue shirt with a yellow MBTA identifier on it and khaki pants. All representatives will have access to Google Translate or speak another language. They have also received training on accessibility, de-escalation, youth engagement, and more.\nThe team members were first introduced in October of 2024 to answer questions and visually check if fares were being paid.\nProgram rolls out Sept. 8\nThe program will officially roll out on September 8. Future advancements of the program will see the staff on buses, Green Line and Mattapan trolleys. For more information about fare checks, click here.\n\"Obviously, for us it's really important that whatever is done is done equitably, that it's done in a non-discriminatory way,\" said Caitlin Allen-Connelly of TransitMatters. She said fare enforcement is an essential step in the right direction, especially as the region prepares for the World Cup next year.\n\"Right now, we're in a system where you have a Charlie Card, the Charlie Cards can't be used for the tap and pay,\" said Allen-Connelly. \"And so people have different methods of passes for the T and different ways of paying. And once we integrate that all together, it'll be a lot easier.\""
