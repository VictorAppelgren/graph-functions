  "title": "Finnish Startup Produces Protein From Thin Air For Space And Earth Markets",
  "description": "",
  "content": "Solar Foods SLRFF, a Finnish food technology company, has developed a unique twist on protein food production by harnessing renewable energy and capturing carbon dioxide.\n\nThe company has developed a way to create edible calories\u2014literally \"food out of thin air.\" The food production could feed more people worldwide and provide sustenance for astronauts traveling on Elon Musk's first interplanetary mission to Mars.\n\nFounded in 2017 as a private venture, Solar Foods remained relatively unknown until its initial public offering (IPO) in August 2024 on Nasdaq First North Growth Market Finland. With a concentrated ownership structure, high insider ownership, and institutional interest, the company has positioned itself to scale globally.\n\nSolar Foods originated in a research program at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and Lappeenranta University of Technology. Biotechnology researchers Dr. Pasi Vainikka and Dr. Juha-Pekka Pitk\u00e4nen discovered how to turn emission-free electricity and captured CO2 into edible calories using hydrogen fermentation.\n\nThe production process has developed outside traditional agriculture. It uses no arable land, animals, or large amounts of water, making its location independent. Yet, it creates a product containing all nine essential amino acids required by the human body, making it a complete protein source that can feed people worldwide.\n\nSolar Foods' first product, Solein, uses microbial protein cultivated using carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and electricity. The process involves cellular agriculture. This involves a single microbe, discovered in Finnish nature, grown in bioreactors\u2014much like brewing beer.\n\nThe microbe feeds on a nutrient-rich medium As it multiplies, the company continuously harvests and dries it into a yellowish, protein-rich powder. Solein has a high nutritionally make up and a neutral in flavor. Consumes can use the product as a milk or egg substitute.\n\nSolar Feeds protein requires 0.1% of the land and 1% of the water needed for beef protein. It emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than beef.\n\nInderes Analyst Thomas Westerholm discussed its advantages in an interview for Inderes Nordic.\n\n\"Production of Solein isn't at all reliant on weather,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a very efficient way of producing protein which is attractive in this model. It consumes less water than traditional agriculture and the production is rather fast. A batch of Solein grows in 70 hours.\"\n\nDespite promising technology, Solar Foods has operated in a highly regulated market that has curbed its expansion. Singapore approved Solein as a first novel food in 2022\n\nIn the United States, Solar Foods has achieved self-GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status, allowing limited sales. It has worked toward full FDA notification, which it hopes to secure by 2026.\n\nIn Japan, Solar Foods' partnerships with local leaders like Ajinomoto AJINF, a major producer of amino acids and food ingredients, could streamline the regulatory process.\n\nIn the European Union (EU), Solar Foods needs multi-year safety reviews and approval among member states. The EU process takes into account population, giving large countries like Germany or France more power in the process.\n\n\"In Europe, the company estimated that it would take up to four years to get the status\u2014we're halfway there,\" Westerholm said. \"The company aims to get it in 2026.\"\n\nThe company's first demonstration plant, Factory 01 in Vantaa, Finland, began operations in spring 2024 with a capacity of 160 tons of Solein per year. This output is enough for approximately five million meals.\n\nThe company needs to do more to achieve a positive cash flow. To reach that milestone, the management sees two main channels of growth.\n\nFirst, the company plans to invest in and operate its large-scale production plants, selling Solein as a raw material to food manufacturers and restaurants. This approach requires significant capital investment and access to affordable electricity, as the process is energy-intensive.\n\nSecond, and potentially more scalable, Solar Foods could license its proprietary technology and microbial strains to other producers. This \"asset-light\" approach would allow partners to finance and operate their facilities, while Solar Foods collects licensing fees and provides technical support.\n\nConcrete partnership opportunities have emerged. Last month, Solar Foods signed a letter of intent with a \u201cleading international brand in Health & Performance Nutrition\u201d to build a new plant. If executed successfully, it could kick-start its licensing revenue stream.\n\nThe partnership with Ajinomoto is promising for the Asian market. The dietary supplement market in the Asia Pacific is projected to grow at 9.9% from 2025 to 2033, reaching over $150 billion. Ajinomoto's expertise and distribution network could accelerate adoption.\n\nSolar Foods has attracted the attention of the space industry. The company won its category in NASA's Deep Space Food Challenge, a competition to develop sustainable food solutions for long-duration space missions.\n\nWhile the award did not come with direct funding, it provided valuable visibility and credibility among space agencies and contractors.\n\nWith the Artemis program targeting a return to the Moon and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk\u2019s ambitious plans to colonize Mars, Solein could be a top candidate to feed the astronauts.\n\nThe ability to produce protein from air, water, and electricity, without reliance on agriculture, is the right solution for resource-constrained space missions.\n\nFinancially, Solar Foods is still pre-revenue, with its demonstration plant serving primarily to prove that the technology can scale.\n\nThe company could, as modeled by analysts, achieve revenue and profitability after 2030. This depends on larger plants being operational and licensing deals in place.\n\nBy 2037, Solar Foods could reach nearly \u20ac600 million in annual revenue, with about 30% coming from licensing, Westerholm estimated.\n\nHowever, this scenario depends on the successful construction of multiple full-scale facilities\u2014either by Solar Foods or its partners\u2014and on securing the necessary financing.\n\nThe European Commission has recognized Solein production as an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI). This recognition could grant the company up to \u20ac110 million in funding, which would be fundamental for the construction of Factory 02. A site in Selk\u00e4harju, Lappeenranta, in Finland, is one of the possible locations for the next production facility.\n\nAny opinions expressed in this article are not to be considered investment advice and are solely those of the authors.

The purpose of reserving the site is to enable Solar Foods to carry out preliminary studies necessary for the implementation of the Factory 02 production facility. The cooperation agreement precedes the actual agreement and investment decision, which is expected to be made in 2026. The company continues to also explore other possible locations for the production facility.\nSolar Foods is evaluating suitable locations for its future industrial-scale production facility Factory 02. As a result of the evaluation, a site in Selk\u00e4harju, Lappeenranta, Finland has been selected as one possible location for the production facility. With the cooperation agreement the City of Lappeenranta reserves the site for Solar Foods and agrees to not transfer or give the right to investigate the site to others during the reservation period. The agreement also outlines the principles and target schedule for selling or renting the site. Based on the reservation, the city also agrees to sell or lease the site to Solar Foods according to the key terms and conditions defined in the cooperation agreement. The agreement is due to be signed in September. Solar Foods must notify the city by writing by the end of the reservation period, 31 March 2028, whether the company will buy or lease the site or part of the site from the city.\nSolar Foods has used the Selk\u00e4harju site as a basis in the pre-engineering phase of Factory 02. The 13,5-hectare area in Selk\u00e4harju offers exceptional electricity supply opportunities and possibilities to integrate into the city\u2019s district heating network. Solar Foods continues to evaluate also other possible locations for the production facility. The final decision about the location is expected to be made during 2025 and the final investment decision during 2026.\nThe investment decision for Factory 02 is affected by the funding decision related to the IPCEI notification (Important Project of Common European Interest) granted by the European Commission. The IPCEI-notification granted to Solar Foods amounts to EUR 110 million. The remaining possible funds amount to approximately EUR 66 million, which is intended to partially cover the costs for the construction of Factory 02. The company does not have a funding decision for that amount yet.\nAdditional information:\nTiia Kuusim\u00e4ki, COO, tiia.kuusimaki@solarfoods.com, tel +358 10 579 3284\nImages for editorial use: www.solarfoods.com/media\nCertified Advisor\nDNB Carnegie Investment Bank AB (publ)\nWhat is Solein?\nSolein is an all-purpose protein grown with the air we breathe: The unique bioprocess takes a single microbe, one of the billion different ones found in nature, and grows it by fermenting it using air and electricity.

      "text": "The Asia Pacific dietary supplement market size was estimated at USD 64.47 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 151.24 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 9.9% from 2025 to 2033. The Asia Pacific region is home to a large and diverse population that is becoming increasingly health-conscious.\nAs a result, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including good nutrition and physical activity. This trend has led to an increase in the demand for dietary supplements that can support overall health and well-being. The young population in the region is especially focused on fitness and physical activity, and this has led to an increased demand for energy and weight management supplements. These supplements are designed to help individuals increase their energy levels and manage their weight, which can be particularly important for those who are engaged in rigorous physical activity or looking to lose weight.\nChina, Japan, and India are among the largest markets for dietary supplements in the Asia Pacific owing to the presence of a large consumer base in these countries. Japan and Australia have experienced heightened awareness regarding the health benefits of dietary supplements over the years, which is expected to strengthen the regional market growth over the forecast period.\nRising expenditure on health-enhancing products, in light of physical fitness requirements and increasing sports activities in the region, is likely to fuel product demand over the forecast period. Various regulatory bodies govern and regulate the market, and their approval is a must before seeking claims.\nConsumers show a strong preference for natural, plant-derived, and additive-free supplements. Traditional medicine has a long history in many parts of the Asia Pacific region, with practices such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, and Unani being widely used for centuries. These traditional medicine systems rely on natural remedies such as herbs, plants, and minerals to treat a wide range of health problems. As a result of this tradition, there is a high demand for dietary supplements made from traditional ingredients such as ginseng, turmeric, and ginger in the Asia Pacific region. These ingredients have been used for centuries in traditional medicine to promote health and treat various ailments.\nThe popularity of these traditional ingredients has led to an increased demand for dietary supplements containing them in the Asia Pacific region. Many manufacturers of dietary supplements in the region now offer products containing traditional ingredients, often in combination with other vitamins, minerals, and natural extracts. In April 2024, Nestl\u00e9 India and Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories announced a joint venture aimed at bringing Nestl\u00e9 Health Science\u2019s nutraceutical brands to consumers across India and other agreed territories. The partnership will focus on categories including metabolic, hospital nutrition, general wellness, women\u2019s health, and child nutrition.\nThe industry has been witnessing increasing demand for plant-based, natural, and clean-label products, primarily driven by consumer preferences for perceived healthier and more sustainable options. Manufacturers are expected to focus on developing products with natural ingredients, minimal processing, and transparent labeling. The rise of e-commerce, social commerce, and direct-to-consumer (D2C) channels is expected to improve product accessibility for consumers, thus driving market growth over the coming years.\nPeople across Asia Pacific are increasingly prioritizing preventive healthcare. In China, for instance, around 80% of consumers reported a strong interest in immunity-boosting supplements post-COVID-19. In India, the vitamin and mineral supplement segment grew by over 15% in 2022 alone. This reflects a broader shift toward health maintenance and disease prevention through daily supplementation. Additionally, rapid urbanization in India and Southeast Asia is contributing to dietary imbalances and stress-related health issues. In 2023, urban dwellers made up nearly 35% of India\u2019s population, and this segment is increasingly turning to energy boosters, multivitamins, and digestive supplements to cope with lifestyle challenges.\nThe aging demographic in countries like Japan and South Korea is a major driver. Japan has the world\u2019s oldest population, with over 29% aged 65 or older, which is boosting demand for supplements that support joint health, cognitive function, and bone strength. In South Korea, the senior population is expected to reach 40% by 2050, reinforcing long-term growth in the segment.\nFitness enthusiasts and athletes emphasize the importance of holistic nutritional solutions that cater to diverse aspects of well-being, such as bone and joint health, digestive well-being, immunity, restful sleep, and promoting healthy aging. While recent advancements in weight management offer rapid results, the real challenge lies in maintaining a healthy weight. People are becoming more aware of the connection between weight management and long-term health.\nTherefore, there is a growing demand for natural, effective, and safe ingredients in Asia Pacific dietary supplements that offer a comprehensive approach to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Chinese consumers show a strong preference for natural, plant-derived, and additive-free supplements. Popular natural ingredients include ginseng, ganoderma lucidum, goji berry, and various traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. Quality, efficacy, and scientific backing are highly valued, and there is increasing demand for clean-label, organic, and locally sourced products.\nNew companies operating in the market are responding to customer needs and interests to provide various products ranging from phytochemical-enriched beverages to plant-based burgers and others. The Journal of the American College of Nutrition reports a crucial relationship between nutrition and health and the growing self-care movement as two factors driving the nutraceutical foods market. Innovative foods and brands are available in the market owing to growing interest in functional foods.\nConsumers are increasingly seeking products with meaningful functional benefits, such as cognitive support, energy, and stress relief, along with solutions for issues like inflammation and digestion. In March 2024, South Korea approved vitamin K2 as a healthy functional food ingredient, following industry proposals and the vitamin\u2019s widespread use in supplements overseas. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) is establishing new specifications and usage standards for vitamin K2, aiming to expand the list of approved nutritional ingredients in functional foods. Local manufacturer GF-Fermentech, which produces vitamin K2 using fermentation technology, has been exporting the ingredient and is now expected to offer it for domestic use.\nOwing to an increased awareness of health and wellness, consumers nowadays desire more than simple nourishment from their food and more than hydration from their beverages. In June 2024, Daewoong Bio launched CRA-TG Soft Capsule in South Korea, a new combination product that merges the hyperlipidemia drug rosuvastatin with omega-3 fatty acids. This innovative capsule is designed to treat patients with high triglyceride levels by offering the lipid-lowering effects of rosuvastatin alongside the triglyceride-reducing benefits of omega-3, commonly used as a dietary supplement. The launch addresses the high prevalence of hyperlipidemia in Korea and the demand for combination therapies to improve patient compliance and outcomes.\nVitamin supplements accounted for a revenue share of 29.3% of the Asia Pacific market in 2024, due to increasing health awareness, rapid urbanization, and changing dietary patterns that often lead to nutrient deficiencies. Growing concerns over immunity, especially post-pandemic, have prompted consumers to prioritize preventive health through vitamin intake. Additionally, the expanding middle class, aging population, and greater access to healthcare information are driving the consumption of essential vitamins like C, D, and B-complex across the region.\nThe demand for products with protein & amino acids is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.2% from 2025 to 2033. The demand for protein and amino acid supplements in Asia Pacific is rising due to increasing health consciousness, growing participation in fitness and sports activities, and a surge in lifestyle-related health issues. Urban consumers, especially younger demographics, are seeking supplements to support muscle growth, endurance, and recovery. Additionally, rising disposable incomes and expanding gym and wellness culture across countries like India, China, and Southeast Asia are driving the adoption of protein powders, BCAAs, and other amino acid-based products.\nOver the counter (OTC) dietary supplements in Asia Pacific accounted for the largest revenue share of 76.5% in 2024. OTC sales are anticipated to witness steady growth over the coming years owing to the rising consumer awareness regarding the nutritional benefits of these products and the easy accessibility. Preventive healthcare practices are among the major factors driving the growth of this segment. The convenience of direct purchases and cost-effectiveness are expected to promote the sales of the OTC supplements during the forecast period.\nThe demand for prescribed dietary supplements in the Asia Pacific is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.9% from 2025 to 2033. The demand is growing due to rising awareness of preventive healthcare, increasing diagnosis of nutritional deficiencies, and greater trust in medical guidance. Additionally, lifestyle-related disorders, aging populations, and chronic diseases are prompting patients to seek doctor-approved supplements as part of their long-term health management. The assurance of quality, safety, and personalized dosage in prescribed supplements further supports this growing trend.\nTablet supplements accounted for the largest revenue share of 31.8% in 2024. The demand for dietary supplements in tablet form is rising in the Asia Pacific region due to increasing health awareness, busy lifestyles, and a growing preference for convenient, easy-to-consume formats. Tablets are favored for their longer shelf life, precise dosage, and portability, making them ideal for on-the-go consumers. Additionally, the rising middle-class population, increased spending on preventive healthcare, and expanding access to retail and online health channels are driving the popularity of tablet-based supplements across countries like China, India, Japan, and Southeast Asia.\nPowdered supplements are projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2025 to 2033. Consumers prefer powdered formats for their ease of mixing with water, milk, or traditional beverages, making them ideal for daily routines. Additionally, the region\u2019s growing fitness culture and interest in functional nutrition are driving demand for protein powders, herbal blends, and vitamin-infused drink mixes. The affordability, longer shelf life, and customizable dosage of powdered supplements further contribute to their growing popularity across diverse age groups in the region.\nAsia Pacific dietary supplements for immunity accounted for a revenue share of 11.9% of the Asia Pacific market in 2024. Consumers are proactively seeking ways to strengthen their immune systems through natural and preventive solutions. Urbanization, changing lifestyles, and rising pollution levels have also contributed to greater susceptibility to illness, prompting individuals to incorporate supplements containing ingredients like vitamin C, zinc, elderberry, and traditional herbs such as turmeric and ashwagandha. This growing focus on long-term wellness and preventive care continues to drive strong demand for immunity-focused supplements across the region.\nAsia Pacific dietary supplements for prenatal health are projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.5% from 2025 to 2033. The demand for dietary supplements supporting prenatal health is rising rapidly in Asia Pacific due to increasing awareness of maternal nutrition, improved healthcare access, and government-led initiatives promoting safe pregnancies.

Additionally, rising disposable incomes, urbanization, and delayed parenthood among working women are further contributing to the adoption of prenatal dietary supplements across the region.\nThe dietary supplements for adult\u2019s market accounted for a revenue share of 63.0% of the Asia Pacific market in 2024.

The demand for Asia Pacific dietary supplements among infants is growing due to increased awareness of early childhood nutrition, rising concerns over nutrient deficiencies, and recommendations from pediatricians for supplements like vitamin D, iron, and omega-3. Factors such as premature births, picky eating habits, and lack of breastfeeding in some cases further drive the need for supplemental support to ensure healthy growth, immunity, and brain development during the crucial early years.\nThe sales of Asia Pacific dietary supplements through offline channels accounted for a revenue share of around 77.3% of the region\u2019s revenue in 2024, due to consumers' preference for trust, personalized guidance, and the assurance of product authenticity. Pharmacies, health stores, and nutrition clinics offer direct interactions with pharmacists or healthcare professionals, allowing buyers to make informed decisions based on expert advice. This is especially important for first-time users, elderly consumers, or those purchasing prescribed supplements. In regions with limited digital literacy or lower internet penetration, offline retail continues to be the primary purchasing route, further driving growth in physical sales of Asia Pacific dietary supplements.\nThe sales of Asia Pacific dietary supplements through online channels are projected to grow at a CAGR of 9.3% from 2025 to 2033. E-commerce platforms offer detailed product descriptions, reviews, and comparisons, enabling informed decisions without visiting physical stores.

The government of China has taken numerous initiatives in recent years to promote the benefits of consuming healthy food and following a healthy lifestyle. It has also taken steps to raise the nutrient intake among consumers, along with a focus on building a nutrient-fortified food industry and the development of healthy food products in the near future.\nThe dietary supplements market in Japan is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.6% from 2025 to 2033. The growing number of fitness clubs across the country has been contributing to the increasing product demand. At a macro level, various factors have been contributing to the growth of the Japan Asia Pacific dietary supplements market.

In addition, the growing incidence of lifestyle diseases such as malnourishment, overweight, and high blood pressure, coupled with the high cost of medical treatments, is expected to increase the level of health awareness among consumers, which, in turn, is anticipated to fuel the demand for Asia Pacific dietary supplements.\nEstablished companies and emerging players in the Asia Pacific dietary supplements market are creating a competitive environment by emphasizing product innovation, quality, and strategic pricing. This heightened competition is driven by the need for ongoing investment in advanced manufacturing facilities, automation, and skilled professionals to ensure operational efficiency and regulatory compliance. The market landscape is further influenced by rising consumer demand for health and wellness solutions.\nGrowing awareness of chronic health issues such as diabetes, obesity, and nutrient deficiencies is encouraging consumers to seek targeted and preventive nutrition through Asia Pacific dietary supplements.

Available in chocolate and vanilla flavors, this low-fat drink is tailored to support healthy growth, brain development, and immunity in young children.\nFixx Nutrition, a leading Australian sports nutrition brand and the official sports nutrition partner for the 2024 Gold Coast Marathon, launched new flavors of its popular FIXX Gel X Pro energy gels. The new all-natural, vegan-friendly, and gluten-free flavors-Vanilla-Maple, Raspberry Fizz, and Pear Cider-are available with or without caffeine and are designed to offer athletes more choice and excitement compared to typical sports supplements. The launch coincides with the lead-up to the Gold Coast Marathon, highlighting the brand\u2019s commitment to supporting endurance athletes with innovative, effective, and enjoyable nutrition solutions.\nIn April 2023, A South Korean\u2013manufactured omega-3 supplement became the first in the country to receive Nutrasource\u2019s third-party International Fish Oil Standards (IFOS) certification. This marks the first time a supplement made entirely in South Korea-without importing ingredients or manufacturing abroad-has earned the IFOS label. The certification was achieved by FMW Corp., with support from Nutrasource and approval from the Korean Health Supplements Association (KHSA), which reviews such applications for the Korea Food & Drug Administration. This milestone highlights the high quality of FMW\u2019s products and underscores the growing importance of transparency and third-party testing in the South Korean supplement market.\n|\nReport Attribute |\nDetails |\n|\nMarket size value in 2025 |\nUSD 71.00 billion |\n|\nRevenue forecast in 2033 |\nUSD 151.24 billion |\n|\nGrowth rate |\nCAGR of 9.9% from 2025 to 2033 |\n|\nActual data |\n2021 - 2024 |\n|\nForecast period |\n2025 - 2033 |\n|\nQuantitative units |\nRevenue in USD billion, and CAGR from 2025 to 2033 |\n|\nReport coverage |\nRevenue forecast, company ranking, competitive landscape, growth factors, and trends |\n|\nSegments covered |\nIngredients, type, form, application, end user distribution channel, ingredient-form, form-end user, form-application, region |\n|\nRegional scope |\nAsia Pacific |\n|\nCountry scope |\nChina; India; Japan; Australia & New Zealand; South Korea |\n|\nKey companies profiled |\nAmway Corp.; Abbott; Bayer AG; Glanbia plc; Pfizer Inc.; Archer Daniels Midland; NU SKIN; GlaxoSmithKline plc.; Herbalife Nutrition Ltd.; Nature's Sunshine Products, Inc.; XanGo, LLC; RBK Nutraceuticals Pty Ltd; American Health; DuPont de Nemours, Inc.; Good Health New Zealand; Nature's Bounty; NOW Foods |\n|\nCustomization scope |\nFree report customization (equivalent up to 8 analysts\u2019 working days) with purchase.

      "text": "Solar Foods is a technology company that aims to commercialise food raw materials to replace food of animal origin, and the patented technology platform used to produce them, hydrogen fermentation. We aim to produce new food raw materials for the global market using both existing and new microbial strains under development.\nOur business model is twofold:\n1) invest in Solein\u2019s production capacity and supply protein raw materials to food product manufacturers (B2B)\n2) license hydrogen fermentation technology and production organisms for customers supplying raw materials to the food industry.\nInvestment in production capacity and supply to food product manufacturers\nThe first part of the business model is to supply food product manufacturers with a protein product called Solein, which serves as a raw material for their products. Solein\u2019s pricing is based on its application and other protein options available on the market that customers may consider instead of Solein. Currently, we can only produce Solein in limited quantities, so the price per kilogram is currently hundreds of euros. We have invested over EUR 40 million in a hydrogen fermentation plant, Factory 01, in Vehkala, in Vantaa. The purpose of Factory 01 is to verify the ultimate scalability of our technology.\nAfter the investment phase, we estimate that our commercial factories will generate strong and predictable cash flow, as production is not dependent on long raw material supply chains or their strategic supply risks. In addition, the working capital tied to the process is low.\nLicensing of hydrogen fermentation technology\nIn some regions or product categories, we may not manufacture or sell Solein directly but aim to license our technology to an industrial partner.\nSuch a partner would be responsible for the construction and operation of the Solein plant and would have the right to sell Solein in certain regions or product categories. In return, we would receive a license fee based on a general percentage of the licensee\u2019s total net sales. Potential partners include, for example, companies supplying raw materials to the food industry.\nOur potential customers are all companies that manufacture and/or sell food products. Potential customers can be divided into five groups:\n1) Global and local food companies that sell food products under their own brand to consumers\n2) Global and local restaurant and caf\u00e9 chains\n3) Grocery store chains with own brands\n4) Contract manufacturers of food products\n5) Distributors and resellers of food ingredients.\nWe are currently focusing on global and local food companies that sell food products under their own brands to consumers. These companies, and above all global food companies, are the largest customer segment in terms of potential volume.\nThe current customer base consists of companies that supply raw materials for the food industry or manufacture and sell food products.\nThe customer has access to a small amount of Solein material. The customer tests Solein\u2019s properties and assesses whether Solein is suitable for their products.\nIn the next step, the customer develops concrete food products using Solein as a raw material. This typically involves the following steps: optimising the taste and texture profile of the food product, shelf-life tests, consumer tests, packaging solutions, pilot and production run at the factory.\nAfter this, it is time to prepare for a commercial launch and we sign a purchase agreement with the customer. The agreement defines concrete commercial and operational terms and conditions. At this point, the customer starts discussions and preparations with the retail chains.\nThe first food products containing Solein become available to consumers on store shelves. Potential customers typically start launching with a few individual products and in one pilot country. At this stage, feedback is collected from consumers, the product solution is modified when necessary and preparations are also made for a wider launch.\nAt this stage, products containing Solein are launched in the entire product category and several countries."

      "text": "Solar Foods: New letter of intent related to future production plant\nTranslation: Original published in Finnish on 7/16/2025 at 7:00 am EEST.\nSolar Foods announced it had signed a letter of intent for 500-1650 tons of annual Solein production between 2026 and 2030. This corresponds to 4-13% of the planned Factory 02's production capacity. The company announced in March two other letters of intent, which, together with this agreement, account for approximately 50-60% of the future production facility's capacity. This supports the company's growth prospects and opportunities to implement the planned factory investment. In addition, we believe customers can also support financing for the factory project. Our forecasts already anticipate the company's relatively successful commercialization of Solein, and the agreement therefore does not impact them.\nThe new letter of intent strengthens the outlook for the future plant\nSolar Foods states that it has signed a letter of intent with a \"leading international brand in Health & Performance Nutrition\". As a letter of intent, the agreement is non-binding, and its purpose is to define product development cooperation between the companies and to guide planning towards binding agreements. Interest in Solein indicates its commercial potential.\nThe company plans an investment in an industrial-scale factory (Factory 02), with a full capacity of 12,800 tons in 2030. The final investment decision for the facility is scheduled for 2026, with production commencing in 2028 and gradually ramping up to full capacity. Together with the letters of intent signed in March, the company now has letters of intent totaling about 50-60% of the planned plant\u2019s production capacity. The company has also announced smaller contracts this year.\nCustomers may also provide support for the financing of the factory project\nLetters of intent are naturally a positive signal for Solein produced by Solar Foods and support the company's plans to scale up production to an industrial scale. The plant investment is substantial for Solar Foods, but we believe customers may support the project's financing, e.g., through equity stakes or pre-orders.\nSolar Foods established in 2017 is a global leader in sustainable protein production, solving the global food production problem by offering a completely new alternative to existing animal and plant proteins. Solar Foods\u2019 first product is the naturally occurring single-cell protein Solein\u00ae, which can be used as a food raw material with high protein content. In the long run, Solein production will improve global availability of protein and increase price and quality stability of food raw materials by disconnecting food production from agriculture.\nRead more on company pageKey Estimate Figures28.02\n| 2024 | 25e | 26e | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Revenue | 0.0 | 0.5 | 2.3 |\n| growth-% | 275.5 % | 2,741.3 % | 331.2 % |\n| EBIT (adj.) | -8.9 | -9.2 | -11.9 |\n| EBIT-% (adj.) | -47,635.3 % | -1,721.2 % | -520.8 % |\n| EPS (adj.) | -0.45 | -0.42 | -0.51 |\n| Dividend | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n| Dividend % | |||\n| P/E (adj.) | neg. | neg. | neg. |\n| EV/EBITDA | neg. | 290.9 | neg. |"

      "text": "Solar Foods\u2019 Solein\u00ae makes its debut in Singapore\u2019s resilient food culture\nShilei Zhang\nCCO\nSingapore is now the first country in the world to approve a microbial novel food grown with carbon dioxide and electricity. Their market is now open for Solein\u00ae. On May 25th, a fine-dining restaurant in Singapore will host the first-ever official Solein tasting event, showcasing the potential of this novel food. We spoke with Shilei Zhang, Chief Commercial Officer of Solar Foods about the significance of the approval.\nThe world in miniature\nSingapore is a global living laboratory for new foods and food technologies. There are a multitude of reasons why Singaporeans are not squeamish about being the first ones to have food on their plates that no one has ever tasted before.\nIn Singapore, the wide range of cuisines is viewed as crucial to its national identity and a unifying cultural thread. Zhang believes a lot of Singapore\u2019s pioneering spirit comes down to its cultural history: \u201cSingapore is a great place to bring new foods into the market because it is a mishmash of cultures that live for versatile and diverse foods.\u201d\nSingapore has a unique food culture: a combination of Malay cuisine with its fragrant laksas, the spicy and tangy flavours of the South Chinese and Indian diasporas and Western traditions from Singapore\u2019s colonial past. Religious dietary strictures do exist; Muslims do not eat pork and Hindus do not eat beef, and there is also a significant group of vegetarians/vegans. Singaporeans are foodies, they eat outside a lot, and there are lots of inexpensive restaurants and hawker stalls to choose from. Many people don\u2019t have the means to make food at home either so people from different communities often eat together while being mindful of each other\u2019s culture and choosing food that is acceptable for all. \u201cIt\u2019s the world in miniature if you look at populations in the world,\u201d remarks Zhang.\nBuilding resilience for a tiny powerhouse\nSingapore is motivated to be the first to introduce new, less resource-consuming foods because of an apparent reason. Singapore is completely dependent on imported food. This is a huge challenge for food security. A supply shock due to politics or natural disasters could have devastating effects on the country and with the global food crisis looming, Singapore must make their own food production punch above its weight. Singapore has set a resilience strategy called 30 by 30, which aims to produce 30 percent of the country\u2019s food domestically by 2030. After GOOD Meat by Eat Just announced it is building a factory in Singapore, Singapore proved its ability to react quickly and promote the licensing of novel foods is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of the world.\nProducing a third of the food consumed by 5.8 million people in an area smaller than Disney World would be impossible if it wasn\u2019t for new technological and societal solutions. Singapore has its sights on becoming an agri-food hub sans agriculture by venturing further into novel foods than any other country. Singapore was the first in the world to approve the sale of lab-grown meat, in the form of Eat Just\u2019s cultivated chicken in 2020. They join Singapore\u2019s cohort of homegrown food techs, ranging from cultivated protein players like cell-based milk maker TurtleTree Labs, and crustacean-focused Shiok Meats, jackfruit alternative meat startup Karana, and the plant-based chicken brand Tindle.\nHowever, there is no one making protein out of CO2 and electricity in Singapore. Yet. This marks a moment in the history of humanity, which has been bound to farming for the last 10,000 years. Solein will be the first food in the world that is completely disconnected from agriculture. Singapore is in many ways the perfect testing ground for a food which doesn\u2019t require land or soil. This also makes it possible to consider having a Solein factory in the middle of a big city, although there are no plans for one yet.\nStricter safety regulations help introduce novel foods\nSingapore enjoys one of the lowest incidences of food-borne disease outbreaks compared to the rest of the world even though more than 90% of all food consumed is imported. This is because Singapore observes stringent food safety standards. As the national authority for food safety in Singapore, The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has put in place an effective integrated food safety system to ensure that food is safe for consumption.\n\u201cThe most important point that this shows is that our food is 100% ready to eat. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has made that abundantly clear,\u201d says Zhang.\nIn November 2019 Singapore set up new regulatory guidelines to assess the safety of \u201cnovel foods\u201d such as microbial foods, plant-based alternative proteins and cultured or lab-grown meat, amid growing demand for protein substitutes. The guidelines made it clear what safety measures food technology companies are required to take to ensure their products are allowed for sale. Companies must report on a product\u2019s toxicity, allergens and safety of their production method, as well as the materials used in the manufacturing processes and how they are controlled to prevent food safety risks. Making the regulations more transparent and proactive also helped companies on their journey to introduce more sustainable, healthy, and functional novel foods to the Singaporean market.\nThe ingredient to tie the tastes together\nZhang believes an important aspect of thinking about novel alternative proteins is the difference in the way dishes are structured in Asian cuisine: \u201cA lot of the focus in the alternative protein discourse is on how to produce substitutes to burgers and steaks and other chunks of meat. Having meat at the centre of the plate is a pretty Western-centric way of looking at food. Most of the people in the world live in countries, especially Asian ones, where meat is more of a flavouring, to go with a dozen other ingredients to produce something greater than the sum of its parts.\u201d\nSolein is ideal for foods made with this principle. And it\u2019s great for making alternative meats too. It\u2019s a versatile protein that has an enormous number of functions. You can use it as a structure-forming ingredient to produce many different textures and tastes that would have a protein component in them in sauces, spreads, beverages, noodles or pasta, baked goods or in foods to replace meat, dairy, or eggs.\nHowever, in the end, it all comes down to taste, wherever you are. Singapore is a great test kitchen because they relish a very wide variety of flavours, as long as the dishes are delicious.\n\u201cIf we want to create a product that will be enjoyed across the globe, it also must be able to provide all the tastes of the world. That is where Solein\u2019s real strength lies,\u201d says Zhang.\nHe continues, \u201cSolein is wonderful in that you can make it taste like anything. We have made savoury dishes and we\u2019ve made sweet desserts and Solein has enhanced every food we\u2019ve added it to.\u201d\nFirst Singapore, then the world\nNow that Solar Foods has a licence to sell Solein in Singapore, the next phase is bringing it to people\u2019s plates. There is a lot to be done before that. The approval by the SFA is what Solar Foods hopes and expects to be the first of many across the world in the coming years. Solar Foods is seeking GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status assessment for Solein soon in the United States, and applications for novel food authorisation have been filed earlier in other key markets such as the UK and the European Union. Singapore is sure to see more Solein too. 2024 will see the opening of Factory 01, the first commercial-scale Solein production facility. Factory 01 will produce Solein for the needs of food brands, the food industry and food service companies.\nWith expanded production capacity the cost will also see a significant drop.\n\u201cDemand already exceeds supply by a large margin. The factory will be ready by the end of next year and discussions are underway with many food producers on how we can go even further. We\u2019re happy to speak to everyone ready to match the size of our vision,\u201d Zhang declares.\nA historic moment: the first Solein tasting ever is taking place in Singapore\nNow, for the first time, Solein will be tasted by the public at a fine-dining restaurant in Singapore on May 25th, 2023. This is a watershed moment in food history, as Solein is the world\u2019s first protein made out of air that will be tasted and eaten by the general public.\nThis tasting event exemplifies one of the thousands of ways Solein can make its way onto people\u2019s plates. Professional chefs in Singapore were given full freedom to present how they would use this new futuristic raw material, discover the right cooking methods and use their creativity to come up with dishes they are proud to offer their customers. If Solein is tasty enough for Michelin-starred chefs, it should be good enough for the everyday products in your grocery bag.\nFor the first time, we will also hear what people who are tasting Solein think of how it has been interpreted on plated dishes. The way food arrives on our plates will change in the future, but the dishes, the taste and the traditions that are strongly associated with food will remain almost unchanged. The future will taste what you want it to taste like."

      "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This release was updated on Nov. 5, 2024, to include the Phase 3 international runners-up.\nNASA has awarded a total of $1.25 million to three U.S. teams in the third and final round of the agency\u2019s Deep Space Food Challenge. The teams delivered novel food production technologies that could provide long-duration human space exploration missions with safe, nutritious, and tasty food.\nThe competitors\u2019 technologies address NASA\u2019s need for sustainable food systems for long-duration habitation in space, including future Artemis missions and eventual journeys to Mars. Advanced food systems also could benefit life on Earth and inspire food production in parts of the world that are prone to natural disasters, food insecurity, and extreme environments.\n\u201cThe Deep Space Food Challenge could serve as the framework for providing astronauts with healthy and delicious food using sustainable mechanisms,\u201d said Angela Herblet, challenge manager for the Deep Space Food Challenge at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \u201cThe challenge has brought together innovative and driven individuals from around the world who are passionate about creating new solutions that support our agency\u2019s future Moon to Mars missions.\u201d\nSince the challenge\u2019s launch in 2021, more than 300 teams from 32 countries have participated by submitting innovative food system designs. The competition, conceived and managed by NASA Centennial Challenges at NASA Marshall, is a first-of-its-kind coordinated effort between NASA and CSA (Canadian Space Agency), which ran its own challenge in parallel.\nFour American teams competed in Phase 3, which began in September 2023. The Methuselah Foundation partnered with Ohio State University to facilitate the final phase of the challenge, which included a two-month testing and demonstration period held on the university\u2019s campus in Columbus, Ohio. Each U.S. team in Phase 3 was awarded $50,000 and took their technology to Columbus for testing.\nThroughout this phase, the teams constructed full-scale food production systems that were required to pass developmental milestones like safety, sensory testing, palatability, and harvesting volumes. Each team worked with four \u201cSimunauts,\u201d a crew of Ohio State students who managed the testing and demonstrations for Phase 3 over the eight-week period. The data gathered from testing was delivered to a judging panel to determine the winner.\nThe challenge concluded at the Deep Space Food Symposium, a two-day networking and learning summit at the Nationwide and Ohio Farm Bureau 4-H Center on Aug. 15 and 16. Throughout the event, attendees met the Phase 3 finalists, witnessed demonstrations of the food production technologies, and attended panels featuring experts from NASA, government, industry, and academia. The winners of the challenge were announced at an awards ceremony at the end of the symposium.\nThe U.S. winner and recipient of the $750,000 grand prize is Interstellar Lab of Merritt Island, Florida. Led by Barbara Belvisi, the small business combines several autonomous phytotrons and environment-controlled greenhouses to support a growth system involving a self-sustaining food production mechanism that generates fresh vegetables, microgreens, and insects necessary for micronutrients.\nTwo runners-up each earned $250,000 for their food systems\u2019 successes: Nolux of Riverside, California, and SATED of Boulder, Colorado.\nNolux, a university team led by Robert Jinkerson, constructed an artificial photosynthetic system that can create plant and fungal-based foods without the operation of biological photosynthesis.\nStanding for Safe Appliance, Tidy, Efficient & Delicious, SATED is a one-man team of Jim Sears, who developed a variety of customizable food, from pizza to peach cobbler. The product is fire-safe and was developed by long-shelf-life and in-situ grown ingredients.\nNASA also selected and recognized one international team as a Phase 3 winner: Solar Foods of Lappeenranta, Finland, developed a food production system through gas fermentation that relies on single-cell protein production. Enigma of the Cosmos from Melbourne, Australia, and Mycorena from Gothenburg, Sweden, also were recognized as the international runners-up.\nIn April 2024, CSA and Impact Canada awarded the grand prize winner of its parallel challenge to Ecoation, a Vancouver-based small business specializing in greenhouses.\n\u201cCongratulations to the winners and all the finalist teams for their many years dedicated to innovating solutions for the Deep Space Food Challenge,\u201d said Amy Kaminski, program executive for NASA\u2019s Prizes, Challenges, and Crowdsourcing at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \u201cThese food production technologies could change the future of food accessibility on other worlds and our home planet.\u201d\nAlso present at the symposium was celebrity chef and cookbook author Tyler Florence. After spending time with each finalist team and getting acquainted with their food systems, Florence selected one team to receive the \u201cTyler Florence Award for Culinary Innovation.\u201d Team SATED of Boulder, Colorado, received the honor for their system that impressed Florence due to its innovative approach to the challenge.\nThe Deep Space Food Challenge, a NASA Centennial Challenge, is a coordinated effort between NASA and CSA. Subject matter experts at Johnson Space Center in Houston and Kennedy Space Center in Florida, supported the competition. NASA\u2019s Centennial Challenges are part of the Prizes, Challenges, and Crowdsourcing program within NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate and managed at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The Methuselah Foundation, in partnership with NASA, oversees the United States and international competitors.\nTo learn more about the Deep Space Food Challenge, visit:\n-end-\nJasmine Hopkins\nHeadquarters, Washington\n321-432-4624\njasmine.s.hopkins@nasa.gov\nLane Figueroa\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.\n256-932-1940\nlane.e.figueroa@nasa.gov"

It originates from a natural, non-modified, single-cell organism. It is nonetheless a completely natural protein, even though it is not grown traditionally. Solein offers endless possibilities for the food industry and the nutritious, tasty and sustainable foods of tomorrow.\nEndless possibilities\nSolein vanishes into virtually any daily meal while simultaneously maintaining its nutrient density. By offering a unified solution that caters to virtually every imaginable meal of today, Solein can replace the protein in virtually any food.\nUp until now, the novel protein has been produced only in small quantities and Solein-powered foods have been available in limited editions. This is finally about to change. Factory 01, the world\u2019s first Solein factory begins operations in Finland. As Solein production moves to a commercial scale, food brands will be able to explore the ingredient\u2019s potential in a whole new way.\nTo learn more about how Solein will liberate global protein production, visit Solein\u2019s own website.\n|\nTypical values of Solein\u00ae (Average values from dry weight) |\n|\n|\nprotein content fat carbohydrates total dietary fibres minerals |\n78% 6% 2% 10% 4% |\nNutritious goodness\nSolein is 78% protein, 6% fat (primarily unsaturated fats), 10% dietary fibres, 2% carbohydrates and 4% mineral nutrients. Solein is also a good source of micronutrients like iron (1,1g/kg) and vitamin B12 (50 \u00b5g/kg).\nWhile protein is found in both plant and animal-based foods, edible proteins are not all the same. They are made up of different combinations of amino acids and are characterised by the ratio and amount of essential amino acids they have.\nSolein contains all of the nine essential amino acids that are required by the human body.\n|\nNATURAL AND SUSTAINABLE NUTRITIENT DENSE CONTAINS IRON LOW IN SODIUM AND FAT SOY-AND GLUTEN-FREE NON-DAIRY NON-GMO ANIMAL-FREE |\nCreating a better tomorrow\nSolein unlocks a world of new food diversity that is genuinely sustainable. It not only creates an infinite food supply for our world but also allows consumers to choose foods with a genuinely sustainable protein source. By mixing together our knowledge of nature and science, we seek to create a delicious future of food filled with mouth-watering possibilities.\nSolein will liberate global\nprotein production\n- Secure supply\nSolein can be grown anywhere in the world, providing a secure supply of protein. - No ethical or environmental harm\nSolein avoids all the ethical dilemmas of agriculture from destructive land use to animal suffering. - Cost competitive\nSolein production can easily be scaled and the price of renewable energy is rapidly dropping. - Nutritious\nSolein has a verifiably balanced nutritional profile containing protein, dietary fibres, vitamins and minerals. - Highly functional\nSolein has been successfully tested in multiple foods with different tastes and textures, ranging from alternative meat to noodles to ice cream.\nSolar Foods\u2019 Solein\u00ae received its first novel food regulatory approval in September 2022 from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA). This approves the import, manufacture and sale of food products containing Solein in Singapore. In September 2024 Solein obtained self-affirmed GRAS status (Generally Recognized As Safe) in the United States. Solar Foods has filed for novel food dossier for Solein in other key markets such as the EU and UK. The world\u2019s first commercial-scale Solein production facility, Factory 01, has started production in spring 2024."
