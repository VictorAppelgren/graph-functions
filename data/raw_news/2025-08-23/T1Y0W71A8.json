I think I speak for a lot of other former players and Viking fans when I say that this does not represent this great franchise,\" Brewer said.\n\"Now we\u2019re being represented with men with pom-poms on the sideline. It\u2019s sickening. No man needs to ever have a pom-pom in their hand.\"\nBrewer added that he believes the inclusion of men on the cheerleading squad is an attempt to \"manipulate children.\"\n\"This is purely an attempt to manipulate young children, to overtake the minds of young children with this spiritual evilness,\" Brewer said. \"The influence on kids is manipulating the mind of the children.

They\u2019re trying to take gender and say, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to make it more about gender than we are about masculinity.\u2019 Then, you\u2019re going to have a huge problem. It\u2019s coming.\"\nTuberville warned that fans may stop buying tickets to games if male cheerleaders become more prevalent.\n\"People will actually quit buying tickets because this is the narrative they\u2019re trying to push. This is not just about a couple of people being men cheerleaders,\" Tuberville said. \"It is about pushing a narrative that you want to put gender into sports and let everyone know we\u2019re trying to show, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to take the masculinity out of it a little bit.\u2019\"\nBrewer praised Tuberville for his recent statements.\n\"Thank God for Tommy Tuberville, who came out with a strong statement standing up against that\u2014one of the greatest college football coaches in the history of the game\u2014because he knows he has a voice. He\u2019s trying to speak out, not just for his perspective, but for the perspective of the vast majority of coaches, players, and even fans. This is not supported by the fans.
