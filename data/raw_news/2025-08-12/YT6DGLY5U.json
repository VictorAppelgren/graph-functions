  "description": "Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) slammed Trump and FBI Director Kash Patel on Tuesday following the publication of a whistleblower report targeting him.",
  "content": "Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) slammed President Donald Trump and FBI Director Kash Patel on Tuesday following the publication of a whistleblower report accusing Schiff of authorizing leaks of classified information meant to damage Trump during his first term.\n\nOn Monday night, Just the News published documents claiming that a whistleblower identified as a former Democratic staffer on the House Intelligence Committee reported Schiff\u2019s behavior to the FBI in 2017. The whistleblower referred to Schiff\u2019s actions as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the report during Tuesday\u2019s briefing. She confirmed that Trump \u201cwants to see Adam Schiff investigated for the countless lies he told the American people in relation to the Russia-gate scandal.\u201d\n\nLeavitt also read off a statement, attributed to Patel, on the issue:\n\n\u201cFor years, certain officials used their positions to selectively leak classified information to shape political narratives. It was all done with one purpose, to weaponize intelligence and law enforcement for political gain,\u201d Patel said, per Leavitt. \u201cThose abuses eroded public trust in our institutions, the FBI will now lead the charge with our partners at DOJ and Congress, will have the chance to uncover how political power may have been weaponized to restore accountability.\u201d\n\nSchiff\u2019s office responded to the whistleblower report with a statement, referring to the whistleblower as a disgruntled former staffer and accusing the administration of seeking to distract the public from questions about Trump\u2019s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\u201cKash Patel\u2019s latest smear against Senator Schiff is absolutely and categorically false, and is just the latest in a series of defamatory attacks from the President and his allies meant to distract from their plummeting poll numbers and the Epstein files scandal,\u201d Schiff\u2019s spokesperson wrote. \u201cThese baseless smears are based on allegations that were found to be not reliable, not credible, and unsubstantiated from a disgruntled former staffer who was fired by the House Intelligence Committee for cause in early 2017, including for harassment and potentially compromising activity on official travel for the Committee.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added that \u201ceven Trump\u2019s own Justice Department and an independent inspector general found this individual to not be credible, have \u2018little support for their contentions\u2019 and was of \u2018unknown reliability,\u2019 and concluded that his accusations against Members of Congress and congressional staff \u2018were not ultimately substantiated.'\u201d",

      "text": "President Donald Trump is painting Democrats as soft on crime ahead of the 2026 midterm elections as he seizes control of law enforcement in Washington and accuses liberals of presiding over a public safety crisis.\nTrump announced Monday morning that he, for the first time in the nation\u2019s history, will federalize the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia and mobilize hundreds of National Guard troops to supplement a crackdown on violent crime in the district.\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF DC POLICE TO FIGHT CRIME: WHAT TO KNOW\nThe move was followed by Trump\u2019s threats to expand his law enforcement push to other cities led by Democrats, including Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore, and Oakland, California.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose our cities over this,\u201d Trump said of crime. \u201cAnd this will go further.\u201d\nWhile Washington is unique because Congress controls it and the president can order up the National Guard, Trump\u2019s calling out other blue cities put Democrats on defense, claiming that crime is not bad enough to warrant such federal interference.\n\u201cViolent crime in Washington, D.C. is at a thirty-year low,\u201d Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said. \u201cDonald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost.\u201d\nThe takeover of the MPD, which is expected to last 30 days, was met with outrage from leading Democratic lawmakers, including Govs. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), JB Pritzker (D-IL), and Wes Moore (D-MD), all possible 2028 presidential candidates.\n\u201cHe was just getting warmed up in Los Angeles,\u201d Newsom wrote on social media following Trump\u2019s Monday press conference, referencing the president\u2019s use of National Guard assets earlier this year to quell protests and riots surrounding Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in the Los Angeles area. \u201cHe will gaslight his way into militarizing any city he wants in America. This is what dictators do.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not lie to the public, you and I both know you have no authority to take over Chicago,\u201d Pritzker added in his statement. \u201cBy the way, where are the Epstein files?\u201d\nMoore said, \u201cTrump\u2019s decision to mobilize the National Guard to conduct municipal policing in D.C. lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous.\u201d\nThe Democratic Mayors Association cited statistics showing that \u201ccrime is down in most major cities \u2014 including Washington, D.C.\u201d to claim that Trump \u201conly wants to create another political charade to serve his own interests and distract Americans from his failures.\u201d\nSenior Republican operatives with close ties to the Trump White House told the Washington Examiner that Newsom, Pritzker, and other presidential hopefuls \u201cpredictably\u201d fell into Trump\u2019s political trap, one that pits them on the \u201closing side\u201d of the issue.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no denying that Washington is an absolute cesspool \u2014 wannabe teenage gangsters, weed smoke everywhere,\u201d one former Trump administration official said. \u201cPresident Trump is doing what any reasonable person would hope, making this city safe and livable. And instead of saying, \u2018Thank you, Mr. President, for cleaning up our streets,\u2019 the Democrats are coming out as pro-crime. It\u2019s the perfect play.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly hope so,\u201d a veteran operative with past work on Trump\u2019s political campaigns laughed when asked if Trump\u2019s move could put Democrats at a disadvantage ahead of next year\u2019s elections.\nTrump has employed similar tactics in the past, albeit with mixed results. Throughout the 2020 campaign, which he lost, the president repeatedly sought to paint Democratic nominee Joe Biden and others in his party as soft on crime by linking them to the Black Lives Matter protests and national police reform movements.\nThat tactic proved much more successful during the 2024 election. However, as Trump was able to spin Biden and then-Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s border policies into electoral gold, he specifically sought to tie immigration to crime on Monday morning.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to take it just like we did on our southern border,\u201d he said during his press conference. \u201cNobody comes to our southern border anymore.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s intervention happened after a string of high-profile crimes in Washington, including the murder of two Israeli Embassy staffers, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim; the attack of Edward Coristine, a former Department of Government Efficiency engineer who goes by the nickname \u201cBig Balls;\u201d and the shooting death of 21-year-old congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym.\nTamara Tarpinian-Jachym, Eric\u2019s mother, said she does not care that statistics show crime may be declining when far too many people are getting hurt.\n\u201cI looked at Eric\u2019s ashes, and I said, \u2018Eric, you haven\u2019t died in vain,'\u201d Tarpinian-Jachym told Fox News in praising Trump\u2019s announcement. \u201cThings will change so other people are safe when they go visit D.C. or work at D.C. And that\u2019s my goal, to make people safe.\u201d\nEven the DC Police Union issued a statement on Monday welcoming Trump\u2019s takeover announcement. Chairman Gregg Pemberton said his union stands \u201cwith the president in recognizing that Washington, DC, cannot continue on this trajectory.\u201d\n\u201cCrime is out of control, and our officers are stretched beyond their limits,\u201d Pemberton wrote. \u201cThe federal intervention is a critical stopgap, but the MPD needs proper staffing and support to thrive. This can only happen by repealing the disastrous policies that have driven out our best officers and hindered recruitment.\u201d\n\u201cThis is why Democrats continue to be so unpopular among everyday Americans \u2014 they think the President of the United States cracking down on crime in our nation\u2019s capital is a bad thing,\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers added in a statement when asked if Trump\u2019s announcement is meant to put political pressure on the opposing party.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s polling remains negative, with the RealClearPolitics average showing his approval rating sitting 6 points underwater as of Monday. Furthermore, only 4% of respondents to an Economist-YouGov tracking poll last week ranked crime as the most important issue to them, with inflation and prices (21%), jobs and the economy (14%), and healthcare (11%) all significantly outranking crime.\nAnd not all Democrats took Trump\u2019s Monday bait.\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser framed Trump\u2019s announcement as an opportunity to supplement their existing police initiatives.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.\u201d\nThough Bowser did call Trump\u2019s moves \u201cunprecedented,\u201d she also repeatedly declined to tell reporters that she would resist the federal takeover in any form or fashion, despite protests breaking out in the city demanding a \u201cFree D.C.\u201c\n\u201cIf people are concerned about the president being able to move the National Guard into our city, the time to do that would have been when Congress had a bill that it could have given control of the D.C. National Guard to D.C.,\u201d the mayor continued.\nA Democratic National Committee spokesman declined to comment on whether Trump\u2019s district takeover would put political pressure on Democrats regarding crime, instead citing Chairman Ken Martin\u2019s statement from earlier in the day.\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s record as president is marked by gross abuses of power, and his latest move to supersede local law enforcement by deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C. is no exception,\u201d Martin wrote.\nDemocratic strategist Mike Nellis downplayed questions regarding whether Trump has potentially put pressure on Democrats concerning crime.\n\u201cFederalizing the D.C. police is another wild swing from the president as his approval rating continues to crater,\u201d Nellis told the Washington Examiner. \u201cHis decision-making is driven by erratic attempts to change the subject.\u201d\nNellis, who worked for Harris\u2019s 2020 Democratic primary campaign, during which she was pressured regarding crime, added, \u201cPolls show him underwater on every major issue, including immigration. Most Americans don\u2019t care about what happens in DC \u2014 they want action on the economy, and most say they\u2019re worse off than before Trump took office.\u201d\nA second Democratic strategist, Christopher Hahn, agreed.\nTRUMP FEDERALIZES DC POLICE AND ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TO COMBAT CRIME: \u2018TAKE OUR CAPITAL BACK\u2019\n\u201cThis is the standard GOP playbook being taken to another level,\u201d Hahn said.\n\u201cNow that he\u2019s involved, he owns all of it,\u201d Hahn told the Washington Examiner regarding Trump. \u201cAnd we all know how powerful a single crime can be in political ads.\u201d"
