  "content": "For all the attention on the money-minting gains from AI today, there\u2019s an often-f0rgotten corner of the market that\u2019s been rallying \u2014 small-cap stocks. \n\n\n\nThe Russell 2000 Index is up 7.3% so far in August, which ties for its best month relative to the S&P 500 since July 2024. With the Federal Reserve seemingly prepared to cut interest rates at its meeting next month, there is reason to expect more gains from the index, which includes regional banks and industrial companies that could benefit from looser monetary policy. \n\n\n\n\u201cThe potential is certainly there\u201d for the small-cap index to keep rising, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. \u201cYou have the momentum now, which has been badly missing for a long time.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough few years for the group. Unless something drastic happens by Friday, it will mark the small-cap gauge\u2019s longest streak without a record since the dot-com bubble. By contrast, the S&P 500 Index has clocked 19 records this year alone.",
