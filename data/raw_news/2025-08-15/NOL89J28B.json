  "description": "Sharks Mark Cuban and Rashaun Williams share tips on raising capital, funding options, and building lasting business success.",
  "content": "When I interviewed billionaire investor Mark Cuban and venture capitalist Rashaun Williams \u2014 both speakers at the upcoming Clover x Shark Tank Summit \u2014 they didn\u2019t hold back on what it really takes to raise money and build a company that can stand the test of time. Both have seen countless entrepreneurs succeed \u2014 and just as many fail \u2014 and their advice is rooted in decades of experience.\n\nFor both, the message was clear: start with customers, prepare long before you pitch an investor, and keep your focus where it matters most \u2014 on sales and profitability.\n\nCuban says the biggest mistake founders make is chasing funding before proving anyone actually wants their product.\n\n\u201cI truly believe it's always better to have customers before you raise money,\u201d he told me. \u201cOnce you do, it gets easier.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a firm believer in sweat equity \u2014 starting small, even part time, to test your idea with real customers before seeking outside funding. If you don\u2019t have access to traditional capital, he suggests a more personal approach: \u201cCut back on personal expenses and save what you need.\u201d\n\nBut before you take anyone\u2019s money, Cuban cautions, make sure you know exactly what comes with it. \u201cUnderstand the obligations you have to the people providing you with capital.\u201d\n\nToo many founders, he added, miss the most important part of building a business. \u201cThey worry about everything but sales and profits.\u201d\n\nThe Three Barriers To Capital\n\nWilliams distills the funding challenge into three words: net worth, network, and traction.\n\n\u201cWrite that down, tattoo it on your arm and save yourself five years of wasting time,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that early funding rarely comes from venture capital or private equity. More often, it\u2019s a founder\u2019s own savings, contributions from friends and family, or angel investors already in their network. \u201cVenture capital is usually \u2018growth\u2019 capital, not \u2018idea\u2019 capital,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s why he believes in building connections well before you need them. And for those without traditional networks or resources, Williams points to other options. \u201cCrowdfunding and customer prepayments \u2014 I love those two options if you don't have the traditional means,\u201d he said.\n\nLaying The Groundwork Before Asking For Money\n\u2022 Put some of your own money into the venture.\n\u2022 Get out of what he calls the \u201cidea maze.\u201d\n\u2022 List every way your business could fail in the next two years \u2014 and plan for each.\n\nIn his view, most startups don\u2019t fail because their ideas are bad, but because the foundation is too weak to support growth. \u201cLack of planning, poor financial literacy, and misalignment with market needs are the real killers,\u201d he said.\n\nLearn From People Who Have Done It\n\nBoth Cuban and Williams agree: the most successful entrepreneurs start with customers, prepare early, and keep profits at the forefront.\n\nWilliams adds that events where founders can learn from experienced entrepreneurs can be game-changing. \u201cThat\u2019s why I love events like the Clover x Shark Tank Summit,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Super Bowl of entrepreneurship \u2014 the best athletes, the best sport, the biggest stage.\u201d\n\nTheir bottom line: build something solid, get creative about finding the money to grow it, and never lose sight of the people who matter most \u2014 your customers.",
