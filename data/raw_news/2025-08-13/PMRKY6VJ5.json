  "description": "Summer heat can spoil your camping trip. Follow these 10 tried-and-true tips to stay cool and comfortable.",
  "content": "Summer days are warm and long, which makes them great for outdoor activities like swimming, hiking and even camping. There's nothing quite like sleeping under the stars, and it's an excellent way to relax and unwind from the constant grind of your usual daily routine.\n\nSpending time outside has countless physical and mental health benefits. It can lower cortisol levels and stimulate the release of serotonin, often called the \"feel-good\" neurotransmitter. This helps to regulate mood and enhance your overall sense of well-being. It can also improve sleep quality by resetting your circadian rhythm to align with the natural rising and setting of the sun.\n\nOne downside to summer camping is the heat. Michael Gradisar, head of sleep science at Sleep Cycle, explains, \"Overheating during the night disrupts sleep, in the form of more frequent awakenings, night sweats and reduced sleep quality. For those already prone to rumination or insomnia, high nighttime temperatures act as an added stressor, making it even more likely you'll wake and struggle to drift off again. The result? Fragmented sleep and groggy warm mornings.\" If the thought of hot nights has been keeping you from your adventures, you're not alone. Several Reddit users are just as confused, trying to find effective ways to cool off while tent camping.\n\nThe good news is that there are ways to stay comfortable while camping this summer. Here are ten simple tips for keeping cool while sleeping outside.\n\nHow to stay cool while camping\n\nWhen camping in hot and humid conditions, choose a lightweight and breathable tent with plenty of mesh material and ventilation panels. Tents with a mesh canopy are ideal because they allow for adequate airflow and prevent heat from building up inside. If you're sharing the tent with a partner, children or pets, make sure there is sufficient space for everyone. Feeling sweaty and cramped all night is a surefire way to damper your camping experience.\n\nChoosing whether to use the rainfly can significantly impact your comfort while camping. I've made the mistake of leaving it off when I shouldn't have on multiple occasions, waking up with chattering teeth to unexpected rain and snow. I've also kept the rainfly on during warm nights, leading to restless slumber in a much-too-stuffy tent.\n\nIf there's no precipitation in the forecast, it's best to leave the rainfly off while sleeping on those hot summer nights. The extra airflow not only helps prevent overheating, but you'll also have a great view of the night sky above.\n\nWhere and when you pitch your tent are crucial components for a comfortable camping experience. First, prioritize a campsite that offers plenty of shade. This will help keep you cooler and prevent your tent from accumulating heat. Consider keeping your tent disassembled during the day and reassembling it after the sun has gone down -- that way, there's less opportunity for it to heat the tent.\n\nFor optimal ventilation, angle your tent so the door faces the breeze. Open all the vents and mesh windows, but ensure the door stays zipped to keep bugs out. If you want or need to use your rainfly, try one that extends past your tent door to create a small awning or shaded area in the front, which can help keep the interior cooler during the day.\n\nIt's best practice to go to bed and wake up with the sun while camping, as your tent will warm up quickly as soon as the sun rises. If you're trying to sleep in because you went to bed too late, you may find yourself uncomfortably tossing and turning in a stuffy tent all morning.\n\nRead more: 8 Hobbies to Boost Your Mental Wellness This Summer\n\nIf you can't keep your tent out of direct sunlight, consider covering it with a reflective sunshade or tarp. Be mindful of the sun's movement throughout the day and adjust the tarp as needed for optimal protection. Leave space between the sunshade and your tent to prevent hot air and condensation from getting trapped.\n\nI also recommend placing a groundsheet or tarp underneath your tent. It will add an extra layer of protection between you and the hard ground and safeguard against potential rainfall. A tarp can also extend the lifespan of your tent by protecting its floor from tears and rips.\n\nRunning a fan in your tent at night can help circulate the air and create a cool breeze, allowing you to sleep more comfortably. Portable fans come in various shapes and sizes, offering adjustable speeds and customizable airflow settings to fit your preferences. Fans designed for tent camping are typically lightweight, battery-operated (some are rechargeable) and may have hooks or clips for convenient attachment inside your tent. You'll want to consider the battery's run-time and how often you'd need to charge your fan if you're camping for multiple nights without electricity access.\n\nWhen setting up the fan in your tent, position it above your sleeping area rather than on the ground to avoid obstructions caused by people or gear. If your tent has vents, align the fan to draw cool air in or push warm air out through these openings.\n\nOne portable option is the Coghlan's Camping Fan, which features three fan speeds, a hook for hanging and a built-in light. If you want something more powerful, check out the Shark FlexBreeze Fan, chosen by CNET editors as one of the best outdoor tech products of 2025. Air conditioning units, such as the EcoFlow Wave portable AC unit, are also available if you want to indulge a bit and your campsite situation allows for it.\n\nIf you're looking for a fan to cool you down as you move around during the day, consider a wearable neck fan, which allows you to stay hands-free while enjoying a refreshing breeze.\n\nRead more: Survive the Summer Heat Wave With These Must-Have Cooling Products\n\nIf your camping environment is safe and the weather is clear, you might consider skipping the tent and using a hammock or trying cowboy camping instead. Cowboy camping means sleeping on the ground with a mattress pad and sleeping bag (without a tent for shelter). As always, be mindful of potential wildlife hazards and securely store any food and attractants to avoid drawing local wildlife to your campsite.\n\nMost sleeping bags are designed to provide insulation and warmth. Unless you have a breathable warm-weather sleeping bag, you might want to ditch it altogether. Instead, pack a lightweight sheet made of moisture-wicking materials such as linen, bamboo or cotton. Check out our list of the best cooling sheets for hot sleepers in 2025, tested and approved by CNET experts.\n\nYou can also stick your feet out from the sheet as you sleep, which will help regulate your core body temperature. \"As the body prepares for sleep, it naturally releases heat, especially from the hands, feet and face. This cooling coincides with increased sleepiness. But when your environment is too warm, your body can't shed heat effectively, making it harder to fall and stay asleep,\" says Gradisar.\n\nThough it seems obvious, I cannot emphasize this enough: stay hydrated. The risk of dehydration increases as you move and sweat throughout the day, which can lead to serious issues like dizziness, fatigue and reduced cognitive functioning if you're not drinking enough water.\n\nEngaging in activities during your camping trip, such as hiking, swimming, biking or even playing outdoor games, can be physically demanding, making it even more important to stay hydrated.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is to bring two gallons of water per person for each day of camping. This estimate includes the water you'll need for drinking, cooking and cleaning. Before you head out on your trip, check if the campground has a potable water system where you can refill. If you're hiking and camping in the backcountry, locate your water sources along the way, such as lakes, rivers and streams. Water is remarkably heavy -- bring a filtered water bottle or Lifestraw so you can refill and stay hydrated on the go without having to carry excess water weight. I highly recommend the Grayl GeoPress Purifier Water Bottle, which filters quickly and efficiently.\n\nIf you have the capacity, pack more water and ice than you think you'll need -- especially at higher elevations, where dehydration can occur quickly. If you plan to consume alcohol, be sure to drink plenty of water to help offset its diuretic effects. Additionally, keep in mind that alcohol can affect your sleep quality. \"Even moderate alcohol intake exacerbates the likelihood of waking from sleep,\" explains Gradisar.\n\nRead more: Best Filtered Water Bottles of 2025\n\nIt also doesn't hurt to bring some electrolyte powder. Electrolyte packets can help you stay hydrated by replenishing the essential minerals you need to function properly. My personal favorite and one of CNET's best electrolyte powders of 2025 is LMNT.\n\nIf your campsite offers showers, rinse off before bed. Showering can help lower your core body temperature, which signals to your brain that it's time for sleep. If there are no showers, consider dipping in a natural body of water nearby, wiping down with potable water or using wet wipes or cooling towels.\n\n10. Protect yourself during the day\n\nTo help stay cool while you sleep at night, focus on keeping your body comfortable throughout the day. Wear airy, breathable, moisture-wicking, light-colored clothing to protect your skin from the sun's intense rays. Wear a hat and sunglasses to shield your scalp, face and eyes. Finally, remember to apply sunscreen multiple times a day. The last thing you want is to add the discomfort of a sunburn on top of an already hot and stuffy tent situation.\n\nOther gear to bring camping this summer\n\nHow you camp and what you bring is entirely up to you -- you can go super minimal or pack the car to the brim as if preparing for the apocalypse. Regardless of your setup, your trip will be significantly improved if everyone stays safe and comfortable with the right gear and equipment. Here are a few other camping products I use and recommend having on hand.\n\nBear canister: If you live in bear country or are planning to enter bear territory, a bear canister is a must (unless your campsite provides bear boxes). For guidance on selecting the right one, check out this fun and informative article by Outdoor Life that evaluates the best bear canisters tested by actual grizzly bears. Bear canisters can also help prevent smaller animals, like chipmunks, pikas and marmots, from getting into your bag and accessing your food.\n\nHandheld GPS and/or satellite communicator: If you're heading into the backcountry, consider investing in a handheld GPS or satellite communicator. These devices offer accurate navigation in remote areas and can help you safely trek through unfamiliar terrain. In an emergency, a satellite communicator allows you to send distress signals and communicate with rescue services. These tools provide an added layer of security and peace of mind during your adventure, enabling you to stay connected while exploring and enjoying the remote beauty of the wilderness.\n\nIf you have an iPhone 14 or later, you can also use Emergency SOS via satellite to contact emergency services in remote areas without cell service. I had to use this feature recently on a hike and was impressed by how well it worked.\n\nPortable power bank: It's fun to go off-grid and disconnect from the \"real world\" while camping, but being vigilant and aware of your surroundings is important. I've found myself in multiple situations where it would have been highly beneficial -- and even potentially life-saving -- if my phone battery hadn't been dead. While I still put my phone on airplane mode to focus on living in the moment during camping and backpacking trips, I now also make a point to keep at least one person in the group's phone charged in case of emergencies.\n\nRead more: Best Power Banks for iPhones in 2025\n\nInsect repellent: Avoid setting up camp near stagnant water, as it increases humidity and attracts unwanted insects such as mosquitoes. There's nothing worse than being too hot and getting eaten alive by bugs. I like the EPA-registered Natrapel Insect Repellent for keeping mosquitoes, ticks and other insects away.",

But you should know that prolonged sun exposure and ultraviolet rays can cause premature aging, sunburn and even skin cancer, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation -- and that's true all year round. However, it's now summer and the urgency for sunscreen is two-fold. Using sunscreen is one of the best ways to protect your skin from the damaging effects of the sun. On top of protecting from skin cancer, sunscreen also helps keep your skin youthful and prevents skin issues such as wrinkles, sagging and hyperpigmentation.\nOur Picks\nI live in sunny (and humid) Puerto Rico, so sunscreen has been an essential part of my daily skincare routine over the years.

You can save even more using the 15% Subscribe & Save on-page coupon.\nI chose this sunscreen as the best sunscreen for everyday use because of its lightweight and sheer formula. It absorbs well into the skin and doesn't smell like sunscreen, so you can wear it to work or to go out without smelling like you just got back from a tropical vacation. The gel-like consistency also makes it easy to rub onto the skin and doesn't leave a matte or dewy finish -- it doesn't look like you have anything on at all. Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen Body contains a blend of antioxidants that helps protect the skin from free radicals. This sunscreen is water resistant (up to 40 minutes), dermatologist tested, reef friendly, vegan and contains no artificial fragrances.\nGreasy sunscreens are no longer the norm, thankfully. Now you can find many sunscreens that feel like (and blend into your skin like) a moisturizing lotion. One of them is Coola Classic Body Sunscreen. This SPF 30 is ultra-lightweight, water resistant (up to 80 minutes) and promises to hydrate and nurture your skin while protecting it from the sun. This sunscreen has a proprietary Plant Protection complex that contains antioxidant-rich ingredients like red raspberry seed oil, buriti oil, meadowfoam seed oil and prickly pear extract that help fight free radicals and nourish your skin.\nZinc sunscreens have come a long way from those pasty lotions that left a sheen of white behind. EltaMD UV Sport Sunscreen uses only zinc oxide to reflect harmful UV rays off your skin so they don't cause skin damage. What I really love about this sunscreen is that it applies clear. It's also oil-, fragrance- and paraben-free, so it's a good sun protection choice for anyone with sensitive or oily skin.\nCeraVe is already a great brand for simple, budget skincare, so this sunscreen's effectiveness is no surprise. CeraVe's hydrating mineral sunscreen is a great choice for those looking for a sunscreen that provides protection and a natural-looking tint. As someone with dark skin, I tend to avoid tinted products as they're typically too pale for me and leave a white cast. I did not have that experience with this sunscreen. It absorbed really well with no white residue.\nIn addition to sun protection, CeraVe Mineral Tinted Sunscreen also contains three essential ceramides, hyaluronic acid and niacinamide, that help restore and strengthen the skin's protective barrier. This product is great for all skin types and is free of fragrance, oil and parabens.\nOne myth is that Black people don't need sunscreen, which couldn't be further from the truth. While melanin does protect Black skin, it doesn't mean immunity from harmful rays. Black Girl Sunscreen is specially formulated to protect darker skin tones. Many sunscreens leave a sheer white cast on dark skin tones, but Black Girl Sunscreen blends seamlessly onto the skin. If you're worried about oxybenzone and octinoxate, neither are in this sunscreen; all you'll find are natural ingredients like avocado and jojoba oil, which also hydrate the skin.\nDoctors recommend limiting your baby's sun exposure by having them wear a wide-brimmed hat and sun-protective clothing and keeping them in the shade. Even with those precautions, sunscreen is still recommended, generally when they are six months and older. Once they reach the six-month milestone, you can use sunscreen to protect them from the sun's rays, but stick to formulas free of dyes and scents and use minerals (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) for sun protection.\nThis sunscreen for babies was tested on my 7-month-old nephew. His mom was pleased that it had no strong scent and also didn't cause any reaction on his sensitive skin.\nBadger Baby Mineral Sunscreen Cream is an excellent choice for parents looking to protect their babies from the sun's rays. This sunscreen is made with natural and organic ingredients and is free from harsh chemicals like oxybenzone. It's also water resistant (up to 40 minutes) and has a soft scent (from the chamomile).\nIt's currently 15% off at $15 on a 2.9 Fl Oz pack of one.\nPros\n- No white cast\n- Fragrance-free\n- Lightweight\n- Moisturizing\n- Has a tinted version\nCons\n- Takes time to blend\nDespite its name, this sunscreen isn't clear out of the pump. This mineral sunscreen rubs in without any white cast. It's designed for those with acne, rosacea and hyperpigmentation and includes niacinamide (vitamin B3), an ingredient that can soothe inflammation and reduce redness.\nThis formula is neither thick nor thin, and there's no smell. It takes a bit of rubbing to get the formula to sink in, but once rubbed in, it feels lightweight and moisturizing on the skin. If you're opposed to the white hue, EltaMD also makes tinted sunscreen.\nEltaMD products are great if you have various skin concerns such as rosacea or sensitivity.\nIf you want this, you should grab it quickly as it's currently on sale at 5% off -- with the option to save an extra 10% through Subscribe and Save.\nLooking for a sports sunscreen that doesn't feel sticky or oily? This is a good bet. This sunscreen is designed to provide protection from UV rays, even during intense physical activity. Coppertone's Sport Sunscreen is a popular lotion that's both water-resistant and moisturizing, thanks to vitamin E. It'll protect you from UVA/UVB rays for up to 80 minutes if you're in the water or sweaty. What I liked most is that once I started sweating, it didn't sting my eyes like other affordable brands do.\nIf you're looking for a sunscreen that doubles as a skincare duo, you'll love the Everyday Human's Resting Beach Face formula. It's infused with natural ingredients like green tea extract and spinach, which help strengthen your skin's natural defense systems. It also contains hyaluronic acid and Pentavitin\u00ae, a moisturizing complex that helps restore your skin's suppleness and volume. This sunscreen is lightweight and non-greasy, so it's a great option to use under your makeup. It also provides broad-spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays, which is essential for maintaining healthy, youthful-looking skin. All of Everyday Human's products are cruelty-free, vegan, oxybenzone and PABA-free, fragrance-free and Climate Neutral Certified. The packaging is also recyclable. All you have to do is unscrew the cap, cut the tube to remove any product and rinse.\nIf you're anything like me, you enjoy good branding. Everyday Humans' packaging is so aesthetic you'll want to snap a few pics next to the pool with it. Good ingredients and nice packaging? You got it with Everyday Humans.\nYou can save 5% if you buy this while it's on sale right now.\nThis sun gloss contains SPF 50 to protect your lips against the damaging effects of UV rays while helping you look fabulous. It contains hyaluronic acid, tripeptides, vitamin E and jojoba that nourish your lips. Unlike other lip sunscreens I've tested, this one doesn't leave a chalky or sticky residue on your lips. It has a glossy and smooth texture that keeps your lips moisturized, similar to the high-end glosses you would get at Sephora. Just like regular body sunscreen, you must reapply every two hours for maximum sun protection.\nThis sunscreen lotion is a great choice for parents who want a safe but effective sunscreen for their little ones. I tested this sunscreen on myself as I don't have any kids in my family, but what's important here are the product's ingredients. Earth Mama Uber Sensitive Mineral Sunscreen Lotion is made with organic shea butter and organic colloidal oatmeal, making it soothing and gentle for sensitive skin. This sunscreen is reef-friendly, cruelty-free and contains non-nano zinc -- sun protection that sits on top of the skin that scatters sun rays instead of being absorbed by the skin.\nEarth Mama's Mineral Sunscreen for Kids is water resistant (up to 40 minutes) and free from parabens and artificial fragrances.\nSonrei Cleary Zinq mineral sunscreen is the best organic sunscreen I tested on this list. It provides ample protection from UV rays and is also gentle on the skin. This Sonrei sunscreen is made with 70% organic ingredients like zinc oxide, an effective mineral sunscreen agent. It's also free of oxybenzone, fragrances, parabens and gluten. The Sonrei Clearly Zinq sunscreen is also cruelty-free, vegan, GMO-free, water resistant (up to 80 minutes) and Hawaii Reef compliant. It's lightweight and doesn't leave a greasy finish like other mineral sunscreens I tested.\nIf you're looking for a great cruelty-free sunscreen, look no further. Pacifica Sea & C Sheer Sunscreen is your best bet if you're looking for quality sunscreen without compromising your ethical beliefs. As someone who is vegan, I really like that this sunscreen is completely free of animal-derived ingredients, and Pacifica also does not test on animals, making it 100% cruelty-free. Pacifica's Sea & C Sheer Sunscreen contains vitamin C and marine extracts which decrease photodamage (skin damage from the sun) and help repair your skin. It's also water resistant (up to 80 minutes), free of octinoxate, oxybenzone and nanoparticles (small particles that may be absorbed by the skin and have been associated with adverse effects).\nI don't love sunscreens that come in a spray bottle since it's hard to apply evenly. Instead of a spray, it's more like a light mist -- it does a better job of providing coverage. I recommend not relying only on the mist but also rubbing it onto your skin with your hands after spraying.\nHow we tested the best sunscreen\nTo determine this roundup of the best sunscreens, I considered factors like SPF levels, ingredients, consistency and price. I also tested these sunscreens hands-on to better understand how these products perform in real time during different activities. Through this process, I identified the top sunscreens that offer the best sun protection and have quality ingredients.\nAll of these sunscreens were tested for a full, normal workday. My day consisted of a morning outdoor workout, working indoors (next to a window) for eight hours and an afternoon walk in the park. I reapplied each sunscreen every two hours, as recommended by experts.\nI tested over 30 products and narrowed it down to my top 14 sunscreens on the market for every skin type and lifestyle.\nRead more: What Is the Best SPF for Sunscreen?\nHow to choose a sunscreen\nWith all of the options available, choosing the best sunscreen for you can be overwhelming. Most sunscreens will offer adequate sun protection, so you just need to keep a few things in mind when buying sunscreen.\n- Choose a sunscreen with broad-spectrum protection. This means it protects against UVA and UVB rays.\n- Look for a sunscreen that offers SPF 30 or higher. Anything under that may not give you enough protection.\n- Consider your skin type and any allergies or sensitivities. If you have acne-prone skin, it's best to choose a sunscreen that's labeled non-comedogenic.\n- Take a look at your lifestyle. If you plan to spend a lot of time in the water, choose a product that's water-resistant. If you play an outdoor sport, consider one that's formulated for physical activities.\nMineral sunscreen vs. chemical sunscreen\nMineral and chemical sunscreens work in different ways to protect your skin. Mineral sunscreens use active ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium oxide that create a physical barrier on the skin that reflects and scatters UV rays. These sunscreens tend to be less irritating to the skin and might be a better option for those with sensitive skin.\nChemical sunscreens typically use active ingredients like oxybenzone and octinoxate that absorb UV rays. Chemical sunscreens generally provide a more even coverage but may not be suitable for people with skin sensitivities.\nMany people stay clear of chemical sunscreens because of these active ingredients. However, the FDA says they're safe."

      "text": "Do you feel like you haven't had enough fun this summer? If you're looking for some extra enjoyment before the summer comes to a close, now is a great time to get outside, connect with your inner child and play outdoor games with loved ones. To help, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the best outdoor games for all ages and budgets, factoring in price, portability and more. After the fun, wind down the day with a favorite film on an outdoor projector.\nOur Picks\nPickleball started to gain attention during the COVID-19 pandemic when people discovered it was a sport that could be played outdoors. Pickleball is a mix of tennis, ping-pong and badminton and is played using a tennis net, wooden paddles and a small ball. It can be played with two people (similar to tennis) or four people with two players making up one team. It's the ideal game to play if you have enough people at your get-together and the best part is it often comes in portable kits.\nThe Franklin Sports Pickleball Net comes with a travel bag that fits up to 12 balls and has a net that's 22 inches long. You can prop it up in your yard, the park, driveway, tennis court or any other space with plenty of room to serve and strike the ball. If you're looking to learn how to play pickleball or are already a pro, this is a solid set to have on hand.\nIf you're not looking for a set and would prefer to stick with just a paddle for courts nearby, check out our list of the best pickleball paddles.\nNothing screams summer quite like a good water balloon fight. The standard water balloons you grew up with aren't great for the environment since they leave remnants behind. That's where reusable water balloons come in. This eco-friendly option allows you to enjoy the same perks of a water balloon, the exception being it won't leave rubbish, and you can use it over and over again.\nThese water balloons come in a multicolored set. They are made up of high-quality silicone and seal up using very thin magnets (which makes them slightly harder than regular balloons -- these hurt more if they hit you in the face). These water balloons can be enjoyed by adults and children alike, especially during the hot summer months when you're looking for a fun and refreshing way to cool down.\nIf you like playing basketball and also enjoy a good game of beer pong, BasketPong may be up your alley. This game is a larger-than-life version of basketball and beer pong (minus the beer). It comes with six large 19-ounce buckets and two basketballs for dunking. This is a family-friendly game that's portable and can be played in the park, backyard or the beach. The buckets can be filled with water and set up in a diamond shape -- typically used during beer pong -- on each opposing side for the two teams playing.\nUnlike the drinking game, which uses Solo cups, the bigger buckets make for easier targets. You can turn this game as family or adult-friendly as you'd like, but most importantly, it's about having fun.\nPractice your aim with a fun game of ax throwing with this set. Ax throwing is a popular pastime with studios across the country, but you can also do it in the comfort of your own home. It's ideal for the whole family and can be set up outside during get-togethers in your yard or the park. The target stand is 5 feet tall and comes with eight red and blue axes so you can play with a friend. The props are made of plastic, so you don't have to worry about using discretion around young children.\nUsers highly rate this set and say it's sturdy, safe and fun enough that adults and kids alike can enjoy it. This is a good way to practice hand-eye coordination if you enjoy playing sports where good aim is required.\nIf you've ever played hacky sack, you're familiar with bean bags. This upgraded backyard game is a good way to socialize with loved ones and challenge yourself. The kit comes with 16 bean bags and a tower with seven buckets. It's portable and not too big, so you can play indoors, take it to the park, outdoor family get-togethers or even if you're tailgating before a game. Each plastic bucket represents different points ranging from 1 through 4, and can be played with two or more players.\nOnce you're done using it, you can store it in the carrying case. It's a nice alternative to corn hole if that isn't your thing, but it's more challenging since the buckets on the tower are spread out.\nIf you're a fan of corn hole, you'll want this outdoor game set. It consists of waterproof plastic corn hole boards, so you can leave them out and not worry about the rain ruining them. It folds flat and packs away easily, so you can keep it in the trunk of your car and break it out at get-togethers or when you're at the local park. It's appropriate for kids of all ages and adults to play with, so you can get in on some friendly competition with everyone in the family.\nSome reviews say the bean bags are not the most durable, so if you plan on using this set regularly, it may be a good idea to purchase extra bean bags.\nFactors to consider for the best outdoor games\nWhen you\u2019re looking for the best outdoor game for your family, friends or guests, here are a few things to keep in mind:\n- Whether you want something portable or more permanent\n- If the game is waterproof or can handle inclement weather\n- How many people can play at once\n- Whether it has age restrictions or works for all ages\nBest outdoor games FAQs\nWhat are the benefits of playing outdoor games?\nOutdoor games are a great way to socialize, get exercise, build teamwork and strategy skills -- and take a break from screens.\nHow do outdoor games improve our mental health?\nBecause you're exposed to nature when playing an outdoor game, you're reducing your chances of stress. Forest bathing -- the Japanese practice of nature therapy -- has been found to help stress levels, cardiovascular health, fatigue, depression and more."

      "text": "The habit of having a drink before bed as you unwind after a long day might seem harmless, but that's not true. A nightcap might give you a sense of relaxation and help you fall asleep quickly, but it likely won\u2019t result in the best quality sleep, and you might find yourself waking up shortly, and frequently, after. Plus, there are both short- and long-term negative effects that can come from having a daily drink.\n\"Alcohol never improves sleep,\" says Dr. John Mendelson, founder of Ria Health and a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Although alcohol helps you relax, making falling asleep easier for some, 3 to 4 hours after falling asleep, people wake up and can't get back to sleep.\"\nRead more: 22 Great Gifts for $50 or Less\nMany of us are used to having a drink before bed. But whether you have trouble staying calm at night or can't fall asleep at all, it's not a good idea to use alcohol to try and solve the problem. Drinking is only a temporary fix, and it'll bring up more issues, so it's best to identify the underlying issue. Try swapping out the nightcap for relaxing activities in your nighttime routine, like reading a book, taking a bubble bath or doing yoga before bed.\nHow does alcohol affect sleep?\nAlcohol is a central nervous system depressant, which is why it gives you that pleasant, relaxed feeling. It's why so many of us fall asleep after drinking and why it can seem like alcohol helps you sleep. How alcohol affects your sleep isn't straightforward because there are several ways that alcohol consumption impacts the quality of sleep you get.\nTo be clear, we're not just talking about binge- or heavy drinking; a drink or two that is too close to bedtime can have a significant effect on your sleep.\nHere are four ways that alcohol influences your sleep quality.\n1. Alcohol disrupts REM sleep\nIts relaxing properties make alcohol seem like a surefire way to sleep at night. The quality of restorative, restful sleep decreases. Research has shown that alcohol use interrupts your sleep cycle, particularly REM sleep. Remember, REM sleep is where dreaming happens.\n\"Evidence now suggests the deeper sleep of alcohol is also associated with an increase in frontal alpha waves, markers of wakefulness, and sleep disruption. Thus, the deep sleep of alcohol is likely not to be restorative,\" says Dan Ford, sleep psychologist and founder of the Better Sleep Clinic.\nSo while you may initially fall asleep quicker, you aren't getting the benefits of REM sleep through the night. When you don't get enough REM sleep, you won't feel rested, and you'll see that influences your performance the day after. Studies have shown that daytime alertness decreases the day following a night of heavy alcohol consumption.\n2. You wake up more often after a few drinks\nWe mentioned that alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. This means the excitatory nerve cells in your brain are suppressed, so you fall asleep. For most people, it doesn't last long. As your body metabolizes the alcohol, the excitatory nerves rebound. This process can cause you to wake up and experience trouble getting back to sleep.\nWhile this is common, it doesn't happen to everyone. To those I say, consider yourself lucky. This side effect happens to me almost every time I have a drink at night. Sure, the cocktail is fun while it lasts, but let me tell you, when I'm staring at my ceiling at three in the morning, I wish I would have skipped it altogether.\n3. Alcohol suppresses melatonin production in our bodies\nOur bodies produce melatonin to help control our sleep-wake cycle, which happens to coincide with sunlight. Our pineal gland releases melatonin as the sun goes down, and we start feeling tired. When you drink, you're essentially throwing your sleep-wake cycle off.\nAlcohol consumption decreases melatonin production, regardless of whether the sun is down. One study found that drinking alcohol an hour before you go to sleep can suppress melatonin production by 20%.\nWe know what you're thinking: I can just take a melatonin supplement and combat the side effects. Not so fast; it's not recommended to mix alcohol and melatonin. Potential side effects can include anxiety, high blood pressure, dizziness or breathing problems. On a larger scale, mixing the two can affect your liver's ability to produce certain enzymes.\n4. Alcohol can amplify the effects of sleeping disorders\nIn the case of obstructive sleep apnea, where the throat muscles and tongue are already impeding your airway, alcohol makes the condition worse. When you drink alcohol before bed and have sleep apnea, your throat muscles will be even more relaxed and collapse more often, which translates to frequent breathing interruptions that last longer than normal.\nResearch suggests alcohol consumption increases the risk of sleep apnea by 25%. It also contributes to the lowest oxygen saturation levels in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Oxygen saturation measures how much oxygen is in your blood and how effectively it's able to carry it to your brain, heart and extremities.\nAlcohol can also worsen insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, which is marked by difficulty falling asleep, waking up through the night or waking too early in the morning.\nIt's estimated that between 35% and 70% of people who drink alcohol live with insomnia. It's a little bit of a chicken and an egg situation; troubles with insomnia can be made worse by alcohol consumption. Insomnia has the potential to contribute to alcohol dependence.\nOn the surface, alcohol's sedative effects can feel like they would ease the symptoms of insomnia and help you fall asleep. Given the likelihood of REM sleep disruptions and frequent waking, it's not recommended that anyone use alcohol to treat their insomnia symptoms.\nHow to sleep better after drinking alcohol\nYou can still enjoy a drink and sleep well. Use these tips to ensure your favorite cocktail never keeps you up at night.\nPay attention to how alcohol impacts your sleep\nYou should be aware of how alcohol affects you and your sleep schedule. \"Keep a sleep log to measure duration and quality and add to that log drink quantity and times to see if you notice patterns related to sleep quality,\" Mendelson advises.\nIt can be as involved or simple as you want. You can log it in a journal or just check in with yourself in the morning. The impact alcohol has on your sleep will be specific to you. If you're making an effort to pay attention to how it affects you, you can set limitations for your body and needs.\nStop drinking at least 4 hours before you go to sleep\nYou can still enjoy a cocktail and get good sleep. There's no need to swear off alcohol entirely, but timing your drinks can be the difference between sleeping through the night and tossing and turning.\n\"If you choose to drink alcohol, drink in moderation and stop at least four hours before bedtime to avoid its negative effects on healthy sleep,\" advises Dr. Raj Dasgupta, assistant professor of clinical medicine at Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\nTo put that in perspective, four hours before you sleep is roughly dinnertime for most people. Four hours is a good benchmark because it gives your body time to metabolize the alcohol to ensure it won't impact your sleep.\nToo long, didn't read?\nWe're not here to tell you a drop of alcohol will ruin your sleep quality. There are a few nuances that you'll run into. Drinking alcohol, specifically within 4 hours before you go to bed, may help you fall asleep quicker but ultimately reduce your REM sleep and will potentially wake you up later. Timing your cocktails or swapping out your drink for a mocktail is a great way to ensure you'll sleep soundly through the night."

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2025A great alternative to DEET-- much less toxic, corrosive, and even smells better. This is so far the only thing that works on tropical mosquitoes, sand flies, and midges. Lasts for a few hours, even with heavy sweating. Pump spray is handy and you can put it in a checked bag on a plane.\n- Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2024After reading up on DEET vs picaridin, went with picaridin for my trip to mosquitoland because I don't like how DEET ruins your plastic gear. This worked fantastic and I didn't mind putting it on because the scent is mild, it wasn't greasy, and it stayed put with one application. I put it on over sunscreen and both worked. Not a single bite on areas that I sprayed, but others in my group were eaten alive.\nIt leaves a slight sheen on your skin - no big deal. Very happy with this product.\n- Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2025This works really well to keep ticks and other insects away. The downside of the spray is that the mist is very fine and very irritating if you inhale it, affecting your lungs and mouth.. Of course there is a warning, to spray your hand and wipe it on your neck or other areas near your face, yet the mist seems to hang in the air. I suggest putting it on outside in a breeze or spray a cloth wrapped near the spray nozzle. The other option is to get the wipe on Natrapel pads and use them - no mist. Other products have irritating chemicals, just not as potent it seems.\n- Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2017I love this product. Insect repellents always have a peculiar smell, but this stuff does not smell bad and is not overpowering like most other insect repellents - and MOST IMPORTANTLY it really works to keep the insects away.\nI've found the pump to be really good quality - firm voluminous sprays with no clogging like many other small spray bottle pumps I've used in the past.\nAlso, the plastic cap covering the spray nozzle is fairly thick and grabs on tight - so I have no issue putting this in a backpack or in the side-pocket of a car.\nCheaper/thinner plastic caps I've used in the past have cracked, meaning the cap no longer does it's job and I can't be as portable with whatever the spray product is. Not the case here.\nPro-tip: spray this in your car as well. I've found it creates a nice 'bug-barrier' for times when I'm in/around infested areas and don't want the insects following me in. I guess I wouldn't spray this on leather, but have found no issues spraying on my cloth seats.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2018THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! My daughter and I are mosquito magnets, she is allergic and ends up with these giant welts. Softball season is usually a nightmare. She hates aerosol sprays because they get in your mouth and basically fog you out and leave your skin wet and sticky and then you get it in your eyes. She is 6 and just hates having to do bug spray and it is a nightmare. BUT this isnt aerosol and it goes on kind of like a light dry oil. It coats the skin and has a flowery plant smell that isnt crazy off putting...but even better IT WORKS! Like NOOOOO bites...at all. I just spray down her arms and legs and then rub some on her neck and lightly mist her clothes. It last a long time and I have no complaints. I am really happy with this purchase.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2018I do not have any bad reaction to DEET, so that's not why I switched to this, but the mosquitoes in my area seemed immune to it so I figured I would give Picaridin a try. It's still not 100% effective\u2014I currently have like four or five bites\u2014but I do spend a lot of time outdoors and it's worked a LOT better than DEET (I used OFF! Deep Woods and still wound up getting swarmed. Luckily I was aware it was happening and was able to retreat indoors, but had I not I would have wound up with dozens of bites).\nTo me it smells better than OFF! but it still has a chemically scent. It doesn't feel greasy on my skin at all, and hasn't damaged any clothing I've sprayed it on. The OFF! used to make my floor slippery where I sprayed it, but this does not.\n- Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2025I frequent islands and warm climates and bought this for Costa Rica. I get very few bites with this product. I definitely realize a difference when I forget to spray it on! I will notice bites where I neglected to apply, which tells me that it repels well!\n- Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2016The wife and I used this stuff exclusively on our trip to Africa. My wife attracts bug bites like crazy, so she started out by using stronger DEET stuff and \"topping up\" every now and then with this stuff. After a while, she stopped with the DEET and switched to this stuff exclusively. I used no DEET while over there, and used only this stuff.\nI sprayed this stuff on over top of my clothes - it did not hurt any of my clothing that I could tell. Even to this day I don't see any damage. (And the DEET did destroy some of my wife's clothes.)\nWhile we were in Africa during the low time for mosquitoes, I can say that I personally did not get even one bug bite. My wife did get one (in South Africa). That speaks volumes for this product. Normally, she would be eaten alive and I would get a couple. We were diligent about applying and came through with flying colors. I would expect this would work just as well during the high mosquito months - one just might have to apply it more often is all.\nIf you are looking for something that is DEET free and works, this is what you want. It worked great for us!\nProduct summary presents key product information\nKeyboard shortcut\nshift\n+\nalt\n+\nopt\n+\nD\nProduct Summary: Natrapel Picaridin Insect Repellent 3.4 oz Pump Spray \u2013 12 Hour Bug Repellent Repels Mosquitoes, Ticks and More\nFrom Natrapel\nAbout this Item\n- 12 Hours of Protection-Stay bite free all day with Natrapel\u2019s 20 percent Picaridin formula.

      "text": "A filtered water bottle can be an essential companion whether you\u2019re hiking in the wilderness, traveling abroad or simply looking to improve your everyday hydration. These bottles use built-in filters to remove microplastics, bacteria, sediment and harmful contaminants such as lead and pesticides and turn questionable water sources into something much safer to drink. I tested each bottle at a freshwater pool in Southern California\u2019s Santa Monica Mountains, choosing a spot that looked anything but pristine. After filling the bottles, I tasted the water and poured some out to see how clean it looked. Each bottle was evaluated based on its filtration system, build quality, ease of use, ease of cleaning and the taste of the filtered water. After all the testing, these are the filtered water bottles that performed the best.\nOur Picks\nWhat is the best filtered water bottle overall?\nThe Grayl Geopress Water Purifier is the best overall filtered water bottle because our tests found that it turned natural water into fresh-tasting bottled water. The purification system is the most intense of the bottles tested. It can filter out chemicals, pesticides, particles, heavy metals, bacteria and viruses. It also takes little to no prep or waiting, so you can just fill and drink. The Grayl Geopress is great for backpacking, hiking or camping when clean water may be scarce.\nBest filtered water bottles of 2025\nPros\n- Relatively easy to clean with dishwasher-compatible parts\n- Wide enough opening and 24-ounce capacity to fit ice cubes\n- Filters out particulates, heavy meals and germs\n- Can withstand 10-foot drops on concrete\n- Has NSF/ANSI and EPA certifications\nCons\n- Expensive at around $100\n- Inner portion and outer portions can suction together if stored when wet\nWhy we like it: The natural water I tested in the bottles already looked relatively clean, but when I poured a bit from the Geopress water purification bottle, I was shocked at how crystal-clear it looked. Although I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, as Grayl's heavy-duty filtering and water purification system is designed to filter out protozoa, chemicals, particulates (like dirt and sand), heavy metals and bacteria and viruses.\nThe Geopress water purifier is made of BPA-free polypropylene, a durable type of plastic. The wide base diameter of the water purifier gives it a sturdy feel, and it's designed to withstand 10-foot drops onto concrete while it's full of water. Without a doubt, the Geopress is the best-filtered water bottle to keep you hydrated with pure water on a backpacking trip due to its intense filtering mechanism and durability.\nWho is it best for: I think this filtered water bottle would be great for anyone going on an outdoor adventure. If you're backpacking, camping, hiking or doing anything else outside where you'd need fresh, clean water, then I think this would be a great filtered water bottle for you.\nWho should not get it: If you don't need a filtered water bottle and can make do with a reusable one that you pre-fill for short adventures, then I would hold off on getting one and save money since this is a pricey investment.\nPros\n- Dishwasher-safe\n- Comes with a handle for travel\n- Affordable at less than $20\n- Sturdy\n- Has locking top\n- Larger capacity up to 36 ounces\n- NSF/ANSI certified by the WQA\nCons\n- Easy to scratch up\n- Best only for tap water\nBrita is known for its faucet and pitcher filters, but the company also makes filtered water bottles. According to Brita's website, these bottles aren't intended for outside use \u2014 they're intended for just filtered tap water \u2014 but this bottle also filtered natural freshwater for me just fine. The Brita filtering water bottle uses an activated carbon filter, which is extremely porous and pulls contaminants, such as chlorine and particulates.\nThis Brita-filtered water bottle is plastic, BPA-free and relatively sturdy. It consists of just three parts: the bottle itself, the flip-top cap and the active carbon filter, which nicely locks into place on the bottom side of the cap. It's easy to put together and requires almost no prep; just quickly wash the bottle and run the water bottle filter under hot water before your first use. I wouldn't take this filter bottle on a backpacking trip. It would suffice for day hikes if you filled it up with tap water first (use it with natural water at your own risk).\nWho is it best for: This filtered water bottle is best for those who only plan to use it with tap water for short adventures, such as day hikes or an outdoor workout.\nWho should not get it: I would not suggest this filtered water bottle to anyone who wants to use it with natural water on longer trips.\nPros\n- BPA-free\n- Stays cold for about 24 hours\n- Filter replacements are affordable at around $5 for each one\n- Medium capacity of 20 to 32 ounces\n- NSF/ANSI certified by the WQA\nCons\n- The body is not dishwasher-safe\n- Holds slightly less than plastic Brita bottle\nIf you want your tap water to stay cold during the day, then you need a water bottle made of heavier, durable material, preferably steel. Luckily, Brita's Premium Filtering Water Bottle also comes in stainless steel. For about $12 more, this water bottle has all the great features of a plastic water bottle and also keeps your water cold for about 24 hours. While I did notice that the ice in my water bottle may melt, the water did stay cold.\nThis bottle is also BPA-safe, double-insulated and very sturdy. It looks just like the plastic Brita bottle but a bit heavier. Both are also the same circumference and should fit into most car cup holders. Do note that while the straw and lid are dishwasher safe, the body needs to be hand-washed.\nWho is it best for: This filtered water bottle is best for those who plan to use it with tap water -- not natural water. I would recommend it to those who are going to use it for cold drinks while traveling in the car, since it can fit into most car cup holders.\nWho should not get it: I would not recommend this filtered water bottle for anyone who needs one for natural water. Also, if you'd like your entire bottle to be dishwasher-safe, this is not the one for you.\nBest filtered water bottles compared\n| Product | Price | Material | Capacity | Filter replacements | Dishwasher safe? | Certifications |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Grayl Geopress Water Purifier | $$$ | Polypropylene | 24 ounces | $30 for one filter | Outer refill, inner press, cap | NSF/ANSI, EPA |\n| Brita Premium Filtering Water Bottle | $ | Plastic | 26 to 36 ounces | 3 for $15 | Yes | NSF/ANSI, WQA |\n| Brita Stainless Steel Premium Filtering Water Bottle | $ | Stainless steel | 20 to 32 ounces | 3 for $15 | Top only | NSF/ANSI, WQA |\nOther filtered water bottles tested\nLifestraw Go: Despite being one of the most popular water-filtering products on the market, the Lifestraw Go did not meet my expectations for filtering. The double-stage filtration includes a hollow-fiber membrane and a carbon capsule, yet this is the only bottle that produces water with particles after passing through the Lifestraw filter. That's not to say the Lifestraw Go isn't safe to drink from. The particles were probably just sediment, but it did produce a relatively strong mineral taste compared to the other bottles on this list.\nThe Lifestraw Go is made of BPA-free plastic throughout and has three simple parts (bottle, cap and filter; four parts if you count the carbon capsule inside the filter). Overall, the Lifestraw Go feels pretty sturdy. I prefer the durability of stainless steel, but it's lightweight and comes with a carabiner, so it would make a good backpacking water bottle. Any time you use the bottle, let the water sit for a few moments to prime the hollow-fiber membrane filter.\nWaterwell Ultrafiltration Travel Water Bottle: Waterwell claims its double-stage filtration system removes 99.9% of waterborne pathogens, but based on the taste of the water that came from this bottle, I wouldn't be so sure. I didn't feel or see any particles like I did with the Lifestraw Go, but the taste alone was enough to make me wary of bringing this bottle into the backcountry for clean water.\nThe bottle and cap are made from BPA-free plastic and feel just as sturdy as a plastic bottle should. The filter is attached to the straw by a flimsy rubber tube, which could be the culprit behind the poor filtering. The water tasted sour, but I couldn't quite place the taste (sulfur, maybe). Despite its poor filter attachment and sour taste, the Waterwell is easy to use, with the same setup as most of the other bottles on the list: bottle, cap and filter. The water bottle filter detaches easily and the bottle opening is large enough to insert a standard dish scrubber.\nHow we test filtered water bottles\nFor the sake of safe drinkable water, two friends and I ventured out to a freshwater source in Southern California. We were lucky to find a tiny trickle of a waterfall in the Rancho Sierra Vista/Satwiwa Wilderness area in the Santa Monica Mountains, which culminated in a series of four tiny pools of water. Of the four water holes, we settled on testing the bottles in the one that looked the least stagnant (and had the fewest bugs and tadpoles).\nThe day before the hike, I cleaned and prepped each water filtration bottle on my list according to its instructions. I filled each bottle from the same water source and tasted the water from each bottle on site. I then drank from the bottles one by one and poured some water from each to see how clean it looked. I was ready to drink gallons of water and keep drinking until I determined the best reusable water bottle.\nFactors to consider when choosing a filtered water bottle\nI considered six important criteria when using each reusable water bottle: filtering and filter capacity, materials, taste, ease of use and cleanup. These are all factors you should consider when looking for a water purifier bottle. You'll want to purchase one that suits the activity you plan to use it for. For instance, if I was looking for a filtered bottle to take backpacking, I wouldn't choose the Brita. I also wouldn't invest in the Grayl Geopress if I only needed a bottle for tap water.\nFiltering\nLook for a filtering mechanism that filters out harmful contaminants, bacteria and viruses and other unpleasantries out of the presumably non-potable water. Does the filter leave any particles in the water after filtering? Also, consider how much replacement filters cost and how easy it is to replace them.\nMaterials\nMost filtered water bottles are made of plastic or stainless steel. If the bottle you are considering is made of plastic, make sure it is BPA-free. Also, make sure it is durable. Would a few drops dent the water bottle? If you are a hiker and need a lightweight bottle, is the material too heavy?\nTaste\nIt's pretty obvious, but you want a filtered water bottle that leaves you with fresh-tasting water. You don't want any remnants of mineral odor or chemical tastes such as a chlorine taste.\nEase of use\nPutting the bottle together should be easy. Inserting and replacing the filter should be simple. Also, consider how the water flows from the straw to your mouth. Do you have to tilt it a certain way to get the water out?\nCleanup\nYou want a filtered water bottle that is easy to clean. Check to see if the bottle is dishwasher-safe. After use, what are you supposed to do with the bottle? Can you easily store it?\nNSF/ANSI certification\nRefers to products that have been tested by the National Science Foundation and American National Standards Institute to ensure safety, reliability and quality."

      "text": "Apple is reportedly partnering with SpaceX and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite support into iPhone software, according to Bloomberg.\nThe partnership would offer some T-Mobile customers an alternative to Apple's existing satellite communication service, Globalstar, which allows you to send emergency messages and contact responders via its Emergency SOS feature when off the grid.\nStarlink, the world's largest low Earth orbit satellite constellation, provides broadband internet capable of supporting streaming, video calls and more, without the need for cellular service. Starlink was previously only an option for select Samsung phones.\nThe report states the latest iOS 18.3 update, released on Monday, includes support for the service. While the update introduced AI features and bug fixes, it did not mention Starlink compatibility.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but SpaceX CEO Elon Musk seemingly confirmed the partnership on X, writing: \"Medium-resolution images, music, and audio podcasts should work with the current generation Starlink direct-to-phone constellation. The next-generation constellation will support medium-resolution video.\"\nThe move signals a big step toward broader satellite-based connectivity to help provide more reliable emergency communication when in a cellular dead zone. It comes as players like SpaceX, Amazon's Project Kuiper and other providers compete for dominance in the field.\nFor now, Bloomberg said the service is only available in the US, whereas Globalstar operates in multiple countries.\nWith Starlink, iPhone users will no longer need to point their devices toward the sky to establish a connection. Instead, the service is expected to work even when the phone is in a pocket, according to the report.\nApple first introduced satellite connectivity in 2022, and at the time, Musk hinted at a potential collaboration, tweeting that SpaceX had \"some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\"\nAccording to Bloomberg, T-Mobile said in a message to beta testers: \"You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere.\""

      "text": "Hot weather is here, and this week's heat wave has been stifling. It's important to stay safe when having fun in the sun this summer. So, if you plan to spend time outside, be sure you're prepared with the essentials to keep cool.\nHere are 10 items you can use to survive this year's heat waves and summer highs.\n1. Cooling towels\nA handheld towel is excellent for drying off after exercising, playing sports or doing hard work under the sun. A cooling towel is a step above. Just get these towels wet with cold water and wring out the extra water. Then, wrap the cooling towel around your neck or dab your face; it should stay cool for up to 2 hours. When it starts to warm up again, just add more water and repeat the process.\nThese towels are great for a hot, summertime walk, relaxing at the beach or a long hike up the mountains.\nThese reusable, two-pack microfiber towels come in two different colors. They also offer UPF 50 sun protection.\n2. Electrolyte powder\nWhen you spend lots of time in the heat, your body actively loses water and electrolytes -- minerals found in the body that have a charge -- through sweat. It's important to replace that lost water and electrolytes with fluids. If you struggle to drink eight cups of water a day in the summer (and sometimes you need more if you're extremely active in the heat), an electrolyte drink can help replenish your body.\nThe best electrolyte powders usually contain sodium, calcium, potassium, phosphate, chloride or magnesium. Electrolytes such as these can balance your body's water and pH levels, move nutrients throughout your cells, carry out waste from your cells, and ensure all muscles, bodily functions and nerves are working correctly.\nLiquid I.V. powder provides two times faster hydration than water alone. It includes five vitamins and and many electrolytes.\nOne bag of Liquid I.V. includes 16 on-the-go packets. Add one packet to 16 ounces of water and stir.\n3. Reusable water bottle\nRule No. 1 for surviving the heat: drink lots of water. Whether this is water or an electrolyte drink, hydration in the summer is key. You don't want to become dehydrated. Dehydration symptoms include tired, dark yellow urine, sunken eyes, headache and lightheadedness.\nI find that I drink the most water when I carry a water bottle around with me. I also drink more water when it stays ice cold throughout the day. An insulated stainless steel water bottle will do just that.\nChoose between an 18-, 21- or 24-ounce Hydro Flask. Made with Pro-Made stainless steel, this water bottle is non-free, BPA-free and keeps water cold for up to 24 hours.\n4. Portable fan\nA portable fan is handy when you miss the indoors or are dealing with broken AC. Cool down while walking, traveling or doing anything in the sun. It can even be useful for summer camping or hanging at the beach.\nLook for a portable fan that is easily rechargeable. Some fans can even mist your face.\nThis chargeable, handheld fan is also a flashlight and a portable charger. Speed one can last up to 21 hours between charging and speed two can last up to 14 hours.\n5. Sunscreen\nIf you want to beat the heat, you first need to make sure your skin is protected. Wearing sunscreen should always be a priority if you're doing anything outside this summer. In addition to wearing sunglasses, a hat or UV protective clothing, sunscreen provides a shield to your delicate skin. Sunscreen provides protection from sun cancer, signs of sun damage and premature aging.\nYou can try chemical, mineral or combo sunscreen. If you want a sunscreen that won't leave a white cast, look for a product with a light serum. If you have acne-prone skin, use a sensitive mineral or combo sunscreen.\nNeutrogena Mineral UltraSheer Dry-Touch is lightweight, clean and contains SPF 30. It is water-resistant for up to 80 minutes.\n6. Countertop ice machine\nThere is nothing better than an ice-cold drink on a hot day. A countertop ice machine can bring the ice directly to you. You can add ice to your water or store beverages and take them with you; a countertop ice machine can be transported from one place to another. Take it camping orbring it to an outdoor party. You can have cold ice handy as long as you have access to an outlet.\nThis Igloo ice maker can make ice in two different sizes. Just add water, select your ice size and ice will be ready in 7 minutes. There are multiple self-cleaning settings.\n7. Cooling pillow\nWhen sleeping cool, using a fan, AC or light pajamas might be your go-to solution. However, changing your bedding is another easy fix. A cooling pillow is designed not to retain any body heat and to provide as much breathability as possible. Some cooling pillows even have a cool-to-the-touch cover.\nPillows made of materials such as non-perforated and non-gel memory foam trap heat and will only make you hotter at night. Look for cooling pillows made of latex, foam, silk, cotton or bamboo. Note that the pillowcase you use may affect the cooling sensation of any pillow. I recommend looking for a silk, satin or light cotton pillowcase to accompany your cooling pillow.\nThe Coop Original pillow is made with shredded memory foam fill that is breathable and adjustable, making this pillow great for stomach, side, back or combination sleepers.\n8. Neck fan\nWhy hold a fan in front of your face when one can sit on your neck? If you're working outside or have your hands full, a neck fan is practical. Shaped like headphones, neck fans wrap around the neck and both sides blow up toward the sides of your face and back of your neck. It's perfect for sitting inside without AC or working under the sun.\nThe ASNUG Neck Fan is blade-less, meaning that it won't snag hair, fingers or clothing. It has three settings and is rechargable via USB.\n9. Cooling sheets\nSimilar to cooling pillows, cooling sheets can help dissipate your body heat. Cooling sheets are never made with materials like flannel or heavy cotton that trap heat. The best sheets for the summer will be made with bamboo, cotton, silk, Tencel, linen, polyester, microfiber or lyocell.\nFor optimal summer bedding, switch to cooling sheets, a cooling comforter, a cooling pillowcase and a cooling pillow.\nThese temperture-balancing, lyocell sheets come in Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King and Split King sizes. Each set includes one flat sheet, one fitted sheet and two pillowcases.\n10. Cold facial mask\nA fun way to cool down is to use a cold facial mask. While I don't recommend wearing this outside, a cold compress can help calm hot, sweaty skin and bring down your internal temperature after being outside in the sun. Similar to cold rollers or certain eye creams, a cold face mask can even help depuff eyes. And if you are prone to migraines, a cold facial mask can aid a pounding headache.\nThe reversible facial mask is filled with gel beads. It is both freezer- and microwave-safe. Freeze for two to six hours before use."

      "text": "Whether I'm out with family and friends or taking a solo journey, one of my favorite things to do is camping. I bet you're also thinking about camping a lot more, now that Memorial Day is approaching and -- although the nights are still cool -- it's about to be perfect camping weather.\nWhat my campsite looks like has changed over the years. From primitive camping in my younger days to pulling a self-built camper trailer now, the ethos remains to relax and enjoy the outdoors. I've been fortunate to test out a lot of great gear over the years. Some tools have become a staple in my setup, while others haven't.\nHere are the five pieces of camping gear that have made it into my 2025 loadout, some important for survival and others for added convenience. When your camping days are coming up, keep my favorites in mind.\n1. A power source\nFor my non-primitive camping, a power source, or more appropriately power sources, are vital. If I were only tent camping, I\u2019d probably only bring a battery pack for my phone, like the Anker PowerCore III 10K or the BioLite Solar Panel 10+, since it is a solar panel with a 3,200m-Ah battery charger built-in.\nBut for longer camps or ones where I\u2019m not \u201croughing\u201d it, I like to bring along a portable power station. I really like the Anker Solix C800 Plus for its compact size, good power options and the two camping lights that are stored in the lid. If I think I\u2019ll need even more power than the 1,200 watts available in the C800 Plus, then I\u2019ll take my Bluetti AC240P for the 3,600 watts of output. Plus, it is IP65 dust- and water-resistant.\nI haul batteries to use around the campsite and also to power my camper. My current setup uses the EcoFlow PowerKit with 15kWh power. Aside from the massive amount of available power, this system's overall capabilities are truly impressive. Everything in the system runs through a central hub that connects to a smart breaker panel, along with the available AC and DC circuits in the Smart Panel.\nI have about 900 watts of solar panels on top of my camper to keep my system charged, but it can handle up to 4,800 watts from the sun, 1,000 watts from your vehicle's alternator and 3,000 watts of shore power. With this system, I can run my air conditioner, refrigerator, lights, TV, microwave, coffee pot or whatever else I may need.\n2. A place to relax\nAfter I get to the campsite and set up the necessities, it\u2019s time to relax. When it comes to sitting around the campfire or sitting at all, I pull up my GCI Freestyle Rocker Chair. While the chair is quite a bit more expensive at $70 than your typical bag chair, it will last much longer. Aside from being durable, it is very comfortable, and the rocking feature is excellent for relaxation.\nWhen I really want to relax or sleep under the stars, I\u2019ll quickly set up the Anymaka Portable Hammock. When I say quickly, I mean I can go from storage bag to sleeping in under three minutes. It has a very sturdy stand and supports up to 550 pounds. Accessories include a cup holder, a canopy for shade and a mosquito net for those stargazing evenings.\n3. A prep station\nIf you are lucky enough to find a camping spot with a picnic table, you\u2019re good to go for a spot to prep meals and put your stuff on. But if you\u2019re like me and prefer to camp where it\u2019s a bit farther from civilization, you\u2019ll likely not have a table to use. This is why a table is a must-have in my camping gear loadout.\nMy table of choice is from the same company that makes my preferred chair -- the GCI Slim Fold Table. While there are many options for camping tables, I love this one because it is lightweight at only 26 pounds and sturdy, with the ability to support up to 125 pounds. The table folds up nice and flat to a relatively compact 3.5 by 24.2 by 27.2 inches, so it doesn\u2019t take up much space, and the slatted design makes for easy cleanup.\n4. Ambiance and cooking source\nIf there is one thing that is truly iconic of camping, it\u2019s fire. It\u2019s important to use something to contain your fire when camping to avoid embers accidentally igniting nature. While there are some great fire pits made for camping, such as the Solo Stove Mesa, they are more for warmth and ambiance and less for cooking.\nFor a more compact option, you could go with a handy portable grill like the Burch Barrel Flat Packer.\nHowever, I\u2019ve been going with something that lets me have a place to cook and get ambiance: the BioLite FirePit Plus. What has made this become my go-to camping stove is the versatility in what it can do and the fuel. It can be used with either charcoal or firewood. There is a sliding grill grate for cooking on, and the mesh sides allow for excellent airflow for the fire. But if the mesh sides aren\u2019t enough, then the battery pack on the end can power a fan to force air through tubes with holes to help fuel the fire.\n5. Something to light the way\nWhen you are out in nature, it can get pretty dark out at night even with a full moon. This is why it\u2019s important to have good light sources available. While I have light sources available in the Anker Solix C800 Plus, I always remember to keep some alternatives accessible.\nThere are some great flashlights options out there, and it\u2019s important to find one that serves your specific needs. I really like the Olight Baton3 Pro for the variety of light options, the 1,500 lumens of brightness, durability and the magnetic end. That end is great for attaching to objects to hold it in place, but when there\u2019s nothing magnetic around the extra-long clip is great to have.\nI also try to have some sort of area light in my loadout. Lately, I\u2019ve been taking the BioLite Alpenglow Lantern for this purpose. While it does have RGB lights and offers some fun effects, I like the long battery life with 200 hours of runtime on low and the dimmable and tunable white light. It\u2019s great to have sitting on the table when eating or just providing some ambient light around the campsite. It also has a hook on the end to hang it up with.\nMany of CNET\u2019s top-rated pieces of hiking gear are just as applicable to camping, so be sure to check out this list of the top hiking gadgets for 2025, as well as the top security gadgets for living that van life and the best camping essentials no matter where your travels take you this spring and summer."

      "text": "Starting with the iPhone 15, Apple moved from Lightning to USB-C charging, so some people still have iPhones with a Lightning connector while others have iPhones equipped with USB-C. I've included a lot of different types of batteries and power banks on this list, including several that offer wireless charging, which continues to evolve. The latest iPhones have not only MagSafe wireless charging but Qi2 wireless charging. Pricier MagSafe-certified and Qi2-certified wireless chargers provide 15-watt fast-charging that's twice the speed of standard magnetic wireless chargers. The iPhone 16 series supports 25W MagSafe charging, but no power banks on the market today do.\nOur Picks\nRead more: Best iPhone Chargers\nWhat's the best overall iPhone power bank?\nThere are a lot of great power banks on this list. The one I currently have at the top is the Baseus Picogo Power Bank 5K because it's a quite slim MagSafe-enabled battery that sticks onto the back of your phone and wirelessly charges your MagSafe-enabled iPhone. Its only drawback is that it's not equipped with Qi2, which means it will only wirelessly charge your phone at 7.5-watt speeds (if you plug in a cable to the battery, it will fast charge your phone at 20 watts). The new Anker Nano Power Bank 5K Magnetic Charger costs more but is good for those looking for faster 15-watt wireless charging in a slim power bank.\nWhat We Updated: August 2025\nWe added the Baseus Picogo Power Bank 5K, Anker Nano Power Bank 5K Magnetic Charger, Baseus Picogo Qi2 Magsafe 10K Portable Charger, Sharge IceMag 2, Mophie Power Station Mini (Gen 3) and Belkin Portable Charger 10K with integrated Lightning & USB-C cables. We also moved several older models to the other power banks we tested section and added additional details and specs to each product on the list.\nBest power banks for iPhone for 2025\nPros\n- Lightweight slim design\n- Strong magnet (adheres well to MagSafe-enabled iPhone cases\n- 20W wired charging via USB-C port and cable\nCons\n- Not equipped with Qi2, so only charges at 7.5W wirelessly (not 15W)\nBaseus makes a couple of very slim magnetic power banks that offer wireless charging. This model -- the Picogo Power Bank 5K -- is more affordable because it only offers 7.5-watt wireless charging for iPhones and isn't equipped with Qi2, which offers 15-watt wireless charging. The newer Picogo Power Bank 5K with Integrated Stand is equipped with Qi2 and a kickstand but costs about twice as much. Both models offer 20-watt wired charging using the USB-C port.\nNote that Qi2 power banks tend to heat up more during wireless charging, but this power bank only got slightly warm while wireless charging; the temperature change wasn't big.\nPros\n- Lightweight, slim design\n- Equipped with Qi2, which enables fast 15W wireless charging\n- Strong maget adheres well to MagSafe-enabled cases\nCons\n- A little pricey\n- No integrated kickstand\nMagnetic wireless power banks continue to slim down and Anker's new-for-2025 Power Bank 5K Magnetic Charger is its slimmest Qi2 5K power bank to date at 0.34-inches thick. With Qi2 on board, it features 15-watt wireless charging speeds for iPhone and Android smartphones and 20-watt wired charging via the USB-C port. It does heat up during wireless charging, but I've tested previous Anker Qi2 power banks that got warmer (Anker says this power bank \"stays below 104\u2109, 14 degrees cooler than the industry standard.\") It's available in three color options.\nPros\n- Fairly compact for 10,000-mAh battery\n- Retractable USB-C cable with smooth mechanics\n- Up to 45W charging\n- Integrated display shows battery life, charging speed and power bank health\nCons\n- Small footprint, but somewhat chunky\nAnker's Nano Power Bank now comes in a few different versions, including this new-for-2025 10,000-mAh model that has a retractable USB-C cable and both a USB-C and a USB-A port for maximum charging flexibility (it offers up to 45 watts of charging from that USB-C port, which means you should have no problem charging a laptop with it, though not to full capacity). I also liked that it has a built-in display that shows how much battery is left and how fast you're charging from each port. There's also pass-through charging technology, so you can charge the battery while also charging a device, and the battery itself can be charged relatively quickly as it supports up to 30-watt fast-charging with a supported power adapter (not included). While the power bank's overall footprint is fairly compact, the power bank is fairly thick and weighs 8.3 ounces or 232 grams, so it's a little chunky.\nPros\n- Among the slimmest and lightest designs for a 10,000mAh battery at .5 inches thick\n- Qi2 fast wireless charging (15W)\n- Doesn't get too warm while wireless charging a device\n- 27W wired charging\n- Slightly more affordable compared to some competing models\nCons\n- Is thicker and heavier than 5K batteries\nA lot of high-capacity 10,000-mAh power banks that fully charge an iPhone twice tend to be a little bulky. But the Baseus Picogo Qi2 Magsafe 10K Portable Charger is one of the slimmest 10,000-mAh power banks you'll find, and it's also Qi2-certified, which means it offers fast 15-watt wireless charging speeds. Like most Qi2-equipped batteries, this model heats up a bit, but it doesn't get as warm as some older Qi2 batteries I've tested. I also thought its magnet was strong (it adhered well to the back of my MagSafe-enabled case on both an iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Mac). And lastly, it offers 27-watt wired charging from its USB-C port.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Fairly compact for 10,000-mAh battery\n- 30W charging\n- LED with battery life indicator\nCons\n- A little bulky\nThe Anker Zolo portable power bank is not only affordable but also pretty compact (4.32 by 2.58 by 0.98 inches, 0.48 pounds) for a 10,000-mAh power bank with fast-charging capabilities. It can charge an iPhone 16 almost two times and outputs 30 watts of power, which means it can charge your iPhone at the fastest rate and also provide your MacBook Air with some juice in a pinch. The USB-C cable tucks into a port on the battery, turning the cable into a lanyard when you don't have it plugged into a device (yes, it charges Android smartphones just fine). Note that for about $10 more, you can get the Zolo portable charger with dual USB-C/Lightning cables if you still have a Lightning-equipped iPhone. And the power bank also comes in a 20,000-mAh version for the same price as the 10,000-mAh version, but it's quite a bit larger.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Dual Lighting/USB-C cable built-in\n- Fairly compact for 10,000-mAh battery\n- LED battery life indicator\nCons\n- A little bulky\nThe Anker Zolo Portable Power Bank comes in a version with a single USB-C cable built-in and a dual-cable USB-C/Lighting version. This one is almost double the price of the single cable model, which isn't surprising given that power banks with Lightning cables typically are pricier (when it first launched, it was cheaper but has now gone up in price).\nLike the single cable version, this dual-cable model is not only quite affordable but also pretty compact (7.65 ounces) for a 10,000-mAh power bank with fast-charging capabilities. It can charge an iPhone 16 almost two times and outputs 30W of power via the USB-C cable, which means it can charge your iPhone at the fastest rate and also provide your MacBook Air with some juice in a pinch.\nPros\n- Slim design\n- Magnetic flap converts into kickstand\n- Strong magnet\n- Multiple color options\nCons\n- No fast wireless charging (only 7.5 watts)\nWhat's cool about Anker's 622 magnetic battery is that it's a wireless battery that has an integrated magnetic flap that converts into a stand. You won't get fast wireless charging from this 5,000-mAh battery (it charges at up to 7.5 watts) but it's slim and easy to carry around.\nIt charges via USB-C and if you use a USB-C to Lightning to charge your iPhone, it will charge at a faster rate of 12 watts. That's not as fast as what a 20-watt USB-C power adapter can deliver, but it's faster than 7.5 watts.\nNote that Anker has updated this model to move the charging port to the side (from the bottom), so you can charge it while using it as a stand. Do not buy the old version that confusingly retains the same 622 model number.\nPros\n- Fairly slim high-capacity 10K battery\n- Integrated dual USB/Lighting cables with fast charging\n- Pass-through charging (18W output)\nCons\n- Somewhat generic design\nIf you're still using Apple devices with Lightning connectors but also want a power bank that can charge USB-C equipped devices, this Belkin 10K power bank is a good option with its dual UBC-C/Lightning cable design. It's a 10,000-mAh battery, so it can charge an iPhone 16 almost twice, and it delivers 23 watts of power from its USB-C port, so it can also provide some juice to a MacBook Air in a pinch.\nPros\n- Eye-catching design with transparent accent\n- Integrated kickstand\n- Equipped with Qi2 for fast 15W wireless charging\n- Doesn't get as arm as some Qi2 batteries\n- 30W input/out from USB-C port\nCons\n- Slightly bulky and pricier than some 10,000 mAh power banks\nSharge's trademark is translucency, and the IceMag 2 has a partially see-through design along with an integrated kickstand that I liked. The IceMag 2 costs more than some high-capacity 10,000-mAh power banks, but it is equipped with Qi2 and offers fast wireless charging at up to 15 watts. Additionally, it has a built-in fan to cool off the battery when it's charging a device, as well as an aluminum plate to help dissipate heat. As a result, this battery does get as warm as some Qi2 batteries. It's also worth noting that it delivers 30 watts of power through its USB-C port, so it can charge a MacBook Air. That port also allows you to fast charge the power bank at up to 30 watts if you have a 30-watt (or greater) power adapter.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Wireless charging\n- Integrated USB-C cable for fast wired charging\n- Integrated kickstand\nCons\n- A bit bulky\n- Wireless charging is only 7.5W\nAnker has a few different Zolo power banks. A couple are just wired chargers with built-in cables but it also has some magnetic Zolo power banks with 7.5 wireless charging, including this model with a built-in kickstand that also features a integrated USB-C cable that delivers 30W of charging power. This is a 10,000-mAh battery and is a bit hefty, measuring 4.15 \u00d7 2.72 \u00d7 .81 inches and weighing 8.46 ounces or 240 grams, but not that bulky for a 10,000-mAh battery that gives an iPhone almost two full charges. It's available in four color options.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- 45W total power output\n- Has dual USB-C/USB-A charge out ports along with built-in USB-C cable\n- LED battery life indicator\nCons\n- Slightly bulky\nThe Baseus Picogo is a relatively compact 10,000-mAh battery that delivers up to 45 watts of total power and has a built-in USB-C cable along with USB-C and USB-A charge out ports. While it's still a little bulky, it's a versatile charger that can almost charge an iPhone 16 twice and can provide some juice for your MacBook Air. It also has a built-in LED battery life indicator and is a good value overall.\nPros\n- Compact design -- not much bigger than a lipstick case\n- Fast 20W wired charging (cable included)\nCons\n- Slightly pricey\nIf you're looking for a compact external battery pack for your iPhone (or any smartphone), Mophie's pocketable Power Station Mini (Gen 3) features a 5,000-mAh internal battery and 20-watt USB-C PD fast charging. (You'll need a USB-C to Lightning cable to take advantage of that fast charging if you're an iPhone owner.) That battery will allow you to fully charge your iPhone -- or at least close to it, depending on the model you have. For just a couple of bucks more, you can pick up the 10,000-mAh version with dual USB-C ports, but that model is bulkier and weighs more.\nPros\n- Compact and lightweight\n- Integrated USB-C connector\n- Fast charging\n- USB-C out port allows for charging second device\nCons\n- May not fully charge your iPhone\nIf you're looking for a new power bank for your new USB-C equipped iPhone, Anker's Nano Power Bank with an integrated foldable USB-C connector is an appealing choice -- and it also charges Android devices (or anything with a USB-C charging port).\nThis 5,000-mAh power bank weighs 3.5 ounces, or 100 grams. It features 22.5 watts of fast charging power and can charge two devices at the same time if you plug a cable into the power bank's USB-C in/out charging port. (Charging two devices simultaneously divides the charging power in half, delivering 11.25 watts to each device.)\nThe Anker Nano Power Bank is available in multiple color options and also comes in a version with a Lightning connector for older iPhones that delivers 12.5 watts of charging power.\nPros\n- High-capacity power bank\n- Qi2 certified\n- 15W wireless charging output\n- Integrated kickstand and LCD battery-life indicator\nCons\n- Pricey\n- A bit bulky\nThe Anker MagGo power bank 10K has a 10,000-mAh battery that can fully charge most iPhones around 1.75 times. It's Qi2-certified, which means it offers 15-watt fast charging capabilities and is fully MagSafe compatible, offering twice the speed of standard 7.5-watt wireless chargers for MagSafe-enabled iPhone 13, 14 and 15 models and Android smartphones that support 15-watt wireless charging.\nAvailable in five color options and not much bigger than the MagGo Power Bank 6.6K, this model has a retractable kickstand and an LCD that displays the remaining battery life. It comes with a USB-C cable, but you'll need a USB-C charger with more than 15-watt output to hit those 15-watt charging speeds. You can take the power bank on the go or leave it plugged in to use as a wireless charging stand when at home. Like the 6.6K version, it's fairly pricey at launch but will hopefully get some discounts as more competitors hit the market. For those looking for a higher-capacity battery, the MagGo power bank 10K is probably a better choice than the MagGo power bank 6.6K. But I do like the foldable stand a little better on the power bank 6.6K.\nPros\n- Integrated charging prongs so you can plug into any wall outlet\n- Built-in 10,000mAh battery\n- Two fast-charging USB-C port and one USB-A port to charge three devices at once\n- Charges a single device up to 65W\nCons\n- No wireless charging\n- Fairly bulky\nThanks to Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology, chargers have been getting more powerful while shrinking at the same time. The latest example of that trend is Anker's new line of GaNPrime chargers with next-generation GaN 3 technology that the company says is even more energy-efficient. The Anker power bank 733, which combines a 65-watt charger with a 10K-mAh portable battery, is part of the new GaNPrime line. It's pretty compact for what it is and offers two fast-charging USB-C ports and one fast-charging USB-A port. You can charge up to three devices at once, but note that to get a full 65-watt charge for a laptop, you'll have to plug in just the laptop.\nPros\n- Fairly slim for 10,000-mAh battery\n- Qi2 certified\n- Up to 15W wireless charging output\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\n- A bit bulky\nYou can get Anker's 621 magnetic power bank for less than half the price of this model (it's a 5,000-mAh power bank). But it only charges your iPhone at 7.5 watts when charging wirelessly, while this model charges at 15 watts since it's a Qi2 charger. The Anker MagGo power bank also has double the battery capacity (10,000-mAh), which means it can charge an iPhone 16 almost twice. But it is quite a bit more expensive and heats up a little when charging. That said, it's relatively compact for a 10,000-mAh power bank weighing 7.05 ounces or 200 grams and measuring .58-inches thick. It also offers even faster 30-watt wired charging from its USB-C port, which means it can also provide some juice for a MacBook Air in a pinch.\nFactors to consider when choosing iPhone power banks\nLightning vs. USB-C\nEvery iPhone from the iPhone 5 in 2012 to the iPhone 14 series in 2022 used Apple's proprietary Lightning connector for charging. With the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 series, Apple has made the jump to USB-C. The differences between these two connectors matter only if you're seeking out a power bank with an integrated cord. Otherwise, you'll want a model with USB-C or USB-A output that can be used to charge your iPhone (or nearly any small electronic device) with the cable that came in the box.\nWireless charging: MagSafe vs. Qi\nMost iPhones since the iPhone 8 and iPhone X models introduced in 2017 offer inductive wireless charging. Apple's standard for these phones is called MagSafe, and power banks that are fully MagSafe compatible -- like Apple's own MagSafe Battery Pack -- will charge iPhones at a fast 15-watt level when the power bank magnetically adheres to the rear of the iPhone. Many other more affordable models will still attach to iPhones magnetically, but charge them at half speed (7.5 watts). In all cases, you'll need to make sure the iPhone has a MagSafe-compatible case. The iPhone 16 series supports 25W MagSafe charging with Apple's MagSafe wireless charging puck. But no power banks on the market today do.\nWireless charging: MagSafe vs. Qi2\nThe iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 series iPhones are compatible with the new Qi2 standard, which allows for faster wireless charging -- up to 15 watts. But Qi2 portable wireless chargers that are capable of charging at 15-watt speeds tend to cost quite a bit more than wireless batteries that charge at 7.5-watt speeds. They also tend to heat up more than 7.5-watt magnetic wireless chargers. Again, the iPhone 16 series supports 25W MagSafe charging with Apple's MagSafe wireless charging puck. But no power banks on the market today do.\nPower capacity vs. weight\nMost baseline power banks now start at a 5,000-mAh capacity, which should give you close to one full charge for an iPhone (Pro Max models have bigger batteries). Chargers with 10,000 mAh or more are available, but they're larger and weigh more. That's of particular note if you plan on traveling with the charger in a purse, backpack or pocket.\nA few more things to keep in mind when shopping for an external battery pack or power bank:\n- A higher power output rating (mAh, short for milliamp hours) means more charges -- but also a heavier portable charger weight.\n- For the latest iPhones (everything after the iPhone 7) you should buy a battery with at least a 5,000-mAh capacity, which should give you at least one full charge for a device. All of the models featured above hit that mark.\n- These best portable chargers for iPhone all use lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, and should thus always be stored in carry-on luggage when flying. Airlines and regulatory agencies are increasingly banning li-ion batteries in checked baggage.\n- If you want maximum power output, opt for chargers with USB-C PD (power delivery) models, which should charge nearly every device smaller than a laptop, such as a tablet or Nintendo Switch.\n- Multiple integrated charge cables or USB-out ports will allow you to charge more than one device at a time, such as an iPad or another iPhone. Just don't expect to charge a laptop unless you get a power bank with 65 watts of output power or more, which is comparatively rare.\nHow we test power banks for iPhones\nAt the current time, we do anecdotal testing on these models. Each is fully charged and used on a recent iPhone model for at least a week in real-world conditions. We verify that charging speeds and recharge times are within expected parameters and -- for models with integrated stands or cables -- confirm that the connections and build quality are sturdy and free of any notable annoyances or caveats.\nOther iPhone power banks we've tested\nUgreen Qi2 magnetic power bank: Less well-known battery companies, like Ugreen and Baseus, are trying to take on Anker on Amazon with value power banks like this Qi2 magnetic wireless charger ($35). It's fairly slim for a 10,000-mAh battery and offers up 15-watt wireless charging and 20W wireless charging if you plug the battery into a 20W or higher power adapter. This power bank can charge an iPhone 16 almost twice and is one of the more affordable Qi2-certified power banks.\nMophie Powerstation Plus Mini: If you have one of the newer iPhones with USB-C charging, or an Android smartphone with USB-C, the Mophie Powerstation Plus Mini ($50) is a relatively compact power bank with an integrated USB-C cable that offers 20-watt fast charging. The mini version has a 5,000-mAh battery that will fully recharge most smartphones at once. Mophie also makes a larger, 10,000mAh version that offers double the charging capacity, but it's a little bulky and costs more. Note that while you're charging the battery, you can also charge your device (the battery has pass-through charging).\nMophie Powerstation Plus: If you're still using Apple devices with Lightning connectors but also want a power bank that can charge USB-C equipped devices, the Mophie Powerstation Plus ($80), while fairly price, is a nice option with its dual UBC-C/Lightning cable design. It's a 10,000-mAh battery, so it can charge an iPhone 16 almost twice, and it delivers 30 watts of power from its USB-C port, so it can also provide some juice to a MacBook Air in a pinch. The smaller Mini version costs about $30 less and has only a single USB-C cable (it's a 5,000-mAH battery), while the Mophie Powerstation Plus ($100) also has dual cables but adds retractable prongs so you can charge it in any power outlet.\nAnker MagGo Power Bank 6.6K: The Anker MagGo Power Bank 6.6K has a 6,600-mAh battery and a foldable design with customizable viewing angles. It's Qi2-certified, which means it offers 15-watt fast-charging capabilities and is fully MagSafe compatible, offering twice the speed of standard 7.5-watt wireless chargers for MagSafe-enabled iPhone 13, 14, 15 and 16 models and Android smartphones that support 15-watt wireless charging. Though it comes with a USB-C cable, you'll need a USB-C charger with more than 15-watt output to hit those 15-watt charging speeds. You can take the power bank on the go or leave it plugged in to use as a wireless charging stand when at home. Its only drawback is that it's a little bulky for on-the-go use.\nNimble Champ: Nimble's updated Champ portable charger uses recycled plastic in its construction. You have to pay a bit more for going green, but it's a nice, compact 10,000-mAh charger that features 20-watt PD fast-charging with dual USB-C ports (one on either side of the power bank) that allow you to charge two devices at the same time. If you are charging two devices, your charging speeds will be limited to 10 watts per device.\nMyCharge Superhero MagLock: MyCharge calls its line of magnetic power banks Superhero MagLock, implying that they're real saviors. I was impressed by their design. Not only do the batteries, which come in various capacities and colors, have strong magnets and stick really well to the back of any MagSafe-enabled iPhone, but they have raised coils, which are supposed to help reduce heat levels while charging. It does seem to work. All the MagLock batteries charge Qi-enabled iPhones at 5 watts, although you can get faster charging if you go wired and use a USB-C-to-Lightning cable. I also liked how there's a chime when the charging starts and your phone tells you how much juice is left in the battery pack\nAnker 523 PowerCore Slim 10K PD: The Anker 523 PowerCore Slim 10K PD ($28) is impressively slim for a 10,000-mAh portable phone charger and has a fast 20-watt USB-C out charging port (it's also a USB-C input to charge its battery), plus a 12-watt USB-A out port. While the Anker 313 PowerCore Slim 10K is cheaper, this offers fast USB-C outcharging, which makes spending the extra dough a big plus if you have a USB-C-to-Lightning cable.\nMophie Powerstation 10K Stand with MagSafe: Mophie's Powerstation Wireless Stand with MagSafe isn't cheap but is a versatile 10,000-mAh battery with both a stand and MagSafe charger built-in and also has a threaded tripod mount at the bottom. Since this is an official MagSafe charger, the battery does charge at 15 watts, making this among the fastest wireless external battery chargers out there and will also charge the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro models with MagSafe. If you use a USB-C-to-Lightning cable (not included) with it, you can charge at 20-watt speeds. You can also charge two devices at the same time.\nAnker PowerCore III 10K Portable Charger: The Anker PowerCore III 10K portable charger has fast USB-C out charging (18 watts) as well as a USB-A port and up to 10-watt wireless charging. It's not magnetic, so your phone won't stick to it but it will wirelessly charge any Qi-enabled devices.\nMophie Snap Plus Juice Pack Mini: Mophie's magnetic power bank is similar to Anker's but is slightly slimmer (it's suitable for a 5,000-mAh battery) and doesn't have an integrated flap that converts into a stand. It's designed to adhere to the back of MagSafe-enabled iPhone or MagSafe cases, it comes with a \"snap adapter\" ring to stick onto the back of Android devices so they'll be magnet-friendly.\nAnker PowerCore Fusion Portable Charger (Currently Unavailable): This Anker model is effectively an oversized wall charger with a built-in 5,000-mAh battery. It's got two standard USB charging ports for simultaneously juicing up your phone and a secondary gadget (or two phones). A little LED indicator on the side lets you check the charge level at the press of a button."

      "text": "Many people enjoy camping, and the experience is just as varied as the people who partake in it. Some love to \"rough it\" and go as minimal as possible when trekking into nature. Others may want an experience that is more like a five-star hotel in a more \"rural\" setting. Regardless of how you camp, some items are essential and others just enhance your time outdoors.\nOur Picks\nYARD AND OUTDOORS DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $2,840 (save $710)\n- $389 (save $161)\n- $599 (save $151)\n- $500 (save $200)\n- $173 (save $58)\nBelow, I've compiled a list containing necessary items for the average camper and some that are great for making your camping experience a bit more enjoyable. If you think of camping as a planned emergency, many of the things you'd want in that situation are the things you'd pack for a camping trip. Things like having a reliable flashlight and a battery pack for your phone are just a few examples. But let's look at the best camping gear you should consider for your next trip.\nBest camping tech for 2025\nOlight is a brand that knows flashlights. While it may be on the pricey end at $70, the Olight Baton3 Pro is a highly capable device that is perfect for any camping loadout. With up to 1500 lumens, it is plenty bright to spot objects in the distance with Turbo mode but won't blind you when searching around your tent at night with Firefly mode. The compact flashlight is also IPX8 rated so it won't be damaged in the rain.\nOlight included a long two-way clip to better secure it to your pocket or bag, and with the magnetic end, you can set it up handsfree when needed. That magnet is also used to hold the charger in place to charge the batteries. This means you can leave the AA batteries at home. The Baton3 Pro is rated to have 120 minutes of continuous run time.\nThanks to Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology, chargers have been getting more powerful while shrinking at the same time. The latest example of that trend is Anker's new line of GaNPrime chargers with next-generation GaN 3 technology that the company says is even more energy-efficient. The Anker Power Bank 733, which combines a 65W charger with a 10K mAh portable battery, is part of the new GaNPrime line. It's pretty compact and offers two fast-charging USB-C ports and one fast-charging USB-A port. You can charge up to three devices at once, but note that to get a full 65W charge for a laptop, you'll have to plug in just the laptop.\nIf you do a lot of camping or any amount of travel, you know how important it is to pack your car properly. Tetris-like skill is needed to fit everything you need. The Flat Packer from Burch Barrel makes the packing a little easier by being under an inch thick when folded away. It can fit easily down the side of your luggage or even flat with bags on top. When you get to where you are going, slide the four pieces together and boom, instant fire pit with a grill top for burgers.\nSolo Stove, which makes some of the best smokeless fire pits, released its second-generation Ranger 2.0 (small), Bonfire 2.0 (medium) and Yukon 2.0 (large) fire pits in August 2022. Now it's gone extra small for its new Mesa fire pit.\nAs its name implies, the Mesa is designed to sit on a tabletop and is small enough to slip into a backpack for mobility. Naturally, you could also set it on the ground, but when you put it on a table, it's at a good height for comfortably roasting marshmallows. It has the same 360-degree Signature Airflow system as Solo Stove's larger fire pits and is the spiritual successor to the Solo Stove Lite, a mini camp stove (whether we'll see some camping accessories for the Mesa is unclear at this point). It's an excellent mini fire pit.\nWhen you need a bit more than a power bank for your phone but don't have a lot of space, the Anker Solix C800 Plus is an excellent choice for your camping gear. Anker makes loads of different mobile battery banks, so it's no surprise to see one on this list. The Solix C800 Plus's size, weight and versatility make it a great portable camping power station.\nFor starters, you get 768Wh of battery capacity, cranking out up to 1200W of power output and 1600W of surge power. All of this is accessible from the two USB-C, two USB-A, five AC outlets and one 12V car socket. When it's time to recharge the power station, it can handle up to 1400W of input from AC power or 300W of solar.\nBut what really makes the Solix C800 Plus great for camping is the door on top of the unit. Inside are two multifunctional lights that are recharged when stored in the lid's compartment. The lights have adjustable brightness and three different modes -- Candle, Floodlight and Flashlight. There is also an expandable stand that threads directly onto the C800 Plus and has a magnetic ball mount on the end to attach the light to. Because the light's base is magnetic, you can also attach it to other metal objects or use the hook to hang the light.\nBluetti is a brand that specializes in portable power stations, and I've used many of its products in various situations. But the Bluetti AC240P stands out as an excellent choice for your camping gear list and outdoor people because it is IP65 water- and dust-resistant. While I don't recommend leaving your power station out in a rainstorm, when you're camping things happen, and sometimes things get left outside. Even if it doesn't rain, dust and overnight moisture can be an issue for other power stations.\nThe Bluetti AC240P is by no means light at 72 pounds, so it is one that you'll want to place in a central location at the campsite. But when you know you need power or simply want up to 3,600W of power for things like a coffeemaker or even a microwave, a big power station is needed. To access that power, you can use either of the two AC outlets or the 30A NEMA TT-30 RV plug, two USB-A ports, two USB-C ports or the single 12V car socket. Recharging is done via AC power at up to 2,200W, up to 1,200W of solar,or even via 12V or 24V car socket.\nWhen you want something more than a small camp stove like this one from Odoland, this sleek portable gas grill from Weber is superior in almost every category and was a fairly clear winner as the best portable grill overall. It's easy to assemble with just a few parts and feels solid and sturdy, even when given a few vigorous shakes. The igniter works well and once lit, the grill got hot, reaching its advertised 500 degrees Fahrenheit after just 15 minutes with the lid closed. The flame is easy to control and keeps a consistent temperature throughout cooking, even when grilling with the flame turned low.\nWith 189 square inches of cooking surface, this grill was not the biggest on the list, but it's plenty big enough to cook burgers, chicken, fish and veggies for a group of six hungry people. It's also nice-looking with flare-out trays to hold your plates and grilling tools, plus an ergonomic design. It comes in a bunch of fun colors or jet black if you prefer. Despite its sturdy build, the Q-1200 is still light enough to take on a camping trip or for one person to carry with relative ease. This grill can use any small propane tank sold at most camping or hardware stores.\nThe one thing there never seems to be enough of when camping is a flat surface to set stuff on. Lugging around folding tables is no fun, but this GCI Outdoor Slim Fold Table has changed the camping game for me. Even if a table might not be considered a camping gadget, I love how light the table is, but it is still very sturdy and able to support up to 125 pounds. The aluminum table is durable but lightweight at only 14.5 pounds, so it's easy to move around. There is more than enough space to gather around the 24.2\u201d D x 54.3\u201d W x 26.8\" H table, and the slatted design makes it easy to clean.\nNot the most affordable camping chair, but the GCI Freestyle Camping Chair is one that you can buy and never have to replace, which is what made it part of my essential camping gear. My family has been using the same chairs for over three years and they have been taken to sporting events, camping trips, the beach and more. The durable construction means it can not only hold up to where you use it, but also being tossed around in the back of a truck.\nThe iconic spring-loaded shocks let you rock and sit comfortably in any position. The seat has plenty of space not to feel cramped, and the mesh back helps keep you cool. You also get a drink holder to keep your beverage handy. Then, when it's time to pack up, the chair folds flat for easy storage.\nA hammock is a wonderful way to relax outdoors. But you either need two trees near each other that are strong enough to hold you and your hammock or a stand to attach your hammock to. Trees aren't always exactly where you want them to be, and not all stands are easy to set up or durable enough to withstand being moved around. The Anymaka Portable Hammock Stand solves all of that.\nThe stand itself is extremely well-made and easy to set up. Anymaka advertises that it takes three seconds to have it up and ready. I have to say that after a few tries, maybe it can be done in 3 seconds, but realistically, it will be a full 5 seconds to be set and adjusted. Attaching the hammock and cup holder takes an additional 20 seconds, and if you decide to put up the sunshade, you're looking at another 15 seconds. I was able to go from unpacking to napping in under a minute.\nNot only is the process quick and easy, but the Anymaka hammock and stand are rated to withstand up to 550 lbs, so they're durable, too. Carrying the entire pack with you isn't going to ruin the relaxation you just experienced. After spending a whole 2 minutes taking the setup down and packing it into the carrying case, you're looking at just over 26 pounds to haul with you for your next adventure.\nThe gear that is available for lovers of the outdoors is also evolving. We'll continue to update our list as new items become available and we can test them. There is plenty of excellent outdoor tech that is great for at home or camping. Finding what works for your style of camping adventures will ultimately help you to identify the gear you need. Just be sure to stay safe and leave your area cleaner than when you found it."

      "text": "We all know how important it is to get good rest for overall health and well-being. The quality of your sleep matters, and the amount of time you sleep each night matters. But with so much happening in the world right now, it's not surprising if you find it difficult to manage your stress levels properly. When we feel stress, finding a coping mechanism can be difficult for some, if not overwhelming or impossible. If that's the case, then this can also lead to anxiety, which further disrupts your sleep.\nAccording to a recent CNET survey, US adults are willing to spend around $1,000 a year ($78 monthly) to improve their sleep quality. More than half of those adults, around 56%, have some kind of coping method to deal with their sleep-related challenges. And one in four (22%) use some kind of sleep tech to help them get a good night's rest. While a new mattress and bedding can certainly help, there are other ways to help you get better sleep that won't be too expensive.\nPersonally, I've never had trouble falling asleep; staying asleep is my issue. I often wake up at ungodly hours to racing thoughts about everything I have to get done and everything I'd failed to accomplish the day before. I'd done all the \"right\" things to manage anxiety, like reducing my coffee intake, intentional breathing, meditation and eating balanced meals. Although I saw small improvements, the results weren't long-lasting. That's when I spoke to Andrea Micheo, a certified holistic health coach from the Institute for Integrative Nutrition, to find natural remedies for anxiety.\nRead more: Best Mattress for 2025\nHow morning sunlight affects your circadian rhythm\nA good night's sleep is essential for our health. One often overlooked factor in achieving quality sleep is exposure to sunlight in the morning. There are multiple benefits of getting sunlight first thing in the morning, such as boosting your mood and improving your quality of sleep. How? Great question. Let's get into it.\nWe can't talk about morning sunlight and improved sleep hygiene without first addressing our circadian rhythm. This is the body's 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. It naturally responds to light and darkness, and it dictates when we get hungry, sleepy and ready to wake up. Think of it as an internal clock.\nAccording to Johns Hopkins, the SCN (or suprachiasmatic nucleus) is the area of your brain that controls your sleep-wake cycle. In the morning, your eyes sense the sunlight, and then the SCN triggers the release of cortisol to help wake up your body. Getting sunlight in the morning helps regulate your circadian rhythm as the light signals to your body and brain that it's time to start the day. When it gets dark at night, the SCN triggers the release of melatonin, which makes you sleepy.\n\"About a year ago, I started getting sunlight first thing in the morning and at sunset as a means to regulate my circadian rhythm. Since then, I've ditched the melatonin and have been getting more quality sleep,\" said Micheo.\nOur internal clock is most sensitive to light during three specific times of the day:\n- During the first hour after waking up: In the morning, as you get exposed to sunlight, your body starts to suppress its melatonin production (sleepy hormone).\n- Approximately 2 hours before your bedtime: As it starts to get dark outside, your brain receives the signal that it's time to wind down and go to bed.\n- During the night: The darkness continues to signal to the brain to keep us asleep.\nYou can leverage these three stages of light to synchronize your circadian rhythm. Studies show that exposure to daylight not only improves sleep quality but can also help you fall asleep earlier. \"I always recommend this time-efficient and cost-effective behavioral tool to all my clients and continue getting positive results and feedback,\" added Micheo.\nRead more: Circadian Rhythm: Here's How to Reset and Get Better Sleep\nMy sleep quality before and after getting morning sunlight\nI'm a decent sleeper: I prioritize sleep and usually get enough quality rest to wake up feeling refreshed the next day. When looking at the data from my Oura ring (a cool health and fitness tracker), my average sleep score is around 80, which Oura labels as \"good.\" Here's my sleep data from the night before I incorporated getting sunlight into my morning routine.\nAs you can see, I got almost 8 hours of sleep, but I had more wakeups than usual (restfulness). It took me 28 minutes to get to sleep (10 to 20 minutes is normal for most adults), and I didn't spend an ideal amount of time in deep sleep.\nThe only thing I switched up in my morning routine was going for a 30-minute walk outside briefly after waking up. I didn't wear sunglasses or a hat to expose my eyes to the sun's first morning rays, but I did protect my skin with sunscreen. If you go outside later in the day, it's best to wear a hat and sunglasses and use sunscreen.\nRead more: Best Sunscreen\nI didn't change anything else in my daily or night routine, and this is what I woke up to:\nThe first thing I noticed was that I slept a whole hour more and that I experienced fewer wakeups during the night. I also spent more time in deep sleep, and it only took me 9 minutes to fall asleep.\nDid I feel any different? Besides feeling a little more energized, I didn't experience a huge shift. I am surprised that I noticed such a difference in my sleep quality in just one day of exposing myself to the morning sun. The initial results are pretty promising, and I plan to get sunlight most mornings to see if I see significant improvement in the long run.\nGuide to sunlight therapy in the morning\nThere isn't a single right way to get sunlight in the morning; these general guidelines can help you maximize your time in the sun:\n- Go outside within the first hour of waking up: Since your body is most sensitive to light right around when you wake up, it's a good idea to soak up some sunshine first thing in the morning.\n- Aim to spend at least 30 mins in the sun: According to Harvard Medical School, 30 minutes is the optimal time to spend in light.\n- Be sure to wear sunscreen: While the sun's UV radiation is less harmful in the morning than during the day, it's still a good idea to protect yourself with sunscreen.\n- Talk to your doctor: Before trying out light therapy with the morning sun, be sure you talk to your healthcare provider to ensure it's safe for you.\nTips to get more sunlight in the morning\nNow that we've discussed how morning sunlight can affect sleep quality, let's explore ways to get more sunlight.\n- Rise with the sun: Waking up around sunrise can be a game-changer for your sleep. Aim to wake up early and catch the first rays of sunlight to help regulate your circadian rhythm.\n- Open your curtains and blinds: One easy way of maximizing natural light in your home is to open your blinds and curtains. This allows the sunlight to provide a natural wake-up signal for your body.\n- Do outdoor activities in the morning: Whether it's going for a brisk walk or just stretching on your patio, exposure to natural light and physical activity can help you wake up naturally.\n- Eat breakfast by a window: If your mornings are limited and you can't find 15 extra minutes to get sunlight, try having your breakfast or coffee near a window.\n- Invest in a light therapy lamp: If you have limited access to natural sunlight or live in a region with overcast weather, consider a light therapy device that mimics the spectrum of natural light.\nMorning sunlight FAQs\nWhat is the best time to get sunlight for your body?\nIf you're looking to reset your internal clock, the best time to get sunlight is 30 minutes to an hour after you wake up. This should generally be around the same time since a consistent sleep schedule gives the best results. Studies have found that anywhere between 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. is a great time to get sunlight to obtain vitamin D.\nHow long should you get morning sunlight?\nYou should aim to get anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes of sunlight in the morning. You can start with 5 minutes on a sunny day and work your way to 10. On cloudy days, you may need closer to 20 minutes. It's up to you and how your body feels."

      "url": "https://www.cnet.com/health/the-best-electrolytes-according-to-experts/",
      "text": "With one of the hottest summers affecting the whole country, you\u2019ve probably heard about the importance of staying hydrated and replenishing electrolytes. Electrolytes are essential minerals (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium) found in the body that we lose through sweat. Electrolytes are important for a variety of reasons, like keeping our pH levels balanced and regulating nerve function and muscle contractions (to prevent cramping) while also keeping us hydrated.\nOur Picks\nTo replenish electrolytes, you would have to eat hydrating foods like watermelon, squash, cucumbers and strawberries, among others. Another way you can add back electrolytes is by relying on electrolyte powders and drinks. These can be difficult to pick from since the FDA doesn\u2019t regulate dietary supplements before they\u2019re on the market.\nThe good news is that we had a few experts weigh in on the best electrolytes you should have on hand in the middle of a heat wave, when you\u2019re training for hours at a time or if you simply want to stay on top of your hydration. Below are their recommendations, plus some other things to keep in mind when selecting an electrolyte powder or drink.\nBest electrolyte powders and drinks overall\nGatorade is the best overall pick because of how well-balanced the electrolytes and carbohydrates are in this sports drink. It was specifically designed for those who exercise vigorously and need to replenish their energy sources quickly.\nBest electrolyte powders and drinks, according to experts\nThe best overall electrolytes for athletes are sports drinks like Gatorade and Powerade. According to Rayven Nairn, senior dietitian for student health and well-being at Johns Hopkins University, these beverages are ideal because they\u2019re well-balanced.\n\u201cThey hit hydration, energy and electrolyte targets,\u201d she says. Sports drinks are a good option if you are an athlete or engage in vigorous physical activity for more than an hour. Drinks like this were developed to not only help you replenish any minerals lost but to also include carbohydrates, which are the body\u2019s primary source of energy. This is what helps athletes keep going during a race or other endurance sport.\nIf you\u2019re in a pinch and need an electrolyte drink, Pedialyte is another good option. Although it\u2019s a common rehydration beverage people drink when they\u2019re sick or hungover, it\u2019s just as good for active individuals. It comes in premixed, dry packet types and even freezer pops. Pedialyte contains sodium, potassium and chloride electrolytes.\nNairn says she recommends Pedialyte to her athletes who exercise for periods extending 60 minutes since it's enough to replenish any electrolytes lost. One thing to keep in mind is that Pedialyte tends to have less sugar than a traditional sports drink, so if you\u2019re working out vigorously and need a quicker boost, you may prefer to opt for the sports drink instead.\nNuun is a popular electrolyte powder tablet that is recommended for athletes. It\u2019s sold in a tube and contains round tablets that dissolve in water. It comes in a variety of flavors, is vegan and gluten-free and also has a caffeinated version. Wendell Albarran, an ISSA-certified fitness expert and nutritionist at Real Elevate Fitness, says, \u201cSome of my favorite electrolyte supplements include Nuun Sport for its balanced electrolytes and ingredients, making it great for everyday athletes.\u201d\nCassandra Padula Burke, a registered dietitian nutritionist, certified endurance coach and owner of Catalyst Performance Lab in Finksburg, Maryland, also likes Nuun because it\u2019s a complete hydration option. \u201cIt has sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium and is a great option for activities lasting less than an hour,\u201d Burke says. Because of its portability, it\u2019s an ideal electrolyte drink if you\u2019re training for a marathon or triathlon and need to give your water a boost during a training session.\nLiquid I.V. is another favorite that comes in a variety of flavors, is dairy-free, vegan and gluten-free and even has sugar-free options. It\u2019s an electrolyte powder that comes in individual packets, so you can carry it while traveling or to the gym. Burke says this is another one of her go-to recommendations for athletes who work out for more than an hour. If you\u2019re not active or simply want to flavor your water, the sugar-free Liquid I.V. packets are a great option. The brand regularly comes out with new flavors -- with their latest being cotton candy and rainbow sherbert.\nIf you\u2019re a salty sweater -- as in you sweat excessively and a white residue visibly develops on your clothing or skin -- you require sodium replenishment as quickly as possible. It\u2019s helpful to have an electrolyte like LMNT by your side. LMNT is a sugar-free electrolyte powder intended to help replenish essential electrolytes for those who excessively sweat. It\u2019s also suitable for those on low-carb, keto and paleo diets. Burke says this electrolyte is appropriate for endurance athletes and salty sweaters. For reference, one packet has 1,000 milligrams of sodium. You can buy these powder electrolytes by signing up for a subscription or a one-time purchase.\nBest Electrolyte powders and drinks compared\n| Electrolyte Powders/Drinks | Calories per serving | Carbohydrates | Sodium | Sugar | Price |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Gatorade | 80 | 22 g | 160 mg | 21 g | $13 |\n| Pedialyte | 40 | 10 g | 370 mg | 9 g | $20 |\n| Nuun Sport Hydration | 15 | 4 g | 300 mg | 1 g | $27 |\n| Liquid I.V. | 50 | 13 g | 500 mg | 11 g | $25 |\n| LMNT | 10 | 2 g | 1,000 mg | 0 g | $45 |\nHow we chose the best electrolyte powders and drinks\nWe consulted with dietitians who work with the general public and athletes for their recommendations. We took into consideration that both athletes and less active individuals could benefit from electrolytes.\nFactors to consider when choosing the right electrolyte powders and drinks\nCarbohydrates\nFirst, it\u2019s important to know what you should be looking for on the nutritional label. Gabriela Barreto, a registered dietitian and sports nutritionist says, \u201cwhat research shows for optimal and rapid rehydration is the addition of carbohydrates into the electrolyte mix.\u201d This is because carbs are more rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and, as a result, rehydrate your cells more efficiently. Most brands have between 10 to 20 grams of carbs in their formulas. Other ingredients you should look for include magnesium, potassium, calcium and sometimes chloride since they\u2019re all also electrolytes, Albarran advises.\nSodium\nMost importantly, you want to focus on sodium because it\u2019s the primary electrolyte lost through sweat. The amount of sodium you will need depends on how much you sweat and how much sodium you lose when you sweat. \u201cThe average loss of sodium is 950 mg per liter of sweat, but this can range from 200 to 2,000 mg of sodium depending on the person,\u201d Barreto says. She adds that most quality electrolyte brands range from 300 to upward of 1,500 milligrams of sodium.\nYou can also calculate your sweat rate at home by following this CDC-approved formula. Other methods may include using a sweat patch, but it\u2019s essential to know that some methodologies may provide inconsistent results, so bear in mind these are estimates. The sweat test, which reads the level of chloride in sweat, is the most accurate method when done correctly and in a lab. Generally, children with cystic fibrosis have a sweat test done to get a diagnosis since those with CF have higher levels of chloride in their sweat.\nPhysical activity\nIf you're an active gym goer or athlete, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re prioritizing replenishing electrolytes and carbohydrates. \u201cAn indicator of increased electrolyte needs would be cravings post-exercise and/or headaches, muscle cramping, lightheadedness and fatigue,\u201d Nairn says. \u201cI usually recommend looking for supplements that provide higher amounts of sodium and potassium, which are more readily lost during exercise through sweat.\u201d For athletes, Barreto recommends sticking to electrolytes with 500 to 1,000 milligrams of sodium. \u201cSome of the higher sodium brands do not contain carbs, which athletes training longer than one hour will need an alternative carb source for fueling purposes as well,\u201d Barreto advises.\nSugar\nIf you\u2019re looking to add electrolytes to your water but aren\u2019t generally active, Barreto suggests choosing a sugar-free electrolyte with sodium less than 300 milligrams. \u201cWhile carbs help with optimal rehydration, that's more important for heavy sweaters who are actively performing,\u201d she explains. In this case, sugar-free options are suitable for those who don\u2019t exercise but like adding electrolytes to their water. \u201cThose engaging in moderate to intense exercise should avoid sugar-free options because sugar is necessary post-exercise for energy replenishment,\u201d Nairn says.\nPregnancy\nPregnant patients may want to consider paying attention to their electrolyte levels. This can be because of hormonal changes, increased blood volume, morning sickness and higher sweat rates, especially if they are active. If you are pregnant and concerned about your sodium levels, see your health care provider.\nHealth conditions\nPeople with specific health conditions like hypertension, kidney disease or heart disease should consult with a health care provider to determine appropriate sodium levels. Nairn explains that certain medications like diuretics, which are commonly prescribed to those with edema or kidney issues, can cause electrolyte imbalances. \u201cDiuretics can impact sodium, potassium and magnesium,\u201d she explains, adding that \u201cangiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, which are used to reduce blood pressure, can also affect this because they can result in high potassium.\u201d\nPrecautions to take with electrolyte powders and drinks\nAlthough there are many powder and drink options on the market for electrolytes, you should still be mindful of how much you consume daily. Nairn and Barreto advise consulting with your health care provider regarding your personal needs. If you do add electrolyte powders to your drinks and enjoy the taste, it\u2019s important to avoid overdoing it. In some circumstances, having too many electrolytes can cause nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, cramping, bloating or gas. It is usually uncommon, but electrolytes can disagree with some individuals. \u201cThese symptoms can vary in intensity based on the individual's sensitivity and the specific electrolyte supplement used,\u201d explains Nairn.\nOne of the health risks to consider if you over-consume electrolyte products is excessive sodium intake. This can present itself in edema (water retention) and hypertension (high blood pressure). \u201cAcute toxicity is of little concern because once water needs are met, the kidneys can handle the rest, but sustained overconsumption can lead to chronic hypertension,\u201d Nairn says. Those with a history of heart failure and/or kidney disease have to be particularly careful about their potassium and sodium intakes.\nOther things to consider are excessive potassium intake, which can lead to cardiac arrest, and excessive chloride intake, which can result in water-deficiency dehydration, but this is rare. Nairn says most of these scenarios are unlikely in healthy individuals, but they\u2019re still helpful to keep in mind.\nIf you're considering consuming electrolyte powders and drinks, consult with your doctor to ensure that you\u2019re selecting one that is suitable for your needs."

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2025A great alternative to DEET-- much less toxic, corrosive, and even smells better. This is so far the only thing that works on tropical mosquitoes, sand flies, and midges. Lasts for a few hours, even with heavy sweating. Pump spray is handy and you can put it in a checked bag on a plane.\n- Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2024After reading up on DEET vs picaridin, went with picaridin for my trip to mosquitoland because I don't like how DEET ruins your plastic gear. This worked fantastic and I didn't mind putting it on because the scent is mild, it wasn't greasy, and it stayed put with one application. I put it on over sunscreen and both worked. Not a single bite on areas that I sprayed, but others in my group were eaten alive.\nIt leaves a slight sheen on your skin - no big deal. Very happy with this product.\n- Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2025This works really well to keep ticks and other insects away. The downside of the spray is that the mist is very fine and very irritating if you inhale it, affecting your lungs and mouth.. Of course there is a warning, to spray your hand and wipe it on your neck or other areas near your face, yet the mist seems to hang in the air. I suggest putting it on outside in a breeze or spray a cloth wrapped near the spray nozzle. The other option is to get the wipe on Natrapel pads and use them - no mist. Other products have irritating chemicals, just not as potent it seems.\n- Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2017I love this product. Insect repellents always have a peculiar smell, but this stuff does not smell bad and is not overpowering like most other insect repellents - and MOST IMPORTANTLY it really works to keep the insects away.\nI've found the pump to be really good quality - firm voluminous sprays with no clogging like many other small spray bottle pumps I've used in the past.\nAlso, the plastic cap covering the spray nozzle is fairly thick and grabs on tight - so I have no issue putting this in a backpack or in the side-pocket of a car.\nCheaper/thinner plastic caps I've used in the past have cracked, meaning the cap no longer does it's job and I can't be as portable with whatever the spray product is. Not the case here.\nPro-tip: spray this in your car as well. I've found it creates a nice 'bug-barrier' for times when I'm in/around infested areas and don't want the insects following me in. I guess I wouldn't spray this on leather, but have found no issues spraying on my cloth seats.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2018THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! My daughter and I are mosquito magnets, she is allergic and ends up with these giant welts. Softball season is usually a nightmare. She hates aerosol sprays because they get in your mouth and basically fog you out and leave your skin wet and sticky and then you get it in your eyes. She is 6 and just hates having to do bug spray and it is a nightmare. BUT this isnt aerosol and it goes on kind of like a light dry oil. It coats the skin and has a flowery plant smell that isnt crazy off putting...but even better IT WORKS! Like NOOOOO bites...at all. I just spray down her arms and legs and then rub some on her neck and lightly mist her clothes. It last a long time and I have no complaints. I am really happy with this purchase.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2018I do not have any bad reaction to DEET, so that's not why I switched to this, but the mosquitoes in my area seemed immune to it so I figured I would give Picaridin a try. It's still not 100% effective\u2014I currently have like four or five bites\u2014but I do spend a lot of time outdoors and it's worked a LOT better than DEET (I used OFF! Deep Woods and still wound up getting swarmed. Luckily I was aware it was happening and was able to retreat indoors, but had I not I would have wound up with dozens of bites).\nTo me it smells better than OFF! but it still has a chemically scent. It doesn't feel greasy on my skin at all, and hasn't damaged any clothing I've sprayed it on. The OFF! used to make my floor slippery where I sprayed it, but this does not.\n- Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2025I frequent islands and warm climates and bought this for Costa Rica. I get very few bites with this product. I definitely realize a difference when I forget to spray it on! I will notice bites where I neglected to apply, which tells me that it repels well!\n- Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2016The wife and I used this stuff exclusively on our trip to Africa. My wife attracts bug bites like crazy, so she started out by using stronger DEET stuff and \"topping up\" every now and then with this stuff. After a while, she stopped with the DEET and switched to this stuff exclusively. I used no DEET while over there, and used only this stuff.\nI sprayed this stuff on over top of my clothes - it did not hurt any of my clothing that I could tell. Even to this day I don't see any damage. (And the DEET did destroy some of my wife's clothes.)\nWhile we were in Africa during the low time for mosquitoes, I can say that I personally did not get even one bug bite. My wife did get one (in South Africa). That speaks volumes for this product. Normally, she would be eaten alive and I would get a couple. We were diligent about applying and came through with flying colors. I would expect this would work just as well during the high mosquito months - one just might have to apply it more often is all.\nIf you are looking for something that is DEET free and works, this is what you want. It worked great for us!\nProduct summary presents key product information\nKeyboard shortcut\nshift\n+\nalt\n+\nopt\n+\nD\nProduct Summary: Natrapel Picaridin Insect Repellent 3.4 oz Pump Spray \u2013 12 Hour Bug Repellent Repels Mosquitoes, Ticks and More\nFrom Natrapel\nAbout this Item\n- 12 Hours of Protection-Stay bite free all day with Natrapel\u2019s 20 percent Picaridin formula.

      "text": "Even though summer is over, fall is still a great time to enjoy your outdoor space. In preparation for all the festivities, we've tested grills, coolers, outdoor projectors and audio equipment, as well as kept tabs on various outdoor lighting and other great gadgets for your outdoor space. These are some of the best outdoor tech devices for 2024.\nOur Picks\nYARD AND OUTDOORS DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $2,840 (save $710)\n- $389 (save $161)\n- $599 (save $151)\n- $500 (save $200)\n- $173 (save $58)\nYou can (and should) go down the rabbit hole on other outdoor tech, particularly grilling accessories and outdoor security cameras. Still, this list is all about entertaining in an outdoor space. If you spend your warmer days -- or cooler ones if you have a good fire pit -- with your friends and family, have a large enough backyard space and want to make the most of it, then any or all of these great tech choices are for you.\nPizza ovens are an outdoor cooking sensation. Smaller than your average grill, this propane-powered pizza preparer is simple to use and can evenly cook pizza, and other dough-based deliciousness at a rapid pace.\nThe hot stone in the center of the oven is heavy and needs a good amount of preheating before you put your pizza on, but once it's ready, a homemade pie takes about 6 minutes to cook to perfection. The stone rotates so there's no need to take the food out to move it or worry that it will be undercooked on one side.\nThe liftable lid is the other feature that really sets the Halo Versa apart from most pizza ovens. Once the food is cooked you tilt the lid up, giving you far more access and making it easy to get the food out without dropping it (something I've occasionally done on a normal oven).\nLiving in Virginia means I get cool winters and very hot summers. My backyard is set just right so no wind ever reaches it, making summer days stifling and in need of a breeze. The Shark FlexBreeze has been a godsend since it arrived because it offers wire-free cooling directly to me and my family. The battery charges quickly and lasts for hours, or it can be plugged in for continuous power if you aren't using the mister. Oh, by the way, it also has a mister which is fantastic if you don't mind being moist. For one more party trick, the Shark can pull apart into a shorter table fan, making it truly versatile.\nThis large solar light has an elegant design that can be screwed into your deck near a pool or walkway to give a beautiful glow all night long. Or you can do what I've done and use it in place of a real flame fire pit. The soft, warm light gives that same ambiance a fire pit does without adding degrees of heat to the surrounding area.\nMy family and I love to hang out in the yard during the summer, but the temperatures are in the mid-80s, much too hot for a real flame. The Skye from Mod Lighting is an excellent compromise.\nThis Cuisinart heater stands out from the options thanks to the adjustable arm that reaches out and away from the base and can rotate 360 degrees around it. This means the heater can be positioned in the middle when you and your group sit around a table, keeping everyone warm.\nAccording to Cuisinart, the propane heater is rated at 38,200 BTUs, and the dome on top has a more downward curve than most, which helps push heat toward you. In testing, the heater consistently dropped in temperature as I moved away, only losing an average of about 4.5 degrees from the initial temperature increase of 12.73 degrees average at 1 foot.\nThis is easily the most extravagant thing on this list, but if you spend hours in your backyard like we do, having a TV designed to last is well worth it. This entry from Sylvox is water resistant against rain and splashing from the pool, can work in freezing temperatures as well as hot weather and is smart too.\nThe Google TV integration makes the entire TV very snappy and you get all of your favorite apps to play with. The volume is decent, though nothing to write home about, but the screen is incredibly bright. Even on the brightest day, I was able to watch Miraculous Ladybug with my daughter without any issues.\nSmokeless fire pits are all the rage, and for good reasons, but there is so much more that you can do with these automatic ambiance creators. Aside from being excellent for making wood-fired pizza, there are a lot of accessories make fire pits all-around good grilling machines.\nI love Breeo fire pits for the variety of styles offered, like the wonderfully bougie Luxeve, but what really makes these fire pits stand out is the durability and construction of them. Made from heavy gauge stainless steel (unless you go with the corten steel option for that natural patina look) and meticulously welded, Breeo fire pits are built to last.\nSo it stands to reason that the accessories for these fire pits would be great, too. The Outpost Grill accessory comes with a steel post, a cooking grate large enough to cover the entire fire pit opening, and a ground stake if you want to cook over a traditional campfire. When attached to your fire pit, you can easily adjust the height of the grate over the flames and swing it out of the way if you need to remove it from heat. The Outpost makes cooking everything from hot dogs to steaks over the fire a cinch. The Breeo flat top griddle is another accessory that makes cooking things like breakfast, loose veggies, and more so easy.\nWhile many Bluetooth speakers suffer from poor bass reproduction, the HD-Force from Treblab sounds deep and rich at any volume. The battery will last the length of any outdoor gathering, and the flashing lights on top add a party atmosphere in the evenings.\nThe HD-Force also has an IPX6 water rating, meaning it can survive an extended blast of high-pressure water or splashing. You won't want to drop it in the pool, but it can handle all the splashing or sprinklers you could want.\nWith a heavy-duty acrylic \"bulb\" cover, these lights are not only more durable than most, but the shape of the acrylic refracts the light in multiple directions for a beautiful look, from warm glows to vibrant colors. It has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Matter all in the mix for controlling these lights.\nThe lights get very bright and can be dimmed to the perfect level for any occasion. In addition to choosing any of the 16 million colors supported by these lights, you can also choose from preset themes to get the perfect ambiance for your patio.\nA hammock is a wonderful way to relax outdoors. But you either need two trees near each other that are strong enough to hold you and your hammock up or some stand to attach your hammock to. Trees aren't always exactly where you want them to be, and not all stands are easy to set up or durable enough to withstand being moved around. The Anymaka Portable Hammock Stand solves all of that.\nThe stand itself is extremely well-made and extremely easy to set up. Anymaka advertises that it takes three seconds to have it up and ready. I have to say that after a few tries, maybe it can be done in three seconds, but realistically, it will be a full five seconds to be set and adjusted. Attaching the hammock and cup holder takes an additional twenty seconds, and if you decide to put up the sunshade, you're looking at another fifteen seconds. I was able to go from unpacking to napping in under a minute.\nNot only is the process quick and easy, but the Anymaka hammock and stand are rated to withstand up to 550 lbs, so they're durable, too. Carrying the entire pack with you isn't going to ruin the relaxation you just experienced. After spending a whole two minutes taking the setup down, when packed into the carrying case, you're looking at just over 26 pounds to haul with you for your next adventure.\nHaving a solar generator with you when you go places is great. I recently took my family to the local lake, and by setting up the Ecoflow River and its solar panel, I could keep all our devices charged and even help out some of our lakeside neighbors. I could also power the pump for all the inflatables on the beach!\nThe power station is helpful even at home, where I have outlets near. I have it set up at the other end of the yard with lights and seats for people to escape the noise and keep their phones charged.\nIf you want a TV for your outdoor space but either don't want to spend the money on an outdoor TV or you already have a non-outdoor-rated television you want to use, then the Storm Shell is perfect. This enclosure has size options for TVs ranging from 32 to 75 inches. The durable plastic shell is mounted to the wall and comes with all the necessary hardware for a typical installation.\nThe Storm Shell also includes a power strip, cooling fan, articulating TV mount and locking clips for the front cover to keep your TV secure. Once inside, your TV is completely protected from the elements. This won't add to the television's temperature resistance, so keep that in mind for your location. Pricing ranges from $350 for the smallest base model to $1,000 for the Pro variant."

      "text": "Water\nWater is the most important survival need, and a rule of thumb is to drink 2 liters of water a day or more, especially if you are in very hot climates. If you're staying in a frontcountry campground, filling up a water jug is one of the first things to take care of when you arrive. You need water to drink, cook, and clean. In the backcountry, selecting a camping spot near a water source is important.\n- A collapsible water jug takes up less space, but you sacrifice a bit of durability.\n- A hard-sided jug can be more durable but takes up more space.\n- Bring refillable water bottles for personal use.\n- If you're bringing a cooler and carrying weight isn't an issue (frontcountry camping or backcountry camping in a boat or raft), freezing a few gallons of water in a plastic container can help keep your things cold for a bit. Then simply let it melt if you need more drinking or cooking water.\n- If you are in the backcountry, you will need to filter or purify the water you drink and prepare food with. Bring a water filter, water purification tablets, or boil your water.\nFood\nFood preparation and cleanup is part of the rhythm of life. Meal planning is important when you're camping, you'll want to make sure you brought enough because it may be a long way to the grocery store, especially in the backcountry! You'll also want to make sure the foods you brought are light enough to carry, if you're hiking, and easy to prepare. So what are some ideas of what to bring?\n- Focus on dry foods like rice and pasta. You'll save space and weight, plus you don't have to worry about keeping them cold. This also helps to reduce odor when cooking, which is an important consideration in bear country.\n- Food storage is important. You don't want that essential ingredient to roll under a car seat while you're rummaging through your things, so staying organized and keeping everything contained will help you out a lot. What's more, keeping things clean will prevent animals from getting into your food. If you're frontcountry camping, you might want to bring a cooler to store refrigerated items, and you'll also want to have a container for the rest of your food to keep things organized. Backcountry campers may need to use a waterproof bag to hang their food. If you're staying in bear country, you may need to make use of a food storage locker in the campground. Check with your park for specific food storage policies.\n- Pack foods that come in packages you can flatten, such as plastic bags or boxes, rather than jars and cans. That will save weight and space.\nShelter and Bedding\nCamping involves setting up a home away from your home. You will need shelter and bedding to rest your head.\n- Tent - Tents come in many sizes and shapes. Dome tents are popular because they offer the most interior space with the least amount of material, which saves weight if you're backpacking. If you're purchasing or renting a tent, keep in mind that a two person tent means there is room for two people to sleep inside, not two people and all their gear or pets. But in order to save in space and carrying weight, it's usually wise not to bring more tent than you need.\n- Hammocks - Some campers prefer to sleep in a covered waterproof hammock. This saves weight and space, but you may be out of luck hanging it if there are no trees around. Also, many parks do not allow you to tie ropes to trees. Please check park regulations before bringing a hammock.\n- Sleeping pad - Before you unroll your sleeping bag, you'll want to lay down a ground pad to provide some cushion under your body, but, more importantly, to keep moisture from accumulating beneath your body. This will rob your body of heat and you'll be cold. Foam pads are the most inexpensive solution, but they're bulky and not terribly cushioned. Air mattresses can be more comfortable but usually require an air compressor to inflate. Pads that are a hybrid foam and air offer the best of both worlds.\n- Sleeping bag - Sleeping bags come in various shapes, sizes, thicknesses, and materials. Use a sleeping bag that fits your personal comfort needs, size, and that matches the temperature and weather conditions for your location and time of year. An alternative to a sleeping bag is to use 2-3 blankets.\n- Pillows - They are a bulky luxury item, even if you're car camping. To save space, try bringing a pillowcase and fill it with some of your extra clothes.\n- Rain/sun shelter (optional) - Some car campers like to bring a pop-up shelter or dining fly that can protect their dining area from sun and rain, and for some models with screened walls, insects. Many frontcountry campgrounds do not allow you to tie ropes to trees, but if you can, you can use a rope and tarp to create a rain shelter or wind screen.\n- Tip - Before turning in for the night, change into dry clothes. You'll be much more comfortable!\n- Tip - If it's really cold outside, you might be tempted to stick your head into your sleeping bag to stay warm. While this might be comforting at first, breathing inside your sleeping bag introduces a lot of moisture, which will make you feel even colder in the long run.\nCooking Supplies\nIf you love cooking in camp, here are a few basic supplies you should consider bringing with you. You may want to be selective in the supplies you bring with you in the backcountry -- not everything will fit in your backpack or be light enough to carry. Many of the supplies below can be found in a backpacking version that is smaller and lighter.\n- Knife\n- Cutting board\n- Flipper or tongs\n- Cooking grate\n- Skillet Pot (1-2)\n- Camping stove (propane or white gas) + Fuel\n- Cups\n- Plates\n- Silverware\n- Tip - camping mess kits are handy; they can be used for personal cooking and eating. They typically assemble into a tidy package for compact storage, and contain a plate, skillet, small pot, and cup.\nCleaning Supplies\nCamping can be a dirty activity! You will want to keep a clean camp, even if you are outdoors.\n- Biodegradable soap\n- Scouring pad\n- Wash basin (3 basins, one for soap, one for rinse, one for sanitizing)\n- Paper towels or rags (Pro tip: Microfiber rags are very absorbent and lightweight)\nPersonal Hygiene Products\nJust because you're camping doesn't mean you have to be a caveman (unless you want to be). Personal hygiene is important.\n- Small bar of soap\n- Washcloth and small towel\n- Toothpaste, toothbrush, floss\n- Feminine hygiene products\nLast updated: July 2, 2024"

      "text": "This summer is predicted to be hotter than normal, so you may want to stock up on cooling clothing for when you're outdoors, sleeping or if you don't have air conditioning. Cooling clothing often has properties like temperature regulation and is made from specific cooling fabrics to help you stay sweat-free even when the sun is beating down. These items can also be helpful if you're working out in the heat.\nHow do cooling clothes work?\nYour body temperature going down is what gives you the sensation of feeling cool. For clothing to be effectively cooling, the fabric must have properties that work together with the body to help dissipate heat and promote airflow.\nAir permeability\nVentilated, flowy and breathable clothing allows for more air to pass through, and helps prevent heat or perspiration from being trapped against the skin. Less breathable fabrics like polyester or wool, on the other hand, can keep body heat confined between your body and the material and make you feel even more sweaty.\nMoisture-wicking\nPerspiration can be annoying but it's our body's way of regulating temperature. Moisture-wicking fabrics quickly absorb your body's sweat and then help it evaporate away. The secret is in hydrophilic and hydrophobic fibers. Hydrophilic fibers absorb sweat from the skin, evenly dispersing it across the fabric. Hydrophobic fibers keep out moisture and help fabric quickly dry.\nTemperature regulation\nThermoregulation is how humans maintain their body temperature, and there are four different ways to transfer heat. If the fabric of your clothes is effective at any of these four methods, it can help keep you cooler.\n- Thermal conductivity relates to the measure of how well materials transfer heat from one side to the other. Every material has a thermal conductivity, and the higher it is, the more cooling the material will be.\n- Thermal convection: Heat moves from the material with the highest temperature to the one with the lowest temp. This explains why you feel cooler when you put on silk or bamboo; your warm body heat transfers to the cooler fabric and this process helps you feel more cool.\n- Radiation: Solar radiation is a major contributor to feeling hot, especially if you have to be outdoors during high temperatures. Clothing that protects you from the sun and harmful UV rays will help you stay cooler, and maintain healthier skin.\n- Evaporation: The best cooling clothing allows sweat to evaporate and quickly dry, keeping you feeling cooler in hot temperatures. Fabrics with poor evaporation abilities can remain damp, making you feel sticky.\nCooling clothing recommendations\n- Weightless Poplin AC Pant: These are the ultimate day-to-night, multi-functional pants that work for everything from work attire, adventuring outdoors, and even a date. Unlike your traditional black clothing, these are made with coldblack fabric that offers UV protection and reflects the sun's rays better than your regular ol' T-shirt or pants. They're also super lightweight -- my partner wears them to work on 99-degree days and swears by them.\n- Forloh hoodie: It has UPF 50-plus protection and the brand's cooling Brrr Pro technology, which makes it \"hyper-wicking.\" The brand claims it has quick-drying abilities up to 300%. It's also infused with cooling minerals that help provide immediate cooling relief. It's very form fitting and lightweight, similar to an Under Armour long sleeve.\n- Livsn EcoTrek shorts: These are stretchy, lightweight and quick-drying shorts with ventilated mesh pockets and an eco-friendly construction. According to the brand, 70% of the material is made from recycled ocean buoys from Taiwan. I wore these during a paddle boarding session, jumped into the lake, and the water basically repelled off of them. They were completely dry within five minutes.\n- Arctic Cool crew neck T-shirt: A good affordable cooling clothing pick, this T-shirt has the brand's HydroFreeze X Technology that actively keeps you cool, along with enhanced moisture-wicking tech and UPF 50-plus protection. It also features antimicrobial and anti-odor properties.\n- Tommy John Second Skin pajama set: Taking the win as the best cooling pajamas, this set is ultra breathable, thin, lightweight and silky-smooth against the skin. The tank and boxer shorts are made from 49% viscose, 43% micromodal (a type of rayon) and 8% spandex.\nInnovation in cooling clothes\nEveryone knows what it feels like to be muggy and hot in their clothes. As each summer seems to break the previous year's high-temperature record, researchers are exploring different ways to produce effective cooling clothing.\nClothing and other garments can utilize non-electric cooling techniques such as ice, phase-change and radiation cooling. Early cooling clothing looked like actual ice vests that absorbed a person's body heat as ice melted, causing a physically cool feel. A lot of modern cooling clothing, like those from LifeLabs, has infrared heat-blocking abilities that offer protection from the sun's harmful rays.\nBut experts are even working out the kinks on smart cooling clothing powered by electricity. As we continue to experience high temperatures, it's fair to expect more improvements and development to come from cooling garments.\nThe best fabrics for cooling clothing\nCotton\nCotton is a natural fiber that's breathable, lightweight and widely accessible. Air easily passes through cotton fabric, allowing you to feel breezy and cool. It's best for dry heat, since it's absorbent but not moisture-wicking.\nBamboo\nBamboo is a premium natural fiber that's good at wicking away moisture. It's also even more breathable than cotton because of the \"micro gaps\" within bamboo fabric that promotes increased airflow.\nSilk\nSilk is a thermoregulator that helps you keep a comfortable body temperature. It's ultra-lightweight, soft and tends to come in flowy silhouettes.\nRayon\nSourced from processed wood pulp, rayon is made up of thin fibers that make it feel light and breathable. It doesn't trap heat between the fabric and your body, allowing sweat to evaporate and heat to dissipate.\nViscose\nViscose is a type of rayon that's considered an artificial silk. As such, it's a smooth, highly absorbent and soft fabric that's great for cooling clothing.\nLinen\nLinen is derived from the flax plant and is a well-known fabric for summer because of its lightweight and breathable feel. It has a loose weave, allowing air to easily pass through.\nThe worst fabrics for cooling clothing\nPolyester and nylon\nPolyester and nylon are made from petroleum, essentially making them a type of plastic. They retain heat and even bad odor, and they don't absorb moisture. This means your sweat sits on their surface, trapped between your skin and the fabric.\nDenim\nWe all love our jeans, but they aren't the best clothes for hot weather. The material is heavy, not very breathable and can retain moisture. If you have to wear jeans, try a looser fit and a light wash to reflect the sun.\nLeather\nMade from thick cowhide, leather is a good insulator during the winter. It's also often dyed black, a color that absorbs heat. Unless you want to be real warm, avoid leather jackets in the summer."

It is a natural stress buster,\u201d explained Susan Albers, PsyD, psychologist for Cleveland Clinic.\nDr. Albers said the sights, sounds and smells of nature can have a calming effect and can help you clear your mind.\nBy being present in the moment, you are practicing what\u2019s called \"mindfulness.\"\nShe said there are physical health benefits too.\nFor example, if you go on a hike in the woods, not only are you getting fresh air, but you\u2019re getting some exercise in too.\nAnd that in turn can improve your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\nPlus, exposure to the sun gives you vitamin D.\n\u201cIf you are looking for a family friendly activity that is free and beneficial to everyone, just step outside,\u201d said Dr. Albers. \u201cYou can go for a walk, pack a picnic, go for a bike ride. This is a wonderful investment in the connections in your family, physical exercise, and also a great deal of memories and enjoyment.\u201d\nShe advises that if you are having a hard time managing your stress and nothing seems to be helping, you should speak with a mental health professional.\nCleveland Clinic is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education. Located in Cleveland, Ohio, it was founded in 1921 by four renowned physicians with a vision of providing outstanding patient care based upon the principles of cooperation, compassion and innovation. Cleveland Clinic has pioneered many medical breakthroughs, including coronary artery bypass surgery and the first face transplant in the United States. Cleveland Clinic is consistently recognized in the U.S. and throughout the world for its expertise and care. Among Cleveland Clinic\u2019s 82,600 employees worldwide are more than 5,786 salaried physicians and researchers, and 20,700 registered nurses and advanced practice providers, representing 140 medical specialties and subspecialties. Cleveland Clinic is a 6,728-bed health system that includes a 173-acre main campus near downtown Cleveland, 23 hospitals, 280 outpatient facilities, including locations in northeast Ohio; Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada; Toronto, Canada; Abu Dhabi, UAE; and London, England. In 2024, there were 15.7 million outpatient encounters, 333,000 hospital admissions and observations, and 320,000 surgeries and procedures throughout Cleveland Clinic\u2019s health system.

      "text": "Trying new hobbies or revisiting activities you once loved is an excellent way to boost your mental wellness, and the summer is the perfect time to expand your horizons and give a new hobby a chance. Whether you're looking for an activity to do as a family while the kids are on summer break, or something to give yourself a bit of \"me time,\" we've found plenty of hobbies worth exploring this season.\nHobbies aren't a replacement for professional help, but they do offer mental health benefits such as improved mood, a sense of accomplishment and a redirection for negative thoughts. For inspiration, we outlined some great hobbies you can start now to improve your happiness.\nWhy are hobbies good for mental health?\nHobbies make you feel good. They help you relax and unwind from your day, with the added benefit of lowering your stress levels and blood pressure. Hobbies can help ease existing depression symptoms and decrease your risk of developing depression by up to 30%.\nWays that hobbies improve your mental health:\n- Improve neuroplasticity: According to StatPearls, neuroplasticity describes our brain's ability to adapt its activity and structure by forming and using new synaptic connections. You can think of your brain as a big map -- there are many ways to get to your destination, and sometimes you have to change which way you're going. Hobbies and habits require you to form new neural pathways, which provide new reference points for the brain to recognize.\n- Reduce stress: Many people use hobbies to decompress from stressful days. When you do something you like, you're allowing your body to relax and cortisol levels to drop, which lowers your heart rate and blood pressure while your mood increases.\n- Help self-esteem: Everyone likes to complete things. It brings a self of accomplishment that feels great. As you master your hobby more and more, your confidence and self-esteem build.\nEveryone is busy. It's nearly impossible not to feel like you're bouncing from one thing to the next. But when you feel like you don't have time to dedicate to your hobbies, remember, they're good for you.\nWhich hobbies are the best for boosting mental health?\nThere is no one reigning champ of hobbies for mental health. We're all different, so we will choose different things to help us relax. What works for you may not yield the same results for someone else. It's about finding the right hobby that you find value in.\nHere are some common options people use to elevate their mental health and why it works.\n1. Journaling\nRegularly journaling is a powerful tool that allows you to work through feelings and reflect on events you experience. It's often recommended for those with anxiety, depression and PTSD. You don't have to write a novel; research has shown that journaling for as little as fifteen minutes daily can help reduce anxiety.\nRead more: iOS 17.2: What You Should Know About Apple's Journal App\nYou don't have to search to solve a problem while journaling. It's also something you can do just for fun. The benefits come either way. Common types of journaling include reflective journaling -- which involves writing about your day and what you thought about it -- and gratitude journaling.\nNo matter what type of journaling you choose, it's a great hobby that allows you to highlight your wins and challenge negative thoughts and feelings.\n2. Cooking\nEveryone knows that eating can be therapeutic. But so can cooking. Besides the benefits that can affect your physical health, like being in control of the ingredients, there are several reasons why cooking is one of the best hobbies for mental health. It offers a level of emotional relief that other hobbies may not.\nAccording to a study published in Frontiers in Psychology, cooking can help you relax and boost your happiness. It's not hard to see why. With each dish, you feel more self-reliant and confident, not to mention the social connections you can make when serving it to others. And for the record, yes, baking counts too.\n3. Spending time in nature\nHobbies that involve going outside -- like hiking or gardening -- can be great for mental health. Studies show that being in sunlight can help boost the body's serotonin production. Serotonin is the naturally occurring neurotransmitter that plays a part in regulating our moods, according to Harvard Health Publishing. It's called the \"feel-good\" chemical for a reason. When our body produces the right amount of serotonin, we feel happy and calm. Lower levels of serotonin are associated with mood disorders like depression.\nSo if you're someone who goes outside, you're helping your body combat depression without even knowing it. Being outside in nature can also reduce stress and lower your heart rate.\n4. Art\nWhen I say art, I'm talking about everything creative you can think of -- painting, drawing, sculpting, embroidery and woodworking. The list goes on. No matter where your hobbies fall in the lineup, you get tangible mental health benefits from them.\nArt lets you express your feelings and channel your creativity. You may also use it as a way to work through things that are tough to talk about. It's a tactic used often in art therapy sessions.\nArt may also relieve stress and improve self-confidence. You do not need to be \"good\" at painting to do it. There is no bar to meet for quality. The only thing that matters is that you enjoy what you're doing.\n5. Music\nYou get a sense of accomplishment and enjoyment from playing an instrument. Making something feels good, and your body responds to those positive feelings. But if you're not musically inclined, don't worry; listening to music also derives similar benefits by lowering stress and anxiety levels. It also can boost your mood.\n6. Reading\nReading is the ultimate form of escapism. You can jump into a whole new world and live a thousand different lives -- or as many books as you can read. It also happens to be a great hobby if you have anxiety. Reading can help distract you from negative or intrusive thinking you may be experiencing. It also can help lower your heart rate and help you relax.\nYou'll get the same benefits from listening to books too. So if you can't carve out the time to read, try listening while walking your dog or cleaning your house.\n7. Strategy games\nStrategy games and puzzles -- like chess, crosswords and sudoku -- are other hobbies that are good for your mental health. Studies have found that strategy games improve brain functioning, problem-solving skills and memory. Puzzle games also can help those with ADHD hone their concentration.\nGiven their ability to strengthen cognition, strategy games and puzzles may also reduce the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's in older adults. However, experts are divided on whether they are truly a preventative measure or if they help cope with the disease. More research is needed to determine strategy games' role in age-related cognitive decline.\n8. Exercise\nWhether you work out alone or participate in team sports, exercise is one of the best hobbies to have -- both physically and mentally. When we exercise, our brains flood with endorphins that boost mood, per Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nExercise is an outlet to let out frustrations and navigate emotions. By exercising, you're lowering your risk for anxiety and depression. Team sports give you the extra edge by filling up your social meter while moving your body."

      "url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/garmins-new-handheld-gps-devices-offer-boosted-battery-life-and-improved-positional-accuracy/",
      "text": "Garmin on Tuesday announced new additions to its lineup of GPS handhelds in the form of the GPSMap 67 Series and the eTrex SE. The new outdoor navigation devices offer longer battery life than their predecessors as well as improved positional accuracy for added peace of mind when out on the trails.\nWith prices from $500, GPSMap 67 and GPSMap 67i are an upgrade to the previous-gen GPSMap 66 Series. A headline improvement over the older devices is a battery life bump to up to 180 hours in standard mode and up to 840 hours in expedition mode. That's up from a maximum of 450 hours in the GPSMap 66i, a boon whether you simply want to charge the device less frequently between hikes or plan to take it on days-long expeditions.\nBoth 67 Series models offer a 3-inch color display that's designed to be readable in sunlight. Access to preloaded TopoActive mapping from Garmin is included and you can use the display to view satellite imagery. The devices also feature multiband GNSS support that will help with coverage in challenging areas, a three-axis compass and barometric altimeter. GPSMap 67 Series devices are compatible with Garmin's $50 per year premium mapping subscription, Outdoor Maps Plus, which had previously only been available with pricier Montana 700 handhelds. The differentiating feature of the $600 GPSMap 67i is its built-in InReach technology that enables SOS functionality as well as two-way messaging and location tracking via the global Iridium satellite network.\nIf $500 and up is steep for the limited off-road adventures you partake in, the eTrex SE is a more affordable pick at $150. It has multi-GNSS, as well as a 2.2-inch high-contrast display, digital compass and rugged build that is design to withstand the outdoor elements so you can use it to view waypoints and track your location as you explore. Rather than being rechargeable, it is powered by two AA batteries, which should offer around a week of battery life. All three of the new devices can be paired with the Garmin Explore app for active weather reports and for planning out routes ahead of time."

      "text": "It's finally summertime. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping and campsites around the country are calling your name. You can practically hear the campfire crackling away as you get ready to rest in your tent among the trees, looking up at the stars. It sounds peaceful, doesn't it? Maybe for some, but unfortunately, it's not the case for me.\nI'm terrible at sleeping outside -- always have been. Being a bigger guy, sleeping pads and air mattresses are constantly deflating underneath me throughout the course of the night, causing me to wake up on the hard ground. I'd get an RV, but what kind of online mattress reviewer has that kind of money? Up until recently, I had accepted my fate, doomed to endure the harsh sleeping surface of the forest floor. But then, I found the solution -- Haven.\nAfter stumbling across these products online, I quickly reached out to the brand, and the good folks at Haven sent me their Haven Safari tent to test out. In this review, I'll cover what I like about it, what I don't and who I think it's ideal for.\nWhat are Haven Tents?\nHaven tents are basically suspended sleeping surfaces. Like an average outdoor hammock, you get the benefits of being off the ground, with the added advantages of a sleeping pad and an enclosed tent design. It's pretty much an all-in-one camping packing -- it's your hammock, sleeping pad and tent.\nThere are three main Haven tents to choose from on the brand's website. The Haven Tent is their most affordable, bare-bones tent that's designed to be lightweight and packed small. Then there's the Haven XL tent which is the brand's most popular, mid-tier option, designed to be a bit more durable and supportive for bigger people. And lastly, you have the Haven Safari tent, which is the most premium and heavy-duty option, and also the model we tested for this review.\nThe design elements of the Haven Safari Tent:\n- Durable Hammock Body with Bug Net\n- Insulated Air Mattress (Optional with upgrades)\n- Spreader Bars (2x)\n- Waterproof Rainfly\n- Tree Straps (2x 6ft)\n- Guy Lines (4x)\n- Stakes (4x)\n- Carabiners (2x)\n- Bunting Banner\n- Welcome Mat\nVideo: Haven Safari review\nWatch me and our sleep experts review the Haven Safari.\nSetting up the Haven Safari\nOnce ordered, the Haven Safari arrived at our office inside of a box and it also shipped for completely free. The box it came in was a lot smaller than the standard online mattress, so it was a nice change of pace for us in terms of the whole unboxing process.\nUpon its arrival, we decided to take it to a local park to unbox the tent and set it up. We found a nice grassy spot with some trees that looked perfect, opened the box and began to remove its contents one by one. All of the tent's design elements were nicely packaged and many could fit easily into a pack, which was also provided.\nHowever, as we began the setup process we quickly realized that our location wasn't as perfect as we thought. The tree straps were a lot shorter than we anticipated, and we weren't able to wrap all the way around our trees. So, we packed everything up and headed to a different spot. The trees in the second spot proved to be too far apart, and then it took two more attempts in different locations before we were successfully able to set it up -- needless to say, the setup was a bit tricky at first.\nWhen it was finally hanging in our fourth set of trees, it was finally time to test it out. Usually, there's a bit of suspicion if a newly constructed hammock will hold your weight, but as I got in the Haven Safari, it proved to be plenty durable. I'm a bigger guy, and I felt plenty of support once I applied my full weight to it.\nThe sleeping pad also felt really nice. You can really tell it's a quality, insulated air mattress made of a durable material. The surrounding bug net is also very breathable and allows for a ton of airflow -- great news for hot sleepers. After testing it out, I was excited to take it camping and spend a night in it.\nMy experience with the Haven Safari\nI took this on a camping trip recently and used it for two nights in total. I'm happy to report that I got the most restful sleep that I've ever experienced while camping. The Haven Safari truly is a game changer for sleeping outside -- especially if you hate sleeping on the ground like me.\nLuckily, my campsite had some decently sized trees that were the right distance apart for the Haven Safari's setup. This time, I draped the rainfly over the shell to test out this component of the tent. This would've provided a lot of waterproof protection if it was raining, but since it was sunny out, it really only made the tent warm up during the day.\nAt night, however, the rainfly offered the perfect amount of insulation for sleeping comfortably. Without it, I think I would've been very cold, even with a sleeping bag and a bunch of blankets. The tent itself is so comfortable to sleep in. The sleeping pad is really adjustable firmness-wise, and the spreader bars offer a nice amount of sleeping space. I'll be honest, the first night took some getting used to, but on the second night, I slept like a baby -- since it's a hammock, it even rocks you to sleep, how fitting.\nOne of the main design advantages of Haven tents, is that they're able to accommodate any sleeping preference: back, side, stomach and combination sleepers. Being a combination sleeper, I was sure to try out every sleeping position in the Haven Safari, and I definitely have some thoughts on this subject.\nBased on my experience, I would say the tent is most accommodating for back and side sleepers. I personally found stomach sleeping to be a little uncomfortable in the Haven Safari. My back just bowed a tinge more than I'd prefer. Since there's a strap underneath the head section of the tent that you can adjust to offer more or less support, I'd like to see another one running under the middle of the tent to provide more of an adjustable Zoned Support feature for stomach sleeping.\nDrawbacks of the Haven Safari to be aware of\nThis leads me nicely to the main drawbacks of the Haven Safari tent. While I really enjoyed this product, there are some things that I didn't really like about it and other things that I could see Haven improving upon design-wise.\nEnvironment: By default, the tree straps that come with Haven tents are each 6ft in length. While that may sound long enough, we actually found it to be rather limiting, especially if the trees have wide trunks or are far apart. Luckily, Haven as a brand offers a product called, \"Whoopie Slings.\" These are rope extensions that you can attach to the tree straps to make the tent's setup more versatile. Even though they're sold separately, I recommend adding them to your cart upon checkout -- you'll run into a lot fewer issues than we did.\nCouples: Realistically, this sleeping hammock is only able to accommodate one person at a time. The Haven Safari has a weight limit of around 350 pounds, so if you and your partner are on the smaller side you might be able to get by in it -- just get ready to cuddle. While it's really durable and can support a lot of weight, there's not enough width to accommodate two people at once. Bad news for couples who are interested, but if you're solo, go for it.\nMotion: Keep in mind that while it's technically a bed, it's also technically still a hammock. This means that when you move around in it, your motion will cause the Haven tents to swing slightly. On one hand, this could provide a nice \"rock you to sleep\" motion, and on the other, it could give you motion sickness. I personally found the rocking motion to be soothing, but other team members found it to be dizzying. If you get motion sickness easily, you might prefer a more stationary sleep setup.\nHaven Tent pricing\n| Model | Weight & Dimensions | Price |\n|---|---|---|\n| Haven Tent | 6 lbs 3 oz 78x24 inches | $313 |\n| Haven XL | 7 lbs 10 oz 80x30 inches | $335 |\n| Haven Safari | 12 lbs 6 oz 80x30 inches | $355 |\nConsidering that these are the first sleeping hammocks of their kind, made from high-quality and durable materials, I think they're of great value. This pricing is comparable to the REI Half Dome tent, and here you're getting a hammock and a sleeping pad along with a tent.\nIs the Haven Safari worth it?\nDepending on your exact needs and specifications for camping, the Haven Safari could be right for you. I'd say it's a great option for solo campers who want more of a comfortable, suspended sleep setup that's super durable. Also, if you're backpacking through a forested area and want something that's super packable and lightweight, the flagship Haven Tent might be more suitable for your needs. All in all, this product provided a safe haven for my nightly camping experience.\nYou should try the Haven Safari if:\n- You'd prefer a suspended sleeping setup\n- You sleep solo, without a partner\n- You're a primary back or side sleeper\n- You're camping in a heavily forested area\nYou shouldn't try the Haven Safari if:\n- You'd prefer a more traditional, grounded, sleep setup\n- You sleep with a partner while camping\n- You're a primary stomach sleeper\n- You're camping in an area sparse of trees"

      "text": "Don't feel bad if you're one of the unfortunate people out there who have woken up drenched in sweat. It happens more than you think. I've been there myself: tossing and turning, peeling off layers and flipping my mountain of pillows over to the cool side to try and sleep better. It feels like it will work, too, but then you're up an hour later, soaked with sweat, clammy and uncomfortable. It not only means more washing, but night sweats can ruin your sleep schedule.\nGetting 8 hours of sleep is meant to leave you refreshed and not feeling like you ran a marathon. If you often wake up with night sweats, you know how exhausting that can be. After some trial and error, I identified the triggers and found ways to stop them. If you want to wake up dry and comfortable, here\u2019s what might be causing your night sweats and how to cool down for good.\nDon't get too concerned if you're like me and wake up too hot. There are plenty of ways to stay cool at night. I'll highlight and explore the seven leading causes of night sweats and the most effective way to tackle them to ensure you get a good night's sleep.\nRead on to find out more about better sleep, including the best tools to ensure it, like mattresses and pillows.\nHow to stop sweating while sleeping\nTara Youngblood, a sleep expert and founder of Chili Technology (appropriately, a manufacturer of temperature-controlled bed accessories), says that ending night sweats for good is about attacking the root cause. Here, she offers tips for four of the most common causes of night sweats.\n1. Take a second look at your mattress\n\"Your body is an engine,\" Youngblood says. \"It is constantly giving off heat while you sleep, [and] there are some materials that actually increase your body temperature while you sleep.\" She points to foam as a common culprit, noting that some foam mattresses can retain and reflect heat back to you, causing you to sweat more.\n2. Consider your blankets and comforters, too\n\"Make sure your covers aren't working against you,\" Youngblood says. \"Your blankets could be restricting you from cooling off by blocking out the cool air your fan or AC is bringing.\"\nYoungblood says that when you sleep under covers, you create a \"cave\" for your body to sleep in, and it's important to make sure that your cave stays cold with cooling blankets or airy materials like linen and cotton.\n3. Adjust the temperature in your room\nMake sure you lower the temperature in the bedroom before going to sleep. This activates your body to cool down naturally. If your room stays the same temperature all day, your body becomes accustomed to the temperature and will not lower in your sleep. If you cannot lower the temperature of your room, take a cool or cold shower before jumping into bed.\nRead more: Lower Your Electric, Gas and Water Bills: 8 Hacks That Actually Work\n4. Refrain from alcohol or heavy meals before bed\nYoungblood says alcohol and dense food before bed can also crank up your body heat at night. Try to avoid both a few hours before bed to encourage your core body temperature to lower, which will reduce sweating during sleep. If you need to eat a meal before bed or have a late-night snack, learn about the best foods for better sleep.\nWhat causes night sweats? Here are 7 potential reasons\nThe easy answer would be that your AC isn't set low enough, but people who sweat in their sleep no matter the temperature know it's not that simple.\nWhen you feel like you've tried everything -- from frigid AC temps and fans on full blast to \"cooling sheets\" and sleeping in the nude -- but nothing has worked, you may want to give up and accept daily sheet-changing as your destiny.\nNot so fast: The first step to solving any health-related condition is understanding the cause. From there, you can work with a health professional or try home remedies to eliminate the symptom.\nNight sweats can come about for a ton of reasons. Here are some of the most common.\n1. Your bedding\nYour sleep setup might honestly be the problem. Your sheets, mattress pad, pillows and mattress itself may be causing you to sweat at night. Look into cooling or temperature-regulating sheets -- best-case scenario is you solve your night sweats; worst-case scenario is you get some nice new sheets.\n2. Hormonal changes\nWhen your hormone levels fluctuate wildly or go through a period of change, you might sweat at night. A common example is women going through menopause. One of the unpleasant symptoms of menopause is night sweats, and it's mainly due to the decreasing levels of estrogen in a woman's body. Pregnancy and menstrual cycles may also influence your body's core temperature at night. For men, low testosterone might contribute.\n3. Medications\nSome prescription medications may cause you to sweat at night. If you're on any prescriptions, ask your doctor if night sweats are a side effect.\n4. Medical conditions\nLikewise, many medical conditions can cause night sweats. According to Mayo Clinic, that includes hyperthyroidism, anxiety disorders, autoimmune disorders, sleep apnea, drug addictions, neurological conditions and more. Viral infections can also cause night sweats due to a fever.\n5. Alcohol and diet\nDrinking alcohol before bed can cause you to sweat at night because it affects your nervous system functioning and core body temperature. While there's little evidence to suggest that food alone can cause night sweats, it's thought that certain types of food, especially spicy and high-fat foods, can make preexisting night sweats worse.\n6. Hyperhidrosis\nSince we're talking about sweat, hyperhidrosis -- excessive sweating -- deserves a special mention. If you tend to sweat excessively during the day and at night, you may want to talk to your doctor about this condition and whether you could have it.\n7. Stress\nHigh levels of stress can manifest as physical symptoms, including night sweats. Stress-induced night sweats may be accompanied by scary nightmares or stressful dreams, rapid breathing, elevated heart rate and trouble falling asleep because of worries or anxiety.\nMore sleep tips\n- Buying a New Mattress: 7 Questions to Ask Before You Shop\n- Try This Sleep Trick I Discovered Years Ago.

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2025Flavor Name: WatermelonSize: 30 CountVerified PurchaseI\u2019ve tried a lot of electrolyte powders, but LMNT is on a whole different level. Whether I\u2019m working out, sweating through a long shift, or just trying to stay energized and focused, LMNT delivers every single time.\nPros:\n\u2022 Perfect Electrolyte Balance: It has just what I need\u20141000mg sodium, 200mg potassium, 60mg magnesium\u2014without any sugar or fillers. No crash, no bloating, just clean hydration.\n\u2022 Zero Sugar, Zero Junk: No artificial flavors, coloring, or sweeteners. Just pure function. And somehow, it still tastes great!\n\u2022 Boosts Energy & Focus: I drink one before the gym or during long work shifts, and I feel noticeably more alert and less drained.\n\u2022 Great for Low-Carb/Keto: If you\u2019re doing keto or intermittent fasting, LMNT is a lifesaver for preventing headaches, fatigue, and electrolyte imbalances.\n\u2022 Flavors are \ud83d\udd25: Citrus Salt, Watermelon Salt, and Raspberry Salt are my personal faves. Salty-sweet perfection once you get used to the taste.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2025Flavor Name: Lemonade SaltSize: 18 CountVerified PurchaseI\u2019ve tried nearly every LMNT flavor, and lemonade is hands-down the winner for me. The taste is perfectly balanced\u2014bright, tangy, and refreshing without being overly sweet. It actually tastes like real lemonade, but with that LMNT clean, salty edge that keeps you hydrated and energized.\nI love that it\u2019s zero sugar, packed with electrolytes, and keeps me feeling good through workouts, hot days, and even when I\u2019m just trying to stay on top of my water intake. It mixes instantly, no clumps, and I look forward to drinking it every single time.\nIf you\u2019re on the fence about LMNT or overwhelmed by all the flavors\u2014start with lemonade. You\u2019ll probably end up like me, ordering it in bulk so you never run out.\nFinal Verdict: Refreshing, hydrating, and addictive in the best way possible. My go-to, forever. \ud83e\udd47\ud83c\udf4b\ud83d\udca7\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2025Flavor Name: Lemonade SaltSize: 18 CountVerified PurchaseI\u2019ve been using LMNT Zero\u2011Sugar Lemonade Electrolytes daily for about two weeks\u2014and they\u2019ve quickly become my go-to hydration solution, especially during workouts and busy mornings.\nHydration Powerhouse: Each stick delivers 1000 mg sodium, 200 mg potassium, and 60 mg magnesium\u2014significantly more than typical sports drinks, so you feel hydrated long after drinking it\nTiendamia\n+6\nAmazon\n+6\nCamelCamelCamel\n+6\n.\nZero Sugar, Clean Formula: No sugar or artificial sweeteners here\u2014just effective salts and minerals. Ideal for anyone keto, low-carb, or sugar-conscious\nAmazon\nUbuy Netherlands\n.\nLemonade Flavor: Refreshing and not overpowering. I prefer it with about 24 oz water to balance the saltiness and find that perfect zing without it tasting like concentrate.\nVersatile Use: I add packets to water before workouts, on long hikes, and even mix one into tea or sparkling water. Always dissolves well, no gritty bits.\nNoticeable Benefits: Since adding LMNT to my routine, I\u2019ve had no cramps, better mental clarity, and more energy\u2014even mid-afternoon slump couldn\u2019t bring me down.\nCouple minor notes:\nA few others noted the intense salt level\u2014makes sense given the clinical sodium dose. Easy fix: just adjust your water ratio to suit your taste.\nPrice per serving is higher than generic powders\u2014but for me, the clean formulation and reliability are worth it.\n\u2705 Would I recommend it? Without hesitation. If you're demanding real electrolytes without sugar, and appreciate something that actually works, LMNT is clearly a step above. Especially great for training days, fasting, or demanding outdoor activity.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2025Flavor Name: Raspberry SaltSize: 30 CountVerified PurchasePros: Intense Flavor, Dissolves Easily\nCons: VERY Salty, More Expensive\nBeware of LMNT powders being sold from private sellers on other sites. Bought a box from W*lmart and it was fake, expired, or damaged. Had no flavor and seemed to just be baking soda.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2025Flavor Name: Citrus SaltSize: 30 CountVerified PurchaseI\u2019ve purchased these over 10 times now\u2014and for good reason! These LMNT electrolyte packets have become a daily essential. They\u2019re incredibly helpful for staying hydrated, especially during intense workouts or hot summer days. I\u2019ve noticed a huge difference with fewer headaches and muscle cramps thanks to the magnesium and potassium. The flavor is bold and refreshing, and it mixes easily with just a few shakes in my water bottle. Yes, they\u2019re a bit pricey, but the quality and benefits make them 100% worth it for me. I won\u2019t go without them!\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2025Flavor Name: WatermelonSize: 30 CountVerified PurchaseExcellent Electrolyte Support Without the Sugar\nLMNT has been a total game-changer for me. It delivers the perfect balance of sodium, magnesium, and potassium without any sugar, fillers, or artificial ingredients. I use it during workouts, hot days, and when fasting\u2014it keeps me hydrated and feeling strong.\nThe flavors are salty (as expected), but refreshing. Watermelon Salt is my go-to. If you\u2019re new to LMNT, the taste might surprise you at first, but it\u2019s worth it for how great you will feel! I would recommend starting with half the pack if your just getting started .\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2025Flavor Name: Lemonade SaltSize: 18 CountVerified PurchaseHands down LMNT is the best electrolyte drink their lemonade is the perfect taste with amazing taste of salt. Dissolves easy. No sugar, no bad aftertaste, no upset stomach after drinking this like I\u2019ve had with other brands. Worth buying!\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2025Flavor Name: Mango ChiliSize: 30 CountVerified PurchaseIf you enjoy drinks like a mangolada or other tropical treats with a spicy twist, LMNT\u2019s Mango Chili flavor is a must-try. It\u2019s absolutely delicious\u2014bold mango flavor with a zesty chili kick that makes it both refreshing and invigorating.\nI love that there are no added sugars, which is rare for something that tastes this good. It satisfies my craving for something flavorful without all the junk. The spice might be strong for some, but I find it energizing, especially during a workout or on a hot day.\nHighly recommend if you like your hydration with a little attitude!\nTop reviews from other countries\n- Amazon CustomerReviewed in Singapore on October 21, 2024\n5.0 out of 5 stars Great Product\nFlavor Name: Raw UnflavoredSize: 30 CountVerified PurchaseThis is the best hydrating without calories on the market\n- ReneeReviewed in Australia on October 21, 2024\n5.0 out of 5 stars Sugarless Zesty pick-me up!\nFlavor Name: Raspberry SaltSize: 30 CountVerified PurchaseI like the subtle raspberry flavour that I purchased and I tend to use it as quite a salty concentrate in my 750ml water bottle which took a little to get used too. On days when I am physically working hard in the sun or exercising with cardio work outs, I have found it takes care of any dehydration issues. I will definitely be buying again as it complements my Keto or Carnivore lifestyle.\n- applecartReviewed in the United Kingdom on March 12, 2025\n5.0 out of 5 stars excellent product\nFlavor Name: WatermelonSize: 30 CountVerified Purchaseexcellent product\n- Amazon CustomerReviewed in Canada on July 19, 2025\n5.0 out of 5 stars Great Hydration.\nFlavor Name: Raspberry SaltSize: 30 CountVerified PurchaseThis is a great hydrator.

It held its charge the whole time and kept me cool and comfortable. Lightweight, hands-free, and surprisingly powerful\u2014definitely worth it for anyone spending time outdoors in the heat.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2025Color: BlueVerified PurchaseI was a little skeptical, but we were going to Greece for vacation and I do NOT do well in hot weather, so we bought several items to have just in case. This was a real good find though!\nBest Uses:\nThis is most beneficial in stuffy, crowded places with not much fresh air. I used it on ferries, busses, and planes where it's uncomfortably warm and/or crowded. This really helped make uncomfortable places much more pleasant. In my opinion, motion sickness is just compounded with heat, and there were a few situations where others around me were getting sick but I was feeling surprisingly fine.\nNot as Good For:\nIt was windy on our vacation, so it's not particularly useful when we were walking around in the hot sun because we already had a breeze.\nMost of the time I had it on low and it was plenty strong enough. There IS noise, but it didn't impede my hearing. It's hands free and it's also stronger than the handheld fans a few people in my group had, so it was doubly beneficial.\nSlight design flaw: on several occasions it turned itself on in my purse because the on button isn't hidden and can be pressed accidentally by other things in my bag. I would just kind of hear my purse humming and realize it was on.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2025Color: BlackVerified PurchaseI never thought a wearable fan would make such a difference, but after using a neck fan during hot summer days, I\u2019m completely sold. These hands-free fans are lightweight, rechargeable, and surprisingly powerful. They sit comfortably around your neck and blow a steady breeze upward, keeping your face and neck cool. It is perfect for outdoor walks, yard work, sporting events, or even just lounging around.\nThe battery life is decent (usually lasting 4 to 8 hours, depending on the speed setting), and most models are USB rechargeable. I love that they\u2019re quiet enough not to be disruptive, but still effective. Some versions even come with adjustable fan heads or aroma pads for essential oils, which is a nice bonus!\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2025Color: BlackVerified PurchaseThis is a great product. Kept me very cool all day at a baseball field in hot summer weather. Everyone wanted a turn to wear it because it really did help keep cool. I'll be buying additional for my family as gifts since they were all impressed by it. Seems to be good quality. The battery surprisingly lasted 6 hours being on the whole time.\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2025Color: BlueVerified PurchaseThis neck fan is perfection. I bought 2 to use on my upcoming trip to NYC (we went on their hottest days) and they worked so great.\nVery light weight but blasted air all around my neck and hairline. The 3 settings are nice but kept it at the highest setting when outside.\nThe fan is quiet so you can still hear conversations and not have to turn off. The battery life is great (almost 8hrs straight at highest setting).\nAn absolute must for outdoor activities like walking, biking, etc.\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2025Color: GreenVerified PurchaseNot accurate pictures to what you receive.

      "text": "Cowboy camping is a good way to make your backpacking trips more efficient while falling asleep to a view of the moon and stars. If the forecast is good, you can roll out a foam pad and a sleeping bag/quilt and camp in the open. In the morning there will be no tent to pack up and you\u2019ll be on the trail in no time. There are numerous experiential benefits to cowboy camping too, including a deeper degree of wilderness immersion. All that said, cowboy camping can be psychologically challenging for some. There is an intense feeling of vulnerability that comes from being completely exposed to the surrounding desert, forest, mountains, or sky. But after a few nights out, most people acclimate to the experience.\nTime Savings\nOne of the main benefits of cowboy camping is the time saved by not setting up a shelter. If you are putting in the miles and walking into camp after dark each night, it\u2019s nice to just unroll a foam pad on the dirt and crawl into your sleeping bag. Of course, this works best when you know it\u2019s not likely to rain.\nExperiential Aspect\nThe other and arguably main benefit of cowboy camping is experiential. Cowboy camping allows you to stargaze before falling asleep. I think most hikers would agree that seeing the stars is one of the most wonderful things about backpacking. Many of us live in cities where light pollution limits us to only the moon and occasionally Venus or Jupiter. Falling asleep with the milky way above you is a near-primordial ritual experience. Whenever I get to do this I feel rejuvenated, almost like rediscovering an essential part of myself I\u2019d forgotten about.\nPsychological Element\nCowboy camping can be either psychologically beneficial or detrimental depending on one\u2019s state of mind at the outset. Let me explain. Cowboy camping can be challenging for some of us who are afraid of animals, snakes, scorpions, and other creepy crawlers.\nThere is a certain feeling of vulnerability to cowboy camping which is both part of its appeal and partly what makes it so unsettling. But also, isn\u2019t it some degree of vulnerability that drives us to go backpacking anyway? Cowboy camping allows us to experience a greater degree of vulnerability than traditional tent camping. It\u2019s up to you whether you want to lean into this vulnerability and see how it feels, or just prioritize a good night\u2019s rest.\nWhile it doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d that way, a tent actually provides very little protection from bears, mountain lions, raccoons, and marmots when it comes right down to it. It\u2019s really only there for weather protection. Once you internalize this, camping without a tent or shelter becomes a little less intimidating.\nRecommended Cowboy Camping Gear\nGroundsheet\nIf you\u2019re carrying an inflatable pad, cowboy camping necessitates the use of some sort of groundsheet. In most situations, a thin sheet of ultralight polycryo plastic should suffice. A big piece of polycryo only weighs a few ounces but is as tough as nails.\nFoam Pad\nIf you are using foam, you may not need a groundsheet at all. I spent an entire summer cowboy camping on a Therm-A-Rest Ridgrest without any sort of groundsheet.\nQuilt or Sleeping Bag\nWhether you use a quilt or a sleeping bag, really comes down to personal preference. I prefer a quilt in warmer weather and a sleeping bag when it gets colder under 20 degrees. If you\u2019re feeling more exposed without a tent to protect you from critters, a sleeping bag may provide you with a great sense of security. But both options work perfectly well when coupled with a warm sleeping pad for ground insulation.\nBivy\nIf it\u2019s bug season you can take a bivy like the Katabatic Gear Pinon Bivy. At around 6.6 oz you will have a floor and insect protection. It can also help offset the fear of snakes and spiders. Another option is a waterproof bivy such as the Outdoor Research Alpine Ascentshell Bivy. With a waterproof bivy, you\u2019re wrapping up a floor, bug protection, and rain protection into one ~19 oz item. There\u2019s a simplicity to this option that is very appealing. No need to fuss with a tarp in the middle of the night.\nBackup Tarp\nIt pays to bring along a minimalist waterproof shelter that you can quickly set up, even if rain is unlikely. The Zpacks Pocket Tarp w/ Doors is my personal favorite backup tarp at only about 6 oz. Though small, it has 4-sided protection which I appreciate immensely. A simple tarp like the 7.5 oz Gossamer Gear Solo Tarp is also another excellent option.\nThere are plenty of other tarp options, but the bottom line is that if you are cowboy camping often then you are probably in a place with intermittent weather, so your shelter probably does not need to be super substantial. Your backup shelter will not be a three-season dome tent or a double-wall pyramid style shelter. Your shelter will be a minimal tarp with either four-sided, three-sided, or two-sided protection.\nAnd because cowboy camping often relies on natural shelters as part of your system, a cheap, flat tarp actually makes a lot of sense. If you\u2019re next to a rock wall or a tree, you may only need to block the rain from one side in the middle of the night with a lean-to design. Or if the rain is very light, maybe you will simply roll up in your flat tarp like a burrito until it passes.\nCampsite Selection\nMost of the cowboy camping I\u2019ve done has either been in the ridiculously arid parts of southern Utah and northern Arizona where it almost never rains. Here, I mainly look for flat campsites and sleep best when my pad is as level as possible. Sand is good because you can sculpt it if need be to achieve flatness. Because you don\u2019t have to set up a shelter or pound in stakes, you now have the option of camping on rock too, which can actually be very comfortable.\nBut when I\u2019m moving fast and don\u2019t know much about the forecast, I try to tuck under a tree, in an alcove, or next to a boulder. These partial shelters will block some rain, and more importantly, some wind which can sometimes keep me awake. If you\u2019re a light sleeper like me, the light breeze on your face while cowboy camping can be enough to make it pretty unpleasant. Finding natural shelters to block the wind cuts down this risk significantly.\nParting Thoughts\nCowboy Camping may not be for everyone, but if you\u2019re feeling an aversion to it, don\u2019t discount it too quickly. Not only can it increase the efficiency of your fast and light trips, but it could provide you with a more immersive experience of nature, one that will last well into your work week. You will see more shooting stars than you would in a tent. Maybe even a UFO if you\u2019re lucky. You will feel a breeze on your face. You may see a deer walk right beside you. There may be something you could learn about your own fears and anxieties by sleeping out under the night sky. And through this immersive experience, maybe some of those fears and anxieties will dissolve.\nSectionHiker never accepts payment for gear reviews or editorial coverage.

I\u2019m going to give cowboy camping a shot at the next opportunity (I\u2019ve already slept in my hammock without a rainfly and loved it). Given that I\u2019m in the mid-Atlantic, my opportunities for cowboy camping aren\u2019t as frequent or as guaranteed, so I appreciated the advice on mitigating small-but-not-zero chances of rain.\nGreat piece thanks.\nI have cowboy-camped on trips to the south-western U.S., but rarely in the region where I live. In the wet mid-Atlantic, you are likely to wake up with your gear damp from dew, fog, mist or frost, even if there was no regular precipitation, so cowboy camping is risky. If a high barometric pressure weather system pushes the humidity away and you are not too near a stream or in a moisture-trapping hollow, on the other hand, you should be fine. The clearest nights are often the coldest, so you may want additional insulation if you don\u2019t have some form of cover. Tom P\u2019s approach of sleeping in a hammock without a rainfly makes sense, especially in warm weather, since it gets you up off the moisture in the ground. You can always put a hammock rainfly up, but roll it out of the way, so it is ready to deploy in a hurry if rain or snow comes in.\nI haven\u2019t camped much in the mid-Atlantic, but I trust you\u2019re right about this. It works better in drier alpine environments like the Rockies and of course deserts like the Colorado Plateau. Could probably overlay a cowboy camping map with John Wesley Powell\u2019s \u201cArid Region of the United States\u201d map and they would match up. Most places west of the 100th meridian haha.\nGood idea!\nI may try it someday, but I\u2019m definitely in the irrationally-afraid-of-this group.\nMaybe there are places it would bother you less. I personally do better in pi\u00f1on and juniper woodlands than in alpine forests though I\u2019m not sure why. And alcoves are better than barren badland exposure. Just my particular psychology.\nThe 6 person group next to us at Bright Angel campground in the Grand Canyon were all cowboy camping. They were trail running out in the morning and only brought running vests with minimal gear.\nTop man yourself ?\nBut\u2026won\u2019t raccoons and coyotes chew your fingers and toes off\u2026? ?\nCowboy camped a lot in my life mostly in my home state of Montana. There is something about the simplicity that minimalism provides and the sense of freedom that comes with it. Yes there have been downpours and one memorable blizzard but I would not have changed a thing. It\u2019s an experience you owe to yourself to try if you love the outdoors. Thanks for the write up!\nI grew up camping out in West Texas on a ranch the cowboy camped all the time but not the way you\u2019re describing it we roughed it sometimes we all we had was a tarp but that was okay we were at home in nature we were kids but you\u2019re describing sounds like City cowboy camping\nPlease don\u2019t insult West Texas. They\u2019re having a pretty hard time right now.\nI grew up camping in West Texas also underneath the stars. Y\u2019all use tarps? That\u2019s cheating! Man must\u2019ve been nice.\nGood article. I enjoy Cowboy Camping, but I have gotten bit by something each time. Even in my netting, something has managed to bite me \u2013 when I pressed against the netting I suspect. Bugs like me.\nI\u2019m a light sleeper so I usually wake up during the night and go enjoy the views before going back to hide in my tarp-tent for the night. :-)\nNot a cowboy camping specific question, but do you have any suggestions on how to layer a zero degree quilt i have with a summer(?) sleeping bag to more comfortably winter camping/backpacking?\nI\u2019d stack the quilt on top\u2026 It will also block the drafts that get past your quilt.\nI was going to say quilt on top too assuming the other one is a mummy bag or something. That said, the preferred system for a lot of folks is usually a thicker bag or quilt inside (maybe 20 degree) and a thinner synthetic quilt on the outside (maybe 40 or 50 degree)\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in the past, based on recommendations to place the synthetic quilt on top to capture any condensation. And let me tell you, it was an amazingly warm combination. Twenty degree down bag with 40 degree synthetic quilt in mid-teens weather.\nI have a roomy \u201cspoon-shaped\u201d Nemo down bag. When I go below its rating, I put a narrow-cut, sewn-footbox quilt inside it. That works well since the outer bag is big and the inner quilt is narrow. I\u2019ve tried draping a flat quilt outside my down bag, but I find the outer layer slides off. I haven\u2019t wanted to secure the quilt with straps, since I don\u2019t want to compress the inner bag\u2019s loft. The bag-and-quilt system is heavier and bulkier than a sub-zero bag, but if you get condensation in your system, you can separate the pieces for drying. I found it very flexible where some nights would be pretty warm and others very cold. You may want to experiment someplace where you can retreat easily to your car if you miscalculate until you get your system dialed in.\nI\u2019m from New England like Philip so I don\u2019t get to cowboy camp very often (I don\u2019t ever trust it not to rain), but once when I did so on a rafting trip in Utah I woke up way too early from ants crawling over me \u2013 I\u2019d put my sleeping pad right over a giant ant\u2019s nest, oops. Not only was this really annoying but when I went to pack up my gear, I discovered a scorpion had made itself at home under my pad (snacking on yummy ants, probably). I\u2019m generally not terribly nervous about critters but my yelp upon seeing the scorpion skitter out from under my pad woke a few others in my group who were nearby.\nSo I guess the moral of this story is to make sure you don\u2019t cowboy camp on top of a giant ant\u2019s nest.\nI have had enough bears sniffing around the outer edges of my rip stop tents that I would never ever be in just a sleeping bag unless > 9500 ft alritude\nThanks Randy! You just ruined it for most of us, LMAO! Oh man luckily most of the places I camp and have camped bears were not a problem Texas and Louisiana to Florida. Grew up in tbetween west Texas with my hippy parents and south Louisiana with the grandparents. Snakes don\u2019t bother me. Learned to repel bugs and camp in the winter in the swamps and Deep South. Now we camp in the Ozarks of Arkansas and we\u2019re wanting to venture off into bear county some. I\u2019m having mixed feeling about being around bears. Sitting here imagining waking up with a bear sniffing around me in a bivy bag has got me laughing my ass off and a little concerned. Oh man.\nEasily solved. Hike with a short partner.\nRandy,Does the rip stop fabric on the tent help repel bears? Asking for a friend.\nwhatcha suggest/preferred modus operandi fer keepin\u2019 dem skeeters at bay there cowboy?\nDEET\nWe don\u2019t like DEET because it dissolves synethtics. Permethrin or Picaridin don\u2019t.\nPermethrin, a UL bivy, and/or site selection.\nPhillip, or camp with a friend who runs with a limp!\nI really enjoyed this article. I always enjoyed sleeping out underneath the stars and it was nice to hear someone else\u2019s take on that. Thanks again for sharing the article. Sincerely, River Smith.\nIf I\u2019ve looked at the forecast & there isn\u2019t really a chance of rain, and it\u2019s not particularly buggy, I cowboy it. I typically go with groups of people who pair up to share tents (one person carries the stakes & body, the other the rainfly, footprint & poles), & we\u2019ll lay down the tent footprint & set our pads on top of that. There\u2019ve definitely been some mornings in the Sierra Nevadas that I\u2019ve woken up to frost on my sleeping bag from cowboying it, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nI\u2019ve cowboy camped many times by myself and once tried it with my grandson and another friend in Big Bend NP when grandson was eight. That experience didn\u2019t work too well. He needed the security of some sort of shelter. We found he slept better when he was between the two adults\u2013it gave him more of a sense of protection. My take away from that is that children may not take to cowboy camping too readily even if they\u2019ve camped and backpacked quite a bit. Bugs weren\u2019t an issue because it was right about New Year\u2019s that we camped.\nA few years earlier, I hiked the South Rim Trail in Big Bend the same time of the year. There was fresh snow on the ground and I just put my ground sheet, pad and sleeping bag on the ground. It was a glorious refreshing night as I lay there star gazing in the darkest skies of the Lower 48. During the night, I could hear footsteps in the woods and animals sniffing around my campsite at various times.\nThe following morning, as I sat on the edge of the 500\u2032 cliff that makes up South Rim, gazing a hundred miles into Mexico and looking at the Rio Grande snaking through the desert and canyons a mile below, I did my personal daily Bible reading from a photocopy of the section of the Bible I was in. It was Psalm 104 which talked about mountains ascending and valleys descending, springs of water in the valleys between the mountains, animals of the forest coming out to roam when the sun sets and then withdrawing to their dens when the sun rises and man goes to work. As I drank my water collected from the canyon of Boot Spring, it hit me: I am living this Psalm right at this very moment! It was a very moving cowboy camping experience I\u2019ll never forget!\nMy wife and I spent an anniversary in the Big Bend area. After a day on horseback, we cowboy camped along the Rio Grande and I remember waking up during the night and being startled by the clarity of the stars overhead. I also remember her being excitedly startled awake by a pig, explained next morning to have been from the Mexican side, snorting not three feet from her! In retrospect, the memory makes me realize I don\u2019t cowboy camp nearly enough!\nAnyone have a good solution for condensation when cowboy camping? When I was on the PCT, I often found that unless I was under heavy tree cover, I\u2019d wake up at 3am absolutely soaked with condensation on my bag\u2013it was enough to get me to set up a shelter a couple times just to have something else for the condensation to attack.\nSame suggestion as for avoiding condensation on a tent, don\u2019t camp near water, in meadows, or other depressions in the landscape. The only time I\u2019ve had condensation problems were when I camped near water. I guess fortunately it\u2019s always been cold enough that I woke up with frost on my quilt that I could mostly shake off.\nSounds awesome and worth a try \u2013 maybe not here in central FL.\nI can suggest that a simple solution to seeing stars while \u201cregular\u201d camping is take the fly off your tent!\nGreat article!\nI finally tried cowboy camping 3 years ago and now I cowboy camp whenever possible. I love the simplicity and the views. That thin nylon or dyneema isn\u2019t protecting you from anything except mossies. As for other insects, they will try to avoid you same as the ones in your bedroom. You don\u2019t have spiders, earrings, etc in your house? Suuure.\n*earwigs\n(Thanks autocorrect)\nWe\u2019d get wolf spiders in the house when I was a kid. I once woke up to one on my pillow, within inches of my face.\nI\u2019m fine with spiders in my house, but not ones that bold. NIGHTMARE FUEL.\nGreat article and comments. Love the different perspectives! I also had a near religious experience camping under the stars at the South Rim of Big Bend. Amazing light show! I woke that morning to the sounds of snuffling near my head\u2026 opened one eye and saw a pair of skunks less than 3 feet away, trying to get in my pack. What to do? Simple: go back to sleep. Woke again 30 min later and they were gone. No harm no foul, but next time I moved the pack a bit further away from my sleeping spot\u2026\nI was in the Coast Guard for a dozen years, and the first two cutters I served in made long-distance trips on the Pacific. One moonless night, one of the engineers was up on the bridge for some reason. He was out on the bridge wing, staring at the sky, agape. Several minutes in, I asked him if he was okay or if he needed anything. He explained he\u2019d never been topside at night when we were underway. I nodded \u2013 when the sky is so dark you can see faint stars, it really takes your breath away. It\u2019s magical, and something humans in industrialized countries are generally denied.\nI told him to take all the time he wanted.\nKim Kremer: This comment of yours is one of my favorites I\u2019ve ever read on this site. Yes, stars are mesmerizing.\nThanks!\nIt\u2019s a pleasant memory. I cannot remember his name, but sharing his awe will always be etched in my memory.\nThe only experience I had Cowboy camping was many, many, years ago at the Hale trailhead. (Well before the current \u2018lot\u2019 was built.) I pulled in very late at night, so just slept on the ground behind my car. As I was falling asleep I heard \u201cThump, thump, thump\u201d coming closer\u2026 and something, probably a squirrel, landed on my stomach. My legs and arms all shot out, and I heard nothing for a couple seconds, until he landed, then a very rapid retreat. I\u2019m not sure who had been more surprised him or me. :-)\nI envy y\u2019all that are willing to do this.\nSeveral years ago, I left the bug netting home because I knew it would be cold enough at night that bugs wouldn\u2019t be a problem. One night, I heard/felt something walking on the hang strap for my hammock. Then a wee rodent walked across my face. My instinctual reaction was to fling it off of me. I was camped atop a ridge, and I suspect that poor critter didn\u2019t hit the ground until it hit Trap Lake 1000\u2032 below.\nIf I\u2019m confident there\u2019ll be no rain, I don\u2019t put the tarp up. While the bug netting diminishes star gazing a bit, I can still see all around me. Unless the tarp is really battened down for a storm, I can feel the breeze around me \u2014 that\u2019s one of my favorite things about sleeping in a hammock. But without the netting, I would assume every noise was something risking it all to walk on my face.\nCowboy camping sounds really attractive, but I am far too much the housecat to attempt it.\nA simple bivy sack like a Borah Ultralight Bivy or Bug Bivy would keep the small critters off.\nI would love to try this, but New England is not the right climate for it. We\u2019ve been using double-walled tents to handle the rain and condensation, but I\u2019m hoping to try out a hammock and tarp this year.\nIf the weather is mild and no rain is likely, I don\u2019t put the tarp up over my hammock. If I have to be a groundling, I have a couple of net tent options that allow me to skip the rain fly if the weather is right.\nBut yeah, I don\u2019t want to feel anything walking on my face ever again.\nOne of my favorite times cowboy camping was on a summer night up in the Uintas of Utah. I was about 30 yards away from a mountain lake sleeping under a star filled and moonless canvas. I dozed off. I began to hear foot steps all around me! I couldn\u2019t see what was causing the noise. My sleeping bag had a little zippered pocket near my chest and in it I had my flashlight. I slowly unzipped the pocket. Found my flashlight. Turned it on. Suddenly there were multiples of eyes all starring at me!\nIt was a herd of deer coming down to the lake for a drink. A great night!\nAka: dirt bagging\nCamped like this twice in the White Mountains of NH. First Time at the Dolly Cop camp Ground, moonless night abundant star light. 2nd time on a Sobo Presi traverse about 1/2 hour north of the the summit of Mount Washington, bivy sack and foam pad on some \u201ccomfortable\u201d rocks. Woke up to my first view of a phenomenal undercast. I wasn\u2019t concerned about securing my food back then but imagine if I did Cowboy up these days a bear can would be in order, yes?\nJust an FYI. It\u2019s illegal to camp above tree line in the Whites except on 2 feet of snow. The rule is designed to protect fragile vegetation in the alpine zone. It\u2019s not hard to imagine how bad it would be if people ignored that.\nI hear about how tough polycro is. In my experience, even with the heavy weight version, it falls apart with the slightest poke or tear.\nWhat am I missing?\nThe stuff that Gossamer Gear used to sell was very tough. Not sure what they\u2019re selling now, but I\u2019d be surprised if it wasn\u2019t the same. You couldn\u2019t poke it for instance.\nThanks Phil. I will look into their product.\nFor the last couple of seasons I\u2019ve been using vapour barrier, both light and heavy. It\u2019s tough.\nAs a variation, I like to set up my tarp using a snakeskin tube. That way I can see the stars and be part of the outdoors. If it rains, I can easily slide back the snakeskin and unfurl the tarp for protection. The few times it has rained with this system, the initial raindrops were enough to wake me in time to deploy the tarp.\nI usually just set up an A frame with the tarp, using hiking poles (you may need two guylines for the poles). The stakes and a pounding rock are near at hand. I\u2019ve preset the stakes once, but had a difficult time finding them. Pounding the four stakes in proved to be quicker.\nSnakeskins are a common thing with hammock campers as a way of storing and simplifying set up. A mesh snakeskin weighs next to nothing.\nAn alternate for this setup is to unfurl just one side, in a sort of lean-to set up. This can provide some wind protection. You can\u2019t use the snakeskin but can somehow roll up or tie down one side.\nRecently cowboy camped on a summit in NH (below tree line) to catch a sunrise. We threw down some z-fold pads and sleeping bags and were about as comfortable as we could be for the 4 hours prior to sunrise. Woke up in the morning and the bags were fairly wet with dew. It wasn\u2019t an issue for us since it was a single night out but might have presented a challenge if it was a multi-night trip."

      "text": "Recent research shows that up to 75% of American adults are chronically dehydrated. The National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine notes you should consume 125 ounces, or 15.5 cups of water daily for men and 11.5 cups for women. However, nearly three-fourths of adults only drink two and a half cups daily.\nHydration is vital for good health. Drinking enough water allows your heart to pump blood more easily, helps your body regulate temperature, aids in disposing of waste and improves your skin condition. Common signs of dehydration include having a dry mouth, your urine being a dark yellow, and feeling thirsty. However, there are other, less common signs of dehydration you might not know. Our guide covers these symptoms and provides ways to ensure you're properly hydrating your body.\nLesser-known signs of dehydration\nHere are some of the lesser known signs of dehydration.\nFatigue and low energy levels\nYour body needs proper hydration to operate efficiently. When you don't drink water regularly, your body loses water, sodium and potassium. Your blood pressure can also drop, leading to poor circulation and less blood flow to your brain. With reduced blood flow, you can feel sluggish. However, your body will try to balance your blood pressure by constricting blood vessels and forcing your heart to pump harder. Because of the increased energy exerted by your heart, you can also experience more fatigue.\nHeadaches and migraines\nA dehydration headache can happen when you don't drink enough water. When your body dehydrates, it shrinks portions of your body, including your brain. As your brain shrinks, it pulls away from the skull, placing pressure on the nerves. This pain isolates in your head, unlike other headaches, which can extend to your neck and shoulders. If you drink water and notice the pain improving, you have a dehydration headache.\nDry skin and lips\nYour body prioritizes where to send water. If you don't drink enough water, your body sends the water you do have to your organs to keep them working well. It means your skin cells won't receive the water it needs. Without this moisture, your skin can look dull or become flakey.\nYou can also experience dark shadows and hyperpigmentation. It happens when your blood vessels constrict because they don't receive enough water. Concerning your lips, they dry out quicker because they don't have oil glands like other parts of your body. It's why one of the first ways you know you're dehydrated is when your lips are dry or flakey.\nMuscle cramps and joint pain\nAs noted above, when your body doesn't have adequate water, it reduces blood flow and can cause muscles to cramp. Another reason your muscles or joints can hurt is your body loses electrolytes when not hydrated. Electrolytes transmit messages to help muscles constrict and relax. Without the messages to relax, your muscles can be more prone to cramping because they're more rigid. You're more likely to experience Charlie horses when exercising because your body doesn't have enough hydration to allow electrolytes to send messages.\nBad breath and oral health issues\nOne of the most common symptoms of dehydration is dry mouth. When your mouth is dry, it reduces its saliva production. Saliva can protect your teeth and gums by removing debris from your teeth, neutralizing acids from foods or drinks and strengthening your teeth by containing calcium, fluoride and phosphate. Without saliva, you could experience tooth decay, plaque build-up, bad breath, gum disease, cavities and weakened enamel.\nDark urine color\nYour body can give you indications you're not drinking enough water. One of the most common is that your pee has a dark yellow color. It is common to see this in the morning after first waking up since you haven't had water in a few hours. The reason your urine becomes dark is when you're dehydrated, your kidneys must conserve water. It results in your urine being more concentrated since your body doesn't have enough hydration.\nDr. Yoshua Quinones, a board-certified internal medicine physician, notes people of advanced age can experience other problems. \"Specific symptoms in older adults include urinary infections and functional decline,\" he says. It is why staying hydrated should be a primary focus for all age groups this summer.\nTips for staying hydrated all summer\nHere are some tips for staying hydrated this summer.\nDrink plenty of water and hydrating beverages\nThe first step is to change how you approach consuming water. If you experience some of the symptoms above regularly, you're not staying hydrated. The goal for men is to consume around 15.5 cups of water daily, while women need 11.5 cups. It means you'll need to prioritize consuming water sources more regularly. You can drink water, or Quinones adds, \"Besides water, you can maintain hydration by consuming beverages like herbal teas, coconut water, milk, electrolyte drinks, fruit-infused water, diluted juice, and vegetable juices.\"\nConsume foods that are rich in water\nIf you dislike drinking water in large quantities, another option is to eat foods rich in water. Foods packed with water include watermelons, cucumbers, lettuce, celery, apples, zucchini, peaches, broth and tomatoes. Adding a steady diet of these and drinking more water ensures you remain hydrated during the balmy weather.\nAvoid excessive caffeine and alcohol intake\nFollow the one-to-one rule when drinking alcohol or caffeine. For every drink you have, chase it down with a glass of water. It helps you remain hydrated since alcohol and caffeine have dehydrating effects. How does alcohol dry you out? Alcohol is a diuretic, meaning your body produces more urine the more you drink. It's why the term breaking the seal applies, as on nights when you have several drinks, you go to the bathroom more often.\nCarry a reusable water bottle and set reminders\nFor some, drinking enough water to stay hydrated can be challenging. Dr. Quinones recommends, \"To improve hydration habits, use reminders or apps, flavor water, start with small sips, carry a water bottle, set daily goals and include hydrating options like broths or herbal teas.\" It also helps to have a hydro buddy. It can be a friend or loved one who sets the same goals as you or holds you accountable.\nRead more: Best Reusable Water Bottles\nStay cool and avoid prolonged sun exposure\nWhen the weather becomes hot, you'll want to refrain from staying in the sun for long periods. Staying in the sun exposes your body to its heat, drawing the water out of you through sweat. The longer your body experiences these temperatures, the more water it loses. It's why you only want to be in the sun for small periods so you don't experience excessive heat, leading to dehydration.\nConsider electrolytes after intense physical activity\nAfter exercising, consuming electrolyte drinks can help your body rehydrate quicker. As your body absorbs electrolytes, they can regulate muscle and nerve function, repair damaged tissue and regulate blood pressure. After losing excessive fluids during intense exercise, it's the quickest way to restore hydration.\nRead more: How to Stay Cool While Exercising Outside this Summer\nListen to your body and hydrate accordingly\nWhen you're out in the heat or exercising, your body can tell you when you need water. If you have dry lips or notice your muscles cramp, it means to hydrate immediately. Also, if you're in an area prone to high temperatures regularly, pay close attention to your energy levels. On days when it's sweltering and you feel tired or disoriented out of the blue, you'll need to go someplace cool, rest and hydrate."

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2021We bought the Grayl 24 oz GeoPress specifically because we were traveling to Africa, and we were not certain we could trust the water supplies. Probably the best way to write a review is to do a pros and cons breakdown.\nPROs\n1) This filter really works! We encountered a wide variety of water sources, and every time the Grayl produced filtered water that smelled and tasted good. I say that because some of the water smelled a bit funky before filtration; but after using the Grayl, it smelled good.\n2) The filter is easy to use. You just fill the outer vessel about 3/4 full, place the filter/inner vessel inside it, and push down. The filtered water fills the inner vessel and is immediately ready to use.\n3) The filter is relatively compact. The entire system is no bigger than a large water bottle.\n4) The Grayl system seems very well made. We used it almost every day while in Africa, and it worked perfectly every time.\n5) It basically filters everything: bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and odors. During the entire month we were in Africa, we experienced no gastrointestinal issues due to \"bad\" water because we only drank filtered water from the Grayl.\nCONs\n1) The Grayl system is fairly heavy. When you are trying to pack light, the Grayl system uses up a bit of your weight budget.\nThere have been some reviewers that complained of water leaking around the seal between the inner and outer vessels. I believe they simply were not using the system correctly. If you take a little care and line things up as they were intended, it works perfectly every time.\nAlso, some reviewers have complained that it takes too much effort to plunge the inner vessel when filtering. There is definitely some resistance when you are plunging (filtering), but if you are patient, it really does not take a significant effort. My wife used it frequently, and she applies a lot less force than I do.\nBottom line, the Grayl filter system is an easy, convenient, and effective method for purifying water when you are traveling. I highly recommend this product and believe it is one of the best filter systems available.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2020If you have young kids, this is your answer.\nI needed an easy purification system to use while hiking with my kids, and I needed something that would produce water \"normal\" enough for a young kid to drink abundantly. The Grayl was a home run.\nThis filter works great, but it is especially perfect if you are traveling with kids. I took one of my kids (8 yrs old) on a short backpacking trip this summer and this was the ideal filter. She can't really work the slowish straw-type or pump-type filters; adding the purifying drops makes the water taste like medicine and sometimes you have to wait awhile; and the UV-light systems might kill the bugs but the water remains silty or murky. The Grayl solves all of those problems.\nMy kid isn't a wimp; she would have reluctantly drunk murky or bad-tasting water, but she drank a lot more water (esp. important in July) since I could refill her water bottle with clear, great-tasting water as quickly and as often as she wanted.\nThe second time I used the Grayl (long day-hike), I was able to continuously refill the water bottles for the entire family. Again, it was super convenient and not difficult to convince the younger kids to drink the clear and clean water that came out.\nMaybe it's not 100% perfect: it's a little hard to push the inner bottle down (but not that hard). I squirt myself in the face sometimes as excess water comes out the sides as I push down, but with young kids this thing was absolutely worth its weight in gold. The water looks and tastes like fresh clear tap water, and you can refill others' water bottles as much and as quickly as you want.\nLike I said (wrote) above: Home Run.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2025Color: Bali BlueVerified PurchaseMy first backpacking trip with this did not go so well because I used it wrong by twisting it as I pressed it, causing the filter to come off and dirty water to get all over the inside of the water bottle. Luckily I had a backup way to filter water. Since learning from my mistake, I have trusted the Grayl as my primary water filter on all of my backpacking trips. It is simple to use (when used properly, dont twist it), filters water fast, water tastes great and have never gotten sick.\n5.0 out of 5 starsMy first backpacking trip with this did not go so well because I used it wrong by twisting it as I pressed it, causing the filter to come off and dirty water to get all over the inside of the water bottle.

Also after 2 weeks it takes like a minute to press through the water putting all my weight on it.... In the first few days it went really fast and smooth. Does that mean my filter expired in like two weeks using daily 2-3 filtering????? I mean the purified water feels super clean, but the brand promises more lifetime for a filter than 2 weeks and I would also expect that.

      "text": "Like many others at the height of COVID-19 lockdowns, I was suddenly working remotely, socially distancing from family and friends, and leaving the house only for trips to the grocery store. I craved the ability to get out and escape the overbearing presence screens had in my life.\nThat\u2018s when I discovered my love of camping. Weekend camping trips let me take advantage of the gorgeous freshwater springs, trails and nature preserves in my area.\nI felt the difference almost immediately \u2014 out in the woods I wasn\u2019t scrambling for my phone or thinking about work deadlines. My attention span seemed to lengthen and level out. I relaxed. I came home feeling rested and a little more cheerful, and these trips became a way to manage the stress of the pandemic.\nAside from a nice weekend getaway, what I was actually experiencing were the benefits of nature on my mental health \u2014 something researchers and healthcare providers have long noted.\n\u201cThere are many studies that demonstrate how spending time in nature can improve mood, lower anxiety, and improve cognition and memory,\u201d says Mayo Clinic nurse practitioner Jodie M. Smith, APRN., C.N.P., D.N.P., M.S.N. \u201cMaking time for nature is important in order for us to maintain resiliency and promote self-care in a world that demands a lot from us.\u201d\nBelow, Smith discusses exactly why nature is so good for your mental health.\nHow does nature benefit mental health?\nFirst and foremost, Smith says that nature can be an effective tool to manage stress.\n\u201cStress stimulates our sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for increasing our blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar in order to react to a stimulus that is causing us stress,\u201d says Smith.\nAnd while not all stress is bad \u2014 for example, stress can motivate you to meet a work deadline or keep an eye on your kids at the pool \u2014 prolonged or chronic exposure to stress can chip away at your emotional and mental well-being.\nBut nature may be able to combat stress and its effects. For example, one study showed that exposure to nature can regulate the sympathetic nervous system in as little as five minutes.\n\u201cThis means that we can get an almost immediate benefit from stepping outside,\u201d says Smith. And doing so on a recurrent basis may prevent cumulative effects from stress, which could mean a lower risk for chronic disease, illness and mortality.\u201d\nIn addition to alleviating stress, Smith says research indicates that exposure to nature can be an effective coping strategy for those with chronic mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nProlonged immersion in nature and nature-based therapy programs have shown promise as a way of managing PTSD.\nEven for those without serious mental health conditions, nature may help you manage emotions like loneliness, irritability and possibly even road rage.\nFinally, there is evidence that nature exposure is associated with better cognitive function \u2014 like memory, attention, creativity and sleep quality.\nBut perhaps the best part is that nature makes it easy to soak in these benefits.\n\u201cBeing present in nature doesn\u2019t ask or require anything of us, so it frees up our mind to think more deeply and clearly about things,\u201d says Smith.\nNext time you\u2019re outside, take a moment to listen, touch, smell. Notice the environment around you and simply be present.\nWhat if I live in the city without much nature around?\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 55% of people live in urban areas \u2014 a number that is expected to rise to 68% by 2050. Increasing urbanization can bring unique health challenges, as WHO estimates that the majority of city-dwellers experience inadequate housing, transportation, sanitation and waste management, as well as low air quality. Combined with the lack of green space in many cities \u2014 or open, often walkable areas with plants, natural landscape and water \u2014 accessing nature isn\u2019t always as simple as just going outside.\n\u201cCities can be very energetic and exciting but also can contribute to both conscious and unconscious stress from the sensory overload and challenges of maneuvering in those spaces,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIf you live in an urban environment, exploring to find even a small natural reprieve can be extremely beneficial.\u201d\nIf you are unable to fully immerse yourself in nature \u2014 like by taking a weekend camping trip \u2014 you can still carve out opportunities in your area. This might look like finding a small park near your workplace, taking a moment to sit under a large tree, or taking the time to find a pond or body of water.\n\u201cTaking a purposeful five-minute break during the day to refresh your mind in this type of environment can provide a benefit and can be justified by knowing that we will feel better and more productive afterward,\u201d says Smith.\nTechnology, too, represents a significant distraction \u2014 and barrier \u2014 to quality time outside and unplugged. Texts, email and social media require a lot of attention, which can take you out of the moment. Instead, Smith recommends leaving your phone behind when seeking green space.\n\u201cSlow down, go outside, notice what\u2019s around you,\u201d says Smith. \u201cListen to the birds and the wind and the crackling of the leaves under your feet, and you really will notice a benefit in your well-being.\u201d\nHow can I interact with nature if I\u2019m stuck inside all day?\nIn addition to simply spending more time outdoors, there are several strategies to get more green space into your daily life.\nFirst, consider how you can enjoy nature even if you\u2019re stuck inside. Although it\u2019s not a replacement for fully immersive, outdoor green space, you can still engage your senses by listening to recorded bird songs or a rainstorm instead of music, bringing lush plants into your home and office, decorating with pictures of natural beauty, or using a diffuser with natural scents.\n\u201c(These strategies) can improve relaxation and work satisfaction through the same mechanisms that being outdoors can provide,\u201d says Smith.\nOn a wider scale, you may consider working with your neighbors to plan a community garden, joining or coordinating a walking or bird watching club, and advocating for high-quality parks and environmental centers in your town or city.\nHow much nature do I need?\nSome research suggests that even very quick visits outdoors can be beneficial. But there are indications that certain amounts and types of outdoor time may have greater impacts on well-being. A 2021 study, for example, found that the 20- to 90-minute sessions in nature were most beneficial for mental health, with gardening, nature-based therapy and exercise in green spaces being the most effective for adults.\nOne large survey found that people who spent at least two hours a week in nature \u2014 whether in one longer outing or in multiple smaller chunks of time \u2014 were more likely to positively describe their health and well-being than were people who spent no time in nature. If that seems unattainable, Smith recommends that you aim for 15 minutes each day.\n\u201cThere are added benefits that can come from prolonged immersion, so each week try to spend an hour outside doing something you enjoy, and each month try to spend a half day [outside],\u201d says Smith."

He worked hard, and so did his hands. They would often split and crack in the frigid New England winters. One night, seeking a soothing solution, he mixed up some beeswax and olive oil to create a simple herbal balm. It helped his hands so much, he decided to share it with everyone he knew - and the rest, as they say, is Badger history.\nProduct Description\nTravel + Leisure 2025\nBest Moisturizing Reef Safe Sunscreen\n\"has the feel of a high-end moisturizer that leaves the skin feeling soft and protected. It blends in immediately and does not leave any noticeably residue behind.

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2025Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)Verified PurchaseI have combination-dry, sensitive skin. Chemical sunscreens irritate my skin, cause stinging in my eyes and an odd taste in my mouth. I also cannot use anything scented for similar reasons.\nMany physical sunscreens are either too heavy, or leave a white cast, and sunscreen formulated specifically for the face tend to be geared toward oily skin. Their \u201cmatte\u201d or \u201cnon-greasy\u201d formulas dry me out and pile under makeup. This one is different.\nBadger\u2019s Mineral Daily Sunscreen is deeply moisturizing, absorbs beautifully, and has zero white cast once rubbed in. It\u2019s not greasy, but it\u2019s also not mattifying. It\u2019s consistency and feel are like a high quality facial moisturizer, which is exactly what I need. I use it on my face daily, often under makeup, and it looks great. No piling, no irritation, no stinging eyes.\nIt\u2019s technically not labeled as a face sunscreen, but I find it works better than most that are. Plus, the 4 oz tube is generous and makes it easy to use on the body too.\nI\u2019ve tried nearly every physical sunscreen out there, and this one is a rare find: unscented, reef-safe, certified organic, and full of safe, skin-loving ingredients. I seriously hope they never change the formula, I don\u2019t want to go through the search all over again.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2025Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)Verified PurchaseThis sunscreen is rated excellent on Yuka. It\u2019s a thick cream that absorbs really well into my skin and leaves no white cast. With that being said it does leave a greasy finish. It works decently under makeup and doesn\u2019t flake off but I have to use a lot of translucent powder to set it and then apply my concealer and blush. If you use minimal makeup then this will work ok but you NEED powder in my opinion.\nIt is non-irritating and doesn\u2019t have a scent. I\u2019m happy with it overall.\n5.0 out of 5 starsThis sunscreen is rated excellent on Yuka. It\u2019s a thick cream that absorbs really well into my skin and leaves no white cast.

I\u2019m happy with it overall.\nImages in this review\n- Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2025It\u2019s my first time using this brand of spf and I really like it. I have really dry face skin, but the face spf doesn\u2019t make my skin too dry even with it being matte. It goes on really nice and leaves a thin layer with little to no smell. The body spf does leave a little shine to your skin but it\u2019s not oily like most. I was also pleasantly surprised with the bottle sizes. Plus the non toxic ingredients put the cherry on top. Will be repurchasing.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2025I like that it contains natural ingredients. Goes on nicely, feels good on my skin.\nA bit greasy.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2025Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)Verified PurchaseAfter doing a lot of research on the harmful chemicals in sunscreens I decided to try out badger. I love it and how light weight it is on my skin. Being a mineral sunscreen you never know if it\u2019s going to be clunky and thick but this was neither and rubs in very well!\n- Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2025Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)Verified PurchaseFirstly, this is the first sunscreen I can use on my face. It actually helps my skin, and has not caused me to break out. Please be hesitant however, some people can be sensitive to coconut oil. But most aren't. Secondly to that yes its oily, but a little goes a long way. Can be worn under makeup but here's the catch... not perfect under all makeup. For one let it sink into the skin for a good 7-10 min before you apply. Works very well with powder foundations and concealer. I have yet to try liquid foundation because I just don't think that will work out. Also people complaining about how this wears under makeup is wild to me, it's sunscreen. It's meant to protect your skin. If that's truly what you care about just go without the makeup. If you use it daily, just find what products work with it and what don't. But this is completely clean ingredient wise so doesn't matter to me much! Hard to come by clean sunscreens like this.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2025Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)Verified PurchaseIt took me a long time to pick this out. Something with good ingredients but doesn\u2019t cost too much. I\u2019m so glad I found this. It is smooth to put on and not greasy or heavy. It covers well and does well in the water.\n- Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2025I almost chucked this for being too oily, but then it absorbed in about 10 mins and the oiliness was gone. I saw no white cast personally. Relieved because I thought I was either going to have to sacrifice sun protection (higher zinc oxide content) for comfort, or vice versa. Until now I had been using light, matte sunscreens (Sun Bum face, Bare Republic, Australian Gold [new formula, not the old orange spackle paste]) but then I started worrying that there was no way AG was getting 30, 50 and 70 SPF ALL with 4 or 5% zinc (and roughly the same of titanium). No matter what their formula is, I don't see how they could be making 3 different SPFs with that much range, all with the same (tiny) amount of zinc. Then I realized that all of the mineral sunscreens that people were raving about the feel, wear and look of all had a low quantity of zinc (sometimes augmented with chemical sunscreens snuck in) and all of the ones with (adequate) higher zinc quantities were ones people complained of texture, white cast, a readability, thickness, etc. This one seems like a favorable compromise though.\nDisclaimer: While we work to ensure that product information is correct, on occasion manufacturers may alter their ingredient lists.

      "text": "As you prepare for brighter days filled with endless summer adventures, you can\u2019t forget your sunglasses. We all know the importance of choosing the best sunscreen to protect our skin, but proper eye protection often gets overlooked. The sun\u2019s UV rays can cause serious damage to your vision and the color of your sunglasses can affect how they perform. The color of your shades can affect how sunlight filters in through your sunglasses, making certain tints better than others for specific activities.\nBy understanding how your sunglasses' color affects how they work and which activities they're best for, you can optimize your use of sun protection to benefit your vision health.\nRead more: Best Prescription Glasses\nBrown or amber sunglasses\nBest for: Sports and activities that require heightened visual acuity, like golfing and racing.\nDarker tints, like brown or amber, are common and work well for everyday use, REI reported. Brown offers a multitude of benefits that make it such a popular color. It helps protect your eyes by cutting through glare and preventing eye strain. Brown sunglass lenses also enhance warm colors and brighten your vision.\nAccording to VSP Vision Care, the high contrast provided by these lenses ensures that objects appear more defined and sharp, even at a distance. This makes brown or amber lenses an excellent option for sports and outdoor activities that require clear vision and heightened visual acuity, such as racing and golfing.\nYellow or orange sunglasses\nBest for: Gamers, pilots, hunters and winter athletes.\nYellow or orange-tinted sunglasses are perfect for moderate- to low-light conditions, per REI. They can be helpful in foggy, hazy or overcast weather because they enhance contrast and clarity. This color also makes it easier to focus your eyes on moving objects, according to VSP. Gamers, pilots, hunters and winter athletes gravitate towards this tint.\nBlue or purple sunglasses\nBest for: Water sports, snow activities and wet or misty conditions.\nBlue or purple-tinted sunglasses help reduce glare in bright, sunny conditions and environments, per Hunting and Fishing, so they minimize discomfort caused by bright reflections. According to Frames Direct, they also improve color and contour perception. These qualities make them perfect for water sports, snow activities and wet or misty conditions.\nGreen sunglasses\nBest for: Sunny outdoor activities like golfing, fishing and hiking.\nGreen-tinted sunglasses are suitable for a variety of situations. They improve color perception and contrast, reduce glare and also help brighten shadows. That makes them helpful for sunny outdoor activities like golfing, fishing and hiking but they're just as effective in low-light or partially cloudy weather.\nPink or red sunglasses\nBest for: Winter sports and individuals with light sensitivity or certain eye conditions.\nPink or red-tinted lenses are ideal for depth perception, according to Hunting and Fishing. This color is also a popular choice for winter sports because it offers great contrast against white backgrounds. Additionally, these lenses can benefit individuals with light sensitivity or certain eye conditions, providing a soothing effect and easing eyestrain.\nGray sunglasses\nBest for: Outdoor activities like running, cycling and beach outings, or driving.\nGray sunglasses provide a neutral color perception and reduce overall brightness without distorting colors, according to VSP. They are versatile and suitable for various situations, making them ideal for everyday wear. In bright sunlight, they minimize glare and eye fatigue and provide comfort to the eyes. They remain just as helpful in cloudy or lower-light weather. Wear them for outdoor activities like running, cycling and beach outings, or while driving.\nOther specs for your specs\nWhen considering sunglasses for eye protection, there's still more to consider beyond color and style. For example, lens coating, lens material and frame material. Polarized lenses reduce glare, while mirrored or flash coatings enhance visual comfort. The most critical factor is UV protection, ensuring sunglasses block harmful rays that can lead to certain eye conditions, such as cataracts or cancer. A combination of these factors, tailored to specific situations, helps determine the best sunglasses for optimal eye safety and comfort.\nIf you believe you may need prescription sunglasses or transition lenses, always consult your eye doctor for their professional opinion and advice.\nCorrection, Aug. 15: An earlier version of this story included an incorrect tip. It is not advisable to wear red or pink lenses while driving."

      "text": "The latest heat wave across the country is setting record high temperatures. That\u2019s bad news for your sleep, worse if you\u2019re a hot sleeper. Cooling sheets are a budget-friendly way to bring a cooling factor to help you sleep. There are plenty of options, too, ranging from percale sheets and sateen sheets, to traditional cotton sheets. At CNET, we've been studying sleep and testing bedding accessories for some time. To find the best cooling bedding, we spoke with sleep experts and tested a variety of options.\nThe best cooling sheets\nRemaining cool to the touch while offering comfort and style, the Citizenry's stonewashed linen sheets topped our list.\nThey're available in 14 colors and patterns, from basic white to indigo chambray (our favorite) so it's easy to match them to your bedroom decor.\nBest cooling sheets of 2025\nWhile made from stonewashed French flax linen, Citizenry sheets actually hail from one of the oldest linen mills in Portugal.\nThese sheets feel crisp and cool right out of the bag. They're definitely soft, but more rugged than satiny, with a lived-in, baggy look (especially after a few washings).\nIf social responsibility is important to you, know that Citizenry sheets are sustainably sourced, Oeko-Tex-certified nontoxic and fair-trade-verified by the World Fair Trade Organization.\nThey also come in more than a dozen subdued colors and patterns, so matching to your blankets or decor won't be an issue. (You can always request free fabric swatches to make sure, though.)\nIncludes: Fitted sheet, flat sheet and two pillowcases\nStyles: Available in 13 colors and three patterns\nSizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King\nPros\n- Soft and comfortable\n- Come in 14 different colors and patterns\n- Easy to care for\nCons\n- Pricey\n- Wrinkle easily\nIf you're looking for cooling technology and luxury, Lusom\u00e9 is a brand you'll want to know about. This Canadian company is dedicated to optimizing sleep through technology.\nSom\u00e9's continuous cooling performance sheets are engineered with Xyrotex technology, designed to maintain optimal body temperature through the night. This fabric isn't actively cool -- rather, it regulates your body temperature to prevent overheating and night sweats.\nI found the sheets to be breathable and lightweight. They come in a cool honeycomb pattern that feels smooth to the touch.\nFor returns and refunds, you have 30 days from the shipping date to email the company. Note that the customer is expected to cover the shipping costs of the returns.\nIncludes: Fitted sheet, flat sheet and two pillowcases\nColors: White\nSizes: Queen\nPros\n- Enhanced temperature regulation\n- Moisture wicking properties\n- Hypoallergenic (made with 100% cotton)\nCons\n- Limited sizing and styles (only available in white and for queen mattresses)\n- Customers have to pay for shipping on returns\nWant bamboo without breaking the bank? Quince's bamboo viscose sheets are breathable and cool to the touch, with a silky, smooth sateen weave.\nWith full elastic all around, they're definitely roomy but still have a fit that's true to size and easily covers mattresses up to 16 inches deep.\nAnd the customer reviews are fairly glowing, with an average 4.8 rating out of 5.\n\"It's one of the softest sheets I've ever slept on,\" one user raved. \"We washed it and used it for a week now. It is the hottest time of the year on the East Coast and the sheets keep us pretty comfortable at night.\"\nIf you're a nut for pristine smoothness, the wrinkling might be a drawback. You're not going to beat this price, especially for Oeko-Tex-certified, organic sheets.\nIncludes: Fitted sheet, flat sheet and two pillowcases\nColors: Available in eight colors\nSizes: Twin, Full, Queen, King, California King\nPros\n- Super silky soft feel\n- Great price compared to comparable sheets\n- Stay on the bed\nCons\n- Lower thread count means a thinner feel\n- Can get wrinkly\nLaunched by husband-and-wife duo Vicki and Rich Fulop in 2014, Brooklinen was one of the first players in the direct-to-consumer bed linens market.\nThe company's original core sheet set is great for people who sleep hot: Percale is a close-weave cotton, which has a certain structure to it but is still very soft and breathable.\nIt has a matte finish, which stays cooler than denser-weave sateen.\nBrooklinen sheets are made out of long-staple cotton, which doesn't pill or fade as much as short-staple cotton: I bought my Brooklinen bedding three years ago and it still looks like new.\nEach set comes with a one-year warranty, and you have 365 days to return it for a full refund. (They'll even cover the shipping.)\nIncludes: Fitted sheet, flat sheet and two pillowcases\nColors: Available in three colors and three patterns\nSizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King\nPros\n- Cool and crisp after multiple washes\n- Don't fade or pill\n- 365-night sleep trial\nCons\n- Percale cotton isn't good at wicking away moisture\n- Can wrinkle and be noisy\nYou wouldn't think sheets made from wood would be incredibly soft, but these 100% bamboo viscose bed linens are lustrous and creamy, while still durable and breathable.\n\"The softest sheets I've ever owned, and they keep getting softer,\" one customer wrote.\nThese generously sized linens come in every size from twin to split king and fit deep pocket mattresses up to an unheard-of 20 inches.\nYes, they're among the priciest sets we've tested, but the quality is undeniable. A 100-night warranty means you can make sure they're right for you.\nAs an added treat, each set comes in canvas packaging that can be repurposed as a tote or beach bag, with a zipper enclosure, sturdy handles and an external pocket.\nIncludes: Fitted sheet, flat sheet and two pillowcases\nColors: Available in seven colors\nSizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King\nPros\n- Stay smooth after multiple washes\n- Naturally antibacterial and hypoallergenic\n- 100-night sleep trial\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Fewer color choices\nHot sleepers will love how the Casper Hyperlites ventilate and draw away moisture, a must if you get sweaty at night.\nI actually don't like the feeling of silk against my body. (Thank God silk boxers haven't come back in style.) But the Tencel fabric and unique grid weave make these sheets smooth without feeling too slippery.\nTencel is made from wood-based cellulose fibers -- usually from eucalyptus but also bamboo or even pine or spruce. (Casper says its version is a blend.) It requires less energy and water than cotton and uses a lot fewer chemicals than even other bamboo fabrics.\nIt's a light fabric, bordering on thin. You'll feel like there's hardly any sheet there, which is good if you're trying not to overheat.\nCasper's sheets come with a 30-day trial with free returns and a one-year limited warranty.\nIncludes: Fitted sheet, flat sheet and two pillowcases\nColors: Available in five colors and three patterns\nSizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King\nPros\n- Cheaper than comparable sheets\n- More sustainable than other fabrics\n- 30-day sleep trial\nCons\n- Thinner material\n- Less stylish, with fewer color options.\nHow we tested the best cooling sheets\nFor this roundup, I tested sheet sets from some of the best-known bedding brands, choosing a variety of fabrics and prices.\nI slept on each set for several nights, then gave them a second try after washing. I focused on feel, look, price and how cool the sheets kept me through the night. (I did consider other factors, including how sustainable the fabric was and if the sheets had trouble staying on the bed.)\nI usually sleep with a comforter (and two cats). In the name of science, I only used the provided cover sheet during the testing period.\nRead more: The Best Cooling Comforters\nFactors to consider when choosing cool sheets\nMaterial\nThe best cooling sheets are made out of natural fabrics, specifically cotton, linen, bamboo and eucalyptus.\nPrice\nThere's no getting around it: Quality bed linens can be expensive. The priciest pick in our roundup tops out at $375. For some folks, a good night's sleep is priceless. If you're on a budget, there are good options for less than $100.\nComfort\nWhat your sheets look like when you're lying in the dark isn't as important as how they feel. If linen makes you itchy, It doesn't matter how cool it keeps you. Fortunately, there are a variety of fabrics that support cool sleeping.\nSustainability\nMore and more consumers are concerned about how their products are produced and their impact on the planet. Fortunately, the same fabrics that promote cool sleeping are also more sustainable. Many top bedding companies provide information about their environmental impact on their packaging and websites.\nBest cooling sheets FAQ\nWhy is sleeping cool important?\n\"Sleeping in a cool environment helps promote and protect the sleep onset process,\" Dr. Shilpa Kauta, medical director of the ChristianaCare Sleep Wellness Center, told CNET in an email. \"It also can help you stay asleep and reach deeper stages of sleep, and, ultimately, wake up feeling more rested and energized.\"\nAccording to Dr. Mike Sevilla, a family physician and health care communicator in Salem, Ohio, the inverse is also true.\n\"Research has found that warmer temperatures while sleeping cause less deep sleep and less REM sleep,\" Sevilla said. \"That can make you feel more fatigued the next day.\"\nWhile everyone has their own comfort zone, most people find the ideal sleep temperature between 65 and 69 degrees Fahrenheit.\nWhat is the best fabric for sheets to keep you cool?\n\"Some materials retain heat more than others, so it's best to look for something that is breathable and can move heat and humidity away from your body,\" said Dr. Peter Polos, a sleep medicine specialist and consultant with Sleep Number.\n\"Think of the area immediately around your body as a micro-environment,\" Polos told CNET. \"Controlling this environment is very beneficial to promoting and maintaining a good night's sleep.\"\nCotton and linen are good options because they're breathable, Kauta said. Bamboo and eucalyptus are even better -- they're softer, hypoallergenic and able to wick moisture away if you get hot flashes or night sweats.\n\"They tend to cost more but can be worth it to have cooler sleep,\" she added. \"My personal favorite is bamboo sheets -- they feel cool and cozy at the same time.\"\nRussell Jelinek, vice president of product development at Casper, makes the case for Tencel, which is made from wood fiber but is less prone to wrinkling than traditional bamboo and has a shinier finish.\n\"Tencel sheets are good for people who struggle with sleeping hot,\" Jelinek said. \"The material is more lightweight and breathable than cotton, which tends to trap heat more easily.\"\nWhat fabrics should you avoid if you sleep hot?\nAll of our experts said to avoid synthetic bedding, like polyester and nylon.\n\"They can trap heat and increase your body temperature during sleep,\" according to Kauta.\nThey also gave the thumbs down to satin, flannel and silk, which can feel cool to the touch but are not breathable.\n\"The more airflow or porosity, the more that body heat can escape,\" Jelinek said."
