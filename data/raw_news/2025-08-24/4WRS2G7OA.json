  "description": "Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde discusses potential plans by the US government to take a stake of about 10% in Intel as SoftBank buys into the chipmaker. Plus Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora discusses the company\u2019s growth plans. And Apple expands iPhone production in India.  (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "> > \u201cBLOOMBERG TECH\u201d IS LIVE FROM COAST-TO-COAST. WITH CAROLINE HYDE IN NEW YORK AND ED LUDLOW IN SAN FRANCISCO. CAROLINE: THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" INTEL GETS $2 BILLION FROM SOFT THAT. A STRONG FOCUS FOR THE CYBERSECURITY GIANT PALO ALTO. APPLE EXPANDS THE IPHONE PRODUCTION IN INDIA AS IT TRIES TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON CHINA. IS IT IN ANY WEIGHT DICTATED BY THE MACRO PICTURE. WE WILL HEAR WHAT CHAIRMAN POWELL SAYS IN JACKSON HOLE. WE ARE MADE AT SUMMER. WE HAVE SOME SEASONALITY INVOLVED. VOLUMES COMING LOWER BUT META ON THE DOWNSIDE. SIX OR SEVEN TRADING DAYS, CURRENTLY HIGHER BY 7.5%. THE NEWS IS THAT SOFTBANK IS TAKING $2 BILLION IN EQUITY STAKE AND SOFTBANK WILL HAVE THE SHARES AND WILL CONTROL THE ARM CHIP DESIGNER. ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAT CONFIRMS THEY ARE EYEING A STEAK FOR THE BUSINESS AND WE WONDER JUST HOW MUCH. I'M PLEASED TO SAY WE CAN DIVE IN WITH THIS WITH OUR EXECUTIVE EDITOR IN TECHNOLOGY IN WASHINGTON. BOY IS WASHINGTON PLAYING A BIGGER AND BIGGER ROLE. SECRETARY LUTNICK SAYING WE ARE INVOLVED BUT HOW MUCH? MIKE: HE STOPPED SHORT OF SAYING IT WOULD BE THE 10% STAKE OUR COLLEAGUES SCOOPED AND REPORTED YESTERDAY AND IT GAVE A SIZE AND SCOPE TO WHAT WE HAD BROKEN EARLIER OVER LAST WEEK AND THAT IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN WEIGHING THIS INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY AND THE IDEA IS TO TAKE SOME OF THE CHIPS AND THOSE ARE FUNDS IN SUBSIDIES WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ON THESE AIRWAVES SO MUCH OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF BUT THEY WOULD TAKE THAT MONEY AND TURN IT INTO EQUITY IN HAND STUFF OVER TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT WOULD MAKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE LARGEST HOLDER IN INTEL WHICH BE AN EXTRAORDINARY STEP, ESPECIALLY IN THE TECH SPACE AND WOULD PROVIDE SOMETHING OF A LIFELINE TO THIS COMPANY, THE NEW CEO TRIES TO TURN IT AROUND AFTER INHERITING IT FROM HIS PREDECESSOR, A COMPANY THAT WAS AT A CROSSROADS. CAROLINE: ASKED ALMOST TRYING LEAVE THE NARRATIVE THAT HAS GOTTEN CONFUSING. FOR THE GOVERNMENT, THEY CARE ABOUT MANUFACTURING IN THE UNITED STATES, THE CARE ABOUT OHIO AN AWFUL LOT IN THE CARE ABOUT INNOVATION THAT ALMOST FELT LIKE SOMETHING HE WAS GOING AWAY FROM BUT IN TERMS OF THE LATEST AND GREATEST INNOVATION WITH THE PROCESSORS, THEY COULDN'T FIND DEMAND FOR IT. MIKE: YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD RIGHT THERE. THERE IS SUCH TENSION BETWEEN WHAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO DO WITH THE TURNAROUND AND THE GOALS AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND TO STOKE WARMTH IN DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING ESPECIALLY IN THE ADVANCED AND SEMICONDUCTOR SPACE FOR THE FACTORY IN OHIO WE HAVE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT IS BEING PUSHED BACK TO THE 20 30'S AND THAT IS NOT IN A TIME DANE -- TIMELINE THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WOULD ACCEPT. INTEL JUST DOESN'T YET HAVE THE CUSTOMERS TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE FACTORY BUILDOUT WHICH IS SO COSTLY AND WOULD INVOLVE SUCH CONTINUED INVESTMENT BY THE COMPANY. IT NEEDS A GUARANTEED REVENUE STREAM FROM THE BUYERS OF CHIPS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT WORK. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS, WITH THE GOVERNMENT TRIED TO CAJOLE SOME OTHER TECH COMPANIES INTO BUYING CHIPS FROM INTEL TO HELP IT FIND THE CUSTOMER BASE AS IT SEEKS TO MOVE FORWARD. WE HEARD FROM THE TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT SAYING THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT GET INVOLVED IN TRYING TO FIND THOSE CUSTOMERS BUT WE WILL WAIT AND SEE. THE PRESIDENT IS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN TRYING TO SEE INTEL SUCCEED AND HAD A VERY POSITIVE MEETING WITH LIP-BU TAN SUGGESTING THE CEO MIGHT HAVE TO LEAVE OVER HIS PRIOR TIES IN ENGAGEMENT WITH CHINA. SO WE ARE SEEING A BIT OF A TURN OF A FORTUNE BETWEEN NOT ONLY THE COMPANY AND THE GOVERNMENT BUT THE COMPANY AND THE CEO WITH THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF. CAROLINE: THIS IS BEEN CALLED MONUMENTAL FOR INTEL IN THE PAST FEW DAYS. ASIDE FROM ALREADY THE INVESTMENT THEY ARE MANAGING TO PUSH FROM SOFTBANK INTO INTEL BUT WHETHER OTHER COMPANIES THAT HAVE TAKEN CHIPS MONEY THAT MIGHT SEE THAT TURN INTO AN EQUITY INVESTMENT. MICRON HAS TAKEN MONEY. HOW CAN THAT WORK FOR TSMC? MIKE: WE ARE SEEING IN BETWEEN THE LINES OF THOSE REPORTING THE SENSE BETWEEN SOME WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO PERHAPS TAKE A STEP FURTHER WITH THOSE OTHER COMPANIES, PERHAPS INCLUDING THE ONES YOU MENTIONED. WITH THOSE LIKE MICRON PERHAPS BECAUSE IT IS A U.S. FLAG AND U.S.-BASED, MAYBE THAT COULD WORK. BUT TAIWAN AND TSMC, HOW DOES TAIWAN SOME IN MANUFACTURE COMPANY AND THE TAIWANESE GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP ACCEPTED SOMETHING LIKE THAT ARE SHORT AND SAMSUNG AND THE GOVERNMENT IN SOUTH KOREA. THERE LIES SOME GREATER SENSITIVITIES, EVEN AS THOSE GOVERNMENTS HAVE COME TO EMBRACE THE NEED TO DIVERSIFY THE LOCATION OF THEIR MANUFACTURING AND TO ALSO CURRY FAVOR WITH DONALD TRUMP BY INVESTING IN THE U.S., THERE MAY BE A CERTAIN LINE WHEN IT COMES TO THE EQUITY STAKES. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT. CAROLINE: WE THANK YOU. LET'S TURN TO THE ANNOUNCEMENTS. WITH US IS GIL LURIA. IS THIS GOOD FOR THEM? GIL: THIS IS A LIFESAVER. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ALREADY HAD A DEAL WITH INTEL. IT IS WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU $6 BILLION AND WE ARE GOING TO GET A COLLAR PROFIT SHARE IT DOWN THE LINE FOR BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS JUST RENEGOTIATING THE DEAL AND SAYING THAT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. WE WANT TO TAKE AN EQUITY STAKE. IN INTEL IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE PART OF THIS DEAL IS A BIG DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE COMPONENT. LET'S NOT FORGET, WE WILL WANT INTEL TO MANUFACTURE CHIPS FOR THE F-35'S AND OTHER IMPORTANT WEAPONS SYSTEMS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP, FOR INSTANCE, WHERE WE ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT MAKING CHIPS FOR DATA CENTERS. SO THE GOVERNMENT RENEGOTIATED THE DEAL AND NOW WHEN IT HASN'T DONE THAT, IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT LIP-BU TAN CAN SAY, OK, THIS IS THE TIME FOR SOFTBANK TO INVEST AS WELL AND MAYBE LINE UP SOME ON DEMAND FOR THOSE CHIPS DOWN THE LINE. CAROLINE: I AM INTERESTED IN THE ERM -- ARM IN THIS. HOW MORE CEMENTED A CEMENTED COOK BECOME? GIL: CLEARLY IT COULD BE A PART OF THE DEAL AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR INTEL AS OF A WEEK AGO, THEY HAD NO CUSTOMERS FOR THE 14 A ARCHITECTURE AND SAY THEY MAY NOT EVEN PROCEED WITH ITS. NOW THEY MIGHT HAVE ONE LINED UP. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS A CUSTOMER AND THAT IS NOW MORE LIKELY TO BE LINED UP THAT AND THEN THEY CAN GO AND TALK TO THE OTHER COMPANIES. EVEN IF THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T GO AHEAD AND TWIST SOME ARMS, LET'S NOT FORGET NVIDIA HAS COMMITTED HALF $1 TRILLION OF INVESTMENT IN THE U.S.. SO CAN THE DASHCAM PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED JENSEN HUANG AND SAY, THIS IS PART OF HOW I WANT TO SEE THE INVESTMENT PLAY OUT? I NEED FREE TO BE A CUSTOMER OF A 14 A. THAT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE AT THIS POINT. REMEMBER, THIS IS A NATIONAL SECURITY SO THE RULES OF THE GAME CHANGES ONCE WE SAY THIS IS NATIONAL SECURITY. CAROLINE: RULES OF THE GAME ARE OFTEN BLURRED BY FRENEMY LINES. THERE HAS BEEN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CEO OF NVIDIA, JENSEN HUANG BUT ALSO IN SOME WAYS WANTS TO BUILD A COMPETING ARCHITECTURE IN SOME WAYS WANTS TO TAKE ON NVIDIA IN TERMS OF A I CHIPS. COULD HE DO THAT WITH INTEL'S HELP? GIL: IT IS ONE WAY FOR HIM TO PARTICIPATE IN AN EVEN MORE BROAD FASHION AND THE GROWTH OF AI WHICH HE IS DOING NOW. HE REGRET SELLING NVIDIA WHEN HE DID AND IS BUYING SOME OF IT BACK BUT ALSO MAKING A SET OF OTHER INVESTMENTS IN AI AND THE STRUCTURE APPEARED LET'S NOT FORGET STARGATE IS PROBABLY THE FLAG BEARER OF THIS EFFORT COMBINING WITH OPENAI AND ORACLE TO BUILD AGAIN AT LEAST A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WITH OF DATA CENTER CAPACITY. AND FOR THAT, IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO DIVERSIFIED AND NOT ONLY BY NVIDIA CHIPS THERE THAT WILL TAKE A WHILE IN NVIDIA NOT ONLY HAS A LEAD BUT CONTINUES TO EXTEND ITS LEAD EVERY YEAR BUT IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR HIM AND FOR OTHER COMPANIES TO TRY AND DIVERSIFY AWAY FROM NVIDIA. CAROLINE: THE COMMERCE SECRETARY, HOWARD LUTNICK, SAID THEY CONFIRM AN EQUITY STAKE AND WOULDN'T SAY HOW MUCH BUT IT WOULDN'T BE WITH THE GOVERNANCE ROLE. HOW ARE YOU STARTING TO ANALYZE COMPANY'S THAT ARE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND IS IT INTERFERENCE OR POSITIVE HOPE THAT IS BEING LENT BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT? GIL: THE GIVE PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT TO SOME COMPANIES TO CHANGE THE RULES OF THE ROAD AND IT WANTS EQUITY PARTICIPATION WHEN IT DOES THAT. AND IT IS NOT DOING IT BROADLY BUT DOING IT WHEN IT IS A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY. IT IS ALREADY VERY INVOLVED WITH NVIDIA. IT IS LIMITING THE CHIPS SALES TO CHINA. IT IS ALREADY INVOLVED WITH OPENAI. THIS MAY BE QUIET BUT IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE GET BRIEFS FROM OPENAI VERY FREQUENTLY ABOUT WHERE THE MODELS ARE. THE GOVERNMENT IS INVOLVED BECAUSE IT'S NATIONAL SECURITY AND INTO INTEL'S CASE, IF IT IS THIS CENTURY'S NUCLEAR ARSENAL, WE NEED SOMEONE TO MAKE THE SHELL CASINGS DOMESTICALLY. WE CAN'T HAVE A TAIWANESE COMPANY IN KOREAN COMPANY MAKE SHOWCASES FOR OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL. SO IN INTEL'S CASE, IT IS A MUCH DEEPER INVOLVEMENT AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THERE IS INPUT INTO WHERE THE INVESTMENTS GO, WHAT THE GOVERNANCE IS, EVEN IF IT IS NOT EXPLICIT. CAROLINE: GIL LURIA, THANK YOU FOR THE ANALYSIS. WE HAVE THE APOLLO ALTO'S CEO COMING UP AS THEY SEE A STRONGER 2026. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" \u266a CAROLINE: PALO ALTO BEST DAY SINCE APRIL, STRONGER THAN EXPECTED FORECAST FOR 2026. WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE CEO EARLIER. HERE IS WHEN HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE GROWTH. > > THE INDUSTRY HAS TOO MANY FRAGMENTED PLAYERS WHERE THE CUSTOMERS ARE LEFT TO DO THE STITCHING ON SECURITY THEMSELVES. AND NOW THE PACE AT WITH THIS IS HAPPENING IN THE BAT ACTOR IS ABLE TO GET IN HAS SHRUNK TO 25 MINUTES. YOU CAN'T SO THAT MEANT -- PROBLEM WITH HUMANS FOR YOU HAVE TO APPLY AUTOMATION IN AI. CAROLINE: YOU TALK ABOUT THE PERVASIVE ATTACKS. YOUR TRYING TO TACKLE ATTACKS COMING FROM GENAI. YOU HAVE PHENOMENAL STATISTICS, 890% INCREASE IN GENAI TRAFFIC IN 2024. CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT HOW YOU CAN COMBAT THAT AND WHAT SORT OF THINGS YOU NEED TO BE IN PLACE TO TAKE THE GENAI IMPACT ON. > > MENTAL PROBLEMS THAT EVERY COMPANY IS FACING IS THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA. YOU NEED GOOD DATA ON DISCOVERY, AND SELF DRIVING CARS TO UNDERSTAND. YOU NEED GOOD DATA TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IF YOU WANT TO USE AI. WHAT WE HAVE DONE ON OUR AND IS WE HAVE BASICALLY BUILT A PLATFORM THAT COLLECTS ALL OF THE DATA FROM THE ENTERPRISE AND MAKES SENSE OF IT AS FAST AS THE BAD ACTORS CAN. THAT CANNOT BE DONE WITH HUMANS. WE CAN IN JUST UNDER 50 TERABYTES A DAY. THAT IS A LOT OF DATA. IMAGINE DOING THAT ACROSS 400 CUSTOMERS, WE ARE INGESTING DATA AND ANALYZING ON THE FLIGHT AND TRYING TO STOP AN ATTACK MIDSTREAM. THAT REQUIRES TONS OF TECHNOLOGY IN AI EXPERTISE BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES ARE DISASTROUS. THE BAD ACTORS ARE DOING THAT AND TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT ONCE AND WE HAVE TO GET RIGHT 100% OF THE TIME. CAROLINE: SO THE EXPERTISE YOU NEED, YOU HAVE HAD ORGANICALLY BUT ALSO SOME INORGANIC WHEN I COME ON AND THINK ABOUT THE DEAL THAT FOLDED IN THE LONGER TERM. > > YOU LIKE TO CALL IT INORGANIC BUT WHEN YOU HIRE POSITIVE PEOPLE, IT IS PROBABLY ORGANIC. WE HAVE TO GET GREAT PEOPLE FROM ELSEWHERE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIORITY TO HAVE THE BEST PEOPLE ALL THE TIME. YOU BUY GREAT TEAMS WHO ARE DOING GREAT WORK. CAROLINE: $25 BILLION HIGHER? > > WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE. IT IS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY AND A GREAT BUNCH OF PEOPLE. THE WAY TO FRAME IT IS IF YOU LISTEN TO ALL OF THE NARRATIVES I HEAR ON BLOOMBERG AND AROUND THE MEDIA, WE ALL BELIEVE THAT AGENTS WILL TAKE OVER THE WORLD AND SOON HE HAS TO MAKE SENSE OF THESE AND WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE CREDENTIALS AND ARE MANAGED AND UNDERSTOOD AND HAVE GUARD RAILS. THE WHOLE WORLD OF AI NEEDS A CLOAK OF MANAGEMENT AROUND THEM. CYBER ARC IS THE LEADER IN THE SPIRIT SO PARTNERING WITH THEM ALLOWS US TO SEE AHEAD AND SAY TWO OR THREE YEARS FROM NOW ON THE WORLD IS TALKING ABOUT MANAGING THESE THINGS COME HOW DOES PALO ALTO GET READY SO OUR CUSTOMERS CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS ON DEPLOYING AI. CAROLINE: WHAT SYNERGIES YOU SEE IN THOSE TWO OR THREE YEARS. HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET HIT TO THE MARGIN THAT SOME ARE WORRIED ABOUT? > > WE ARE THE FIRST AT SCALE CYBERSECURITY COMPANY. THAT ALLOWS US TO LEVERAGE ECONOMICS. WE RUN AT A 30% MARGIN AND CLOSE TO 40%. ANY COMPANY THAT IS IT TO BILLION, WE CAN VASTLY IMPROVE THEIR BUSINESS. ON THE MARKET SIDE, WE HAVE 10 TIMES THE SELLERS THEY HAVE AN ON THE OPERATING SIDE, WE HAVE LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS FOR 6000 EMPLOYEES. IT IMPROVES THE MARGIN HEADLINES ATTACHED. WE BELIEVE THE ACQUISITION WILL GIVE A 40% MARGIN BY 2028 WHICH IS THE GOLD STANDARD IN THE INDUSTRY. CAROLINE: THAT IS THE PALO ALTO CEO. COMING UP, LAWMAKERS AND SACRAMENTAL VISITING MULTIPLE BILLS THAT HAVE IMPACT ON AI DEVELOPMENT. WE WILL HAVE THE DETAILS NEXT. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" \u266a CAROLINE: THE AI INDUSTRY'S MASSIVE FUNDING NEEDS. FUNDS COMPETED TO LEND META $29 BILLION FOR HIS PROJECT IN LOUISIANA. YOU HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON THIS A LOT. REMIND US WHY PRIVATE CREDIT IS SALIVATING AT THE OPPORTUNITY HERE. > > IT IS HUGE OPPORTUNITY WITHIN AI. UNLIKE PRIVATE EQUITY IN WHICH WE ARE SEEING EXITS, THE OPPORTUNITY WITH INFRASTRUCTURE AND DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE, THE MARGINS CAN BE HIGH AND CAN BE VERY LUCRATIVE. IT IS A PIECE OF THE PIE EVERYONE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON. CAROLINE: THEY ARE GETTING IN ON META AND THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO COME. SOME ARE WORRIED IT IS GETTING INTO MUCH. THE RISKS START TO APPEAR. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU ARE HEARING? > > THERE ARE CONCERNS THERE IS TOO MUCH MONEY CHASING THIS OPPORTUNITY AND IT MIGHT BE OVERBLOWN AND DEMAND IS APPARENTLY SOARING BUT I THINK WE ARE A BIT SKEPTICAL ON THAT IN THE LONG TERM. MORGAN STANLEY HAS SAID THERE ARE TRILLIONS OF NEEDS FOR AI IN YEARS AND COULD TRANSLATE TO HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF BOND ISSUANCE COMING INTO THE MARKET. HUGE NUMBERS. CAROLINE: 3 TRILLION IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS IS WHAT MORGAN STANLEY WAS ESTIMATING. WHERE ON THE RISK SPECTRUM DOES THIS LIE. THESE COMPANIES ARE AWASH WITH CASH AND MANY SEE THE DEMAND IS THERE FOR AI DATA CENTERS. > > THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING COULD GET INTO INVESTMENT-GRADE ISSUANCE. THE ISSUANCE OF THAT DEBT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO TAKE ON THE INVESTMENT GRADE RATING AND BACK AGAINST HARD ASSETS. SO IT SHOULD THINGS GO WRONG YOU HAVE MORE SECURITY TO -- TO NEGOTIATED -- NEGOTIATE WITH. CAROLINE: PIMCO A BIG WINNER HERE. GREAT SPEAKING TO YOU. THANK YOU. ELSEWHERE IN AI, LET'S TALK ABOUT REGULATION. LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM VETOED AND AI SAFETY BUILD LAWMAKERS ARE SUPPOSED TO TAKE ANOTHER SWING. > > CALIFORNIA AS THE HEARTLAND OF TECH AND AI INNOVATION HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD ON AI SAFETY. CAROLINE: YOU ARE JOINING US BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE AI AND TECH RELATED BILLS IN FRONT OF LAWMAKERS IN THE SACRAMENTO. I THOUGHT THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T WANT, A PATCHWORK EFFECT, STATE-BY-STATE AI AT FUTURE. > > I WOULD SAY THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM DOESN'T NECESSARILY SAY HE DIDN'T WANT AI REGULATION WHATSOEVER HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IF ANYTHING IN RECENT MONTHS, WE DID SEE THEM TRY TO IMPLEMENT A 10 YEAR MORATORIUM AND HE HAS FELT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO LEAD ON AI REGULATION. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS NEWSOM'S PREFERRED APPROACH HERE BECAUSE CLEARLY LAST YEAR WAS SP 10:47 WHICH IS NOT HOW HE WANTED TO SEE IT. LAWMAKERS ARE TRYING AGAIN AND TRYING TO SUSS OUT AND READ THE TEA LEAVES ON WHAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS AND WHAT KIND OF REGULATION AND WHAT IS THE MIDDLE LINE THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD SAY THIS SUPPORTS INNOVATION BUT ALSO ADVANCES SOME SENSIBLE REGULATION. CAROLINE: SO THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT AI DEVELOPERS TESTING TOOLS IN AB 1018. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ERA OF REGULATION THAT MIGHT OVERSEE AI BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT HOW BIG TECH IN MANY WAYS IS LOBBYING AGAINST SB 53. CAN YOU TALK US THROUGH THAT ONE? > > SB 53 IS THE SECOND ATTEMPTS AFTER THE 10:47 VETOED. DEFINITELY A LOT LESS RESTRICTIVE IT FOCUSES MOSTLY ON DISCLOSING SAFETY AND SECURITY PROTOCOLS FOR AI DEVELOPERS, PROTECTIONS, THIRD-PARTY AUDITS. YOU HAVE TO REPORT THE SAFETY TO THE STATE AG. IT WAS NOTHING AS INTRUSIVE AS LAST YEAR'S BUT TRYING TO PICK UP ON SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS WORKING GROUP FORMED BY A GROUP OF EXPERTS THE GOVERNOR FORMED LAST YEAR. CAROLINE: WORKER RIGHTS AGAINST AUTOMATIC TOOL SEEMS TO BE CONTENTIOUS. > > DEFINITELY. LABOR FORCES IN CALIFORNIA ARE A POWERFUL POLITICAL FORCE. THIS YEAR THEY ARE GETTING MORE IN THE WEEDS INTO TRYING TO PUT IN COMPREHENSIVE RULES AROUND AI IN THE WORKPLACE. SB SEVEN IS VERY INTENSE BILL WHERE LABOR AND TECH AND THAT BILL WOULD GIVE WORKERS RIGHTS TO OPT OUT OR POTENTIALLY REFUSE DECISIONS BY EMPLOYERS WHEN THE USE AI TO MAKE DECISIONS, DISCIPLINARY DECISIONS. CAROLINE: GREAT TO GET YOUR INSIGHTS, THANK YOU. COMING UP, WE WILL GET BACK TO INTEL. DISCUSSIONS THAT THE U.S. MIGHT TAKE A STAKE AND THEY ARE HAPPENING. THE QUESTION IS WHAT SIZE OF A STAKE. SEEING A BIG RALLY IN INTEL ONCE AGAIN. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" \u266a CAROLINE: WELCOME BACK TO BLOOMBERG TECH. WE CHECKED IN ON THE MARKETS. HELP BY .9% IN BIG NAMES METRICS . MICROSTRATEGY ON THE DOWNSIDE. RISK ASSETS MORE CAUTIOUS AS WE LOOK TOWARD A WEEK OF FEDERAL RESERVE NEWS. THE GRANULAR DETAIL. WE ARE ALL THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT MEANS FOR OWNERSHIP AND THEY CONFIRMED THEY ARE LOOKING AT TAKING A STAKE AND WHAT SIZE IS STILL UNDER QUESTION AND HOW WE SEE THE MONEY LENT IN THE CHIPS ACT INTO EQUITY AND WHAT BANKS ARE GETTING IN ON THE GAME. UP 7.5%. LET'S GET TO LONDON WHERE IT PETER ELSTROM IS WITH US LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGY NEWS FOR US. I ASK YOU, WHY SOFTBANK IS TAKING THE $2 BILLION STAKE. WHY ARE THEY GETTING INTEL TO SOMEWHERE EQUITY TO THEM? PETER: THERE IS A LOT GOING ON WITH INTEL. ON THIS SOFT BAKED FRONT IN PARTICULAR, THE FOUNDER HAS HAD AMBITIONS IN THE CHIP AREA FOR A LONG TIME. HE BOUGHT THE CHIP DESIGNER THAT IS COMMONPLACE IN ALL SEARCH OF SMARTPHONES AND HAS AMBITIONS TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN AI CHIPS AGAINST NVIDIA IN PARTICULAR. THEY THINK THEY CAN USE SOME OF THE DESIGNS FROM ARM TO MAKE A MORE IT ENERGY EFFICIENT CHIP THAT COULD COMPETE WITH NVIDIA'S CHIPS, PARTICULARLY FOR RUNNING AI SERVICES LIKE CAP BTT -- CHATGPT IN PARTICULAR. IT GIVES A MISTAKE THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT PERHAPS AS AN INVESTMENT BUT ALSO IF INTEL IS ABLE TO DEVELOP THE FOUNDRY BUSINESS THAT IS MAKING CUSTOM CHIPS FOR OTHER COMPANIES, YOU CAN IMAGINE A DAY WHEN INTEL MAKES AI CHIPS FOR SOFTBANK AND IS ABLE TO SELL THOSE IN BOTH COMPANIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM TAKING SOME OF THE DEMAND AWAY FROM NVIDIA AS THE AI BOOM EXPLODES. CAROLINE: WHEN WE THINK ABOUT MANUFACTURING, THAT IS WHERE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTS TO LEAN IN. THEY WANT DOMESTICALLY MADE MANUFACTURED CHIPS THAT ULTIMATELY GIVES THEM CONTROL OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN BUT WE ARE HEARING FROM HOWARD LUTNICK THAT HE DOES NOT WANT CONTROL AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GOVERNANCE ROLE. PETER: YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS WANTED TO REBUILD THE DOMESTIC SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS A GROWTH BUSINESS AND COULD MEAN JOBS AND PROFITS BUT ALSO DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE STRATEGIC RISK OF HAVING ALL OF THE ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTOR MENU IN THE WORLD IN THE EAST ASIA, TAIWAN AND SOUTH KOREA IN PARTICULAR. THEY WANT TO BRING THAT INTO THE UNITED STATES AND HOWARD LUTNICK ALLUDED TO THIS TODAY WHEN HE CONFIRMED THE SCOOP WE HAD YESTERDAY OF HOW THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING AT TAKING THE 10% STAKE IN INTEL. INTEL IS REALLY THE LAST MAJOR CHIP MAKER IS STANDING THAT HAS A SHOT AT MAKING THE MOST ADVANCED CHIPS TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THE LIKES OF TMC AND SAMSUNG IN PARTICULAR. PEACE IS SAYING THEY MAY USE THE CHIPS ACT 22 MAKE IT INTO EQUITY AND THEN TAKE THE STATE WITHIN INTEL AND SUGGESTING THEY MAY DO THAT WAS SOME OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE RECIPIENTS OF THE CHIPS ACT 20. ONE OF THEM BEING MIKE RYAN -- THIS CHIPS ACT MONEY. CAROLINE: ONE OF THEM BEING MIKE RYAN. THE REASON LIP-BU TAN PULL BACK FROM 1480 IS THAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE PERSON WHO JUST BUILDS IT AND HOPES IT MAY COME. PETER: THIS IS NOT FREE MONEY, TO BE CLEAR. UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THEY ALLOCATE -- ALLOCATED AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE GRANTS AND MONEY COMING IN ANYWAY. THERE WAS NO TALK OF THESE COMPANIES GIVING UP EQUITY TO GET THOSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO CHANGE THE CALCULUS WHERE THEY STILL WILL GIVE YOU THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET FROM THE CHIPS ACT BUT IN PLACE YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE THEM SOME EQUITY IN THE COMPANY. IT IS NOT FREE MONEY AND MAYBE A LITTLE ACCELERATED FROM WHAT THE ORIGINAL VISION WAS FOR THE CHIPS ACT. INTEL MAY BE ABLE TO GET THAT $10.9 BILLION THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GET A BIT SOONER BUT IT IS NOT FREE MONEY. THEY HAVE TO GO OUT AND PROVE THEY CAN SUCCEED IN THE FOUNDRY BUSINESS AND TO YOUR POINT THEY NEED TO GO OUT AND GET CUSTOMERS. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN DO A LOT BUT CANNOT GET INTO CUSTOMERS FOR THE FOUNDRY BUSINESS. CAROLINE: ALWAYS SO ARTICULATE. WE THANK YOU. LET'S BRING IN IPEK OZKARDESKAYA FOR MORE. I ASK YOU WHETHER THIS CHANGING UP OF THE CALCULUS IS WHAT GLOBAL INVESTORS WANT TO SEE. HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO CALCULATE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL DO NEXT? IPEK: IT IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE SPEED AT WHICH THINGS ARE COMING, SOME ARE REGULAR AND SOME ARE UNUSUAL. THE SPEED IN WHICH THINGS ARE COMING TO INVESTORS ATTENTION IS OUT OF CONTROL AND SOME OF IT DO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR COMPANIES BUT THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT GOALS ARE NOT GOING TO BE ALWAYS IN LINE WITH BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY GOAL OF MAXIMIZING INVESTMENT VALUE. SO THE RISKS ARE BUILDING. CAROLINE: DOESN'T PUT YOU OFF, THE GENERATIVE AI TAILWINDS MORE BROADLY FOR LET'S GO BACK TO PREVIOUS WEEKS WITH NVIDIA AND AMD BECOMING IN THE EYE OF THE POLITICAL STORM AND HAVING TO PAY 15% IF THEY ARE GOING TO SELL INTO CHINA, FOR EXAMPLE. IPEK: IF YOU LOOK AT AMD AND NVIDIA, TODAY THEY ARE IN A BETTER PLACE THAN THEY WERE A MONTH OR TWO MONTHS AGO WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO SELL THEIR CHIPS TO CHINA. TODAY, ALL THE SUDDEN THEY CAN IF THEY PAY 15% OF THEIR CHINESE SALES. THIS LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOOD NEWS. IN THE SHORT-TERM IT WILL GIVE THE COMPANIES MORE REVENUE BUT IN THE MID TO LONG RUN WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE NEWS AND THE GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE WILL CHANGE AND WHETHER THEY WILL BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. SO THAT MEANS THAT VOLATILITY IS HIGHER IN THE RISKS ARE BUILDING. DOESN'T MEAN THE COMPANIES WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT BUT MEANS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PURSUE THE SAME GOALS THAT THEY DO ALL OF THE TIME. SO THAT IS A RISK AND IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BECOME QUITE CAUTIOUS. CAROLINE: EVEN THOUGH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS BASICALLY, SEVEN NAMES HAVE MADE UP ALL OF THE BENCHMARK GAINS. HOW DOES AN INVESTOR HEDGE AGAINST THAT VOLATILITY? DO THEY STAY EXPOSED? IPEK: DIVERSIFICATION IS ONE OF THE RULES BECAUSE DIVERSIFYING AWAY FROM THE HIGH VALUATIONS RIGHT NOW TOWARDS SECTORS THAT DO IS INTERESTING. OTHERS ARE LOOKING FOR OPTIONS THAT ARE INTERESTING IN CASE THERE IS A SELLOFF IN THE MARKET AND WE START SEEING THE VALUATIONS COME DOWN. THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO DO BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE SEE THAT AI IS GOING AND IS HOW IT PIECED TOGETHER IT WILL BE IMPORTANT. WE THINK THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES ARE GOING FOR PEACE FOR THEMSELVES AND THAT IS GIVING WAY TO OPPORTUNITIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS NOW THAT THE U.S. TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE VALUE TO PERFECTION. CAROLINE: IT IS INTERESTING THAT YOU SAY HOW THEY USE OPTIONS TO HEDGE ONESELF. WHAT MANY WOULD SAY IS WHAT OCCURRED WITH INTEL IS THEY WERE USING IT HEDGE TO BET AGAINST IT TO PROTECT THE UPSIDE THEY WERE GETTING FROM NVIDIA AND OTHER AREAS OF THE CHIPS MARKET. WAS THAT SOMETHING YOU SAW AT PLAY AND WHERE ELSE HAD INVESTORS LOOK TO BET AGAINST TO PROTECT OF THEIR WINNINGS THEY HAVE SEEN IN THE SECTOR? IPEK: YOU DON'T WANT TO GO AGAINST NVIDIA AND AMD. YOU CAN GO AGAINST THEM. THE ONLY THING THEY ARE WILLING TO DO IS PROTECT ANY POTENTIAL SELLOFF OR DRAG DOWN. WE THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO STATE LONG AND DIVERSIFICATION LOOKS LIKE THE WAY TO GO FOR US. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE A SECTOR MELTDOWN ARE VERY BIG CHANGE IN THE DOMINANT POSITION OF THE U.S.. WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS DIVERSIFY A LITTLE IN ORDER TO TAME THE DOWNSIDE RISK FOR INVESTORS WHILE HAVING INTERNATIONAL EXPOSURE TO BROADEN THEIR AI PLAGUE. CAROLINE: IS THAT IN EUROPE? I THINK OF A FEW BUT NOT MANY READ TO THE FOREFRONT. IS IT MORE THAN AN ASIA GAME AND THINKING ELSEWHERE AND NOT JUST EQUITY BUT MAYBE DEBT? IPEK: FOR YOUR WE ARE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING INTO DEFENSE-RELATED TECHNOLOGY PLAYS AN WITH THE DEFENSE SPENDING IS SOMEHOW GOING TO BOOST TECHNOLOGY SPENDING IN EUROPE AS WELL. WE ARE MOSTLY LOOKING INTO MILITARY AND DEFENSE IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT FOR FOR CHINA, LOOKING AT NIGHT -- AI PLAYS AND THE SHIP MADE GIRDERS. SAME THING FOR SOUTH KOREA. WE ARE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY. THERE ARE SOME CHAMPIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE A PIECE OF THAT CAKE AND ARE LOOKING INTERESTING AND HOW NOT SEEING ENOUGH EXPOSURE SO FAR BECAUSE THEY HAVE REMAINED UNDER THE CLOUD OF THE U.S. BIG TECHNOLOGY GIANTS. WE THINK THERE IS STILL REASON TO THINK THAT DIVERSIFYING THEIR. CAROLINE: WE THINK YOU SO MUCH. COMING UP, SHARES OF APPLE UP SLIGHTLY COME UP .3%. WE DISCUSSED THE IPHONE MAKER TO EXPAND PRODUCTION IN INDIA AND EXPAND TRAINING IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" \u266a I HEART. THIS IS BLOOMBERG TECH. OPENAI LAUNCHING A NEW SUBSCRIPTION TEAR EXCLUSIVELY IN INDIA. CALLED CHATGPT GO AND THEY WILL USE THE LATEST GPT FIVE MODEL AT FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH AND THE PLAN WOULD ALLOW USERS TO GENERATE MORE IMAGES AND INTERACT WITH THE CHATBOT MORE FREQUENTLY COMPARED TO THE FREE VERSION. THE LATEST TEAR WILL BE IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER PAY PLAN OFFERINGS INCLUDING CHATGPT PLUS. STICKING WITH INDIA, APPLE EXPANDED IPHOTO PRODUCTION AT FIVE ACTORS IN THE COUNTRY, A MOVE AIMED AT LESSENING THE RELIANCE ON CHINA FOR U.S. MODELS. MARIBEL LOPEZ, HAD RESEARCHER AND FOUNDER AT LOPEZ RESEARCH. PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS FRUSTRATED THAT APPLE WAS MORE MANUFACTURING IN INDIA AND SHIFTING FROM CHINA AND HE WANTS IT IN THE U.S.. DOES TIM COOK HAVE ENOUGH IN THE U.S. TO OFFSET THIS? MARIBEL: I THINK HE WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH IN THE US TO OFFSET IT BUT THE ANSWER TODAY IS NO. IT IS NOT UNEXPECTED THEY MOVED THIS TO INDIA. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH INDIA SINCE ROUGHLY 2017. IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO BUILD MANUFACTURING. YOU DON'T JUST GO IN MATTER WHO YOU ARE, PRESENT OR NOT SAYING YOU ARE JUST GOING TO BUILD TOMORROW. IT TAKES TIME. CAROLINE: HOW MUCH WILL ULTIMATELY BE SOURCED FROM INDIA INTO THE UNITED STATES? WILL IT ONLY BE IPHONES AND OTHER ACCESSORIES? MARIBEL: I THINK WE ARE SEEING OTHER PLANTS COME ONLINE IN THE U.S.. IN HOUSTON WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH APPLE INTELLIGENCE AND SERVERS FOR THAT, THEY ARE BUILDING THAT AND THAT IS COMING ONLINE IN 2026 AND THAT IS SOME OF THE PRODUCT -- EXAMPLES THAT WILL BE BUILT HERE BUT OTHERS WILL TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO GET UP AND RUNNING. ANY MAJOR SIGNIFICANT U.S. PRESENCE IN THIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY THERE IS ROUGHLY 600 BILLION DOLLARS EARMARKED TOWARD CREATING MANUFACTURING IN THE U.S. AND THAT COMES IN MANY DIFFERENT FORMS. PART OF THAT WILL BE FOR SERVICE BUT YOU HAVE TO ENVISION PART OF THAT WILL BE FOR IPHONES. CAROLINE: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES. TODAY, APPLE IS UNFOLDING THE ACADEMY, ALL ABOUT TRAINING IN THE UNITED STATES. WHO IS IT FOR AND WHAT PRODUCTION COULD THAT ULTIMATELY LEAD TO HERE? MARIBEL: ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE HAPPENING IS AI IS VERY COMPLICATED AND BUSINESSES DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GET STARTED. SO THE CONCEPT BEHIND THE APPLE ACADEMY IS FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES TO UNDERSTAND EFFECTIVELY WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW TO BUILD THE NEXT GENERATION MANUFACTURING. THAT WILL BE A MULTI-DAY PROGRAM THAT SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES SIGN UP FOR IN THEY CURRENTLY HAVE A WAITLIST AT THIS POINT FOR THE NEXT WAVE. THEY WILL BE RUNNING COURSES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND ONCE YOU'VE GONE TO THE COURSE, THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS MORE DETAILED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES YOU NEED WITH APPLE ENGINEERS THAT ARE MORE SPECIFIC TO YOUR ORGANIZATION. THIS IS TO FILL A GAP. WE HAVE PLENTY OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND ABOVE TO TRY AND BRING IN NEW EMPLOYEES BUT IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS OWNER TODAY, ESPECIALLY AT SMALL AND MEDIUM, THERE ARE VERY FEW OPTIONS FOR YOU. THIS IS BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE SMALL BUSINESSES AND ALSO PUT THEM IN THE PIPELINE TO BUY APPLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. CAROLINE: PRIOR TO THIS, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TALKED ABOUT THE PRODUCTION GAP IN WHERE HE WANTS TO SEE THAT RECTIFIED. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID ON AUGUST 6. PRES. TRUMP: WE ARE DOING THESE THINGS NOW AND THE UNITED STATES INSTEAD OF OTHER COUNTRIES, FARAWAY COUNTRIES. THIS IS A CYNIC AND STEPPED TOWARD THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT IPHONES SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ALSO ARE MADE IN AMERICA WITH A MASSIVE INFUSION OF CAPITAL, ANNOUNCING TODAY APPLE WILL ALSO BUILD A 200 50,000 SQUARE-FOOT SERVER MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN HOUSTON AND INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CONSTRUCT DATA CENTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM NORTH CAROLINA THROUGH IOWA AND OREGON. CAROLINE: YOU SO THOUGHTFULLY PUT US RIGHT ON THE MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE NOWHERE TO GO FOR UPSCALING AND FACILITATING PRODUCTION. WHAT DOES APPLE BRING BY TRAINING? BECAUSE THE ANXIETY FOR TIM HAS BEEN THEY HAVEN'T GOT THE ENGINEERS IN THE UNITED STATES THEY HAVE IN CHINA AND INDIA. IS THAT WHAT IS GOING AFTER LONGER TERM? MARIBEL: I THINK YES IS THE SHORT ANSWER. BUT IT IS A VERY BROAD FIELD. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE MOVING INTO, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT PHYSICAL AI AND A LOT OF THAT WILL BE THE MANUFACTURING COULD BE FOR IPHONES OR AUTOMOTIVE. THE REASON THEY PICKED DETROIT IS NOT LOST. IT IS A MANUFACTURING CULTURE AND THERE ARE COMPANIES BUT WE ARE RUNNING INTO THIS GAP OR ORGANIZATIONS DON'T HAVE THE SCIENTISTS AND DON'T UNDERSTAND MACHINE LEARNING. SO WE ARE STARTING WITH THINGS ON THE AI SIDE, MACHINE LEARNING, WHICH IS A BASIC WEIGHT TO START AND THEN MOVING FORWARD. THESE ARE SHORT COURSES COULD APPLE ENGINEERS THAT ARE THERE ARE ACTUALLY BASICALLY DOING ROTATIONS TO SPEND TIME HELPING THE SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES BUT ALSO DURING THEIR DAY JOB. SO THERE IS THE INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF GETTING ORGANIZATIONS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT GENERATION ECONOMY. THAT IS STAGE ONE. CAROLINE: ALONGSIDE THAT IS WHAT COMPANIES ARE LISTENING TO IN TERMS OF WHAT IS NEEDED FOR MANUFACTURING IN THE U.S.. WE JUST HEARD FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP ON AUGUST 6 WHEN HE WENT TO APPLE. HOW DO YOU MAKE OF THE STEAK THEY MIGHT MAKE IN INTEL? MARIBEL: WE ARE IN THE SITUATION WITH THE CONCEPT OF EIGHT U.S. CHIP MANUFACTURER WAS ALMOST GOING TO GO AWAY. THERE WERE SO MANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS SAYING WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AN EQUITY STAKE. SOME OF THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL GO AWAY IN THE NOW IT IS COMING BACK. THE CONTEXT OF HOW THAT COMES BACK IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS AN INVESTMENT, AND NECK AND BACK -- EQUITY STAKE, IT IS TO CREATE CONFIDENCE AS A LONG-STANDING PLAYER TO TAKE AWAY THE RISK. BUYERS DO NOT WANT TO INVEST IN A CHIP COMPANY WHERE THEY THINK THERE COULD BE MULTIYEAR DEALS AND PLANS THAT I TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT SOMETHING I WANT TO HAVE COME ONLINE IN THREE YEARS. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL BE THERE IN THREE YEARS. PART OF THE STRATEGY IS TO TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE RISK TO GIVE INTEL THE FOUNDATION WHERE THEY THINK THEY CAN EXECUTE ON THE STRATEGY THEY NEED TO EXECUTE ON AND HAVE IT NOT BE AT THE WHIM OF HOUSE THE MARKET FEEL ABOUT YOU. CAROLINE: MARIBEL LOPEZ, FASCINATED TO CATCH UP WITH YOU. MORE ON INTEL AS THE U.S. CONFIRMS THERE HAS BEEN TALKED OF TAKING A STAKE IN THE CHIPMAKER. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" \u266a CAROLINE: LET'S GET BACK TO INTEL. THE GOVERNMENT CONFIRMING IT IS IN TALKS WITH THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ESTATE -- A STAKE IN THE CHIPMAKER CONDUCTOR ANALYST JOINS US NOW. YOU PUT OUT A NOTE ALONG WITH COLLEAGUES -- A STAKE IN THE CHIPMAKER. OUR CONDUCTOR ANALYST JOINS US NOW. YOU PUT A NOTE ALONG WITH COLLEAGUES. TELL US YOUR THINKING. > > IN THE NEAR TERM IT CAN HELP BUT WE DON'T THINK IT IS LONG-TERM FOR STAKEHOLDERS. THE NEAR TERM YOU GET THE 10 BILLION INFUSION. THEY GET A SIGNALING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS BEHIND INTEL AND WE THINK GIVEN THE LOOMING SEMICONDUCTOR TARIFFS THAT ARE COMING, THE GOVERNMENT COULD INCENTIVIZE BRINGING BUSINESS TO INTEL MANUFACTURING WHICH WOULD AID THE COMPANY IN LIEU OF GETTING EXEMPTIONS. SOME POSITIVES NEAR TERM BUT LONG-TERM WE DON'T THINK IT IS IDEAL FOR SHAREHOLDERS. MOST OF THE MONEY WOULD HAVE, ALMOST IN THE SHAPE OF GRANTS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY BACK AND I HAVE TO GIVE UP 10% TAKE FOR RECEIVING THE SAME MONEY. NOT A GREAT OUTCOME FOR SHAREHOLDERS. AND THIS DOES NOT GAIN ANYTHING FROM THEM CATCHING UP. CAROLINE: THE SHARE PRICE HASN'T GOING UP INTO THE RIGHT IN REACTION TO MONEY THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING BUT MAYBE IT WAS A MORE PROFIT SHARING IN THE FUTURE. TELL US WHETHER WE NEED TO CLOSE THE GAP FROM INNOVATION. WILL THIS GET THEM OUT IN THE 14 A? > > IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING. 10 MOOD -- 10 BILLION ISN'T GOING TO MAKE OR BREAK THEM GETTING OUT INTO IT. THIS DEPENDS ON WHAT ARE THE STRINGS ATTACHED TO THE DEAL. THIS COULD EVEN SLOW IT DOWN BECAUSE YOU HAVE DEVELOPMENT ON THE DECISION SEAT DRIVING DECISIONS IN THAT DIRECTION. THIS DOES NOT DO ANYTHING TO CLOSE THAT GAP. CAROLINE: THE COMMERCE SECRETARY WAS SAYING WERE NOT GOING TO TAKE A GOVERNANCE ROLE BUT YOU CAN POTENTIALLY YOU CAN SAY ESTIMATE MORE THOUGHTS THAT THE EXECUTIVES HAVE TO THINK THROUGH. IN THE HEAT -- HERE AND NOW, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM THE CEO LIT FOR 10 -- LIP-BU TAN? > > THAT IT WILL BE ON A 14 A -- IT WILL BE ON 14 A AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE THAT IT WILL BE POSITIVE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND IS GETTING MORE FROM U.S. COMPANIES TO GET THE EXEMPTIONS. CAROLINE: WE THANK YOU FOR THE ANALYSIS. THAT DOES IT FOR THIS EDITION OF \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" DON'T FORGET TO CHECK OUT OUR PODCAST. SO MUCH MORE INTEL NEEDS TO DIGEST, THE HIGHEST SINCE APRIL. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\"",

  "summary": "SoftBank has invested $2 billion in equity into Intel, as the US Government considers a 10% stake in the company. The investment is seen as a strong focus on Apple's IPHONE production in India as it attempts to reduce its reliance on China. The US Government is considering using some of the funds in Intel to create an equity equity in the tech sector, which would make the Federal Government the largest hub in the industry. This investment could provide an additional dimension to the tech industry, allowing the government to become the top manufacturer in the US.",

Meanwhile, Apple is expanding iPhone production in India and launching an Apple Academy to train small\u2011 and medium\u2011sized U.S. businesses in advanced manufacturing, as part of a broader effort to shift manufacturing away from China. The segment highlights the intersection of AI, chip policy, and corporate strategy in the current tech landscape.",
