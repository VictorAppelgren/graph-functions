  "description": "London-based startup Throxy raises $6.2 million to replace AI sales tools with a human-first outbound model targeting manufacturing, logistics, and traditional industries.",
  "content": "A London-based startup is betting that artificial intelligence has created more problems than solutions in sales automation, raising $6.2 million to target some of the economy's most lucrative but hard-to-reach industries with a decidedly human-first approach.\n\n, which provides fully managed outbound sales services for companies selling into traditional sectors like manufacturing, logistics and medical equipment, closed the seed round led by with participation from . The funding comes as the three-year-old company claims to have reached $1.5 million in annual recurring revenue with just three employees \u2014 a ratio that would make even Silicon Valley's most efficient startups envious.\n\nThe company's emergence highlights a growing backlash against the proliferation of AI-powered sales tools that promise automation but often deliver . While venture capitalists have poured billions into AI sales development representatives (SDRs) and automated outreach platforms, Throxy's founders argue these tools have fundamentally missed their mark.\n\n\"AI-generated messaging does not resonate a lot with the market, and it's not very effective,\" said Pablo Jim\u00e9nez de Parga Ramos, Throxy's co-founder, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"We barely use AI there. We think the best messages, at least as in today, are generated by humans.\"\n\nWhy manufacturers and logistics firms can't find good sales leads\n\nThe challenge aims to solve stems from a fundamental mismatch between modern sales technology and traditional industries that form the backbone of the global economy. Companies selling software or services to manufacturers, distributors, healthcare providers and logistics firms struggle to find and reach decision makers who often have minimal digital footprints.\n\n\"One of the biggest issues for sales teams is people don't have enough pipeline,\" Jim\u00e9nez de Parga explained. Having worked at three business-to-business software companies from seed stage to Series D, he witnessed the same problem repeatedly: sales teams spending up to 70% of their time on prospecting rather than closing deals.\n\nThe root issue is data scarcity. While LinkedIn boasts 1.1 billion users globally, Throxy has built a database of over 4 billion contacts by mining public company registries, government databases and other sources that traditional sales tools ignore. In the United Kingdom alone, contains information on 6 million businesses, most of which never appear in conventional lead generation platforms.\n\n\"Every single country has company registers,\" Jim\u00e9nez de Parga noted. \"Every single company also has directors, and all that information is publicly available and you can download it. Yet at my previous companies, we were not using that.\"\n\nThis data advantage becomes particularly valuable in traditional industries where employee tenure spans decades rather than years. \"In traditional spaces, people stay \u2014 if you find information about a person in 2011, they're probably still there,\" he said.\n\nHow Throxy beats AI tools by using real humans\n\n, a partner at Base10 Partners who led the investment, said Throxy's focus on underserved industries represents a massive market opportunity that established players have largely ignored.\n\n\"The market is almost laughably large \u2014 even just focusing on US and EU businesses in a couple of traditional industries like manufacturing, logistics, and distribution results in hundreds of thousands of companies with a real willingness to buy,\" Broder told VentureBeat.\n\nWhat sets Throxy apart is not just its data sources but its business model. Rather than selling software licenses or charging monthly fees, the company operates on a pay-for-results basis. Clients only pay when Throxy books qualified meetings with genuine prospects.\n\n\"What is a qualified meeting for you? Forget what we think. What is it for you?\" Jim\u00e9nez de Parga explained. \"Whatever that qualified meeting is for you is what we'll adhere to, and that's why we never have problems.\"\n\nThis approach addresses a longstanding misalignment in sales organizations, where marketing-qualified leads often fail to convert and sales development representatives clash with account executives over lead quality. By tying payment directly to outcomes, Throxy forces itself to maintain rigorous standards while giving clients predictable returns on investment.\n\nThe model appears to be working. , which makes AI-powered quoting software for computer numerical control manufacturers, reported generating three to five qualified meetings per week consistently after partnering with Throxy. \"The manufacturing industry is one of the toughest markets to crack \u2014 it's complex and relationship driven,\" said Niklas Gerlach, Imnoo's chief operating officer. \"With Throxy as our partner, we're starting real conversations with prospects we know will be interested.\"\n\nThroxy's approach puts it in direct competition with established giants like , and newer AI-powered entrants that have raised hundreds of millions in venture funding. But Broder argues that incumbents face structural disadvantages in addressing traditional industries.\n\n\"Incumbents like Salesforce and HubSpot are wed to their seat-based pricing model, both in how they charge customers, but also in how they build product,\" she said. \"From a technical perspective, they are building AI features on top of their core, but have not built the product to support that from the ground up.\"\n\nThe founders' contrarian stance extends to their view of the broader AI sales automation trend. In a blog post titled \" ,\" Jim\u00e9nez de Parga argued that most AI sales tools create more noise than value, contributing to email saturation that makes it harder for legitimate outreach to break through.\n\n\"The rise of AI tools has unleashed a flood of content, automation, and accessibility, saturating every digital space with endless streams of information,\" he wrote. \"The industry may, ironically, be worsening the very problem it set out to solve.\"\n\nThis philosophy translates into Throxy's operational approach. While the company uses artificial intelligence for data processing and lead qualification, human experts craft all outreach messages and manage client relationships. The company describes itself as providing \" \" rather than traditional Software-as-a-Service.\n\nThe challenge facing is whether its high-touch, human-centric approach can scale efficiently enough to justify venture capital investment. Traditional software companies can serve thousands of customers with relatively small teams, but service businesses typically require linear scaling of human resources.\n\nJim\u00e9nez de Parga addresses this concern by pointing to the company's track record of reaching $1.5 million in revenue with three people \u2014 a feat accomplished by using their own platform to generate all of the company's sales pipeline.\n\n\"We use our own product extensively. We have never spent money on ads because we believe all of our pipeline should be generated by our own product,\" he said. \"If we can't generate leads for ourselves, how can we do it well for our customers?\"\n\nThe company plans to use its new funding to expand headcount by nearly five times, focusing on hiring additional human experts who can manage larger portfolios of clients while maintaining personalization quality.\n\nBase10's Broder said she's not concerned about scalability challenges. \"This is a forcing function for the business to find product-market fit and build something people want faster,\" she explained. \"Tying revenue to results puts a lot of confidence in the team and in the product.\"\n\nThroxy's success could signal a broader shift in enterprise sales technology, where the pendulum swings back toward human expertise augmented by artificial intelligence rather than AI attempting to replace human judgment entirely.\n\nThis trend aligns with growing customer fatigue over automated outreach. Research suggests that positive reply rates for cold emails significantly as AI-powered tools flood inboxes with generic messages that recipients can easily identify as automated.\n\n\"I think we're seeing a lot of AI agents, but there's not a lot of AI agents replying to these,\" Jim\u00e9nez de Parga predicted. \"I think there's going to start becoming, at some point, that there's going to be some sort of AI negotiation.\"\n\nFor traditional industries specifically, the implications could be profound. Manufacturing, logistics, healthcare and other sectors have historically lagged in technology adoption, creating opportunities for companies that can bridge the digital divide with human expertise.\n\nThe pay-for-results model may also gain traction more broadly as companies face pressure to demonstrate clear returns on marketing and sales investments. In an economic environment where customer acquisition costs continue rising, outcome-based pricing offers a way to align vendor incentives with customer success.\n\nThroxy graduated from alongside companies like , which raised $50 million for AI sales development representatives \u2014 representing the exact opposite approach to sales automation. As both companies scale, they'll test competing visions for the future of enterprise sales.\n\nThe winner may determine whether the next generation of sales technology amplifies human capabilities or attempts to replace them entirely. If Throxy succeeds, it could prove that in the age of artificial intelligence, the most disruptive innovation is putting humans back in charge.",

      "text": "Why AI SDRs Matter \u2013 and What They\u2019re Missing\nAI SDRs are promised to revolutionise sales, but are they solving core challenges or adding more noise?\nAI SDRs are generating a lot of hype lately, with notable players like 11x raising $50 million and Artisan raising $11 million as investors back bold promises of fully automated sales. The pitch is enticing: AI SDRs aim to handle lead sourcing, outreach, and follow-up to book meetings with your ideal customers, automating what was traditionally manual and resource-intensive. But are they genuinely addressing the core challenges faced by sales teams, or just offering another automation layer dressed in AI jargon?\nOne of the first principles I learned early on is to \u201cbe greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.\u201d When I see massive funding rounds on such quick timelines, my instinct is to be cautious. Sustainable, profitable businesses aren\u2019t built on hype alone; they emerge from a deep understanding of the problem space and delivering real value to end-users. I think AI SDRs haven't yet cracked the problem-space and I'll explain why.\nAt their essence, AI SDRs tap into lead databases like Apollo, pull contact information, conduct basic prospect research, and craft a \"personalised\" message using AI-driven prompts. From there, they generate sequences of emails designed to convert leads into meetings. But when we look under the hood, these tools resemble automation scripts more than intelligent systems\u2014more code than AI. The actual \u201cAI\u201d component handles message creation and limited research, with much of the real sales legwork and strategy still left untouched.\nThis raises a critical question: Are AI SDRs transformative, or are they merely automating the superficial aspects of outreach without solving the deep-seated challenges of sales itself? A closer look suggests that many AI SDRs fall short of the true potential of AI in sales, highlighting the need for a more thoughtful, human-centred approach.\nProblem 1: Overgeneralising Complex Sales Needs\nEvery organisation is different, and so is every sales cycle. Yet, a fundamental flaw in many AI SDR solutions is their overgeneralisation of sales processes. The typical pitch promises to solve \"the problem of templated outreach,\" claiming that AI-driven personalisation\u2014gathering some research and context to craft a better cold email\u2014outshines human capability. But here\u2019s the catch: even the most perfectly crafted message is meaningless if it\u2019s sent to the wrong person. If the recipient isn\u2019t the ideal customer profile (ICP), the quality of the message won\u2019t make a difference.\nProblem 2: Product Quality Concerns\nTo compensate for their limitations, many AI SDRs resort to brute-force tactics, deploying high volumes of messages to maximise reach across the TAM. While this \u201cspray and pray\u201d approach may yield some leads, it carries a serious cost: it risks brand reputation and long-term prospect relationships by prioritising quantity over quality. This kind of indiscriminate outreach quickly alienates prospects, reduces engagement rates, and exhausts valuable leads, leading to diminishing returns.\nThe core issue is that most AI SDRs rely on shallow automation, with simple sequencing tools and minimal AI \u201cdusting\u201d that adds little real value to the process. It\u2019s more a facade of intelligence than true innovation. This superficial automation approach not only fails to address the deeper challenges in sales but can actively harm clients\u2019 sales efforts by creating noise without genuine insight or adaptation. Effective sales development requires precision, strategic thinking, and genuine relationship-building\u2014qualities often lacking in these high-volume, low-touch AI solutions.\nProblem 3: Wrong Focus Area\nWhere AI could add real value is not just in automating outreach but in synthesising large volumes of data to fine-tune lead identification. AI's strength should be in spotting patterns, uncovering prospects previously overlooked, and highlighting specific touchpoints unique to each lead\u2014areas a human SDR might miss. This ability to deliver precision rather than simply amplify volume represents the real transformative potential of AI in sales. Instead of repeating SaaS\u2019s mistake of one-size-fits-all solutions, AI SDRs need to prioritise specificity, enabling sales teams to target with purpose and relevance, rather than just frequency.\nProblem 4: Premature Product Expansion\nMany AI SDR companies are branching out too quickly, rolling out new products like AI cold callers or AI marketers before refining their core offering. This scattershot approach dilutes their focus, as they jump from one feature to the next without fully solving the foundational issues faced by sales teams. Rather than expanding prematurely, these companies would benefit from adopting the principle of \"Take a simple, basic idea, and take it very seriously.\"\nThe real value lies in mastering one specific area\u2014whether it\u2019s outreach automation, lead qualification, or messaging personalisation\u2014before diversifying. By focusing deeply on solving a single aspect of the sales process, AI SDRs could bring genuine innovation and quality to market, rather than spreading themselves thin across features that feel half-baked and ultimately fail to deliver on their promises.\nProblem 5: Wrong Brand Positioning\nAI SDRs are currently positioning themselves to appeal to highly tech-enabled companies\u2014organisations that already use sophisticated tools and automation for their sales processes. But this approach neglects a massive segment of the market: traditional, non-tech-enabled industries where AI-driven sales development could make a real impact. Industries like manufacturing, maritime, financial services, and advisory have substantial sales needs, but they often rely on personal, human-centred outreach and relationship building. These sectors aren\u2019t clamouring for automation that bypasses the human touch, especially not from AI avatars.\nThe brand positioning of many AI SDRs only exacerbates this disconnect. An AI avatar as the \u201cface\u201d of a sales process may appeal to tech-savvy sectors, but it misses the mark for industries still anchored in personal rapport and trust. For example, I recently spoke with a Slovenian pallet manufacturer with contract values exceeding $1 million, a company unfamiliar with most digital sales tools. They\u2019re wary even of entrusting outreach to another human, let alone a fully automated AI avatar. The result? AI SDRs often fail to address the real pain points of industries where they could provide the most transformative value by targeting only those already tech-enabled.\nAI SDRs need to rethink their approach, adjusting their branding to appeal to organisations that prioritise human relationships in sales. Rather than pushing avatars, AI SDRs should position themselves as tools that augment human-led outreach, providing value by blending AI\u2019s efficiency with a human\u2019s relational expertise.\nA Better Way Forward: Service-as-a-Software (SaaS 2.0)\nAs I\u2019ve spoken about before on LinkedIn, the future is shifting towards \u201cService-as-a-Software\u201d (SaaS 2.0) rather than traditional Software-as-a-Service. Unlike SaaS, which often piles on more tools, Service-as-a-Software outsources the outcome entirely, allowing companies to sidestep technology complexity. This model isn\u2019t about offering more tools\u2014it\u2019s about delivering outcomes, a direction that the original SaaS should have embraced. While the software market is large, the service market (i.e. labour market) is manitudes larger, presenting massive opportunities for disruption.\nWhere traditional agencies are constrained by human capital bottlenecks in tasks like research and data synthesis, an AI-driven workforce can automate these processes, freeing humans to focus on what they excel at\u2014using intuition and fostering relationships.\nConsider this example: a traditional setup might require one employee to serve every five clients to maintain a high-touch experience. However, an AI-empowered agency could enable one employee to manage over 5 times the clients, significantly reducing operational costs while enhancing scalability and personalisation. With the advent of Service-as-a-Software, companies no longer need to manage complex tech stacks; instead, they can seamlessly outsource the entire service, shifting focus solely to outcomes.\nOur take: While every business needs a salesperson, not every business needs a sales tool.\nService-as-a-Software provides a scalable, high-touch solution, marrying AI-driven efficiency with human expertise\u2014achieving cost-efficiency without sacrificing depth or relational impact. This is the new standard, empowering businesses to scale, grow, and prioritise outcomes in ways traditional SaaS or agencies simply cannot. While a SaaS model could scale to even more clients per support employee, it often sacrifices the relationship-driven service that many clients still value.\nThe future of business isn\u2019t just software or service. It\u2019s a fusion of both.\n\"AI eats software, now salaries + services\"\nTo disrupt the labour market, you need to actually provide a labour service with real people in the foreground.\nThe AI-agency model, therefore, represents a scalable, high-touch solution\u2014one that balances cost-efficiency with the depth of personalised support. It brings the best of both worlds, leveraging AI to extend the agency\u2019s capacity for managing more clients at lower costs, without losing the relational aspects critical to successful, long-term client partnerships. This is the new standard, empowering agencies to deliver growth, scale, and personalisation where it was once impossible.\nThe Paradox: Cluttered Inboxes and Diminishing Returns\nThe rise of AI tools has unleashed a flood of content, automation, and accessibility, saturating every digital space with endless streams of information. These tools promise efficiency and scale, but in doing so, they create a paradox: as content becomes abundant, meaningful connections become scarce. AI-driven interactions, once novel, now overflow in our inboxes, notifications, and feeds, making it harder to discern what truly matters. The industry may, ironically, be worsening the very problem it set out to solve.\nIn this era of media saturation, our finite attention becomes the most valuable asset. People are naturally starting to seek authenticity amid the noise. This abundance prompts a shift from quantity to quality, as individuals crave genuine connection, thoughtful engagement, and clarity. The real opportunity isn\u2019t in automating for sheer output\u2014it\u2019s in using AI to cultivate deeper, more meaningful interactions. Those who embrace this shift, harnessing technology for value over volume, will lead the way in a cluttered digital landscape.\nThe commoditisation risk with AI SDRs is real\u2014over-reliance on scripts leads to robotic, repetitive interactions, stripping away authenticity. As more companies adopt similar AI-driven processes, differentiation fades, and brands risk blending into a sea of sameness. To stand out, AI should enhance, not replace, the human touch, blending efficiency with personalised nuance to avoid falling into a commoditised rut.\nI believe we\u2019re coming full circle: in-person relationships will regain importance. COVID led to a distancing of people and services, yet in an era of overwhelming abundance, people search for authenticity.\nWith infinite channels, reach, and repetition at everyone\u2019s fingertips, true value no longer lies in creating more but in creating with purpose. This saturation era will usher in a return to relationships, to messages that matter, and to trust built over time. The real opportunity is with those who view AI not as a means to increase volume but as a means to elevate value\u2014those who use it to enhance connections rather than automate them.\nWhy This Matters: The Role of Technology as an Uplifting Force\nAt its core, technology exists to uplift society, to make life better, faster, and more affordable. It\u2019s a function of exchange\u2014a way for humanity to trade knowledge for progress in one of the few truly positive-sum games.\nTechnology, at its core, is the transformation of knowledge and imagination into tools, processes, and systems that amplify human capabilities and remove limitations. It\u2019s humanity\u2019s way of overcoming constraints\u2014physical, cognitive, and social\u2014by creating solutions that extend what we can achieve alone. Beyond practicality, technology reflects our values and aspirations; it\u2019s a multiplier that frees us from repetitive tasks, allowing time for creativity, learning, and exploration. The direction technology takes mirrors our priorities, embodying both our potential and our responsibility. At its best, technology reshapes human experience by creating new possibilities and expanding what it means to live and work meaningfully.\nOf course, technology can bring unintended consequences, such as social media\u2019s role in promoting addictive behaviours. And there are real ethical concerns\u2014job displacement, for example, is a reality. Companies may claim to \u201cempower\u201d employees, but with targets like revenue per employee in mind, increased efficiencies often mean fewer jobs. Sales, a field built on human connection, risks losing its relational edge as AI handles more interactions. Over time, replacing human roles with AI could result in a salesforce less attuned to the psychological nuances essential to meaningful client relationships.\nThis is why it falls on conscientious technologists to steer innovation with intention, thinking beyond hype and short-term gains. We may not foresee every impact, but the difference between a quick fix and a long-term solution is usually clear. It\u2019s our job to drive technology forward with a mindful approach\u2014one that prioritises lasting benefit and genuine human progress.\nWhat shall we do?\nNow while I understand this blog post pay offend a lot of people building in this space - don't take it as that. This is just my perspective on the industry itself - I may be wrong, and I'm willing to be wrong. But thinking from first principles something just doesn't add up for me.\nSo, what does that mean for what we\u2019re doing at Throxy? For us, it\u2019s about keeping things as straightforward as possible:\nSetting the right values from the outset\u2014knowing what we\u2019re doing and why.\nEmbracing long-term thinking.\nCollaborating closely with customers to solve their real problems, step by step.\nAligning our brand with our customers' needs and aspirations.\nDeeply understanding the problem space to create solutions that genuinely work for them, not just products that work for us."

      "text": "Cold email response rates in 2025 highlight a growing divide between average campaigns and top performers. While most campaigns see reply rates between 1% and 8.5%, highly targeted and personalized efforts achieve rates as high as 40%\u201350%.\nKey insights:\nDeliverability remains critical. Proper email infrastructure, including authentication and spam avoidance, can improve response rates by up to 30.5%. Tools like Mailforge simplify scaling outreach while maintaining email quality.\nCold email success in 2025 depends on precise targeting, meaningful personalization, and strong technical execution.\nThe 2025 cold email landscape paints a stark contrast between average outreach efforts and campaigns that excel. While many businesses grapple with low response rates, top performers are breaking through by focusing on relevance and personalization rather than sheer volume.\nCold email response rates typically range from 1% to 8.5%, with an average of 4.1% [12, 14]. However, outliers in this spectrum reveal a growing divide - top campaigns are achieving response rates as high as 40% to 50%.\nOne key factor is campaign size. Smaller, highly targeted campaigns (50 recipients or fewer) yield an average response rate of 5.8%, whereas larger campaigns with over 1,000 recipients drop to just 2.1%. This trend underscores the importance of quality over quantity, as precision targeting not only boosts response rates but also enhances the effectiveness of personalized strategies.\nOther metrics provide additional context. Open rates hover around 23.9%, and click-through rates fall between 2% and 5%. These figures highlight the challenges of not only getting emails opened but also driving meaningful engagement further down the funnel.\nPersonalization has emerged as a game-changer in cold email success. Personalized emails increase response rates by approximately 32%, while subject lines tailored to the recipient can boost open rates by 50% and replies by up to 140%.\nAdvances in AI-driven tools are making personalization at scale more achievable than ever. These platforms can analyze up to 50 data points per prospect in seconds, enabling businesses to craft emails that feel genuinely tailored. Companies leveraging these tools report response rates as high as 35%, which is seven times higher than traditional methods.\nHowever, personalization goes beyond technology. It\u2019s about demonstrating a deep understanding of the recipient's business. Research shows that 78% of decision-makers are more likely to respond to emails that showcase this understanding. This explains why superficial efforts, like using the recipient\u2019s first name, are no longer enough to stand out.\nDespite inbox saturation and spam filters, cold email remains a favored communication method for business decision-makers. In fact, 61% of decision-makers prefer cold emails as their primary communication channel [13, 14]. The challenge isn\u2019t the medium itself - it\u2019s how it\u2019s being used.\nDecision-makers are selective about what they engage with. Only 24% say they receive a truly valuable email at least once a week. The primary reason for ignoring emails? Lack of relevance. A staggering 71% cite irrelevance as the top reason for not responding.\nEmail length also plays a critical role. Messages between 50 and 125 words achieve reply rates of about 50%, showing that concise, focused communication resonates far better than lengthy pitches.\nThese insights reflect a broader shift in B2B communication. Decision-makers are looking for emails that respect their time, address their specific challenges, and offer clear value. The most successful campaigns in 2025 are those that align with these preferences while leveraging technology to deliver personalized, impactful messages at scale.\nCold email performance varies widely across industries, offering valuable insights for businesses to refine their outreach strategies and set realistic expectations.\nNonprofit organizations, museums, and religious institutions lead the pack with reply rates exceeding 16.5%. Their success often stems from mission-driven messaging and less crowded inboxes, giving them a natural edge in engagement.\nReligious organizations top open rates at an impressive 59.70%, followed by hobbies (53.33%) and nonprofits (53.21%). Art galleries and museums also perform well, boasting open rates of 52.07%. These numbers reflect a high level of interest and connection with their audiences.\n| Industry Category | Open Rate | Click Rate |\n|---|---|---|\n| Religion | 59.70% | 2.99% |\n| Hobbies | 53.33% | 4.36% |\n| Nonprofit | 53.21% | 3.25% |\n| Art gallery and museum | 52.07% | 3.15% |\n| Health and fitness | 48.90% | 1.74% |\nLegal services stand out with the highest commercial response rates at 10%. This reflects the relationship-driven nature of the legal field, where professionals actively seek specialized expertise and partnerships.\nE-Learning and EdTech companies also perform well, achieving response rates of 7.8%. This is fueled by growing interest in education solutions and professional development. Similarly, the chemical industry sees strong engagement, with response rates at 7.3%, likely due to the niche and specialized nature of its B2B interactions.\nThese benchmarks provide context for understanding how technology-focused industries compare.\nIn contrast to high-performing sectors, B2B technology and SaaS companies face unique hurdles, particularly due to inbox saturation. Response rates in these industries typically range from 1.87% to 3.5%, falling below the overall average of 5.1%.\nBreaking it down further, IT Services and Consulting firms report response rates of 3.5%, Biotechnology companies see rates around 3.2%, and software companies struggle with rates below 1%. Financial services fare slightly better, with a moderate 3.39% response rate, outpacing the technology sector's 1.87%. These figures highlight the challenges tech professionals face in cutting through inbox noise and capturing attention.\nWhen targeting executives, outreach strategies need to account for their higher engagement levels. C-level executives respond 23% more often than non-C-suite employees, with response rates of 6.4% compared to 5.2%. Managers and leads, by contrast, trail behind at 3.45%.\nThis elevated responsiveness among executives makes sense - they\u2019re decision-makers with the authority to act swiftly on relevant opportunities. However, reaching them effectively isn\u2019t easy. Nearly 37% of decision-makers receive over 10 cold emails each week, with most being irrelevant.\n\"Executives aren't simply dealing with 'more work' or 'new challenges.' They're navigating a fundamental transformation of the decision-making environment - faster cycles, higher stakes, and less certainty.\"\n\u2013 Icertis Leadership Survey\nTiming and relevance are critical for successful C-level outreach. Emails sent early in the day, between 6\u20139 AM, tend to see higher reply rates. Additionally, 57% of C-level and VP buyers favor phone calls, suggesting that a multi-channel approach can be more effective. As executives grapple with challenges like tariffs, AI, and business transformation heading into 2025, tailored outreach that directly addresses these issues is more likely to resonate.\nBoosting your cold email response rates often comes down to a mix of strategy and precision. By focusing on subject lines, follow-up timing, and targeted outreach, you can dramatically improve your email performance.\nYour subject line is your first impression, and it matters - a lot. In fact, 33% of people decide whether to open an email based solely on the subject line. So, getting it right is non-negotiable.\nPersonalization is key. Emails with personalized subject lines see a 50% increase in open rates, and adding the recipient's company name can bump that up by another 22%. Numbers and questions also grab attention, so consider incorporating them into your subject lines.\nKeep it short - under 50 characters - to ensure it displays well on mobile devices. Avoid spammy words like \"free\", \"act now\", or \"guaranteed\", as these can send your email straight to the junk folder. Instead, focus on addressing a specific problem or goal your recipient cares about.\nThe best subject lines combine personalization with clear value. For example, instead of a generic \"Quick question\" or \"Following up\", try something like \"How [Company Name] can reduce churn\" or \"3 ways [Industry] companies are cutting costs in 2025.\"\nOnce you\u2019ve nailed the subject line, the next step is perfecting your follow-up strategy.\nFollow-ups are where many cold email campaigns succeed - or fail. Sending two to three follow-up emails, starting three days after your initial message, can increase response rates by up to 65.8%. Mid-mornings on Tuesdays or Thursdays tend to work best.\nHere\u2019s the breakdown: the first follow-up can boost replies by 49%, while the second adds another 3%. However, a third follow-up often sees diminishing returns, with effectiveness dropping by about 30%. Sending too many follow-ups can also risk your emails being flagged as spam, so keep it measured.\nStructure your follow-ups thoughtfully:\nPay attention to engagement signals. If someone opens your email but doesn\u2019t reply, adjust the timing of your next follow-up. If your emails aren\u2019t getting opened at all, it might be time to rework your subject line or try a different send time.\nReaching the right people is just as important as what you say. A whopping 71% of decision-makers ignore cold emails because they find them irrelevant. That\u2019s why precise targeting is crucial.\nThe sweet spot for outreach is contacting 2\u20134 people within the same company, which yields a response rate of 7.8%. Reaching out to 5\u201310 individuals, on the other hand, drops the response rate to just 2.5%. Clearly, less is more when it comes to targeting.\nSegmenting your campaigns can also make a big difference, boosting open rates by 14.31%. Tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator can help you refine your target list for more personalized outreach.\n\"The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.\" - Dale Carnegie\nEven the most well-crafted email won\u2019t make an impact if it never reaches the recipient\u2019s inbox. In 2025, email infrastructure and deliverability have become critical factors that can determine the success - or failure - of your cold email campaigns.\nDeliverability is the backbone of any cold email strategy. You can have the most engaging subject lines and personalized content, but if your emails land in the spam folder, they\u2019ll likely never be seen.\nThe numbers tell the story: average response rates for cold emails range from 1% to 12%, but a 2025 study by Backlinko reveals that only 8.5% of outreach emails actually get a reply. Every email that ends up in spam represents a missed opportunity to connect.\nEnsuring proper technical setup is key to avoiding these pitfalls. Configurations like DNS records, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, SSL certificates, and bounce tracking all signal to email providers that you\u2019re a legitimate sender. These measures help prevent your emails from being flagged as spam.\nPremium deliverability tools can make a real difference. Features like automated DNS setup simplify the process of configuring authentication records, while domain masking helps protect your sender reputation. Emails optimized for deliverability can see response rates increase by as much as 30.5%. These improvements not only enhance individual campaigns but also make it easier to scale outreach efforts effectively.\nSpam filters have become more aggressive than ever in 2025, scrutinizing even legitimate cold emails. That\u2019s why having a solid infrastructure and strong deliverability practices isn\u2019t just a nice-to-have - it\u2019s essential.\nSolid deliverability practices are the foundation for scaling cold email campaigns.\nWhen you\u2019re sending just a handful of emails, managing your email infrastructure manually might be manageable. But scaling beyond a few dozen emails per day introduces a host of challenges: creating multiple domains, setting up mailboxes, configuring DNS records, and maintaining proper authentication for hundreds - or even thousands - of sending addresses quickly becomes overwhelming.\nThis is where tools like Mailforge come into play. Mailforge simplifies scaling by allowing users to create and manage hundreds or even thousands of domains and mailboxes in just minutes. It automates key tasks like DNS setup, SSL configuration, domain masking, and bulk DNS updates, taking care of the technical complexities so you can focus on your outreach strategy.\nThe shared infrastructure model that Mailforge offers is a game-changer. Instead of requiring manual setup for each campaign or team, the platform enables centralized management of large-scale outreach efforts. This approach reduces operational headaches, minimizes errors, and ensures that best practices for deliverability are consistently applied across all campaigns.\nMailforge is also highly adaptable, working seamlessly with any sending software. Whether you\u2019re an agency handling campaigns for multiple clients, a startup ramping up outreach, or a large enterprise coordinating efforts across departments, Mailforge integrates smoothly into your existing workflow.\nFor businesses serious about scaling, the benefits are clear. Mailforge offers enterprise-level infrastructure at an accessible price, starting at $13 per mailbox slot per month (billed annually, with a minimum of 10 slots). For added security and professionalism, SSL and domain masking are available for just $6 per domain per year. By automating the most time-consuming aspects of email infrastructure, Mailforge helps businesses overcome deliverability challenges and achieve consistent campaign success.\nCold email continues to prove itself as a powerful growth tool in 2025, with top campaigns achieving reply rates between 40% and 50%. In some standout cases, reply rates can even climb to 60% when the focus shifts from sheer volume to delivering high-quality outreach efforts.\nThe key to success lies in addressing specific business needs through thoughtful and strategic personalization. Companies leveraging AI-driven personalization tools are seeing response rates as high as 35%, which is a staggering seven times higher than traditional methods.\nMultichannel outreach has also become a game-changer. By integrating email with LinkedIn outreach and other touchpoints, businesses have seen customer engagement jump by 287% and conversion rates climb by 300%. However, this approach demands strong technical execution to ensure every touchpoint performs effectively.\nTechnical precision is just as important as crafting compelling content. Issues like poor email authentication, improper domain management, or flawed infrastructure can ruin even the most carefully planned campaigns.\nStrategic follow-ups are another essential ingredient for success. Well-timed, value-driven follow-ups can push reply rates past 20%. Instead of repeating the same pitch, each follow-up should offer fresh value or insights to keep the conversation moving forward.\nFor businesses aiming to scale their outreach, tools like Mailforge simplify the process by automating domain and mailbox management. This ensures reliable email deliverability while reducing manual workload. When combined with smart personalization, effective follow-ups, and a solid technical foundation, cold email campaigns can achieve remarkable results.\nThe future of cold email belongs to companies that embrace strategic personalization, adopt multichannel tactics, and invest in robust technical infrastructure. By focusing on these core elements, businesses can continue to see impressive returns, even in an increasingly competitive landscape.\nTo make cold emails more effective in 2025, focus on crafting messages that feel personal and relevant to the person you're reaching out to. Start by using their name, referencing specific accomplishments or interests, and showing a real understanding of their challenges or goals. These small, thoughtful details can make your emails feel more genuine and relatable.\nSkip the generic mass emails - they rarely leave a good impression. Instead, aim for highly targeted, conversational messages tailored to the recipient\u2019s industry or role. Tools like Mailforge can help manage large-scale outreach while keeping your messages personalized and meaningful. Putting in the effort to make your emails feel human can lead to better response rates and stronger connections.\nTo ensure your cold emails land in inboxes in 2025, start with the technical essentials: set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. These authentication protocols not only verify your emails but also safeguard your sender reputation. Another must? Gradually warm up your domains and IPs to build trust with email providers, especially if you're ramping up outreach.\nKeep an eye on bounce rates and spam complaints, and regularly clean your email lists to remove invalid addresses and avoid spam traps. These steps are crucial in a landscape where email security and sender trust are more critical than ever.\nWhen it comes to email campaigns, smaller and highly targeted efforts tend to perform better. Why? Because they zero in on specific audience segments, making it possible to deliver personalized and relevant messages. These tailored messages are more likely to catch the recipient's attention and prompt them to take action.\nAnother advantage of targeted campaigns is their ability to build trust and stronger connections with your audience. By addressing the unique needs or interests of each group, these emails feel thoughtful rather than generic. This approach often results in higher open rates and more meaningful interactions."

      "text": "The artificial intelligence train may have left the station, but where is it heading? For sales teams, AI has already supercharged workflows, automated outreach, and amplified communication \u2013 turning what was traditionally manual door-to-door engagement into bot-selling at scale, using AI to draft emails, schedule follow-ups, and analyze engagement metrics \u2013 but is that a good thing? The answer is \u2013 it depends.\nIn theory, this should be a golden age for sales \u2013 more outreach, more engagement, more opportunities. But the reality is more complicated. When everyone has access to the same AI tools, the result isn\u2019t necessarily more meaningful engagement; it\u2019s an avalanche of automation that overwhelms rather than builds relationships.\nOne of the central issues is that AI-driven automation is largely designed with sellers, rather than buyers, in mind. In a report about the B2B sales cycle, Gartner revealed that only 17% of a buying cycle includes meetings and interactions with \u2013 and assisted for \u2013 the seller. And not just the seller who wins \u2013 that statistic includes all the sellers competing for a contract.\nThis is the tip of the iceberg that sales teams see. The other 83% comprises interactions, research, and meetings that occur only on the buyer\u2019s side. So why is so much attention given to the former?\nAutomation is a force for good, but pursued blindly without a proper strategy, and with only sellers in mind, it can quickly derail the sales cycle. It puts sales teams on a path where selling goes from being slow but highly controlled and tailored to being lightning fast but also chaotic and overwhelming to buyers.\nThis is the \u201cAI Cliff\u201d \u2013 the moment where the benefits of automation begin to erode the very productivity they were designed to boost. It isn\u2019t the technology that is at fault, but rather how it\u2019s deployed and utilized.\nAI Hype and the Road to Disillusionment\nThe rapid rise of AI in sales has followed a familiar trajectory \u2013 one that closely mirrors Gartner\u2019s Hype Cycle, a framework that maps the journey of new technologies from initial excitement to practical reality. Right now, AI sits at the \u201cPeak of Inflated Expectations,\u201d where bold predictions and ambitious promises have created the belief that automation is the ultimate sales accelerator.\nOrganizations have rushed to adopt AI tools, expecting them to revolutionize how deals are closed and relationships are built. But as with any technology, the real test comes when the excitement fades, and teams are left to navigate the fallout.\nThis phase has already started to materialize. While AI has undoubtedly increased output, its impact on outcomes is less clear. More automation doesn\u2019t automatically translate to better engagement or higher win rates. Instead, many sales teams are beginning to recognize that their efforts produce diminishing returns.\nBuyers are inundated with AI-generated messages and out-of-context action points, making it harder \u2013 not easier \u2013 for sales professionals. When applied indiscriminately, AI risks turning sales into a \u201cvolume game\u201d where efficiency is prioritized over effectiveness. More automation doesn\u2019t mean more sales \u2013 it just means more noise.\nOn the Edge of the AI Cliff\nThe promise of AI in sales was to streamline processes, eliminate inefficiencies, and create more personalized, high-impact interactions. Instead, it has flooded inboxes with generic, automated messages that lack originality and depth. What was once a differentiator\u2014precision, timing, and personalization\u2014has now become the bare minimum.\nBuyers, rather than feeling engaged, are tuning out. This is the AI Cliff: the moment when automation stops enhancing productivity and starts working against it. Instead of focusing on quality interactions, sales teams have been conditioned to believe that more automation equals more success.\nWhen every seller is equipped with the same AI tools, differentiation disappears, and buyer fatigue sets in. Volume over substance is no longer a winning formula. Instead of leaping off the cliff, buyers can take a different path \u2013 one that uses AI not as a mere amplification or automation tool.\nJust as a matchmaker, using tailored content and context-aware insights on the side of both buyer and seller to preserve the personal approach. By using AI to champion buyers and make their roles easier, sellers can reduce friction and increase engagement instead of simply pushing for higher numbers.\nShifting Focus from Sellers to Buyers\nFor all the investment in AI-driven sales tools, one critical factor has been largely ignored: the buyer\u2019s experience. Most AI implementations are designed to optimize seller efficiency \u2013 helping teams send more emails, automate follow-ups, and streamline internal workflows. But buyers don\u2019t need more emails.\nAnd they don\u2019t need more outreach. They need better ways to navigate the complexity of their own decision-making process. 83% of the buying process occurs outside direct interactions with sellers, meaning most sales enablement tools solve only a tiny fraction of the equation.\nWhile sellers benefit from AI-assisted automation, buyers are left to sift through mountains of information, manage internal approvals, and justify their choices \u2013 often with little support. This is what we mean when discussing the need to \u201cchampion\u201d buyers.\nInstead of focusing exclusively on seller productivity and barrelling toward the AI cliff, AI should help buyers consolidate key materials, track commitments, and uncover insights that help them advocate for their decisions internally.\nAI should make it easier for buyers to access the right information at the right time \u2013 whether that\u2019s a pricing breakdown, a case study that resonates with leadership, or an easily accessible summary of every discussion in context. Sales in 2025 isn\u2019t really about pitching \u2013 it\u2019s about helping buyers confidently make decisions.\nIf AI is to truly transform sales for the better, it needs to serve both sides of the table, not just one."

  "argos_summary": "London\u2011based startup Throxy raised $6.2\u202fmillion to offer a pay\u2011per\u2011meeting outbound sales service that relies on human outreach rather than AI automation. The firm targets hard\u2011to\u2011reach traditional sectors such as manufacturing, logistics and medical equipment, building a proprietary database from public registries to deliver highly personalized messaging. With three employees and $1.5\u202fmillion ARR, Throxy claims its model boosts qualified meetings and reduces the 70\u202f% prospecting burden that plagues conventional sales teams. The funding signals a shift toward outcome\u2011based, human\u2011centric sales solutions amid growing skepticism of AI\u2011driven SDR tools.",
