  "description": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene buys Google stock just days before a key antitrust ruling. See her latest trades and portfolio performance.",
  "content": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) purchased shares in Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet Inc. Class C, just five days before a significant court ruling that caused the company\u2019s stock to surge. The trade was part of a larger buying spree on Aug. 28, 2025, where the congresswoman invested in over a dozen different companies.\n\nAccording to a financial disclosure filed with the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Rep. Greene purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 of Alphabet Inc. Class C stock.\n\nFive days later, on Sept. 2, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against a Department of Justice request to break up key Google assets in a major antitrust case. The decision sent Alphabet\u2019s Class C shares up over 6.73% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe August 28th disclosure revealed a total of 13 transactions, with an estimated maximum value of over $285,000.\n\nThe transactions were highlighted by online accounts that monitor congressional stock trading, including the Nancy Pelosi Stock Tracker on X and Benzinga\u2019s government trade tracker.\n\nThese platforms use publicly available disclosure reports to provide real-time insights into the investment activities of lawmakers.\n\nBesides Alphabet, Greene also invested heavily in logistics, purchasing up to $50,000 worth of stock in both FedEx Corp. FDX and Ryman Hospitality Properties Inc. RHP.\n\nA complete list of her trades from that day is detailed below.\n\nSee Also: Marjorie Taylor Greene Put Money In BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF This Year \u2014 Here\u2019s How Her Returns Stack Up Against Others In Congress\n\nWhile the Google trade appears particularly well-timed, data from Benzinga\u2019s tracker indicates that Rep. Greene\u2019s overall portfolio has underperformed the market over the last year.\n\nThe analysis shows her trades have gained an average of 1.80%, lagging behind the broader S&P 500 index during the same period.\n\nDespite the overall modest returns, the tracker highlights several individual trades that have performed exceptionally well. Her top trades include a position in Impinj Inc. PI with an 84.90% return and another in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS showing a 71.20% gain.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ, which track the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 index, respectively, fell on Tuesday. The SPY was down 0.74% at $640.27, while the QQQ declined 0.84% to $565.62, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\u2022 Recent Filing Shows That Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Bought Over $54K Worth of Exelon Stock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

The act prohibits members of Congress from using private information given to them by their position for personal gain such as buying or selling a stock. The act also expanded disclosure requirements for members of Congress by requiring them to file a monthly disclosure.\nThe Importance of Congressional Transactions\nCongressional transactions shouldn't be the primary reason for an investing decision, but they can be an important factor for an investor to consider.\nWhen a senator or representative makes a new purchase, it could be an indication they expect the stock to rise.\nA sale, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean the seller thinks the stock will go down.\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has added considerable Bitcoin BTC/USD exposure to her investment portfolio in 2025, making strategic purchases into iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF IBIT.\nGreene\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Gambit\nThe GOP lawmaker first tossed somewhere between $1,000 \u2013 $15,000 into the ETF on Jan. 8, according to the Benzinga Government Trades page, ahead of President Donald Trump's inauguration. The stock rose 13% over the next two weeks.\nGreene doubled up in March, purchasing between $15,000 \u2013 $50,000 worth of IBIT shares just three days before Trump's announcement for a planned Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Unlike last time, the ETH shares fell 8% over the next week.\nAccording to Benzinga, Greene\u2019s IBIT stake is up 10.2% as of this writing, better than her 2.4% return from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD.\nOverall, the Congressperson gained 2.80% on average over the last year, lower than the S&P 500. As of this writing, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS and Tesla Inc. TSLA were among the top performers in her portfolio, netting 76% and 57.7%, respectively.\nSee Also: Bitcoin Flat As US GDP Rebounds In Q2; Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin Slide: Analyst Says \u2018Keep An Eye Out\u2019 For This ETH Level To Confirm \u2018Real Breakout\u2019\nExamining Bitcoin Investments Of Other Lawmakers\nInterestingly, Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas), who bought into IBIT, valued between $50,001 and $100,000, on July 17, is down 6.40% on the investment.\nFurthermore, Sen. David McCormick (R-Pa.), who made several purchases of Bitwise Bitcoin ETF BITB in 2025, enjoyed an unrealized profit of 25.60% as of this writing.\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $111,220.37, down 1.49% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Year-to-date, the coin has rallied 18%.\nShares of IBIT ETF rose 0.57% after-hours after closing 0.11% lower at $63.58 on Wednesday. Year-to-date, the stock has gained 19.76%.\nAs of this writing, the stock demonstrated a very high Momentum score.

GOOG GOOGL surged in after-hours trading after a federal judge ruled the company will not have to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system in a landmark antitrust case, prompting praise from Wall Street analysts and sharp criticism from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\nJudge Rules Against Forced Divestitures\nOn Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta issued a sealed decision rejecting the Department of Justice's request to break up key Google assets, writing that \"Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divestiture of these key assets.\"\nThe ruling follows a five-year legal battle that last year found Google held an illegal monopoly in search.\nAlphabet's Class A shares jumped 7.07% in after-hours trading, while Class C shares climbed 6.73%, according to Benzinga Pro.\nApple Inc. AAPL also gained nearly 3% after Mehta ruled Google can maintain payments to Apple for making its search engine the default on iPhones.\nDan Ives Calls Ruling A \u2018Huge Win' For Big Tech\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives called the decision a \"huge win\" for Google and Apple, adding that it removes a major overhang for both companies.\n\"Good news for big tech, the regulator's bark is bigger than the bite,\" said Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, noting that Apple's lucrative Google search deal\u2014estimated to account for 15% of Apple's operating income\u2014survived intact.\nInvestment advisor Ross Gerber echoed the sentiment, posting on X, formerly Twitter, \"Google gets off with a slap on the hand and the stock roars higher. Love it!\"\nWarren Slams Ruling As \u2018Slap On The Wrist'\nSen. Warren criticized the court's decision, arguing that the Donald Trump administration should appeal to \"break up this Big Tech giant.\"\nIn a post on X, she also raised concerns about separate negotiations between Google, YouTube executives and Trump's legal team over a longstanding censorship lawsuit, calling the talks \"dubious\" and a sign of \"corruption in plain sight.\"\nLast month, several senators, including Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), sent a letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and YouTube CEO Neal Mohan asking if settlement discussions with Trump's lawyers involved promises of favorable treatment.\nWhat Are The Next Steps\nWhile Google avoided divestiture, the court ordered the company to share some search data with competitors, a move it plans to appeal, arguing it could expose proprietary technology.\nBenzinga's Edge Stock Rankings indicate that GOOGL maintains strong momentum across short, medium and long-term timeframes.
