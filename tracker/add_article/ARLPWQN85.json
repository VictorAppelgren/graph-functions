      "summary": "Google warns 2.5 billion Gmail users to stop using passwords after a Salesforce breach that exposed business data, raising phishing risk. The breach didn’t steal credentials but gave attackers detailed contact info, enabling sophisticated impersonation and vishing campaigns. Google recommends regular password changes, two‑factor authentication, and especially adopting passkeys or app‑based 2FA. The company urges users to be skeptical of unsolicited messages and to use its Security Checkup tool. This highlights how partner data leaks can threaten even non‑targeted accounts.",
