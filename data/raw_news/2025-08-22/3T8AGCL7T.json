  "content": "Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. SEE MORE\n\nNext-gen battery materials manufacturer Group14 Technologies today announced $463 million of new funding. The Woodinville, Wash.-based company has raised more than $1 billion from investors.\n\nThe new cash comes as Group14 is forging a path forward despite significant federal cuts for clean tech support, ongoing tariff uncertainties, and projections for a slowing electric vehicle market. The company last month laid off an undisclosed number of workers and is delaying by more than a year the start of production at its flagship battery materials plant in Eastern Washington\u2019s Moses Lake.\n\n\u201cThis raise is powerful validation that, despite a tough macro environment, investors are doubling down on Group14\u2019s role in shaping the future of energy storage,\u201d said Group14 CEO Rick Luebbe in a statement. \u201cTheir continued support underscores their conviction in our technology and recognition of the global demand for silicon batteries we\u2019re already seeing.\u201d\n\nThe company also shared that it was buying out SK Inc. to gain 100% ownership of its already operating factory in South Korea. SK Inc., an investment holding company, also led the Series D round. The deal puts Group14 in \u201cfull control of its primary manufacturing base in Asia, strategically located near the world\u2019s largest battery manufacturers,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nGroup14\u2019s silicon anode technology is used in lithium ion batteries that hold more power and require less time for recharging than traditional graphite anode batteries. The product, called SCC55, is suitable for use in EVs, consumer electronics and utility-scale batteries that can help meet power demand for data centers.\n\nThe company previously raised $649 million from investors, bringing its new investment total to $1.11 billion. Group14 broke ground on its BAM2 facility in Washington\u2019s Moses Lake in April 2023 and aimed to start manufacturing by late 2024. Its new start date is early 2026.\n\nIt was smoother sailing for Group14 and its competitors under the Biden administration, which prioritized the transition to clean power and supported energy independence, including bolstering U.S. battery production that is dominated by China. The Trump administration has reversed course, emphasizing fossil fuel use and cutting tax breaks for batteries, wind, solar and EVs.\n\nIn May, OneD Battery Sciences reportedly pulled the plug on its pilot plant in Moses Lake, while Sila is commissioning its battery materials facility in the same town and plans to start production this year.\n\nGroup14 received a $100 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2022 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act to help construct the BAM2 facility. In September it was awarded a $200 million DOE grant to build a Moses Lake plant that would produce silane gas, an essential ingredient for manufacturing silicon battery materials.\n\n\u201cWith over 90% of anode-grade graphite coming from China, the vulnerability is clear,\u201d Luebbe said. \u201cOur silicon battery material gives manufacturers a high-performance alternative that helps derisk the supply chain. Every tonne of SCC55 displaces five tonnes of Chinese graphite with a homegrown solution.\u201d",

      "text": "Washington state Wins $200M to Jumpstart EV Component Manufacturing and Bring Hundreds of New Jobs to Moses Lake\nFunding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will support build out of two new electric battery component manufacturing plants, supporting U.S. sourcing and manufacturing of electric vehicles\nEDMONDS, WA \u2013 Today the U.S. Department of Energy announced that two companies planning to build battery component manufacturing facilities in Moses Lake will each receive $100 million from a new Bipartisan Infrastructure Law program intended to spur domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles and the electric grid.\nGroup14 Technologies Inc. and Sila Nanotechnologies will each receive the grants from the DOE\u2019s Battery Materials Processing and Battery Component Manufacturing & Recycling program, which Senator Cantwell championed during negotiations leading to passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Both companies focus on producing silicon anodes that can replace the conventional graphite anodes commonly used in today\u2019s electric vehicle batteries. Silicon anodes should enable less expensive and more energy dense battery packs and can be built using materials sourced in the U.S., providing an alternative to China\u2019s dominance of the international graphite market.\n\u201cThe historic investments Congress made over the past two years are helping solve the next generation battery storage technology challenges right here in Washington,\u201d said Senator Cantwell. \u201cThese two cutting-edge companies will not only use domestically sourced materials to make electric vehicles more affordable, they will be creating hundreds of high paying jobs that will help transform Moses Lake into an epicenter of clean energy manufacturing.\nGroup14 Technologies Inc., based in Woodinville, plans to invest $223 million of their own money, along with the $100 million they are getting from DOE, to build two 2,000 ton per year commercial manufacturing modules in Moses Lake. The factories will produce silicon-carbon composite anodes for lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. The project is slated to create 300 well-paying skilled trade jobs to construct the Moses Lake plant and an additional 200 technical and operational jobs to commission, ramp up, and sustain production.\nSila Nanotechnologies, based in Alameda, CA, will invest $300 million of their own money, along with the $100 million from DOE, to build out their 600,000 square foot Moses Lake facility to full capacity. The new factory will produce enough materials to power 200,000 electric vehicles, making Sila\u2019s plant the largest silicon anode production facility in the world. Sila expects to hire and train 150 to 300 additional technologists through the project\u2019s completion.\nSenator Cantwell is a strong supporter of federal investment into America\u2019s critical energy industry, and of Washington state\u2019s historic role in energy innovation. The Senator was the driving force behind passage of the CHIPS & Science Act, the largest science research investment in U.S. history. The Act included $16.9 billion in funding to support research on key technology areas at Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratories, including the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, which is a world leader in EV battery research.\nA portion of Cantwell\u2019s legislation establishing a new 30 percent tax incentive for new electric buses and trucks was incorporated into the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act. In 2008 Senator Cantwell partnered with former Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) to author the pioneering $7,500 tax incentive for electrified passenger vehicles. This credit is often cited as a key catalyst for growing the electric car and truck market from essentially nothing 15 years ago to the hundreds of models that consumers will be able to choose from in the next year or two.\nThe funding announced today comes from DOE\u2019s Battery Materials Processing and Battery Component Manufacturing & Recycling program, a new program which is funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The program aims to bolster domestic battery component manufacturing, materials processing, and recycling to support the growing electric vehicle market and energy storage demands. Today\u2019s announcement of $2.8 billion in funding is for 21 projects by U.S.-based companies from coast to coast. These awards are the first investments of the historic $7 billion in funding for the program authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.??\n###\nNext Article Previous Article"
