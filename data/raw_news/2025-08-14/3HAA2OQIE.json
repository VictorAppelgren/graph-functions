  "content": "Counterpoint | Albert Lea has options if it wants to resist the state on cannabis Starting, but not limited to, the fact that Minnesota\u2019s law is in conflict with federal law. \"The legalization [of marijuana] bill slouched into law for a political purpose: to get the marijuana parties off the ballot \u2014 and public health, public safety and young adults\u2019 brain development be damned,\" John Hagen writes. (The Minnesota Star Tribune) Opinion editor\u2019s note: Strib Voices publishes a mix of guest commentaries online and in print each day. To contribute, click here. Cathy Wurzer of Twin Cities Public Television\u2019s \u201cAlmanac\u201d hosted a political panel before Minnesota legalized recreational marijuana two years ago. \u201cTruckers, doctors and law enforcement are all against legalizing cannabis at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cInteresting kind of coalition there. What do you think?\u201d No panelist gave a responsive answer. None addressed the issues raised by those groups. Nor did pot proponents do so in passing this irresponsible legislation. The Minnesota Medical Association\u2019s president warned of the risks of normalizing pot in a Minnesota Star Tribune commentary on Jan. 11, 2023. He stated: \u201cCannabis use may increase the risk of developing psychiatric disorders, including psychosis (schizophrenia), depression and anxiety, particularly among individuals with a pre-existing genetic or other vulnerability.\u201d He stressed the lack of public awareness of these risks. He also stressed the risk of cannabis to young adults\u2019 brain development (brains are not mature until age 25). Cannabis was legalized in defiance of these risks and in defiance of the menace of impaired driving stressed by law enforcement and truckers. (You\u2019d think, by the way, that when a motorist with cannabis in his bloodstream roars onto Lake Street at 100 miles an hour, obliterates a car, kills five people and complains about the disruption of his evening\u2019s plans, that journalists would mention the increase of traffic fatalities in legalizing states and mention cannabis-induced psychotic breaks. But Twin Cities media tend to be incurious about the dangers of pot.) The legalization bill slouched into law for a political purpose: to get the marijuana parties off the ballot \u2014 and public health, public safety and young adults\u2019 brain development be damned. The bill passed by a single vote in the Minnesota Senate and by a few votes in the House. An overwhelming majority of outstate legislators voted against it. The bill was a contemptuous jam-down of greater Minnesota\u2019s culture and concerns. No community can opt out. Every city is compelled to register at least one dispensary licensed by the cannabis bureaucracy. The city of Albert Lea has challenged this irresponsible law and the cultural overlordship of the Twin Cities. The City Council refused to register a dispensary approved by the state. The state presumably will sue Albert Lea to force it to comply. [Opinion editor\u2019s note: This week the City Council approved two cannabis microbusinesses but stood firm on its rejection of a third.] The work of Star Tribune contributing columnist Clemon Dabney normalizes marijuana. In a column first published Aug. 6, Dabney strenuously calls for the state to vanquish Albert Lea. He warns that other cities are restive and may join in the revolt. Dabney argues that Albert Lea is defying the state\u2019s authority over cities. Another level of authority, however, protects Albert Lea. State laws like Minnesota\u2019s flagrantly conflict with federal law. Dabney: Minnesota must take renegade city council to task for blocking a legal weed business Dabney: Is Minnesota\u2019s cannabis market already in trouble? The federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) forbids trafficking in marijuana. Enforcement (vested in the U.S. attorney general) has ebbed and flowed. At present there\u2019s a policy of nonenforcement. But sales of marijuana are a federal crime. Ordinarily, private parties can\u2019t enforce the CSA. Exceptions exist, however, where state laws seek to force people to violate the CSA or to abet violations by others. The Minnesota Supreme Court squarely addressed this issue in 2021. In Musta v. Mendota Heights Dental Center, it held that our workers\u2019 compensation law cannot force employers to pay for medical cannabis. It held that compelling such payments would make employers \u201ccriminally liable for aiding and abetting the possession of cannabis under federal law.\u201d Albert Lea can invoke this precedent. The state law requiring city officials to register dispensaries coerces them to aid and abet a federal crime. The Musta case indicates that they need not do so. Federal civil rights laws likely protect the City Council as well. A state law compelling people to violate a federal criminal statute almost certainly offends due process. People in such a plight can seek injunctive relief (and attorneys\u2019 fees) against offending state officials, under the doctrine of Ex parte Young. Thus, Albert Lea has weapons to wield in the legal battles that lie ahead. As an Austin Packer who grappled with Albert Lea\u2019s doughty wrestlers, I say: \u201cGo, Tigers!\u201d Stand up for science, public health and public safety. Resist this irresponsible statute and its Goliath of a bureaucracy. And may greater Minnesota (and a public interest law firm or two) stand up with you. John Hagen, of Minneapolis, is an attorney.",

The Minnesota Medical Association warns of the risks of normalizing marijuana, which may increase the risk of developing psychiatric disorders and lead to increased public awareness of these risks.

The city of Albert LeA has challenged this law and the cultural overlordship of the Twin Cities. The City Council refused to register a dispensary approved by the state, which the state will sue to force it to comply, and can invoke state precedent requiring city officials to aid and abet dispensaries to register them.

      "text": "For two hours on Wednesday night, the world saw Taylor Swift in a way that she hasn\u2019t been seen in years \u2014 maybe ever.\nWhen she started out as a teenage country star in the early 2000s, Swift would upload MySpace videos that chronicled her adventures, post photos and comments on social media, or hop on YouTube live streams to chat with fans. But as she evolved into a global pop superstar, she slowly scaled back on revealing details about her life. In the past five years, she has only sat for a few interviews, mostly focused on her music.\nThen she arrived on \u201cNew Heights,\u201d the sports podcast hosted by her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce. During a conversation that was unprecedented in both length and tone, she talked about everything, casually, as if she was just hanging out with her family or friends \u2014 while millions of people watched. (By 12:01 a.m. Thursday, the YouTube stream had 5.3 million views.)\nEarlier this week, the podcast sparked an internet meltdown when its social media team teased that Swift was the special guest on an episode premiering Wednesday at 7 p.m. Eastern time, and even more so when Swift confirmed that she had a new album in the works \u2014 titled \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d \u2014 that she would reveal on the show. On \u201cNew Heights,\u201d Swift did, indeed, unveil the record\u2019s cover and release date, Oct. 3. But she also revealed a lot more.\nShe talked about her two-year relationship with Kelce, purchasing her master recordings after a long fight to own her music, details about her father\u2019s recent health scare, life before and after the record-breaking Eras Tour and, basically, what it\u2019s like being one of the most famous people on the planet. Here are five highlights from the episode:\n1) Swift and Kelce\u2019s relationship has been serious for a long time.\nFor someone who makes international headlines for her personal life, given that she famously writes songs about real people, Swift is very guarded about relationships. She doesn\u2019t walk red carpets or do joint interviews with anyone she\u2019s dating, and really, she rarely mentions them. A decade ago, it was considered shocking that she actually said her boyfriend Calvin Harris\u2019 name out loud at an awards show. She dated actor Joe Alwyn for six years, and while they were photographed together, the public barely saw them interact. So during \u201cNew Heights,\u201d Swifties \u2014 who have been desperate for more details about Swift and Kelce since they started dating in the summer of 2023 \u2014 were in disbelief as they watched the couple hold hands and cuddle during the interview.\n\u201cI owe a lot to this podcast. This podcast got me a boyfriend, ever since Travis decided to use it as his personal dating app about two years ago,\u201d Swift said, as Kelce cracked up. They have already shared the gist of the story, which is that during an ad break on the podcast in July 2023, Kelce said that he tried and failed to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it when the Eras Tour came to Kansas City."

      "text": "The Bomba Squad Twins of 2019 won 101 games and charmed the Target Field faithful (at least until another October plummet).\nThose fans weren\u2019t allowed into the ballpark during the Covid-shortened 2020 season, but the Twins still went 36-24 (a 97-win pace over a normal 162-game season) and repeated as AL Central champs.\nThat led into 2021 and the expectation that the Twins would once again occupy a lofty perch in the division. Baseball Prospectus projected the Twins would win 90.6 games, five more than anyone else in the AL Central and the third-most in the American League.\nInstead, that season began a five-year era filled largely with frustration and what can only politely be termed underachievement.\nI talked on Thursday\u2019s Daily Delivery podcast about how things still figure to get worse for the Twins in 2026 before they get better, basing much of the calculus around rightful frustration over the Pohlad family retaining control over the team and what that might mean for the near-term future.\nHey, I don\u2019t want to stop you from blaming the Pohlads for the disappointing trajectory of the franchise.\nBut at the start of today\u2019s 10 things to know, we also need to talk about just how much the Twins have underachieved in the last five seasons and how much that has shaped their current predicament.\n- 2021: The Twins missed that 90.6-win projection by a mile, which is about the distance that homers off J.A. Happ seemed to travel that season. They finished 73-89, a shocking tumble fueled by a 14-28 start to the year.\n- 2022: Still, Baseball Prospectus gave them a bit of a mulligan and said they would win 84 games in 2022. That would have put them firmly in wild card contention that season. They were 68-64 in early September and tied for the division lead. They went 10-18 down the stretch to finish 78-84, 14 games out of the lead and six games below their projected win total.\n- 2023: No, really, Baseball Prospectus said. The Twins are good. Just look at that roster. They projected the Twins to win 87.8 games, which was just about spot on. The Twins won 87 games and took the crown in a weak AL Central. They followed that with their first playoff series win in two decades, snapping an 18-game postseason losing streak in the process. Optimism was high!\n- 2024: Based on that success and a still-talented roster, BP projected the Twins to win 89.8 games in 2024. That seemed to be a good bet when the Twins sat at 70-53 in mid-August. But they went 12-27 down the stretch to botch a near-certain playoff spot. 82-80 was their final mark, eight games off the projection.\n- 2025: The Twins insisted they would learn their lessons from the collapse, and Baseball Prospectus agreed. They liked the Twins for 87.3 wins this season. Instead, the Twins again underachieved before a trade deadline fire sale. They are on pace to finish with 77 wins.\n- Add it up: I count the Twins being 42.5 wins under projection over the past five years combined. Some of that, perhaps, is miscalculation by Baseball Prospectus. Injury bad luck, especially to pitchers, has played a role. But missing expectations by 8.5 wins a year on average is also flat-out underperformance, and it has left the Twins where they are now.\n- By the way: The Twins finally beat the Yankees on Wednesday.\n- Also on Thursday\u2019s podcast, I broke down what I saw from J.J. McCarthy during Wednesday\u2019s practice with the Patriots and went in-depth on Gophers soccer. Here is a clip from my conversation with incoming Gophers player and Aurora standout Mariah Nguyen:\n- Strib Varsity reporter Jim Paulsen is expected to join me on Friday\u2019s podcast to talk about his list of the 25 best Minnesota high school athletes of the last 25 years.\n- Worth monitoring: Andrew Van Ginkel\u2019s health."

To contribute, click here.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nWith the DFL holding a majority in the House and Senate, and the governor's office, it appears legalizing recreational cannabis is likely this session. One of the authors of proposed legislation made it very clear: \"2023 will be the year we legalize adult-use cannabis.\"\nOn behalf of the Minnesota Medical Association (MMA), the state's oldest and largest professional association of physicians and physicians-in-training, I urge policymakers and the public to recognize that legalizing adult use of cannabis will impact the health of Minnesotans. It is also true that the current legal approach to cannabis use in Minnesota and much of the country comes with its own set of negative health and socioeconomic impacts, particularly among historically marginalized populations.\nAs physicians, we urge policymakers to be mindful of the harmful and difficult lessons learned with respect to alcohol and tobacco regulation. These lessons, combined with the best available, albeit insufficient, evidence on the health effects of cannabis must inform any future Minnesota policy.\nTo best protect the health of Minnesotans, the MMA urges legislators to consider the following:\n1. Research has consistently shown that human brain development and maturation is not complete until the age of 25. Therefore, individuals under age 25 should be prohibited from purchasing, possessing, or using cannabis or cannabis-infused products.\n2. Cannabis use may increase the risk of developing psychiatric disorders, including psychosis (schizophrenia), depression and anxiety, particularly among individuals with a pre-existing genetic or other vulnerability. Public awareness of these risks is not well understood."

      "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration is preparing to open a second immigration detention facility dubbed ''Deportation Depot'' at a state prison as a federal judge decides the fate of the state's holding center for immigrants at an isolated airstrip in the Florida Everglades known as ''Alligator Alcatraz.''\nDeSantis announced Thursday that the new facility is to be housed at the Baker Correctional Institution, a state prison about 43 miles (69 kilometers) west of downtown Jacksonville. It is expected to hold 1,300 immigration detention beds, though that capacity could be expanded to 2,000, state officials said.\nAfter opening the Everglades facility last month, DeSantis justified building the second detention center by saying President Donald Trump's administration needs the additional capacity to hold and deport more immigrants.\n''There is a demand for this,'' DeSantis said. ''I'm confident that it will be filled.''\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has trumpeted Republican governors' efforts to expand their immigration detention capacity, calling Florida's partnership a model for other state-run holding facilities.\nPlans to open the facility in two to three weeks\nDeSantis touted the relative ease and economy of setting up the northern Florida facility at a preexisting prison, estimating the build-out cost to be $6 million. That's compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars the state has committed to construct the vast network of tents and trailers at the south facility in the rugged and remote Florida swamp.\n''This part of the facility is not being used right now for the state prisoners. It just gives us an ability to go in, stand it up quickly, stand it up cheaply,'' DeSantis said of the state prison, calling the site ''ready-made.''"

      "text": "Minnesota\u2019s labor market is slowing in what state officials said is likely an indication President Donald Trump\u2019s federal policy is trickling down to the local economy.\nFrom on-again, off-again tariffs and federal funding cuts to mass government layoffs and an immigration crackdown, federal policies are creating widespread uncertainty and chipping away at the U.S. economy. While Minnesota has tended to do better than the country as a whole, signs of strain are showing \u2014 and could have wide-ranging implications for the state\u2019s future growth.\n\u201cOver the course of months, we\u2019ve been talking about a number of actions at the federal level that we have feared could eventually filter their way into the data and into a broader economic slowdown,\u201d said Matt Varilek, Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) commissioner. \u201cAnd it seems plausible that that may be the early signs of what we\u2019re having here.\u201d\nMinnesota lost 4,400 jobs in July, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.5%, according to data DEED released Thursday. The state also lost more jobs than initially reported in June, mirroring national revisions earlier this month that showed tariffs might have weakened the labor market more than previously thought.\nMinnesota\u2019s diverse economy is still stable, officials said, and continues to outperform the country overall on unemployment, wage growth and labor force participation. The state added more jobs in May than first reported and gained more than 35,000 jobs year-over-year in July.\nTwo \u201csupersectors\u201d DEED measures \u2014 education and health services as well as construction \u2014 added jobs last month, while eight lost jobs. Government experienced the greatest monthly losses, with declines in local and state positions. Federal jobs were mostly flat through the month but have declined since July of last year.\nThe labor market has been in a holding pattern this year, as employers waiting for trade policy to shake out have held off on both hiring and layoffs. Though the national unemployment rate has stayed relatively low, so has the hiring rate \u2014 a tough reality for jobseekers that doesn\u2019t jibe with the headline numbers.\nErrol de Jesus\u2019 copywriting job laid her off in 2021.

      "text": "Ahead of a rare-of-late hometown gig this weekend, Poli\u00e7a has released a new single this week along with details of its upcoming album \u2014 with a hint it could be the group\u2019s last.\nThe Minneapolis-based synth-rock unit \u2014 which spent much of the 2010s touring with the likes of Bon Iver and New Order and playing festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury \u2014 offered up the dramatic, new acoustic ballad \u201cShe Knows Me\u201d on Tuesday as the second track available from its sixth record. The album, titled \u201cDreams Go,\u201d is due out Oct. 17 and will be promoted locally that month with an in-store performance at the Electric Fetus and a release party concert at Icehouse.\n\u201cDreams Go\u201d follows a strenuous couple years for the band, which went on hiatus when its co-founding bassist/co-vocalist Chris Bierden underwent surgeries for glioblastoma (a type of brain tumor). Bierden has been sidelined from the stage ever since. Singer Leaneagh, drummers Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu and producer Ryan Olson enlisted electronics wiz Alex Nutter to help keep the band going.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s announcement for the now-widely streaming song \u201cShe Knows Me,\u201d the band surprised fans by noting that \u201cDreams Go\u201d likely will be their final album. For now, the members aren\u2019t saying more.\n\u201cA long time ago, a music journalist in Minneapolis predicted we\u2019d eventually add guitar to our music,\u201d Leaneagh wrote on their social media pages. \u201cSo\u2026 here it is. \u2018She Knows Me\u2019 from \u2018Dreams Go,\u2019 probably our last record, and it includes nylon strings, strummed by me.\u201d\nDefying a bad bet their friendly neighborhood newspaper music critic made back in 2012 \u2014 predicting they would eventually add a six-string player to their unique sonic mix \u2014 Poli\u00e7a has rather famously gone guitar-less on all its albums up until now, doubling down on its vibrant dueling drums, whirring electronic layers and Leaneagh\u2019s effects-glazed vocals. The title track off \u201cDreams Go,\u201d which was issued in July, was a better example of that trademark sound. It will be interesting to see how much the rest of the new album sticks to or strays from the Poli\u00e7a mold.\nPreorders of \u201cDreams Go\u201d are available via thisispolica.com or through the Electric Fetus, where purchases of the album will get you into the band\u2019s in-store set on Oct. 16. Tickets also are available for their release party at Icehouse on Oct. 25 (8 p.m., $25).\nThe group has only one other gig on the calendar for now, and that\u2019s a headlining slot at the Augtoberfest Block Party put on by Tilia restaurant in Minnesapolis\u2019 Linden Hills neighborhood on Sunday, also featuring Megasound and the Dylan tribute band Mind Out of Time (3-8 p.m., $20). Also, Leaneagh will be one of the guest vocalists filling in for stroke-sidelined songwriter Matt Arthur at Thursday night\u2019s Sound for Silents screening outside Walker Art Center (8:30 p.m., free)."

      "text": "Opinion editor\u2019s note: Strib Voices publishes a mix of guest commentaries online and in print each day. To contribute, click here.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nTwenty years ago this month, I was sitting in a Cracker Barrel in Arkansas with two friends, uncertain about whether Hurricane Katrina had destroyed my home in New Orleans. As we finished our meal, the waitresses gathered around our table with bags of groceries and told us they had bought them for us and that a guest sitting at a nearby table had paid for our meal after overhearing us talking about our situation. The memory of empathy and solidarity in a time of need remains vivid.\nThe past two decades have brought a lot of change in my life. The intervening years have brought marriage, two children, a tortoise, a bulldog, a career in the law and, more recently, also in lawmaking. On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, I\u2019ve been thinking about what I\u2019ve learned in the years since I first left New Orleans with my law school books and a single change of clothing.\nI\u2019m a member of the Minnesota House, and the loss of my leader and friend, Melissa Hortman, has weighed on me over the past months. Politics have become so divisive that we have trouble seeing through differences to our common humanity. I wonder how differently things would play out if Hurricane Katrina had hit ground in August 2025. Would businesses, universities and charities from across the country reach out with dramatic acts of kindness and camaraderie? In my case, professors at my adopted law school, William Mitchell (now Mitchell Hamline School of Law), asked if I needed a place to stay and a school administrator cried with me as he handled the paperwork to admit me. Such unhesitating empathy for a stranger seems rare these days, as we have divided into clans to determine who is worthy of our support.\nIn 2005, I was a law student and a paralegal at an immigration law firm. I remember wandering through Target buying clothing while talking on my phone, answering clients\u2019 questions as best I could. Meanwhile, immigrant laborers flowed into Louisiana to help rebuild New Orleans. By some counts, over half of the reconstruction workforce after Katrina was undocumented immigrants. Undoubtedly, if such a workforce were needed in an emergency today, fear of arrest (or actual arrest) would stop them from coming to our aid in a time of great need. Notably, displaced Louisianans who relocated permanently to Houston have made immense economic contributions to the city in the decades since. Both of these stories are good reminders that displaced people have much to offer their new communities.\nAt the time of my evacuation to Minnesota, I was intensely aware of my privilege. When asked by people \u201cwhat shaped your political worldview?\u201d I think on the impact of this moment of clarity around the cruel disparity between my experience and the experience of New Orleanian residents who spent the hurricane in the Superdome and whose houses were literally washed away. I knew with utter certainty that I had done nothing to deserve my good luck and committed to doing my part to help those less fortunate. In 2005, I would never have envisioned that I would one day have the power to secure funding for local food shelves, create new programs to invest in underserved youth or to recraft education funding formulas to ensure equal access to education. Hurricane Katrina has undoubtedly played a role in how I came to prioritize these efforts.\nKatrina also gave me perspective on what truly matters in life. I spent a week not knowing if my belongings had been swept away. In the end, except water damage from a hole in the roof of my rental house, my books, clothes and mementos were fine. But by the time I drove down to retrieve them, I had moved on and many things remained in boxes for months (even years!) longer. At the end of the day, the relationships we build, the impact we make on our community and the adventures we experience are what make a meaningful life."

To contribute, click here.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nLong before THC gummies lined the shelves of co-ops or cannabis lounges opened in Duluth and the North Loop, hemp quietly thrived in Minnesota \u2014 largely unnoticed, often untamed and decidedly unglamorous. Now that adult-use cannabis is finally legal here, it\u2019s worth asking: What\u2019s the real back story of weed in the Land of 10,000 Lakes?\nMinnesota\u2019s relationship with cannabis stretches back more than a century. One of the earliest tangible records is a hemp specimen collected in 1876, preserved in the University of Minnesota\u2019s Bell Museum Herbarium \u2014 proof the plant was once a natural part of our landscape. In the 1930s, the U\u2019s medicinal gardens grew Cannabis sativa alongside foxglove, belladonna and opium poppy, all studied for pain relief and sedation as part of legitimate medical research.\nIn the early 1900s, Minnesota farmers cultivated industrial hemp across counties like Redwood, Renville and Nobles, growing it for rope, textiles and wartime supplies. World War II intensified this cultivation through the federal government\u2019s \u201cHemp for Victory\u201d campaign, urging patriotic farmers to plant thousands of acres of hemp for Navy ropes, parachutes and canvas. Minnesota\u2019s fertile fields and processing plants became critical to the war effort \u2014 more than 11,000 acres were planted by 1943.\nYet just as rapidly as hemp rose, it fell. Postwar federal regulations, growing stigma and the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 halted legal hemp farming. Fields went fallow, mills shuttered and the plant was criminalized \u2014 alongside the intoxicating cannabis it was frequently confused with. Nevertheless, Minnesota\u2019s wild hemp \u2014 dubbed \u201cditch weed\u201d or \u201cferal cannabis\u201d \u2014 persisted, stubbornly growing along railroad tracks, parks such as Bruce Vento and highways like U.S. 10. Ironically, these feral plants were largely descendants of government-planted wartime crops.\nThroughout the 1980s and \u201990s, the DEA and local authorities spent thousands of dollars attempting to eradicate this harmless ditch weed, despite its lack of intoxicating properties. To some observers, these wild plants became botanical relics \u2014 living time capsules of a forgotten chapter in Minnesota\u2019s agricultural heritage.\nA critical figure in preserving this history was Robert G. Robinson, a University of Minnesota plant genetics professor. In the 1960s, Robinson viewed hemp not as a vice but as a valuable \u201corphan crop,\u201d rich in potential yet unfairly overlooked. His research documented that hemp\u2019s disappearance began long before the modern war on drugs, grounding Minnesota\u2019s cannabis story firmly in science rather than scandal."

      "text": "Every time I look at the back seat of my car, I see it \u2014 a plastic bag holding a white T-shirt and a small, dark feather.\nThey\u2019re leftovers from a fine June morning several years ago, when I\u2019d been on my way to meet friends for a morning of bird-watching. Waiting at a St. Paul intersection for the light to change, I watched an arresting scene: A shirtless man was walking across the street holding the leash of a large white dog in one hand and a fairly large object wrapped in white in the other. The light changed, and as the cars ahead of me began moving I could see what the shirtless man was carrying \u2014 a pileated woodpecker, its red crest and large beak peeking out from the white wrapping.\nMy mind was racing: Why would someone be carrying a wrapped-up woodpecker and where was he going with it? Should I stop and talk to him?\nKnowing I was going to be late, I turned back but man and dog and bird had disappeared. I was ready to give up on this odd errand, but then I heard a deep, throaty bark, and knew it had to be the big dog. Suddenly I spied them on a side street, where a woman was loading the dog into a car while speaking to the shirtless guy. Hmm ... I thought, was she someone who\u2019d also watched this scene and stopped to help?\nI greeted them and said I was curious about what was up with the woodpecker. And then the story unfolded.\nThe guy without a shirt had been out walking his Great Pyrenees before leaving for his job as a painter when he noticed the pileated lying in the street. He took off his white T-shirt to wrap around the bird, and continued walking. He called home and his wife drove over to pick up the dog, but (this part I didn\u2019t quite understand) he said he was going to get to the University of Minnesota, where he was employed, and see if he could find help for the bird.\nHe was more than 3 miles from the U at that point, it was a hot morning and both bird and man would be in rough shape by the time he got there. I volunteered to take the woodpecker to the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Roseville, a plan he endorsed, since he was becoming desperate about what to do.\nWe loaded the T-shirt-wrapped woodpecker into the cat carrier in my car, and went our separate ways. At the Wildlife Rehab Center, the intake staffer said the bird seemed alert, so I began to hope that whatever was wrong with it was not life-threatening. Sadly, I received an e-mail some days later, noting that because X-rays showed the woodpecker had a fractured spine and would never fly again, he was humanely euthanized. (I surmised that while in flight the bird had been struck by a car.)"

Two years later, what once felt like a progressive step toward equity-focused cannabis businesses and economic inclusion now feels stuck in limbo. Are we backsliding before we even get started?\nIn Albert Lea, what was poised to be Minnesota\u2019s first non\u2011tribal cannabis dispensary has hit a hard wall. Jacob Schlichter secured one of the first microbusiness licenses issued in June from the Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) and registered his shop, The Smoking Tree, with the city soon after.\nBut on July 28, the Albert Lea City Council voted 4-3 to block his final approval despite state law expressly forbidding cities from denying a license if applicants meet OCM standards and city zoning rules. Some city officials cited morality, local control and discomfort with the rapid state rollout.\nThe move contradicts Minnesota statute, meaning the city risks legal action and the possible loss of local government aid as a result. The action also brings to a head a conflict between state and municipal powers.\nThis local standoff raises a bigger question: Is Albert Lea the only city standing in the way of legal cannabis businesses opening for business \u2014 or is this the first crack in a broader resistance movement?\nAre there whispers in other towns about following suit? While no other city has made a similarly bold move, the undercurrent of resistance is undeniable. At public meetings across Minnesota, local officials have voiced concern about feeling sidelined in the state\u2019s cannabis rollout. Many resent state-imposed deadlines, zoning burdens and the perception that economic incentives outweigh public readiness. Some local officials have called for moratoriums or delays, hoping to slow enforcement until local systems are in place."

She flips stereotypes on their ears, turning her stories into funhouse mirrors that challenge her protagonists \u2014 and readers \u2014 to navigate worlds that are both strange and all too familiar.\nFor example, in \u201cMail Order Love(\u00ae),\u201d women from Taiwan literally are shipped to the U.S. in cardboard boxes, after Congress bans all immigration, exploiting a loophole in which mail-order brides are \u201cconsidered imported foreign goods.\u201d Chou details how one bride, Bunny, adapts to life in America, getting her GED, heading out with friends, and generally ignoring her decades-older new husband, Frank.\n\u201cThe rare moments she was at home, Bunny spent all her time in the living room watching Korean soap operas dubbed in Mandarin and smoking menthol cigarettes\u201d as Frank turns to customer service chatbots, trying to figure out his purchase.\nIn \u201cCarrot Legs\u201d Chou examines the pressure to conform to impossible beauty standards.

Chou\u2019s debut novel, \u201cDisorientation\u201d (there\u2019s that wordplay), was a New York Public Library Young Lions Fiction Award and Thurber Prize finalist.\nWhile humorously unpacking stereotypes about identity, Chou never condescends to her characters.

Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law 90 years ago this week, he said it would provide economic stability to older people while giving the U.S. \"an economic structure of vastly greater soundness.''\nToday, the program provides benefits to almost 69 million Americans each month. It's a major source of income for people older than 65 and is popular across the country and political lines.\nIt also looks more threatened than ever.\nJust as it has for decades, Social Security faces a looming shortfall in money to pay full benefits. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the program has faced more tumult. Agency staffing has been slashed. Unions and advocacy groups concerned about sharing sensitive information have sued. Administration officials, including the president, have falsely claimed that millions of dead people were receiving Social Security benefits. Former top adviser Elon Musk said the program was a potential ''Ponzi scheme.\"\nAt an Oval Office event Thursday commemorating the program's anniversary, Trump said that under his watch \"we're strengthening it.'' But the president and Republicans who control Congress have not proposed a long-term solution to shore up the program.\nSocial Security remains far from the sound economic system that Roosevelt envisioned, due to changes made \u2014 and not made \u2014 under both Democratic and Republican presidents.\nHere's a look at past and current challenges to Social Security, the proposed solutions and what it could take to shore up the program.\nThe go-broke date has been moved up"

However, overly complex or poorly designed regulations can drive up costs, limit innovation and push smaller operators out of the market \u2014 ultimately benefiting large corporations and illicit sellers.\nThe state\u2019s Office of Cannabis Management (OCM), led by interim Director Eric Taubel, is in the process of finalizing the rules that will govern the long-awaited launch of Minnesota\u2019s retail cannabis flower market. Its proposed rules have generated fierce criticism from small businesses that say they favor big companies and will create unnecessary hurdles for them.\nAs a small-business owner and the founder of Doctor Dabs, a Burnsville-based cannabis company specializing in innovative edibles, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how creativity and quality can set small businesses apart. But the state\u2019s proposed regulations could make it nearly impossible for businesses like mine to compete. Strict production limits, burdensome compliance requirements and barriers to sourcing high-quality genetics will stifle innovation and favor large corporations with more resources.\nThe overly restrictive rules don\u2019t just affect cultivators \u2014 they directly affect processors and edibles manufacturers, limiting the ability to create diverse, high-quality products that consumers demand. While many of these proposed rules seem written to the detriment of small businesses, the OCM could create other rules that, if crafted wisely, would help cannabis businesses compete and thrive.\nOne glaring issue is the lack of rules around moisture and water-activity standards in cannabis products. Without strict regulations, unscrupulous operators can manipulate moisture levels to artificially inflate THC potency in lab tests while selling heavier, water-laden flowers to consumers. This not only misleads buyers, but also increases the risk of mold and microbial contamination."

Van Lear was able to broaden his appeal to local voters by vowing to rein in the city\u2019s two key public utilities, the street railway and gas company, both of which had a major impact on daily life in Minneapolis.\nMobilizing the labor movement as his base of support, Van Lear was elected mayor with 54% of the vote. As his two-year term began in January 1917, the city\u2019s new chief executive expected to focus on local issues, but international events soon cast a shadow over Van Lear\u2019s mayoral administration.\nMinneapolis\u2019 Socialist mayor took office only months before the U.S. declared war on Germany. As war fever swept the country in 1917, Van Lear found himself under attack by his political opponents, who equated his ties to the antiwar Socialists with disloyalty that bordered on treason. Despite his efforts keep the focus on his battle with the utilities, the loyalty issue would continue to trail him as he campaigned for re-election in 1918."

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 First lady Melania Trump demanded that Hunter Biden retract comments linking her to sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and threatened to sue if he does not.\nTrump takes issue with two comments Biden, son of former President Joe Biden, made in an interview this month with American journalist Andrew Callaghan. He alleged that Epstein introduced the first lady to now-President Donald Trump.\nThe statements are false, defamatory and \u2018\u2019extremely salacious,\u2019\u2019 Melania Trump\u2019s lawyer, Alejandro Brito, wrote in a letter to Biden. Biden\u2019s remarks were widely disseminated on social media and reported by media outlets around the world, causing the first lady \u2018\u2019to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\u2019\u2019 he wrote.\nBiden made the Epstein comments during a sprawling interview in which he lashed out at \u2018\u2019elites\u2019\u2019 and others in the Democratic Party he says undermined his father before he dropped out of last year\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\u2018\u2019Epstein introduced Melania to Trump. The connections are, like, so wide and deep,\u2019\u2019 Biden said in one of the comments Trump disputes. Biden attributed the claim to author Michael Wolff, whom Trump disparaged in June as a \u2018\u2019Third Rate Reporter.\u2019\u2019 He has accused Wolff of making up stories to sell books.\nThe first lady\u2019s threats echo a favored strategy of her husband, who has aggressively used litigation to go after critics. Public figures like the Trumps face a high bar to succeed in a defamation lawsuit.\nThe president and first lady have long said they were introduced by Paolo Zampolli, a modeling agent, at a New York Fashion Week party in 1998.\nThe letter is dated Aug. 6 and was first reported Wednesday by Fox News Digital."

      "text": "High school coaches and administrators across Minnesota have been asked to be aware of air-quality levels as athletes return to practice.\nPractices were permitted for the first time Monday and have gone on as scheduled while state health and pollution control agency officials keep a close eye on 700 wildfires burning across Canada.\nOn Wednesday, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency said air quality had improved and was below the alert threshold across northern Minnesota and that air quality would continue to improve across the state over the next few days.\nModerate levels of smoke continued to impact northern and central Minnesota on Wednesday, the agency said, but it cancelled an air-quality alert that went into effect for the entire state Monday morning.\nThe United States\u2019 air-quality index (AQI) is on a scale of 0 to 500; the higher the number the worse the air. An AQI over 300 represents hazardous air quality, but concerns begin at much lower levels; an AQI above 100 is considered unhealthy. On Monday, Bemidji checked in at 179.\nOn Wednesday, the index was at 132 for northwestern Minnesota and Red River Valley North, and for the Duluth area and north-central Minnesota it was at 117, which is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, according to airnow.gov.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate this week,\u201d Duluth Denfeld football coach Erik Lofald said. \u201cIt was looking like [Wednesday] was really going to push into maybe that high red zone. If you get into the 150s and 160s, that\u2019s when you have to really consider not maybe cancelling but really limiting your practices or moving inside. You get into that 200 area and we\u2019re talking we can\u2019t be outside at all. Yesterday was really the first day when we were like, \u2018We may have to adjust here,\u2019 and then it turned out to be a really nice day. It turned out to be windy and cooler.\u201d\nThe AQI also uses a color scheme to indicate levels of seriousness. Thursday\u2019s forecast showed only green (good) and yellow (moderate) for all of Minnesota as lingering smoke leaves the state; winds on Thursday are expected to push remaining smoke north.\nAir quality is expected to move into the green category for the rest of the state by Friday and Saturday.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been telling us to keep an eye on the air quality and when it gets to a certain limit, the boys have to stop practicing,\u201c Brooklyn Center football coach Rodney Pierce-Tyler said. \u201dWe have been splitting up practice, half start inside and half outside. We have a trainer on hand out there that\u2019s keeping an eye on it. When she says to shut it down, we have to shut it down. We\u2019re taking every precaution when it comes to the kids\u2019 safety.\u201d\nHermantown girls soccer coach Nate Hanson on Wednesday said his team had yet to experience issues with air quality.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been [practicing] in the morning and it hasn\u2019t affected us,\u201d he said.\nPer Minnesota State High School League guidelines, outdoor activity should be moved indoors when the AQI reaches 150 and moved indoors, canceled or postponed when the number reaches 200.\nAn AQI of 100 or less is considered acceptable for usual athletic activities, according to the league. An AQI above 100 is considered unhealthy, at first for athletes and coaches with respiratory or cardiac conditions and for everyone as the AQI increases.\n\u201cPeople that have lung issues in general are ones that often are more reactive to the worst air quality, but at some point, it\u2019s really not healthy for any of us,\u201d said Dr. Nick Simpson, Hennepin Emergency Medical Services\u2019 chief medical director.\nThe MSHSL\u2019s recommendations for air-quality levels include:\n\u2022 Any athlete or team personnel who develops a cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath should not exercise outside when the air quality is bad.\n\u2022 Athletes with asthma should move indoors for an AQI of 100 or above.\n\u2022 Moving everyone indoors when the AQI is above 150 is recommended.\n\u2022 When the AQI is greater than 200, all outdoor activities should be moved indoors, postponed or cancelled.\nSimpson compared the decision to cancel high school practices because of poor air quality to the decision race organizers face with heat advisories. General threshold guidelines exist, \u201cbut typically it\u2019s up to the race director or the medical director of that event to make those calls\u201d or put out guidance for participants to ease up on the effort of their activity. In this case, that\u2019s coaches and athletic directors.\n\u201cThe big thing for coaches \u2026 is just to be vigilant and to have an awareness of what medical issues the participants in these events have,\u201d Simpson said.\nComments"

Catch the spectacle while you can because it\u2019s the last one of the year.\nThese linkups happen when several planets appear to line up in the night sky at once. Such parades are fairly common, happening around every year depending on the number of planets. At least one bright planet can be spotted on most nights, weather permitting, according to NASA.\nSix planets were visible in January skies and every planet of our solar system was visible in February, but not all could be spotted with the naked eye.\nVenus, Jupiter, Saturn and a faint Mercury are visible this month without any special equipment, and the best chances to spot them are over the next week. Uranus and Neptune can only be glimpsed through binoculars and telescopes.\nJupiter and Venus made a close brush earlier this week and are still near each other in the eastern sky, \u2018\u2019close together like cat\u2019s eyes,\u2019\u2019 said Carolyn Sumners at the Houston Museum of Natural Science.\nMercury will be at its farthest point from the sun on Tuesday morning, making it easier to spot before it disappears into the sun\u2019s glare.\nTo catch the planets, go out in the morning shortly before sunrise and look east. Try to find Jupiter and Venus clustered together first. Saturn is off to the side and Mercury will be close to the horizon, trying to rise before the sun.\n\u2018\u2019You\u2019re looking for little tiny pinpoints of light, but they are the brightest ones,\u2019\u2019 said Justin Bartel with the Science Museum of Virginia. \u2018\u2019They don\u2019t really twinkle like the stars do.\u2019\u2019"

      "text": "Just two weeks after rejecting a license application for cannabis microbusiness the Smoking Tree, the Albert Lea City Council stood by its earlier decision.\nThe council on Monday voted to deny the license again. However, the council approved two other cannabis microbusinesses in the city: Matchbox Farms MN\u2019s Matchbox Dispensary, operated by father-and-son duo Chris Gracia Sr. and Chris Gracia Jr., and Black Husky, operated by Cristina Aranguiz. The business owners volunteered background checks that revealed no issues, Albert Lea City Manager Ian Rigg said.\nNearly every seat was filled on Monday night \u2014 including extra chairs brought in for audience members. A handful of community members spoke against allowing cannabis dispensaries in Albert Lea, while a few spoke in favor, including Matchbox Farms owner Gracia Sr. A representative for Aranguiz made a similar request.\n\u201cPeople have different opinions, and we respect that,\u201d Gracia Sr. said. \u201cOur goal is not to change anyone\u2019s beliefs but to operate in full compliance with Minnesota law and every ordinance the city puts in place.\u201d\nThe council voted 6\u20131 to approve registering Matchbox Farms, with Albert Lea Mayor Rich Murray voting no. It also approved Black Husky 5\u20132, with Murray and Council Member Keith Van Beek voting against.\nThe OCM previously accused Aranguiz of being \u201cthe face of a scheme to use hundreds of straw applicants to gain unfair advantage\u201d in a social equity license lottery that was canceled in November. She subsequently sued the OCM, challenging the denial of her application. However, in late July, a three-judge panel of the Minnesota Court of Appeals dismissed the case.\n(Sign up for Nuggets, our free weekly email newsletter about legal cannabis in Minnesota.)\nChris Gracia Sr., 54, and Chris Gracia Jr., 29, hope to open their dispensary by Oct. 1.

      "text": "High school two-sport standouts share secrets of juggling summer basketball and football\nShakopee\u2019s Blake Betton, Waseca\u2019s Deron Russell and Hopkins brothers Tre and Jayden Moore, all prominent recruits in each sport, figure out ways to doubly prepare.\nShakopee\u2019s Blake Betton had a blast playing on one of the top AAU basketball teams in the country for years, but football took priority this summer.\nBetton, the most highly recruited defensive player in Minnesota\u2019s 2027 class, has offers from SEC, Big Ten and Big 12 college football programs.\nThat caused the 6-3, 200-pound linebacker/safety to sacrifice playing with his childhood friends on Howard Pulley\u2019s Nike hoops team to attend team camps to boost his football recruiting profile.\n\u201cI knew my future was more with football,\u201d said Betton, who has offers from Michigan, Iowa and the Gophers, among others. \u201cI still like playing for my high school basketball team, but I just knew to focus on football was the best thing for me. I had to get bigger, faster and stronger and get ready for the camps.\u201d\nBetton\u2019s summer basketball was limited to a couple of local summer tournaments with Shakopee. That worked well for his football-heavy schedule. One of his former AAU teammates is the state\u2019s No. 1 junior, Ty Schlagel from Cretin-Derham Hall, who has basketball offers from the Gophers and Wisconsin.\n\u201cI definitely miss it and feel like I could still add some value to that Pulley team,\u201d Betton said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until my freshman year going into my sophomore year when I switched from basketball to football as my main sport.\u201d\nHopkins brothers Jayden and Tre Moore and Waseca\u2019s Deron Russell were among the best basketball players in the state during the AAU season. They didn\u2019t stop training for football as summer basketball went on.\n\u201cWith AAU season, it\u2019s kind of hard because we\u2019re traveling,\u201d said Jayden Moore, who has Division I offers for basketball and football. \u201cBut when we\u2019re back home, the workouts we do for basketball and football are tied into each other and the same. Then we\u2019ll do some extra things on the side for each sport.\u201d\nMoore brothers weigh options\nIf you ask the Moore brothers to pick one sport over the other, they might give you different answers depending on the season.\nJayden was known solely as one of the best point guards in the country until he decided to play football for the first time at Hopkins last year. With Tre as his quarterback, he made 44 catches for 924 yards and scored 11 touchdowns.\nGophers football coach P.J. Fleck offered Jayden a scholarship after his unofficial visit last fall. Jayden still seems to be leaning toward the hardcourt, though.\n\u201cMy shooting got better after spending time in the gym getting up quality shots,\u201d Jayden said. \u201cI feel like coming into this season my jumper will be the best it\u2019s been in my career.\u201d\nFollowing his brother\u2019s path, Tre played for Team Herro\u2019s AAU basketball program in Milwaukee this summer. The younger Moore stood out as high-level guard prospect at the 15U level, but he could have a brighter future as a quarterback. For the Royals last season, Tre threw for 1,438 yards and 14 touchdowns.\nTre is ranked by Prep Redzone as the No. 1 football recruit in the 2028 class in Minnesota, so he spent even more time getting teammates together this summer on the field.\n\u201cI would have basketball practices in the morning,\u201d Tre said. \u201cAfter that I would have all my football workouts in the evenings Monday through Thursday. On Friday, I would do strictly football workouts and play catch with receivers. On the weekends, I would mix it up. I\u2019ve been able manage both sports well so far.\u201d\nRussell rises in second sport\nA springy 6-1 guard on the court and a defensive back on the field, Russell committed to North Dakota State for football in June.\nRegarded as a top-10 senior in the state, he led Waseca to the Class 2A state championship game in March and scored 38 points in the state semifinals in Waseca\u2019s upset of Breck. He was also named to the Prep Hoops All-AAU first team, playing for Minnesota Select. That list included Wayzata\u2019s Christian Wiggins, an Iowa State commit, and Nolen Anderson, a Gophers commit; they are the Nos. 1 and 2-rated boys basketball players in the state\u2019s Class of 2026.\n\u201cA lot of schools asked me how seriously I took football and if I wanted to play basketball,\u201d said Russell, who had older brothers play college football at Washington State (Damarius) and South Dakota State (Saiveon).\nDamarius was one of 14 players on the Star Tribune\u2019s All-Minnesota football team last year that also played basketball, including Gophers recruits Roman Voss and Emmanuel Karmo.\nLike his brothers, Russell decided football is his future, but he still gets attention via basketball. During a Prep Hoops tournament in July, word quickly spread of Russell\u2019s one-handed dunk over a 6-9 defender.\nSoon, however, Russell will use his leaping ability to make interceptions.\n\u201cI just try to play both sports as much as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll try to train for both each day. The transition is [easier] at the end of the summer because we start football camp. That\u2019s when I kind of slow down for basketball to get me ready for the football season.\u201d\nComments"

Dunn was arrested on an assault charge after he threw a \"sub-style\" sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent, a court filing said.\nDunn, 37, of Washington, was an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department's criminal division, according to a department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter.\n\"This is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\" Bondi wrote. ''You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.''\nSabrina Shroff, an attorney who represented Dunn at his initial appearance in federal court, declined to comment on the allegations against her client after Thursday's hearing.\nA multiagency flood of uniformed federal law enforcement officers had fanned out across the city over the weekend after the White House had announced stepped-up measures to combat crime. That was before President Donald Trump's announcement Monday that he was taking over Washington's police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard.\nThe Justice Department still employs a former FBI agent who was charged with joining a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol and cheering on rioters during the Jan. 6, 2021, siege, repeatedly yelling ''Kill \u2018em!\" as they attacked police. The former FBI supervisory agent, Jared Lane Wise, is serving as a counselor to Justice Department pardon attorney Ed Martin Jr., who was a leading figure in Trump's campaign to overturn the 2020 election.\nAround 11 p.m. on Sunday, Dunn approached a group of CBP agents, pointed a finger in an agent's face and swore at him, calling him a ''fascist,'' a police affidavit says. An observer's video captured Dunn throwing a sandwich at the agent's chest, the affidavit says."
