  "title": "'Trump Accounts' are $1k of free money. Here's how to claim it.",
  "description": "Yes, it's free money, but there are lots of other tax-advantaged savings plans. Are \"Trump Accounts\" a worthy investment?",
  "content": "Every child born between 2025 and 2028 is getting a baby shower gift from Congress and the president: a $1,000 deposit into a \u201cTrump Account.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s free money, but your baby can\u2019t spend it. Think of \"Trump Accounts\" as seed money, basically, to encourage children and families to save and build wealth for the many expenses of adulthood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an IRA for kids,\u201d said Evan Morgan, a principal in the tax advisory group at Kaufman Rossin, an accounting and advisory firm.\n\nTrump Accounts are part of the tax and spending package signed into law this summer by President Donald Trump. They join a crowded field of tax-advantaged savings plans that help Americans navigate the costs of education, health care and retirement, among other things.\n\nWhat\u2019s unusual, in this case, is that the accounts start at birth, and with a $1,000 balance.\n\n\u201cTo me, if I drew a best-case scenario on that thousand dollars, it would be sitting in that IRA, compounding, until I retired,\u201d said J. Spencer Williams, founder and CEO of the Retirement Clearinghouse, a financial technology firm.\n\nHere\u2019s how the accounts work, according to analyses from Morningstar, the Tax Foundation and other sources:\n\nThe government pledges to create an account for any baby born between 2025 and 2028, and to fund it with a one-time deposit of $1,000. To qualify, the baby need only have a Social Security number.\n\nParents and others may contribute up to $5,000 a year into the accounts until the child turns 18. An employer may contribute up to $2,500 toward the $5,000 cap. State and local governments and private charities will be allowed to make broad contributions.\n\nNo one may contribute to the accounts until July 2026. Other details are still being ironed out.\n\nTo claim an account, parents probably will have to check a box on a tax form testifying that they are new parents, said Williams of the Retirement Clearinghouse.\n\nThe new law requires that Trump Account funds be invested in low-cost stock index funds, which mirror the performance of an index such as the S&P 500.\n\nParent contributions are after-tax, but that money is not taxable when it is withdrawn. Any earnings on the contributions, however, are taxed when you withdraw them.\n\nYou can\u2019t generally withdraw money from a Trump Account until the year a child turns 18. After that, it functions like a traditional Individual Retirement Account.\n\nThat means, 20 or 30 years from now, a young adult with a Trump Account will be able to withdraw money to cover education expenses or a first-time home purchase without penalties.\n\nYou can also hold onto the money until retirement. At age 59 \u00bd, the early-withdrawal penalties go away.\n\nThe accounts originally were designed to be spent by children in young adulthood. The Senate restructured them into something more like a conventional IRA.\n\n\u201cThis became nothing but a retirement account, at the end of the day. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d said Miklos Ringbauer, a CPA in Southern California.\n\nThe last-minute changes left many people confused about Trump Accounts. Ringbauer said he has fielded questions from clients.\n\n\u201cWe have to correct all the misinformation that\u2019s out there,\u201d he said.\n\nGiven the promise of free money from the government, Ringbauer said, it\u2019s hard to imagine many parents will pass up a chance to acquire the accounts.\n\n\u201cAnything is better than nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many kids who start out with nothing.\u201d\n\nThe harder question, perhaps, is whether parents should actively contribute to the accounts over the next 18 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s free money. The question is whether you would add onto it,\u201d said Monique Morrissey, a senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n\nIf your goal is to save for a child\u2019s education, a 529 education savings account \u201coffers more flexibility and tax benefits,\u201d according to a Tax Foundation analysis.\n\n\u201cI think most parents are going to be better off saving in a 529 for their children rather than this new Trump Account, but it certainly makes sense to collect on the $1,000 contribution,\u201d said Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nBoccia calls Trump Accounts \u201ca blatant giveaway, and a way for the Trump administration, in their hopes, to leave a permanent mark by naming a rather useless savings account after the current president.\u201d\n\nMorrissey predicts Trump Accounts will become \u201ca niche thing,\u201d favored by parents with large portfolios and paid investment advisers. \u201cI don\u2019t think these are going to take off in a big way,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Tax Foundation notes that the U.S. tax code already provides for \u201cat least 11 different tax-advantaged savings vehicles, each with different rules, limitations and regulations.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, a Trump Account encourages the kind of long-term retirement saving that financial planners generally recommend. The earlier you invest, the more your investments are likely to grow before you cash them out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d call it an 18-year head start to retirement,\u201d said Neal Ringquist, executive vice president of the Retirement Clearinghouse.\n\nTrue, Trump Accounts add another layer of complexity to the tax code. But there\u2019s nothing to stop account holders from consolidating their Trump Accounts with other retirement accounts once they reach adulthood.\n\n\u201cIf the money isn\u2019t used, it becomes an ordinary, traditional IRA in its adult life,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe initiative will cost an estimated $15 billion through 2034, at a time when the U.S. government faces a $37 trillion national debt.\n\nEven so, proponents hope the new accounts will inspire a generation of children to gain financial literacy as they build wealth for adulthood.\n\n\u201cThis is a really big step forward,\u201d Williams said, \u201cin terms of using the American free market and the opportunity for growth and compounding to help people save for whatever comes next.\u201d",

      "text": "Maintaining the National Debt\nThe federal government is charged interest for the use of lenders\u2019 money, in the same way that lenders charge an individual interest for a car loan or mortgage. How much the government pays in interest depends on the total national debt and the various securities\u2019 interest rates.\nAs of it costs $0 billion to maintain the debt, which is 0% of the total federal spending in fiscal year .\nThe national debt has increased every year over the past ten years. Interest expenses during this period have remained fairly stable due to low interest rates and investors\u2019 judgement that the U.S. Government has a very low risk of default. However, recent increases in interest rates and inflation are now resulting in an increase in interest expense.\nWhen interest rates remain low over time, interest expense on the debt paid by the federal government will remain stable, even as the federal debt increases. As interest rates increase, the cost of maintaining the national debt also increases."

      "text": "On July 4th, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill into law, marking a historic step towards fiscal responsibility and promoting American opportunity. One significant provision of this bill is the creation of Trump Accounts.\nWhat Are Trump Accounts?\nTrump Accounts are a new form of savings account available on behalf of children. Specifically, all U.S. children born between 2025-2028 and who have a Social Security number will qualify for a Trump Account that includes a one-time deposit of $1,000 from the federal government.\nParents, employers, and others can contribute up to a combined $5,000 per year until the child turns 18. Of that amount, employer contributions are capped at $2,500 per year per employee or the employee\u2019s child. Starting in 2028, these $5,000 and $2,500 limits will be indexed for inflation. State and local governments and private charities can also contribute uniform amounts to particular groups of Accounts and their contributions do not count towards the $5,000 annual limit.\nThese Accounts will not be fully operational until July 2026 and contributions can begin at that time. The Treasury Department will oversee the program, while private banks will handle Account administration.\nInvestments must be made in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds with a ban on industry or sector-specific indexes. Funds must have expense ratios of 0.1% or less, requiring indexing to funds similar to the S&P 500.\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that Trump Accounts will cost just over $15 billion through 2034. Extending the $1,000 federal contribution for children born in and after 2029 would cost another $19 billion through 2034. More than 95 percent of these costs come from the $1,000 federal government contribution and not from any tax advantage.\nHow are They Taxed?\nIndividual contributions to a Trump Account are made post-tax, meaning there is no tax advantage for parents to contribute. It is possible that there would be a tax disadvantage on the earnings of parents\u2019 contributions as they will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates instead of at lower capital gains tax rates that would have applied if parents put the money in an ordinary investment account. If the child\u2019s future income tax rate is higher than the parent\u2019s capital gains tax rate at the time of withdrawal, there will be a tax disadvantage. And if the opposite is true and the child\u2019s income tax rate is lower than the parent\u2019s capital gains tax rate, there will be a tax advantage.\nEmployers may contribute up to $2,500 per year per child in tax-free contributions to the Trump Account of each employee\u2019s child(ren) or to the Trump Account of a teenage employee (applicable to children born in 2025 and later who have Accounts and become working teens). Nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations and state and local governments may also make tax-free contributions to Trump Accounts as long as those contributions are made on an equal basis to a general class of beneficiaries, such as all children living in a certain geographic area. While these contributions are tax free upon deposit, the initial contribution and all future earnings from them will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates upon withdrawal.\nNo withdrawals may be made before the year the beneficiary turns 18. On January 1st of the year the beneficiary turns 18, they may begin withdrawing funds from the Account. Beginning at age 18, and individual\u2019s Trump Account is treated like an IRA. The withdrawn funds are subject to income taxes and, if withdrawn before the age of 59 and a half for a non-qualified expense, an additional 10% penalty. Exemptions generally match the traditional IRA early withdrawal exemptions. Some examples of qualifying exemptions include purchasing a first home, disaster recovery from a federally declared disaster, birth and adoption expenses, and college and other educational expenses.\nIf an individual waits until 59 and a half years old before withdrawing funds, then they can withdraw money for any reason without being subject to the 10% penalty.\nComparison to Other Savings Accounts\nTrump Accounts are effectively a combination of a traditional IRA, a ROTH IRA, and an interest-bearing savings account.\nContributions made by employers, the original $1,000 contribution made by the federal government (taxpayers), and any potential contributions from state and local governments and charities are like a traditional IRA\u2014the contributions are tax-free and the withdrawals of those contributions plus their earnings are taxed at ordinary income tax rates.\nContributions from individuals (such as a parent or family member) are like a Roth IRA in that the contributions are taxed before being deposited into Trump Accounts and the original contribution amount is not taxed upon withdrawal, so long as it is for a qualified expense. However, unlike a Roth IRA that allows the earnings of pre-taxed contributions to also go untaxed, the earnings that accumulate from an individual\u2019s pre-taxed contributions are not only subject to taxes, but are\u2014similar to interest income in a savings account\u2014taxed at ordinary income tax rates instead of lower capital gains tax rates.\nThe main incentives to open a Trump Account are not the personal savings components, but the opportunity for contributions from other sources including: the $1,000 contribution from the federal government for children born between 2025 and 2028, potential employer contributions on behalf of the children of employees, and potential state and local government and charitable contributions. While that may seem attractive, other savings accounts provide a better investment vehicle for parents to maximize return on after-tax investments for their children."

      "text": "10 Things to Know About the Trump Savings Account\nThe new OBBBA-created accounts offer tax-deferred savings for children but come with unique rules, limits, and deadlines.\nDenise is hosting a webinar, \u201cTrump Accounts: What Every Advisor Needs to Know,\u201d at 12 p.m. Eastern time on Aug. 21. Register here.\nThe \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" signed into law on July 4, 2025, created a special savings account for children under the age of 18 called the Trump Savings Account.\nThe Trump account borrows many of its rules from the traditional IRA but follows unique provisions until the year the child turns 18. At that point, the Trump account is treated like a regular traditional IRA. Before then, it has its own limits, restrictions, and timing rules that parents and guardians must understand.\nA Trump account can be funded by a parent or guardian, another individual such as a relative or friend, an employer, the IRS in special circumstances, and an eligible charitable organization. Although contributions may come from several sources, there are strict rules on how much can be contributed each year and when distributions can be made.\nHere are 10 things to know about Trump Savings Accounts.\n1) Who Owns the Trump Account?\nSimilar to a 529 plan or an education savings account, the child is the owner of the Trump account and is referred to as the beneficiary. All Trump account rules are designed with the child as the owner.\n2) What Type of Accounts Are Contributions Made To?\nContributions to a Trump account can only be made to accounts that follow the traditional IRA framework in the tax code. Employer contributions are not treated like SEP or Simple IRA contributions and therefore do not require the notices or operational procedures associated with those accounts. Funds in a Trump account grow tax-deferred, and any earnings are taxable when withdrawn.\n3) Who Can Contribute to a Trump Account and How Much?\nA Trump account can receive contributions of up to $5,000 each year from parents, guardians, and other individuals. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 for an employee or the employee\u2019s dependent who is under age 18. The employer\u2019s contribution counts against the $5,000 yearly limit.\nThe OBBBA also created the one-time $1,000 deposit from the federal government for children born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. It appears that parents can claim this contribution by filing an election with the IRS. The child must have a Social Security number. The $1,000 deposit doesn\u2019t count against that year\u2019s $5,000 limit.\nBesides the $1,000 deposit, certain other government programs and charities may make contributions to eligible classes of children that do not count toward the $5,000 limit.\n4) What Are the Contribution Deadlines?\nTrump account contributions must be made by Dec. 31 of the contribution year.\nIn the year the child turns 18, the account becomes a traditional IRA and follows the regular IRA deadline, meaning contributions can be made up to the tax filing due date for that year and after.\n5) How Is a Trump Account Invested?\nTrump accounts have limited investment options. They may only be invested in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track a qualified index, such as the S&P 500. They cannot use leverage. Annual fees cannot exceed 0.1% of the account balance.\n6. When Can Distributions Be Made?\nDistributions cannot be made before the year the child turns 18, but there are exceptions:\n- A distribution of the entire Trump account can be rolled over to another Trump account for the same beneficiary.\n- A distribution of the entire Trump account can be rolled to an ABLE account in the year the child turns 17.\n- Excess contributions can be returned.\n- A distribution can be made upon the death of the beneficiary.\nAt age 18, normal IRA distribution rules apply, including possible early distribution penalties for distributions before age 59\u00bd unless an exception applies.\n7) How Are Distributions Taxed?\nThe tax treatment of a Trump account depends on the source of contributions.\n- Contributions from parents, guardians, and other individuals are not tax-deductible and create the basis in the Trump account that is not taxable when withdrawn.\n- Employer contributions, the $1,000 federal contribution, and charitable gifts do not create basis and are taxable when withdrawn.\n- Earnings are taxable when withdrawn.\nWithdrawals of taxable amounts before age 59\u00bd may also be subject to a 10% early distribution penalty unless an exception applies.\nExample: If 40% of the Trump account balance is basis and 60% is taxable amounts, then 40% of any distribution will be nontaxable and 60% will be taxable. The IRS does not allow distribution to be taken solely from basis first.\nOnly contributions made by parents, guardians, relatives, friends, or the beneficiary create basis in the account. All other contributions and all earnings are fully taxable when withdrawn.\n8) What Happens at Age 18?\nIn the year the child turns 18, the Trump account transitions to following all traditional IRA rules. Contributions to the account from that point on require the child to have eligible compensation.\nThe Trump account becomes subject to normal IRA rollover, transfer, and aggregation rules, including the one-per-year rollover limit, basis aggregation, and future required minimum distributions.\n9) What Are the Reporting Requirements of Trump Accounts?\nThe financial institution holding the Trump account must send annual reports to both the IRS and the account owner. These reports show contributions (including the source of any contribution over $25 from nonfamily members), distributions, rollovers, account balance, and basis in the account.\nThese reporting requirements continue until the calendar year in which the child turns 17. After that, the account is reported under the traditional IRA framework.\n10) When Can I Start Making Contributions?\nUnder the law, no Trump account contributions can be accepted until 12 months after enactment of the OBBBA. Therefore, the earliest date contributions can be made is July 4, 2026.\nCustodians will need to create Trump account-specific documents and systems to manage the accounts, including the ability to track basis.\nReminder: Watch Out for Penalties\nIt\u2019s important to remember that penalties might occur when contributions to Trump accounts exceed the annual limit, distributions are taken too early, or deadlines are missed.\nIf the annual contribution limit is exceeded, the IRS may assess a 6% penalty each year until the excess is corrected. The correction usually involves withdrawing the extra contribution and any earnings.\nWithdrawals before the year the beneficiary turns 18 are generally prohibited except for limited exceptions. After age 18, distributions before age 59\u00bd may trigger a 10% penalty unless an exception applies.\nBefore age 18, contributions must be made by Dec. 31 of the contribution year. In the year the child turns 18 and after, the deadline shifts to the IRA tax filing date. Missing the deadline may result in a lost contribution opportunity for that year.\nShould I Open a Trump Account for My Child?\nThe Trump account is a new tax-deferred savings option for children aged 17 and younger. It works like a traditional IRA after the child turns 18 but has special limits and rules before then.\nFor families who qualify, the $1,000 federal contribution, employer contributions, and other potential general funding contributions represent free money, and there is little reason to decline them. However, when it comes to making contributions from your own funds, it is important to evaluate whether the Trump account, a 529 plan, a Roth IRA (if eligible), or another savings vehicle is the best fit for your child, unless you have the resources to take advantage of them all.\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

      "text": "Trump Accounts Serve No Clear Purpose and Would Exclude Vulnerable Children\nThe House-passed reconciliation bill\u2019s Trump Accounts double down on a failed approach to addressing public policy challenges and exclude the most vulnerable children from eligibility for even the modest benefits available. Tax-preferred accounts primarily benefit families that already have spare time and money, not the families that need the most help, and come with other downsides including fees, lack of flexibility, and potential penalties. Moreover, the reconciliation bill\u2019s inadequate attempt to address existing wealth disparities through these accounts by providing a one-time $1000 contribution leaves out some of the children with the greatest challenges, including certain children with unstable or complex living situations and those whose caregivers have very low incomes and do not file a tax return.\nThe Basics of Trump Accounts\nTrump Accounts are tax-preferred investment accounts held for the exclusive benefit of a child who is under 8 at the time the account is created.\nThe tax benefits offered by these accounts are modest. Contributions are not deductible, distributions used for qualified expenses are taxed at capital gains rates, and other distributions are taxed at ordinary rates.1 There is no tax on earnings within the account until they are distributed.\nNo distributions are allowed before the beneficiary\u2019s 18th birthday, and cumulative distributions before the beneficiary\u2019s 25th birthday may not exceed half the account balance on the beneficiary\u2019s 18th birthday. A 10% additional tax is imposed on distributions before the beneficiary\u2019s 30th birthday that are not spent on qualified expenses. On a taxpayer\u2019s 31st birthday, the account ceases to be a Trump account and any remaining balance is treated as distributed.\nQualified expenses are:\n- Expenses for post-secondary education,\n- Expenses for certain post-secondary credentialing programs and certain fees related to obtaining or maintaining a post-secondary credential,\n- Certain expenses related to a small business for which the beneficiary has received a small business loan, small farm loan, or similar loan, and\n- Any amount used for the purchase of a first home for the account beneficiary.\nAnnual contributions are limited to $5,000 (adjusted for inflation), disregarding contributions made by federal, state, local, or Tribal governments and certain non-profits. No contributions are allowed after a beneficiary\u2019s 18th birthday.\nAssets in Trump Accounts must be invested in mutual funds that track a US equity index, do not use leverage, minimize fees and expenses, and meet other criteria specified by the Secretary.\nA person may be the beneficiary of only one Trump account. However, the entire balance of a Trump Account may be rolled over from one account to another, which would permit, for example, an existing account to be moved from one financial institution to another. If a second Trump Account is established for a beneficiary, that account ceases to be a Trump Account and the balance is treated as distributed.2\nTrump Accounts Offer Modest Tax Benefits, High Risk, and Additional Complexity\nProponents of Trump Accounts argue that they will give the next generation a critical boost as they reach adulthood, but in practice the accounts offer few benefits and significant risks. Moreover, taken as a whole, the reconciliation bill does far more to deprive the next generation of needed investment.\nThe tax benefits of Trump Accounts are generally worse than other tax-preferred accounts. In practice, Trump Accounts would be quite similar to taxable accounts. Contributions are not deductible, qualified distributions are taxable as long-term capital gains, and assets must be invested in index mutual funds. A taxpayer who wants to buy and hold mutual funds in a taxable account can get essentially the same treatment. Such an investment may generate a small amount of currently taxable dividends or capital gains distributions, but even that is not necessarily the case. A mutual fund that does not pay dividends and capital gains would yield exactly the same treatment\u2014and with no requirement to lock up the investment until age 18, no requirement to pay ordinary tax on distributions not used for a qualified expense, and no risk of penalty taxes if a distribution is needed for something other than the specified qualified expenses before age 30.\nBalances in Trump Accounts must be invested in a high-risk portfolio consisting solely of corporate equities. The bill requires Trump accounts to be invested in a US equity index (or a similarly diversified portfolio of US equities).\nTrump Accounts are explicitly intended for early distribution. They unlock at 18 and qualified expenses include higher education and purchasing a first home. Indeed, the accounts cease to be Trump Accounts when a beneficiary turns 31. A high-risk allocation would rarely be suitable for this set of circumstances. Moreover, there is no allowance for beneficiaries who plan to take distributions in the near future. A high school senior who plans to enroll in college next year cannot change the investment to a lower-risk portfolio. If the market crashes the summer before she plans to enroll, the Trump Account is of greatly reduced use.\nMoreover, there is little reason to have public investment in children depend in this direct fashion on financial market returns during their youth. While this critique could (and should) be made of any account-based approach to investing in children, Trump Accounts exacerbate the flaws of the approach by mandating that the full portfolio be invested in corporate equity \u2013 a very high-risk portfolio allocation.3 The legislation prohibits more reasonable asset allocations such as a mix of equities and bonds or a lifecycle fund that moves into lower-risk allocations as the child approaches age 18. The benefits of mandating investment in a low-fee index, which reduces the portion of the investment taken up in portfolio management fees, could be achieved without choosing to restrict the investment to such a narrow and risky class of assets.\nAccessing the public contribution to Trump Accounts requires beneficiaries and their caregivers to navigate a complex system. For the reasons described above, Trump Accounts will be worse than other tax-preferred accounts for most people. Nonetheless, taxpayers will still need to deal with the accounts to withdraw the public contribution and so will take on all of the complexity of yet another tax-preferred account, including learning all the rules, managing paperwork, and avoiding penalties.\nPilot Program Leaves Out the Most Vulnerable Children\nThe reconciliation bill establishes a pilot program under which the federal government will make a one-time $1,000 contribution to Trump accounts, but this program leaves out some of the most vulnerable children.\nSpecifically, the legislation would provide for a one-time $1,000 contribution to the account of each child born after December 31, 2024 and before January 1, 2029 who is a U.S. citizen at birth and who is the qualifying child of a taxpayer who has a Social Security Number. If the taxpayer is married, their spouse must also have a Social Security Number.\nIf an account has not already been established for a child who appears as a qualifying child on a tax return, the legislation instructs the Secretary to open an account for that child and make a $1,000 contribution to it.\nWhile it is good that the legislation aims to create an automatic backstop for the payment of the contribution, the eligibility requirements leave out some of the most vulnerable children, including:\n- Children who are not the qualifying child of any taxpayer. A child who doesn\u2019t live with any taxpayer for more than six months in a year is not the qualifying child of any taxpayer and therefore could not appear on a tax return. No account will be opened and no contribution will be made. This would include a child who spends equal time with each of two parents but also spends two weeks with their grandparents and a child who splits time roughly equally between three different relatives, for example.\n- Children of non-filers. A grandparent raising their grandchildren who receives only a modest amount of Social Security income may not have a filing requirement and may not know about the Trump accounts. If the grandparent does not file, the child will not appear on a tax return. No account will be opened and no contribution will be made.\n- Children with an undocumented parent. A U.S. citizen child with one U.S. citizen parent and one undocumented parent would be ineligible for the contribution.\nChildren with unstable or complex living situations and those whose caregivers are sufficiently low income that they do not have a filing requirement are exactly those children who may most benefit from additional resources invested in them and their future, but the bill would exclude them from the benefit of the pilot program, while paying $1,000 for everybody else.\nThe exclusion of these vulnerable populations from the pilot program is particularly notable because advocates of Trump Accounts and similar programs often compare simulations of account balances to statistics on wealth inequality to illustrate how they could reduce disparities. A realistic assessment of the impact of these programs must account for incomplete take-up and any exclusions.\nMoreover, if the only money in an account is the $1,000 contributed by the government, the administrative fees associated with keeping a $1,000 account open for 18 years may significantly eat into the value of that $1,000. This is especially likely to be true in the case of Trump Accounts, because the limited tax advantages of the account mean that taxpayers have little reason to contribute other assets to the accounts beyond those resulting from the pilot program. Moreover, if there are few large balance accounts, the potential for cross-subsidization of the costs of maintaining smaller balance accounts is reduced. This contrasts with 529 plans where high-balance accounts of higher-income taxpayers allow for cross-subsidization of the relatively small number of accounts from lower-income taxpayers.\nFinally, taxpayers must also pay tax on the public contribution when it is distributed. While some low-income taxpayers may face a low or zero rate, taxpayers in the phase-out range of the Earned Income Tax Credit, for example, could lose a meaningful portion of the contribution. As a result, even for the children eligible for the promised $1,000, the actual value may be much less taking fees and taxes into account.\nNonprofit Loophole Creates Risks\nThe legislation would also allow nonprofits to make unlimited contributions to groups of Trump Account beneficiaries if the accounts are selected on the basis of beneficiaries\u2019 place of residence, the school district they attend, or any other basis the Secretary determines appropriate and if each recipient receives an equal portion of the contribution. There are no guardrails in the provision preventing targeting these programs at wealthy and well-connected school districts and neighborhoods. That sort of targeting would create a substantial loophole without policy rationale, with an added bonus of tax deductions for the funders of the program. The law would require the funds to come from a 501(c) tax-exempt organization, and that may prevent some of the worst abuses. But there\u2019s a risk it may not (either because of sophisticated planning, or organizations failing to comply with the relevant section 501(c) rules).\nBy contrast, this provision will be of limited use to non-profits, states, and localities trying to in fact serve disadvantaged children. If a nonprofit made contributions to these accounts, a portion of that contribution would be paid in tax to the federal government because it would give rise to a taxable distribution.4 As a result, nonprofits would be wise to consider other ways of spending resources for which the federal government will not take a cut, especially considering the more general shortcomings of tax-preferred accounts described next.\nMore complexity for an inherently inferior policy solution\nIn addition to the numerous shortcomings described above, savings accounts make little sense as a policy to help taxpayers afford the types of expenses that are covered by Trump Accounts:\n- Higher education. While many people save for college education, a child\u2019s younger years are not necessarily a time when it is easy for parents to set aside money for future education. And those who are able to save enough for higher education during a child\u2019s younger years (or after them) are in general well-off filers who are already able to afford those expenses.5 Indeed, there is no convincing evidence that 529 plans increase college enrollment or completion.6 Instead they simply give tax breaks to families already well off enough to afford higher education expenses.\n- First home purchasers. Purchasing a first home requires having enough money for a down payment, but unless that first home is purchased relatively late in life, a tax-preferred savings account that provides a preferential rate of tax on investment earnings is not an effective policy to help potential purchasers secure a down payment for many of the same reasons that 529 plans are not an effective approach to promoting college attendance and completion.\n- Small business investment. An opportunity to start a small business with a substantial potential return could arise at any point in one\u2019s adult life, with no readily apparent reason to prefer a policy that encourages such activities only with a delay when there is a sufficient balance in a Trump account.\nTrump Accounts would certainly not be the first tax-preferred savings account created in a context where savings accounts make little sense. As noted above, 529 plans are mismatched with the finances of families who would struggle most to afford higher education and do not appear to have improved educational outcomes. Similarly, Health Savings Accounts were created to discourage health spending and, in practice, are significantly a vehicle for tax planning by the wealthy. Promoting savings has little to do with the policy goal behind HSAs but wealth has a lot to do with who can benefit from them.\nThe proliferation of tax-preferred savings accounts for various purposes has created a menu of tax subsidies for people who already have spare time and money who can allocate their savings to these various accounts to maximize their tax benefits. They serve, generally, as a transfer of public resources to already well-off filers.\nIf policymakers are primarily concerned with improving college enrollment and completion, housing affordability, and entrepreneurship, they would be better served by addressing such problems directly: investing in higher education, reducing the cost of housing, or providing direct small business subsidies. Notably, the reconciliation bill cuts back on federal support for higher education, including through reductions in the generosity of income-contingent loans and stricter eligibility requirements for Pell Grants. And these cuts are far larger than the contributions made to Trump Accounts.\nIf instead the goal is to more broadly help children, again a savings account makes little sense. Locking up money for a decade while a child grows offers few benefits and adds administrative costs and complexity to the operation of the program. Children who need money today\u2014for unexpected health expenses, better quality childcare, or a move to a better rental home\u2014are rarely best served today or over their lifetime by being required to wait for it until later.\nTrump Accounts would add to an already bewildering array of tax-preferred savings accounts that have little to show for the enormous public investments in them.\n- 1. Distributions are not taxed to the extent they are a return of contributions to the account, excluding contributions by federal, state, local, or Tribal governments and by certain non-profits. \u21a9\n- 2. However, if a Trump Account is established by the Secretary under the pilot program described later, all other Trump accounts cease to be Trump Accounts and are treated as distributed. \u21a9\n- 3. While there is little logic to this portfolio allocation, it has allowed sympathetic analysts of similar proposals to simulate future account balances using high expected returns. For example, Michael Piwowar and Robert Shapiro simulate account balances using an expected (nominal) return of 11%. As a result, they can conclude that the expected balance of a $1000 contribution after 20 years is over $8,000 and after 40 years is $69,000. Of course, many taxpayers would have far less. See Michael Piwowar and Robert Shapiro, Milken Institute, The Economic Impact of Invest America Accounts, 1 (2025). \u21a9\n- 4. The rate of tax would depend on whether the distribution is used to pay a qualified expense or not. \u21a9\n- 5. Indeed, 529 plans ostensibly for higher education allow taxpayers to frontload five years of contributions at birth without paying gift tax, making the plans most valuable for taxpayers who have already accumulated the funds and can simply shift them into a 529 account when a child is born. Two parents can immediately shelter $190,000 in the 529 account of a newborn without paying gift tax using this provision. \u21a9\n- 6. See, e.g., Susan Dynarski, Lindsay Page, and Judith Scott-Clayton, College costs, financial aid, and student decisions, 7 Handbook of the Economics of Education, 227 (2023). \u21a9"
