      "summary": "Transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell’s interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche were released by the Trump administration, showing her denying any knowledge of Donald Trump’s involvement in Epstein’s sex‑trafficking scheme, a move aimed at deflecting criticism as the administration struggled to disclose evidence from the case. The release comes amid ongoing controversy over the Justice Department’s handling of Epstein records, Maxwell’s 20‑year conviction and sentencing, and her recent prison relocation, while victims and advocates continue to demand transparency. Separate stories in the article cover a truck driver denied bond after a fatal crash, the rise and challenges of the T‑visa for trafficking survivors, and the forced return of a Mexican family from a California cannabis farm raid, highlighting broader immigration enforcement tensions. Together, the pieces illustrate the Trump administration’s attempts to manage fallout from the Epstein scandal, its immigration policy controversies, and the human impact of enforcement actions.",
