      "summary": "Americans spent $103 billion on lottery tickets in 2023, yet only $69 billion returned in prizes—an average payoff of less than 67 cents per dollar spent. The odds of winning Powerball’s $1.4 billion jackpot are 1 in 292 million, and the present‑value cash payout is only 45 % of the headline figure. In contrast, the S&P 500 has delivered an average 10 % annual return over the past 97 years, making long‑term equity investing a far more reliable path to wealth than gambling on lotteries.",
