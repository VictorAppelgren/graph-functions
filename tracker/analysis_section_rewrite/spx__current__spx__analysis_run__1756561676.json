      "feedback": "The draft is on the right track but needs tightening to meet Argos standards.  \n\n**Key fixes**  \n1. **Canonical handle mapping** – replace generic “Tesla’s stock” with **TSLA**; use **spx**, **ndx**, **ust10y** for indices and yields.  \n2. **Explicit sign/magnitude** – state “TSLA will decline 5‑10 % if the verdict stands; upside capped at $360 if overturned.”  \n3. **Causal chain** – clearly link the verdict → legal risk → investor sentiment → TSLA price; add Fed policy and 10‑year yield as secondary transmission paths.  \n4. **Catalyst window** – “court ruling due 0‑3 weeks” and “Fed’s 25‑bp cut signal at the September FOMC” with dates.  \n5. **Invalidation** – note that a reversal of the verdict or a rise in ust10y above 4.3 % would blunt upside.  \n6. **Watch list** – court ruling, NHTSA action on robotaxis, Fed policy, ust10y, spx/ndx trend.  \n7. **Citation density** – add inline citations: (LJZYDXVL3) for verdict, (B1KYJ1GPU) for market context, (B1KYJ1GPU) for Fed hint, (B1KYJ1GPU) for 10‑year yield.  \n\n**Revised paragraph**  \n> TSLA will likely decline 5‑10 % if the $243 m verdict is upheld, reflecting heightened legal risk and a broader tech‑sector sell‑off that has already dragged **ndx** and **spx** lower (B1KYJ1GPU).  A reversal could lift TSLA toward $360, but upside is capped by the 10‑year Treasury yield, which has risen to 4.23 % (B1KYJ1GPU) and the Fed’s 25‑bp rate‑cut signal for the September FOMC (B1KYJ1GPU).  The primary catalyst is the court ruling due 0‑3 weeks (LJZYDXVL3); secondary catalysts include NHTSA scrutiny of Tesla robotaxis and the Fed’s policy stance.  Watch for: (1) court decision, (2) any NHTSA action, (3) Fed policy updates, (4) ust10y above 4.3 %.  If the verdict is overturned and ust10y stays below 4.3 %, TSLA could rebound to $360; if ust10y rises or the verdict is upheld, the upside is limited.",
