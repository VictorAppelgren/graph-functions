Our top priority is the life and safety of Milwaukee County residents,\u201d Crowley posted on X.\n\u201cI strongly urge our residents to stay cautious, stay informed, and refrain from traveling. Check in on your neighbors and loved ones, especially older adults, and seek out emergency assistance if needed. I am thankful to our first responders, law enforcement partners, social services workers, and neighbors who are lending a helping hand during a challenging time. We will get through this together, Milwaukee.\u201d\nWisconsin State Fair organizers canceled the final day of the event after heavy rain flooded the fairgrounds in West Allis, closing busy roadways and forcing some motorists to abandon vehicles as thousands lost power.\n\u201cWe are saddened we cannot deliver this final day of the Wisconsin State Fair, but know that this is the best decision with current conditions and the forecast ahead,\u201d organizers said in a statement.\nStartling videos and images showed vehicles trapped in the floodwaters at the fair as Wisconsinites desperately tried to flee the state fair, with their hoods and umbrellas up as they waded through 4-inch-deep puddles.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need, possibly, some federal assistance,\u201d he said at a Sunday briefing, adding that Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers will also declare a state of emergency to secure federal aid.\nWith Post wires"
