      "text": "Amkor (AMKR)\nAmkor keeps us up at night. Its underwhelming revenue growth and failure to generate meaningful free cash flow is a concerning trend.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Amkor Will Underperform\nOperating through a largely Asian facility footprint, Amkor Technologies (NASDAQ:AMKR) provides outsourced packaging and testing for semiconductors.\n- Gross margin of 14.4% reflects its high production costs\n- Operating margin falls short of the industry average, and the smaller profit dollars make it harder to react to unexpected market developments\n- Sales tumbled by 4.4% annually over the last two years, showing market trends are working against its favor during this cycle\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Amkor\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Amkor\nAmkor is trading at $23.10 per share, or 17.6x forward P/E. Amkor\u2019s multiple may seem like a great deal among semiconductor peers, but we think there are valid reasons why it\u2019s this cheap.\nIt\u2019s better to pay up for high-quality businesses with higher long-term earnings potential rather than to buy lower-quality stocks because they appear cheap. These challenged businesses often don\u2019t re-rate, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. Amkor (AMKR) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nSemiconductor packaging and testing company Amkor Technology (NASDAQ:AMKR) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 3.4% year on year to $1.51 billion. On top of that, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance ($1.93 billion at the midpoint) was surprisingly good and 9.3% above what analysts were expecting. Its GAAP profit of $0.22 per share was 37.7% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nAmkor (AMKR) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $1.51 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.42 billion (3.4% year-on-year growth, 6.3% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): $0.22 vs analyst estimates of $0.16 (37.7% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $259 million vs analyst estimates of $218.5 million (17.1% margin, 18.5% beat)\n- Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $1.93 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $1.76 billion\n- EPS (GAAP) guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $0.41 at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 7.5%\n- Operating Margin: 6.1%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 7.4%, up from 4% in the same quarter last year\n- Inventory Days Outstanding: 26, in line with the previous quarter\n- Market Capitalization: $5.23 billion\nCompany Overview\nOperating through a largely Asian facility footprint, Amkor Technologies (NASDAQ:AMKR) provides outsourced packaging and testing for semiconductors.\nSemiconductor manufacturing begins with a silicon wafer upon which circuit patterns are transferred. The fabricated material (the die) is then separated (dicing), typically using automation and precision tools such as lasers. Packaging comes next and serves three key purposes: connects the chip to an external environment (e.g. a circuit board), protects the chips against physical damage, and dissipates excess heat.\nAmkor\u2019s customers are semiconductor foundries (manufacturers), fabless semiconductor companies (designers who outsource manufacturing), and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The company\u2019s packaging aims to meet customers\u2019 requirements for size, electrical and mechanical performance, and interconnect technology (wiring systems to connect chips). For example, one of Amkor\u2019s key packaging offerings is the \u2018Flip-Chip Chip Scale Package\u2019, where the package is no larger than the chip. This supports increasingly small form factors found in smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. In addition to packaging, Amkor also offers testing services to ensure that semiconductors are defect-free and meet specifications before being deployed or sold.\nOther companies offering outsourced semiconductor packaging and testing services include ASE Technology (TWSE:3711), Powertech Technology (TWSE:6239), and Siliconware Technology.\n4. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last five years, Amkor grew its sales at a mediocre 6.6% compounded annual growth rate. This was below our standard for the semiconductor sector and is a poor baseline for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but short-term results matter for semiconductors because the rapid pace of technological innovation (Moore's Law) could make yesterday's hit product obsolete today. Amkor\u2019s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 4.4% annually.\nThis quarter, Amkor reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 3.4% but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 6.3%. Adding to the positive news, Amkor\u2019s growth inflected positively this quarter, news that will likely give some shareholders hope. Company management is currently guiding for a 3.4% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.3% over the next 12 months. While this projection indicates its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector.\n5. Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory\nDays Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business\u2019 capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production.\nThis quarter, Amkor\u2019s DIO came in at 26, which is 4 days below its five-year average. Flat versus last quarter, there\u2019s no indication of an excessive inventory buildup.\n6. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nGross profit margin is a key metric to track because it shows how much money a semiconductor company gets to keep after paying for its raw materials, manufacturing, and other input costs.\nAmkor\u2019s gross margin is one of the worst in the semiconductor industry, signaling it operates in a competitive market and lacks pricing power. As you can see below, it averaged a 14.4% gross margin over the last two years. Said differently, Amkor had to pay a chunky $85.58 to its suppliers for every $100 in revenue.\nThis quarter, Amkor\u2019s gross profit margin was 12%, marking a 2.5 percentage point decrease from 14.5% in the same quarter last year. Amkor\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 1.7 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses).\n7. Operating Margin\nAmkor was profitable over the last two years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 7% was weak for a semiconductor business. This result isn\u2019t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Amkor\u2019s operating margin decreased by 4.3 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Amkor\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nIn Q2, Amkor generated an operating margin profit margin of 6.1%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s cost structure has recently been stable.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nAmkor\u2019s EPS grew at an unimpressive 1.7% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, lower than its 6.6% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nWe can take a deeper look into Amkor\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Amkor\u2019s operating margin was flat this quarter but declined by 4.3 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 2.6%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders.\nIn Q2, Amkor reported EPS at $0.22, down from $0.27 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Amkor\u2019s full-year EPS of $1.23 to grow 6.6%.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nAmkor has shown weak cash profitability over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 6.1%, subpar for a semiconductor business.\nAmkor\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $112.3 million in Q2, equivalent to a 7.4% margin. This result was good as its margin was 3.4 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, leading to temporary swings. Long-term trends trump fluctuations.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAmkor\u2019s management team makes decent investment decisions and generates value for shareholders. Its five-year average ROIC was 15.5%, slightly better than typical semiconductor business.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nOne of the best ways to mitigate bankruptcy risk is to hold more cash than debt.\nAmkor is a profitable, well-capitalized company with $2.04 billion of cash and $1.65 billion of debt on its balance sheet. This $394.3 million net cash position is 7.5% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from Amkor\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Amkor blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also glad its revenue guidance for next quarter trumped Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a good print with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 6.3% to $22.57 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Amkor?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 10:23 PM EDT\nA common mistake we notice when investors are deciding whether to buy a stock or not is that they simply look at the latest earnings results. Business quality and valuation matter more, so we urge you to understand these dynamics as well.\nWe see the value of companies furthering technological innovation, but in the case of Amkor, we\u2019re out. To kick things off, its revenue growth was mediocre over the last five years. On top of that, Amkor\u2019s low gross margins indicate some combination of pricing pressures or rising production costs, and its operating margins reveal poor profitability compared to other semiconductor companies.\nAmkor\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 18.5x. While this valuation is reasonable, we don\u2019t see a big opportunity at the moment. There are more exciting stocks to buy at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $24.38 on the company (compared to the current share price of $24.48)."

Summary\nWhy Applied Materials Is Interesting\nFounded in 1967 as the first company to develop tools for other businesses in the semiconductor industry, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is the largest provider of semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment.\n- Stellar returns on capital showcase management\u2019s ability to surface highly profitable business ventures\n- Disciplined cost controls and effective management have materialized in a strong operating margin, and its rise over the last five years was fueled by some leverage on its fixed costs\n- One pitfall is its projected sales growth of 4.9% for the next 12 months suggests sluggish demand\nWhy Is Now The Time To Buy Applied Materials?\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy Is Now The Time To Buy Applied Materials?\nAt $184.41 per share, Applied Materials trades at 19.6x forward P/E. Applied Materials\u2019s multiple is lower than that of many semiconductor companies. Even so, we think it is justified for the top-line growth you get.\nIf you think the market is not giving the company enough credit for its fundamentals, now could be a good time to invest.\n3. Applied Materials (AMAT) Research Report: Q1 CY2025 Update\nSemiconductor machinery manufacturer Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) met Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q1 CY2025, with sales up 6.8% year on year to $7.1 billion. The company expects next quarter\u2019s revenue to be around $7.2 billion, coming in 0.5% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $2.39 per share was 3.4% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Q1 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $7.1 billion vs analyst estimates of $7.13 billion (6.8% year-on-year growth, in line)\n- Adjusted EPS: $2.39 vs analyst estimates of $2.31 (3.4% beat)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $2.18 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.12 billion (30.7% margin, 2.6% beat)\n- Revenue Guidance for Q2 CY2025 is $7.2 billion at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting\n- Adjusted EPS guidance for Q2 CY2025 is $2.35 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $2.31\n- Operating Margin: 30.5%, up from 28.8% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 14.9%, down from 17.1% in the same quarter last year\n- Inventory Days Outstanding: 142, up from 136 in the previous quarter\n- Market Capitalization: $141.5 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 1967 as the first company to develop tools for other businesses in the semiconductor industry, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is the largest provider of semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment.\nApplied Materials is one of the only semiconductor manufacturing (capital) equipment maker who provides tools used in each of the processes used to create semiconductors. Roughly half its systems\u2019 revenues come from deposition technologies, with another 30% from cleaning or removal systems.\nApplied Materials counts among its customers the biggest chip makers in the world: TSMC, Intel, Samsung, and Micron, although it tilts more towards foundry and logic chip makers than memory producers.\nIts primary peers and competitors are ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LCRX), KLA Corp (NASDAQ: KLAC), and Tokyo Electron (TSE:8035).\n4. Semiconductor Manufacturing\nThe semiconductor capital (manufacturing) equipment group has become highly concentrated over the past decade. Suppliers have consolidated, and the increasing cost of innovation have made it unaffordable to almost everybody, except the largest companies, to produce leading edge chips. The result of the increased industry concentration has been higher operating margins and free cash generation through the cycle. Despite this structural improvement, the businesses can still be quite volatile, as demand fluctuations for the semiconductor equipment are magnified by the already cyclical nature of underlying semiconductor demand.\n5. Sales Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, Applied Materials\u2019s 12.7% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was impressive. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Applied Materials\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed significantly as its annualized revenue growth of 2.7% over the last two years was well below its five-year trend.\nThis quarter, Applied Materials grew its revenue by 6.8% year on year, and its $7.1 billion of revenue was in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Beyond meeting estimates, this marks 5 straight quarters of growth, implying that Applied Materials is in the middle of its cycle - a typical upcycle generally lasts 8-10 quarters. Company management is currently guiding for a 6.2% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. Although this projection suggests its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\n6. Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory\nDays Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business\u2019 capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production.\nThis quarter, Applied Materials\u2019s DIO came in at 142, which is 3 more days than its five-year average, suggesting that the company\u2019s inventory levels have grown slightly above the long-term average.\n7. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nIn the semiconductor industry, a company\u2019s gross profit margin is a critical metric to track because it sheds light on its pricing power, complexity of products, and ability to procure raw materials, equipment, and labor.\nApplied Materials\u2019s unit economics are roughly in line with other semiconductor businesses, pointing to a lack of significant pricing pressure and the effectiveness of its products. As you can see below, it averaged a decent 47.7% gross margin over the last two years. That means for every $100 in revenue, roughly $47.67 was left to spend on selling, marketing, R&D, and general administrative overhead.\nApplied Materials produced a 49.1% gross profit margin in Q1, marking a 1.6 percentage point increase from 47.4% in the same quarter last year. On a wider time horizon, the company\u2019s full-year margin has remained steady over the past four quarters, suggesting its input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses) have been stable and it isn\u2019t under pressure to lower prices.\n8. Operating Margin\nApplied Materials has been a well-oiled machine over the last two years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a semiconductor business, boasting an average operating margin of 29.3%.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Applied Materials\u2019s operating margin rose by 3.2 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage.\nThis quarter, Applied Materials generated an operating profit margin of 30.5%, up 1.8 percentage points year on year. The increase was encouraging, and because its operating margin rose more than its gross margin, we can infer it was more efficient with expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead.\n9. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nApplied Materials\u2019s EPS grew at a remarkable 22% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 12.7% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nWe can take a deeper look into Applied Materials\u2019s earnings quality to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Applied Materials\u2019s operating margin expanded by 3.2 percentage points over the last five years. On top of that, its share count shrank by 12%. These are positive signs for shareholders because improving profitability and share buybacks turbocharge EPS growth relative to revenue growth.\nIn Q1, Applied Materials reported EPS at $2.39, up from $2.09 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 3.4%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Applied Materials\u2019s full-year EPS of $9.20 to grow 2.3%.\n10. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nApplied Materials has shown robust cash profitability, and if it can maintain this level of cash generation, will be in a fine position to ride out cyclical downturns while investing in plenty of new products and returning capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 23.2% over the last two years, quite impressive for a semiconductor business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Applied Materials\u2019s margin was unchanged over the last five years, showing its long-term free cash flow profile is stable.\nApplied Materials\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $1.06 billion in Q1, equivalent to a 14.9% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 2.1 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends trump fluctuations.\n11. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nApplied Materials\u2019s five-year average ROIC was 47.6%, placing it among the best semiconductor companies. This illustrates its management team\u2019s ability to invest in highly profitable ventures and produce tangible results for shareholders.\n12. Balance Sheet Assessment\nOne of the best ways to mitigate bankruptcy risk is to hold more cash than debt.\nApplied Materials is a profitable, well-capitalized company with $6.75 billion of cash and $6.26 billion of debt on its balance sheet. This $486 million net cash position gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n13. Key Takeaways from Applied Materials\u2019s Q1 Results\nIt was encouraging to see Applied Materials beat analysts\u2019 EPS and adjusted operating income estimates this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue was in line and its inventory levels slightly increased. Zooming out, we think this was a mixed quarter. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 3.3% to $168.85 immediately after reporting.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy Applied Materials?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 10:26 PM EDT\nWhen considering an investment in Applied Materials, investors should account for its valuation and business qualities as well as what\u2019s happened in the latest quarter.\nApplied Materials possesses a number of positive attributes. First off, its revenue growth was impressive over the last five years. On top of that, Applied Materials\u2019s stellar ROIC suggests it has been a well-run company historically, and its impressive operating margins show it has a highly efficient business model.\nApplied Materials\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 20x. When scanning the semiconductor space, Applied Materials trades at a fair valuation. If you believe in the company and its growth potential, now is an opportune time to buy shares.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $205.84 on the company (compared to the current share price of $188.93), implying they see 9% upside in buying Applied Materials in the short term."

This valuation is extremely expensive, especially for the weaker revenue growth you get.\nWe prefer to invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with superior earnings growth.\n3. IPG Photonics (IPGP) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nFiber laser manufacturer IPG Photonics (NASDAQ:IPGP) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, but sales fell by 2.7% year on year to $250.7 million. On the other hand, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance of $240 million was less impressive, coming in 0.8% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.30 per share was significantly above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nIPG Photonics (IPGP) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $250.7 million vs analyst estimates of $229.2 million (2.7% year-on-year decline, 9.4% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.30 vs analyst estimates of $0.14 (significant beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $31.55 million vs analyst estimates of $21.64 million (12.6% margin, 45.8% beat)\n- Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $240 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $241.9 million\n- Adjusted EPS guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $0.20 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $0.20\n- EBITDA guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $29 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $28.25 million\n- Operating Margin: 0%, down from 4.7% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was -$17.57 million, down from $29.24 million in the same quarter last year\n- Inventory Days Outstanding: 176, down from 190 in the previous quarter\n- Market Capitalization: $3.29 billion\nCompany Overview\nBoth a designer and manufacturer of its products, IPG Photonics (NASDAQ:IPGP) is a provider of high-performance fiber lasers used for cutting, welding, and processing raw materials.\nIPG Photonics was founded in 1990 by Valentin Gapontsev, a Russian physicist. Gapontsev pioneered a proprietary all-fiber technology platform for fiber lasers and amplifiers. IPG went public in 2007 and was included in the S&P 500 in 2018.\nA laser converts electrical energy to optical energy that can be focused and shaped, creating a concentrated beam that causes materials to melt, vaporize or otherwise change their character. In materials processing, lasers are gaining market share from traditional machine tools (e.g. saws, presses) because of the greater precision, processing speeds, and flexibility.\nSemiconductor manufacturers employ lasers for key steps such as lithography (3D relief images on the substrate) and annealing (heating wafers to change electrical properties). With regards to annealing, for example, IPG Photonics\u2019 lasers can create extremely localized heating with fine depth penetration control and precise positioning; this allows target structures to be heated without affecting other surrounding heat-sensitive materials. The company also offers complementary products used with IPG\u2019s lasers such as optical cables and beam switches to deliver and apply the lasers. Other than semiconductor applications, the most common uses for IPG\u2019s products are industrial cutting/welding, 3D printing, and marking/engraving.\nCompetitors offering laser products for materials processing include Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR), Laserline, Lumentum (NASDAQ:LITE), and Maxphotonics.\n4. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, IPG Photonics\u2019s demand was weak and its revenue declined by 4.3% per year. This was below our standards and is a sign of poor business quality. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. IPG Photonics\u2019s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 16.9% annually over the last two years.\nThis quarter, IPG Photonics\u2019s revenue fell by 2.7% year on year to $250.7 million but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 9.4%. Despite the beat, the drop in sales could mean that the current downcycle is deepening. Company management is currently guiding for a 2.9% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4% over the next 12 months. Although this projection indicates its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n5. Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory\nDays Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business\u2019 capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production.\nThis quarter, IPG Photonics\u2019s DIO came in at 176, which is 34 days below its five-year average. At the moment, these numbers show no indication of an excessive inventory buildup.\n6. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nIn the semiconductor industry, a company\u2019s gross profit margin is a critical metric to track because it sheds light on its pricing power, complexity of products, and ability to procure raw materials, equipment, and labor.\nIPG Photonics\u2019s gross margin is well below other semiconductor companies, indicating a lack of pricing power and a competitive market. As you can see below, it averaged a 37.4% gross margin over the last two years. Said differently, IPG Photonics had to pay a chunky $62.62 to its suppliers for every $100 in revenue.\nIn Q2, IPG Photonics produced a 37.3% gross profit margin, in line with the same quarter last year. On a wider time horizon, IPG Photonics\u2019s full-year margin has been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 5.1 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest deteriorating pricing power and higher input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses).\n7. Operating Margin\nAlthough IPG Photonics broke even this quarter from an operational perspective, it\u2019s generally struggled over a longer time period. Its expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 5.9% over the last two years. Unprofitable semiconductor companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It\u2019s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, IPG Photonics\u2019s operating margin decreased by 46.1 percentage points over the last five years. IPG Photonics\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nThis quarter, IPG Photonics\u2019s breakeven margin was down 4.6 percentage points year on year. Since IPG Photonics\u2019s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead increased.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nSadly for IPG Photonics, its EPS declined by 20.5% annually over the last five years, more than its revenue. This tells us the company struggled because its fixed cost base made it difficult to adjust to shrinking demand.\nWe can take a deeper look into IPG Photonics\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, IPG Photonics\u2019s operating margin declined by 46.1 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2, IPG Photonics reported adjusted EPS at $0.30, down from $0.49 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects IPG Photonics\u2019s full-year EPS of $1.08 to grow 12.3%.\n9. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nIPG Photonics has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 12.7%, subpar for a semiconductor business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that IPG Photonics\u2019s margin dropped by 11.6 percentage points over the last five years. This along with its unexciting margin put the company in a tough spot, and shareholders are likely hoping it can reverse course. If the trend continues, it could signal it\u2019s in the middle of a big investment cycle.\nIPG Photonics burned through $17.57 million of cash in Q2, equivalent to a negative 7% margin. The company\u2019s cash flow turned negative after being positive in the same quarter last year, suggesting its historical struggles have dragged on.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nIPG Photonics historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 5.2%, somewhat low compared to the best semiconductor companies that consistently pump out 35%+.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nBusinesses that maintain a cash surplus face reduced bankruptcy risk.\nIPG Photonics is a well-capitalized company with $899.6 million of cash and no debt. This position is 27.3% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from IPG Photonics\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly IPG Photonics blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its adjusted operating income outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter slightly missed, although the market seems to be willing to overlook this. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 9% to $84.55 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy IPG Photonics?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 10:25 PM EDT\nA common mistake we notice when investors are deciding whether to buy a stock or not is that they simply look at the latest earnings results. Business quality and valuation matter more, so we urge you to understand these dynamics as well.\nWe cheer for all companies solving complex technology issues, but in the case of IPG Photonics, we\u2019ll be cheering from the sidelines. To begin with, its revenue has declined over the last five years. On top of that, IPG Photonics\u2019s declining EPS over the last five years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets, and its declining operating margin shows the business has become less efficient.\nIPG Photonics\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 64.5x. At this valuation, there\u2019s a lot of good news priced in - you can find more timely opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $80.20 on the company (compared to the current share price of $73.50)."
