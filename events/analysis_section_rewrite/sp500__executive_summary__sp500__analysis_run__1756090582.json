      "feedback": "The draft has strong regime framing but it meanders across topics and fails to deliver a tight, executive 4–6 sentence/bullet house view with clear catalysts, risks, and watch-items; tighten the causal chain from regime shifts to pricing, and prune extraneous macro digressions so the para-structure reads as decision-ready. Actionable edits: collapse into 4–6 concise bullets that (1) state a single base-case house view anchored to a clean three-regime map (Regimes A/B/C) and show how real policy-rate differentials, BoP/terms of trade, productivity, and policy reaction functions drive ROIC vs WACC as incremental AUM flows into durable fee income (cite PA57YBYVQ for overseas AUM scales and keep MUFG outside-Japan ~$164B and Mizuho AM One ~$489B as the sole anchor with a single total ≈$1.3T); (2) replace scattered Ford/auto-cycle anecdotes with one line tied to regime risk and provide explicit numbers cited (Ford up ~17% in 2025; EV losses ~$1.3B; F-Series leadership; forward P/E near 10) using W2622L6WW and 22PL3Q360; (3) condense Netflix into a 2–3 sentence base-case with 3–4 metrics (3–6M revenue growth: high single to mid-teens; FCF guide $8.0–$8.5B; P/E ~51.7x) anchored to 61SVFUKBY/A88B7V8PY; (4) compress Hutchmed to 3 catalysts (SANOVO enrollment, SACHI PFS signal, ASCO readouts) plus one governance/leadership invalidation signal (RAV2UWRTT; Y4QWID79M); (5) fix crypto/macroe path to use only IDs OGK8WLL69, JPAIHPA4N, SGB2PAZGK, Y6SQOEK69 and drop speculative target prices unless tied to a trigger; (6) present a precise 4–6 item watch-list mapped to macro-finance channels with explicit readthroughs and invalidations; (7) ensure every assertion cites an ID (eliminate placeholders like (15)(9)) and reconcile any conflicts by selecting a single, source-backed value and noting the alternative. The write should be strictly executive, with tightened prose, no repetition, and a single, coherent ROIC/fee-income thesis built from the cited sources (PA57YBYVQ; W2622L6WW; 22PL3Q360; OGK8WLL69; JPAIHPA4N; SGB2PAZGK; J99EM2TPZ; T1QE6JPIX; Y6SQOEK69; 4LDHF4T77; 4VN4UTWX1; Z5IA1CYUF; RAV2UWRTT; Y4QWID79M; 61SVFUKBY; A88B7V8PY).",
