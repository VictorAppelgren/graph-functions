  "content": "With help from Eli Okun, Bethany Irvine and Ali Bianco\n\nGood morning. This is Ankush Khardori. Get in touch.\n\n\n\nEPSTEIN, AGAIN: The coming weeks may prove to be crucial ones for President Donald Trump and his allies if they hope to bring the controversy surrounding the release of the so-called Epstein files to something approximating a close.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six weeks since the release of the brief and unsigned joint Justice Department-FBI memo that kicked things off in earnest by reporting that the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had indeed taken his own life and that there was no \u201cclient list\u201d to disclose \u2014 despite the various assurances and promises of transparency made over the years by Trump, VP JD Vance, AG Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, among others.\n\nSince then, the White House and Republican allies in Congress have engaged in scattered \u2014 you might even say flailing \u2014 efforts to tamp things down. As of Friday, the House Oversight Committee now has the first tranche of the DOJ\u2019s rolling production of documents in response to a subpoena, so you can safely expect more activity on this front \u2014 and lots more chatter \u2014 once members return to Washington next week after the end of August recess.\n\nAs a result, we thought now would be a good time to take a step back and see where things otherwise stand on the government\u2019s Epstein-related investigative forays.\n\nTo start, let\u2019s level set with the most important question: What could the public usefully learn at this point?\n\nYou can break that down into two subsidiary questions based on public polling, media coverage and our admittedly subjective assessment of the political-legal zeitgeist.\n\n1. What was done to prepare the DOJ-FBI memo? Or, to be more precise, what did the DOJ and FBI actually do in recent months to review the Epstein investigation, and what did they learn about the broader conspiracies alleged by skeptics? According to polling released last month, more than two-thirds of the country believes that the Trump administration is hiding information about Epstein.\n\n2. What references to Trump are reportedly in the investigative files? Roughly half of the country apparently now believes that Trump was involved in crimes that were committed by Epstein.\n\nThus far, the Trump DOJ has failed to answer these in any meaningful way.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s effort to secure the release of grand jury transcripts was a comprehensive flop. There was never much reason to expect to learn anything from them, but as of last week, the administration has now lost in all three of the relevant courts. Two of the judges were particularly sharp in their brushbacks \u2014 writing in their opinions that the DOJ had effectively misled the public by suggesting that they would learn anything new from the material, and that the motions were political diversionary tactics.\n\n\n\nThe Trump DOJ\u2019s release on Friday of the audio and transcript of the Ghislaine Maxwell interview conducted by Deputy AG Todd Blanche was also effectively meaningless.\n\nThe decision to interview Maxwell in the first place was \u2014 at least as an investigative and prosecutorial matter \u2014 a baffling one. For reasons too numerous to recount, no serious prosecutor would take her at her word on anything related to her misconduct, Epstein\u2019s misconduct or, frankly, pretty much anything.\n\nIronically, the department\u2019s release of the Maxwell interview itself ought to put to rest the notion that she is credible in any form. That is because Maxwell told the DOJ that she was unaware of any criminal misconduct and that she never witnessed any misconduct by any men who visited or traveled with Epstein.\n\nAs a practical matter, that would mean one of two things.\n\nThe first possibility is that Maxwell was indeed innocent all along \u2014 that the first Trump DOJ falsely accused Maxwell when they charged her, that she was wrongfully convicted at trial by a unanimous jury, that most if not all of the overwhelming evidence against Maxwell at the trial was false or fabricated and, in addition, that for some reason she did not testify in her own defense despite watching all of this false evidence come in.\n\nThe second possibility is that she is a serial liar who committed terrible crimes and whose self-serving interview with Blanche should be dismissed out of hand \u2014 whether it helps or hurts Trump or anyone else. (If you need a refresher on what the evidence at trial revealed about the type of person that Maxwell is, we suggest pages 5-14 of the DOJ\u2019s post-trial sentencing submission.)\n\nWe\u2019re going with Occam\u2019s razor on this one.\n\nMeanwhile, House Oversight Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) has just begun a series of depositions on the Epstein matter. Former AG Bill Barr appeared last week, and the remainder of the schedule includes former AGs Alberto Gonzales, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder and Merrick Garland, among others.\n\nNone of these people would seem to have much useful information to offer. In fact, to answer the most pressing Epstein-related questions, the people you would want to speak with would probably include \u2014 in no particular order \u2014 Trump himself, Bondi, Patel, Blanche, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and Alex Acosta, who negotiated the sweetheart 2007 plea deal with Epstein while serving as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida.\n\nYou might even call these bizarro investigations. They do not appear to be asking the right questions or talking to the right people to address the things that the average American might actually want to know.\n\nWill the Trump DOJ\u2019s document production be better? That remains to be seen, but a very healthy dose of skepticism is in order. Among other things, the DOJ gets to pick which documents it produces and when it produces them. Yesterday, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said that the overwhelming majority of the 30,000+ pages produced by DOJ on Friday was material that was already public.\n\nIf you put it all together, an unfortunate verdict emerges: The public has learned pretty much nothing new from the government about the Epstein investigation since this controversy kicked off.\n\nWhat they have learned, perhaps, is that the Trump White House, the Trump DOJ and House Republicans have provided the appearance of investigative activity and of forward momentum \u2014 but that that appearance is, in fact, an illusion.\n\u2022 \u201cJustice Department gave Ghislaine Maxwell \u2018a platform to rewrite history,\u2019 family of Epstein abuse victim says,\u201d by NBC\u2019s Nnamdi Egwuonwu and colleagues\n\u2022 \u201cGhislaine Maxwell was honored at a prestigious Clinton event years after sexual misconduct allegations surfaced,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski\n\n\u2014 Vance on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is stringing Trump along, on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d: \u201cNo, not at all \u2026 I think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in three and a half years \u2026 What they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. \u2026 And importantly, they\u2019ve acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) on Trump\u2019s handling of the war, on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cThe president gave impetus to the process, but nothing has resulted from these meetings. Putin remains obstinate, refusing to consider anything other than the surrender of Ukrainian territory, which I think would be a prelude just to a future attack. The Ukrainians will fight on. There was a lot of discussion. I think there was a lot of camaraderie, which is good. But there [were] no concrete proposals nor peace process put in place.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) on the investigations of John Bolton and other perceived political enemies of Trump, including Schiff himself, on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d: \u201cThis is clearly retribution. \u2026 What the president is trying to do here is very systemic and systematic, and that is anyone who stands up to the president \u2014 anyone who criticizes the president, anyone who says anything adverse [to] the president\u2019s interests \u2014 gets the full weight of the federal government brought down on them. \u2026 There\u2019s no there there [for me], but the common denominator is they will manufacture anything to go after their critics \u2026 It\u2019s free reign with a corrupt leadership at the Justice Department.\u201d\n\n\u2014 House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on what Democrats will do in New York and elsewhere to fight the GOP\u2019s unprecedented power grab of mid-cycle partisan gerrymandering, on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d: \u201cWe will continue to respond when necessary across the country. Right now this has happened in Texas \u2014 California has responded. Let\u2019s see what comes next.\u201d Dana Bash: \u201cSo is there not a plan yet in New York? Is that what I\u2019m hearing?\u201d Jeffries: \u201cThere\u2019s a plan to respond as appropriately in New York and in other parts of the country as the circumstances dictate.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cA Letter to America\u2019s Discarded Public Servants,\u201d by William Burns in The Atlantic\n\u2022 \u201cWould You Trust This Man With Your Elections?\u201d by Richard Hasen in the NYT\n\u2022 \u201cA Tale of Two Jurists in the Trump Era,\u201d by The New Yorker\u2019s Jonathan Blitzer\n\u2022 \u201cHe Was the Face and Voice of Gaza. Israel Assassinated Him,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Lydia Polgreen\n\u2022 \u201cWho Is a \u2018Journalist\u2019 in Gaza?\u201d by James Kirchick in the WSJ\n\u2022 \u201cThe 1988 Trap: Democrats Are in Danger of Repeating a Painful Lesson,\u201d by The Messina Memo\u2019s Jim Messina\n\u2022 \u201cMy gut instinct on Trump\u2019s D.C. power grab was wrong,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Shadi Hamid\n\u2022 \u201cWhat Is Trump Hiding in His Secret Budget?\u201d by Thomas Kahn in the NYT\n\u2022 \u201cThe Trump Family Cashes In on \u2018the Infinite Money Glitch,\u2019\u201d by WSJ\u2019s James Mackintosh\n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018MAHA Box\u2019 Might Be Coming to Your Doorstep,\u201d by The Atlantic\u2019s Nicholas Florko\n\u2022 \u201cI\u2019m a Red-State Mayor. Diversity Is Not Reverse Bigotry,\u201d by Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt in the NYT\n\u2022 \u201cHere\u2019s What Happened When I Made My College Students Put Away Their Phones,\u201d by Ezekiel Emanuel in the NYT\n\n1. UP NEXT: After L.A. and D.C., Chicago could be the next unwilling American city where Trump sends in the troops, WaPo\u2019s Dan Lamothe scooped. Weeks of planning at the Pentagon have given Trump the option to deploy the National Guard \u2014 or active-duty troops, though that\u2019s \u201cconsidered less likely\u201d \u2014 along with expanded ICE enforcement in a broad operation against undocumented immigrants, criminals and homeless people. City and state leaders reacted sharply to the reporting, saying such a move by Trump would be unnecessary. This morning, Trump threatened to do the same in Baltimore \u2014 or to pull federal funding to rebuild the Key Bridge.\n\nThe impact: CNN\u2019s Casey Tolan and Holmes Lybrand dug into the data from the first week of the federal takeover in D.C. They found there was a 17 percent drop in violent crime, according to Metropolitan Police Department numbers. (Trump went much further on Truth Social, falsely saying \u201cthere is NO CRIME\u201d anymore.) And the number of immigration arrests has spiked tenfold.\n\nThe problem: NBC\u2019s Rich Schapiro dives into the crisis of carjackings in the D.C. area, which remain elevated above pre-pandemic numbers despite falling significantly in recent years. Many of the young people arrested for the violent crime got released within a day or two.\n\n2. ELBRIDGE COLBY STRIKES AGAIN: Without announcing it, the Defense Department has prevented Ukraine from firing long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems to hit within Russia since the spring, WSJ\u2019s Alex Ward and colleagues scooped. The review process created by Colby gives the U.S. a veto over Ukraine conducting such strikes with the American-made weapons and effectively undoes a Joe Biden green light; the Pentagon has rejected Kyiv\u2019s request at least once.\n\nThe step back: NYT\u2019s Aaron Krolik investigated why U.S. sanctions against Russian trade haven\u2019t been as effective at slowing its war on Ukraine. \u201cOne reason could be that the financial institutions necessary to facilitate that trade are not being found and punished.\u201d\n\n3. TRADING PLACES: DHL and other major shipping providers across Europe announced yesterday that they\u2019d halt many package deliveries to the U.S. immediately or in the next few days, per AP\u2019s Demetris Nellas and Mae Anderson. The reason is the U.S. crackdown on the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption from tariffs for many low-value shipments, which expired Friday. Many postal services said they needed more clarity on the policy.\n\n4. IMMIGRATION FILES: \u201cKilmar Abrego Garcia says Trump administration using threatened deportation to Uganda to coerce guilty plea,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Ben Johansen and Kyle Cheney: \u201cAttorneys for Abrego said in a Saturday court filing the Justice Department is pressuring him to accept a guilty plea to two felony [human smuggling charges that he denies], promising to deport him to Costa Rica \u2014 where he would be free from incarceration \u2014 after the completion of any criminal sentence. \u2026 But after Abrego resisted that proposal, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials told his lawyers that they had decided instead to deport him to Uganda.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. FROM 30,000 FEET: \u201cIn Trump\u2019s Second Term, Far-Right Agenda Enters the Mainstream,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Alan Feuer: \u201cWhether it is dismantling diversity programs, complaining about anti-white bias in museums or simply promoting an aura of authoritarian nationalism, Mr. Trump has embraced an array of far-right views and talking points \u2026 Far-right figures have been particularly thrilled by Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants, praising not only the ubiquitous images of masked federal agents raiding farms and factories, but also the ideology that has fueled those moves: a belief that migration to the United States is all but synonymous with a military invasion.\u201d\n\n6. 2028 WATCH: As the DNC begins its summer meeting tomorrow, POLITICO\u2019s Jonathan Martin reports that another cycle of squabbling over Democrats\u2019 presidential primary calendar may end with New Hampshire (though not Iowa) returning to the front of the line. Some Dems think the likeliest outcome is New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada and a Midwestern state \u2014 perhaps Michigan \u2014 taking the first four slots in 2028. New Hampshire\u2019s return seems especially likely because the DNC gave up its leverage when it didn\u2019t punish the state for going rogue in 2024.\n\n7. BLEEDING CUTS, PART I: \u201cSouth Africa\u2019s most vulnerable struggle to find HIV medication after US aid cuts,\u201d by Louise Dewast for the AP in Johannesburg: Sex workers and transgender people \u201cdescribed a new world of difficulty in obtaining HIV medication or the preventive medicine for people at risk of HIV. \u2026 A major challenge for those who lost access to the U.S.-funded nonprofit clinics is finding help elsewhere, including public hospitals. \u2026 The withdrawal from regular health care by sex workers and others means that many are no longer being tested and don\u2019t know what level of the virus they have in body fluids \u2014 and whether they can pass it on to others.\u201d\n\n8. BLEEDING CUTS, PART II: \u201cThis conservative county lost teachers after administration cut key grant,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Ben Brasch in Montgomery County, North Carolina: \u201cSchool district officials said they believe their grant was rescinded because they agreed when they applied in 2023 to adhere to the Biden administration\u2019s expectation that they would recruit a diverse workforce. The 3,500-student school system started the fall semester last week with 10 fewer teachers, according to a district official, and fewer resources to attract new ones. For students, that means larger class sizes with more inexperienced teachers and fewer after-school offerings.\u201d\n\n9. THE 180: A sweeping new piece by NYT\u2019s Dan Barry and Alan Feuer lays out how the Trump administration\u2019s about-face on Jan. 6 \u2014 pardoning criminals at the Capitol insurrection and purging the law enforcement officers who prosecuted them \u2014 has provided a template for a politicized transformation of the Justice Department. \u201cNow, to remedy what the president has deemed the past weaponization of Justice, it has been deployed as a weapon for his score-settling and political crusades.\u201d\n\n\n\nAntony Blinken had to leave a beach in the Hamptons that was closed due to Hurricane Erin.\n\nOUT AND ABOUT \u2014 Kathy \u201cCoach\u201d Kemper and the Institute for Education hosted a #techplomacy happy hour yesterday afternoon on the Great Lawn at Congressional Country Club.

  "summary": "The controversy surrounding the release of the Epstein files has escalated again, with President Donald Trump and his allies facing crucial efforts to resolve the issue. The initial joint Justice Department-FBI memo revealed that late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had taken his own life and there was no \"client list\" to disclose. Despite promises of transparency by the White House and Republican allies in Congress, efforts have been unsuccessful. The House Oversight Committee has now seen the first tranche of the DOJ's rolling production of documents in response to a subpoena. The decision to interview Ghislaine Maxwell in the first place was a baffling one, suggesting that she was unaware of criminal misconduct and that she never witnessed any misconduct by any men who visited or traveled with Epstein. The administration's efforts to release grand jury transcripts were unsuccessful, with judges' opinions suggesting that the DOJ misled public about their findings.",
  "shortSummary": "The upcoming weeks will prove crucial for President Donald Trump's efforts to transparency in the Epstein scandal, despite multiple DOJ releases and unsubstantiated claims.",

      "text": "It was just after 8 p.m. when Michael Waller pulled up to his home on a well-to-do block near Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Waller, then 59, glanced at his phone to check his email. Within seconds, two men appeared on either side of his gray Mercedes waving Glock handguns.\nThe man on the passenger side opened the door and slammed his gun into Waller\u2019s right ear and scalp, knocking him out for a moment. When he came to, he was still strapped into his seat belt, blood flowing down the side of his head.\nThe gunmen ordered him out of the car and commanded him to throw his phone into the bushes. As they began to drive away, one pointed his gun at Waller and threatened to kill him on the spot \u2014 prompting Waller, battered and bloodied, to duck into an alley.\n\u201cThese guys knew what they were doing, and they were so smooth about it,\u201d said Waller, a defense and foreign policy strategist at the Center for Security Policy, a conservative think tank. \u201cThey seemed like real professionals.\u201d\nThe carjacking in August 2021 made no headlines. It was part of a crime wave that shook the city during the pandemic. Four years later, the capital is teeming with National Guard troops and federal officers called in by President Donald Trump, who also took over the Metropolitan Police Department after highlighting the recent attempted carjacking of an administration staffer.\nThe takeover has sparked a fierce debate over the state of crime in D.C. What\u2019s beyond dispute is that carjackings exploded in Washington and several other major cities in the U.S. after 2019.\nIt\u2019s a particularly brutal crime, experts say, one that often causes lasting psychological damage. And while most types of crime that surged during the pandemic have since dropped off, carjackings are one of the few that have remained well above pre-pandemic levels in certain big cities like D.C., police data shows.\n\u201cIt became the crime of the pandemic,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a D.C.-based organization of current and former law enforcement officials focused on improving policing. \u201cAnd the reason you still have it is because juveniles learned how to do it. That presents a lot of challenges for the justice system.\u201d\nThe soaring number of young people who have engaged in carjacking is indeed one of the key factors that has driven the surge in the Washington area and beyond, according to interviews with more than a half-dozen police officials, criminologists and youth advocates.\nSome of these perpetrators stole vehicles to use them to commit more crimes. Many others commit carjackings simply for the thrill of it, or to earn respect and attention on social media, according to police investigators and advocates who have spoken to the young offenders.\nMany of those who were arrested in or around Washington were out of police custody in a day or two, the investigators and advocates said. In Waller\u2019s case, court records show that the men who were later arrested for being in the stolen car were not prosecuted at all \u2014 an outcome that those familiar with the system in D.C. said was not uncommon.\nOver the last 18 months, the carjacking numbers have fallen in the D.C. area. Sgt. Josh Scall, a supervisor in the carjacking unit in neighboring Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, said he\u2019s proud of the numerous arrests his unit has made in recent years, and the impact that\u2019s having on the crime rate. But even one carjacking is one more than he wants to see in his county.\n\u201cPeople look at these numbers and they don\u2019t take a minute to realize, numbers are people,\u201d Scall said. \u201cThese are people who were violently removed from their vehicle and are going to be psychologically changed for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\u201cWe can parade that we\u2019re not at 573,\u201d Scall added, referring to the record number of carjackings recorded in Prince George\u2019s in 2023. \u201cBut it\u2019s still unacceptable in our books.\u201d\n'Spiraled out of control'\nPeter Newsham was entering his fourth year as the chief of Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department when Covid began to sweep across the country. Crime skyrocketed in D.C. and other major cities spurred by a perfect storm of factors, including school closures, mass layoffs and social unrest following the death of George Floyd.\n\u201cI had never seen anything like it in my time in Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Newsham, who joined the force in 1989.\nCarjacking was among the crimes that rose the highest and the fastest. Newsham\u2019s department was dealing with a staffing crisis, low morale and new legislation that reduced penalties for young offenders.\nEven when investigators were successful in tracking down suspects, Newsham said, they were often right back on the street in a matter of days. That was especially true for those under the age of 18, who amounted to 65% of the 243 arrests the department made for carjacking in 2020 and 2021, according to police data.\n\u201cThese young people knew they could get away with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was very little consequence, and it spiraled out of control.\u201d\nRoughly 150 carjackings took place in the district in 2019. In 2020 that number more than doubled to 360, according to police data.\nNewsham left the department in January 2021 to become chief of police in Prince William County, Virginia. That year, the number of carjackings in D.C. rose to 424. It went even higher \u2014 to 484 \u2014 in 2022.\nBut the next year was when the situation got really out of hand. A total of 957 carjackings \u2014 nearly three a day \u2014 were reported in D.C. in 2023, according to police data.\nLt. Scott Dowling, who leads the more than two dozen detectives in the Metropolitan Police Department carjacking task force, said a relatively small group of offenders helped drive the explosion in cases.\n\u201cThe same people were committing multiple, multiple, multiple offenses,\u201d Dowling said. In one case in 2023, a search warrant led to the arrest of three people suspected of carrying out roughly 50 carjackings and thefts, according to Dowling.\nThe carjacking trajectory in D.C. during the pandemic mirrored that of other major U.S. cities.\nPhiladelphia went from 224 carjackings in 2019 to 409 in 2020. The numbers kept rising over the next two years \u2014 to 866 in 2021 and 1,311 in 2022.\nIn Chicago, carjackings rose from 603 in 2019 to 1,852 in 2021. The city experienced a slight dip in 2022, recording 1,649.\nThe numbers began to drop sharply in those cities and many others in 2023. Not so in D.C. or one of its closest neighbors \u2014 Prince George\u2019s County.\nSituated along Washington\u2019s eastern border, the sprawling, 900,000-person county is more residential than the nation\u2019s capital. It's home to the National Harbor and the main campus of the University of Maryland but also has pockets of low-income areas with high crime.\nSgt. Scall, the carjacking unit supervisor, said the volume of cases was so extreme in 2023 that he would go to bed with his phone in his hand.\n\u201cWe had some really bad incidents happen where we were surveilling for cars and we were shot at,\u201d Scall said. \u201cThat happened three times. It was pure insanity.\u201d\nScall said the stolen cars were rarely going to chop shops, where the perpetrators could make quick cash. It was far more common for people to steal cars for the thrill of it, to get recognition online or to use them to commit other crimes, he said.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just young people from poorer neighborhoods behind the crimes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no quintessential carjacker,\u201d Scall said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done search warrants at million-dollar houses. It really crossed over financial lines.\u201d\nThe number of carjackings in Prince George\u2019s County dropped to 368 in 2024, down nearly 40% from 2023. So far this year, there have been 113, which is roughly 50% fewer than the 250 recorded at this point in 2024.\nScall attributes the drop to his unit\u2019s increased prowess in busting the carjackers.\n\u201cIf you do a carjacking in Prince George\u2019s County, we\u2019re usually closing it in a day or two,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve sharpened our skills. We know what to do. We know where to look.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not lost on Scall that the numbers this year are still trending far higher than the 93 recorded in 2019. He said policy shifts have helped keep repeat offenders off the street for longer than before, but he thinks the juvenile justice system is \u201cstill playing catch up.\u201d\n\u201cIf they are a juvenile, I don\u2019t expect them to go to jail for 20 years,\u201d Scall said. \u201cBut I think if you violently rob someone you should probably sit out for a little bit.\u201d\nIn D.C., 183 carjackings were recorded through July of this year. That\u2019s about 40% fewer than the same period in 2024. But it\u2019s already higher than the 152 incidents in all of 2019.\nThe case that got Trump\u2019s attention \u2014 the attempted carjacking of Edward Coristine, 19, better known by his online nickname \u201cBig Balls \u2014 took place in the early morning hours of Aug. 3. According to the police report, officers on patrol spotted about 10 \"juveniles\" assaulting Coristine, who worked under Elon Musk at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, before moving to the Social Security Administration. The officers managed to arrest two suspects \u2014 a boy and a girl, both 15.\nDowling said he believes new tracking software in cars, as well as new laws that raised penalties for gun crimes and thefts, helped to bring down the incidents of carjacking. But old-fashioned police work also played a significant role, he said.\n\u201cMy detectives are phenomenal,\u201d Dowling said. \u201cI often say that I don\u2019t get impressed very easily, but they impress me.\u201d\nHelping teens\nJawanna Hardy, the founder of the nonprofit Guns Down Friday, has devoted her adult life to helping victims of crime and young people caught up in the criminal justice system in the D.C. area. That gave her an intimate glimpse into the factors driving the carjacking crisis.\nAs the pandemic took hold, children suddenly lost the structure that school brought. Many in lower income areas experienced losses far dearer to them, Hardy said.\n\u201cA lot of my kids lost their grandparents, their strongest support system, during Covid,\u201d said Hardy.\nVideo clips glorifying car thefts caught fire on social media. Hardy noticed that young people in different cities were boasting about their exploits.\n\u201cEverybody had a name. They had a song,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cI could understand why the children were into it. It was exciting.\u201d\nAs the months went on, Hardy also noticed that the youths who were being brought to her for mentorship after getting caught up in the justice system were younger than she was used to seeing.\n\u201cFor some reason, the 15-year-olds were tearing the city up,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d say 75% of the kids I was working with were 15 when they started committing these crimes.\u201d\nWhen NBC News first reached out to Hardy last week, she was with a 15-year-old who had recently been arrested for stealing cars. He was one of the so-called Kia Boys, who had been using basic tools to break into the vehicles and start them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what made me decide to do it,\u201d the teen said. \u201cThere was just a freedom. You\u2019re not supposed to be inside a vehicle, but it\u2019s moving fast at your feet. I enjoyed feeling that rush.\u201d\nAccounts like that sparked a light bulb moment for Hardy.\n\u201cI realized we were addressing the violent piece, but we weren\u2019t addressing the need to want to drive,\u201d she said.\nSo for young people who were at least 16, she began to help them navigate how to get a learner\u2019s permit. It was clear they wanted to drive. Why not help them do it legally?\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get kids into the mindset of, \u2018I can get a license. I can get a car. I can do this the right way.\u2019\u201d\n\u2018Why have laws?\u2019\nA day after Waller\u2019s Mercedes was stolen, Prince George\u2019s County officers spotted it at a busy intersection 6 miles from his home. When they tried to pull the car over, the driver sped off, according to a police spokesperson. The Mercedes crossed into D.C. but crashed into another vehicle on a highway there.\nD.C. police arrested the four occupants, one of whom had a handgun with an extended magazine, according to a police report on the incident. Investigators also recovered pills with labels indicating they were oxycodone, according to the report.\nThe suspects included two brothers, Davon Alston, 18, and Juvan Alston, 19. The two other suspects were 18 and 21. The four were booked on a range of charges, including carrying a pistol without a license, unauthorized use of a vehicle, fleeing a law enforcement officer and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, the police report says. (It does not make clear who was hit with the gun charge.)\nFor reasons unknown, federal prosecutors declined to bring charges, according to court records obtained by NBC News. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia did not respond to a request for comment.\nWaller, for his part, knew that his car had been recovered and that some suspects had been arrested. A detective had asked him to participate in a virtual line-up, but Waller said it took him too long to identify the one gunman he got a decent look at, the one who had pistol-whipped him.\nWaller said he never heard back from the police or prosecutors. When NBC News informed him this week that the men in the car weren\u2019t charged, Waller noted that he had no way of knowing whether the four were involved in the carjacking.\nEven still, he was aghast.\n\u201cThey\u2019re literally letting criminals in a stolen car, who are escaping police, back on the streets,\u201d Waller said. \u201cThen why have laws?\u201d\nEleven months after the carjacking, a 17-year-old was shot dead outside a home in Southeast D.C. Two teenagers were arrested and charged with murder: the Alston brothers.\nThey have pleaded not guilty and their trials are slated for next year.\nPolice charging documents say a video posted to Instagram 30 minutes after the fatal shooting showed Davon Alston and a second person riding in a Mercedes that was believed to have been used in the shooting.\nAccording to the documents, it had been carjacked about an hour earlier."

      "text": "Last month, James Boasberg, a seasoned federal judge, and Emil Bove III, a Justice Department lawyer, became foils in a parable about the rule of law during Donald Trump\u2019s second term. On July 28th, the Department of Justice announced a misconduct complaint against Boasberg, whom it accused of harboring a personal bias against the President. The next day, Bove, whom Trump had nominated to a judgeship on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, was confirmed by Republicans in the Senate. Boasberg had \u201cundermined the integrity of the judiciary, and we will not stand for that,\u201d Pam Bondi, Trump\u2019s Attorney General, wrote on X. By contrast, Bove, she said, \u201cwill be an outstanding judge.\u201d\nBeyond the fact that they\u2019re both former prosecutors, and bald, the two men would appear to have very little in common. Boasberg, who is in his early sixties, was appointed to judgeships by George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The Senate confirmed him to his current post by a vote of ninety-six to zero. In 2014, John Roberts, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, named Boasberg to a seven-year term on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, giving him high-level security clearance. \u201cYou knew when you went into court with him, that he was going to follow the rules,\u201d a former Justice Department lawyer told CNN. \u201cHe was very predictable, because he followed the law.\u201d\nBove, who is forty-four, worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York from 2012 to 2021, but his principal credential came two years later: after Donald Trump faced thirty-four counts of falsifying business records in Manhattan, Bove joined his criminal-defense team. (Trump was convicted on all counts and has appealed the result.) When Trump re\u00ebntered the White House, Bove was rewarded with a top job at the Justice Department, where he immediately distinguished himself as an enforcer. This past winter, when three prosecutors in the Southern District of New York resigned over the Administration\u2019s ultimately successful push to dismiss a corruption case against Mayor Eric Adams, Bove was at the center of the controversy. The Justice Department had ordered prosecutors to drop the charges, evidently so that Adams would be able to enforce the Administration\u2019s immigration policies. According to one of the prosecutors, Bove chastised them for taking notes at a key meeting, at the end of which he \u201cdirected the collection of those notes.\u201d (Bove denies any quid-pro-quo deal, claiming that he ended Adams\u2019s prosecution because it was politically motivated\u2014Adams maintains that he engaged in no wrongdoing\u2014and that he restricted note-taking to prevent leaks.)\nThe high contrast in which Boasberg and Bove currently stand is the direct result of a case that, by an accident of timing and circumstance, bound their political fates together. On Friday, March 14th, Trump signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to authorize the removal, in secret, of more than two hundred Venezuelan men to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. As a matter of federal policy, this was a radical move. With shoddy evidence, none of which the men were allowed to contest, the government accused them of belonging to a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua. Based on what Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials had reportedly told them during their detention, the men thought that they were being deported to Venezuela. The majority of them hadn\u2019t committed any crimes, and some actually had legal status in the U.S. Among those who didn\u2019t, many had pending cases before immigration judges.\nShortly before Trump signed the proclamation, a group of D.O.J. lawyers met to discuss what would happen if a judge issued an order to halt the removals. One of them was Bove. Another was Erez Reuveni, a veteran government litigator freshly promoted to the job of acting deputy director of the Office of Immigration Litigation. According to Reuveni, who later filed a whistle-blower complaint, Bove told the lawyers that, once Trump signed the proclamation, one or more airplanes would set off for El Salvador that weekend \u201cno matter what,\u201d and he went on to say that if a judge tried to enjoin the flights, the department would \u201cneed to consider telling the courts \u2018fuck you.\u2019 \u201d (Bove denies this.)\nWithin hours of the proclamation, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of five Venezuelan men in federal immigration custody, to block removal flights conducted under the Alien Enemies Act. On the morning of March 15th, at around eight, Boasberg learned that he\u2019d been assigned the case at random. When he first \u201creached out to locate Government counsel,\u201d Boasberg wrote, in a subsequent opinion, he didn\u2019t receive a response. In the meantime, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers reported that at least one of their clients was sitting in an airplane that could take off at any moment. Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order, just before 10 A.M. He said he had to \u201cfreeze in place the status quo until a hearing could be held.\u201d\nThe hearing began at five o\u2019clock that evening, a little more than an hour after Trump\u2019s proclamation was posted publicly. The government\u2019s lawyers were adamant that Boasberg should not certify a broader class\u2014beyond the five plaintiffs\u2014for protection against removal under the Alien Enemies Act. When Boasberg asked whether any flights might leave \u201cin the next twenty-four or forty-eight hours,\u201d Drew Ensign, the government lawyer, replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that question.\u201d According to Reuveni, however, Ensign had attended the meeting the previous day at which Bove had said that removal flights would be departing over the weekend.\nEventually, Boasberg called a forty-minute adjournment and instructed Ensign to get more information from the Department of Homeland Security. During that time, two planes, each carrying about eighty detainees, left Texas for Honduras. They were in transit when the hearing reconvened, but Ensign said that he had learned nothing further. At around six-forty-five, Boasberg issued a verbal order blocking the government from removing anyone under the auspices of the Alien Enemies Act. \u201cThis is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately,\u201d he said.\nReuveni had been listening to the live feed of the hearing. He immediately sent several e-mails to officials at the Departments of Homeland Security and State laying out, explicitly, what Boasberg had said. \u201cSorry for all the emails,\u201d he wrote in one, at 6:48 P.M. \u201cThe judge specifically ordered us not to remove anyone in the class, and to return anyone in the air.\u201d Reuveni was ignored, as was Boasberg. At 7:36 P.M., a third plane left Texas for Honduras. Between eleven-thirty-nine and twelve-thirty-nine that night, all three flights then flew from Honduras to El Salvador, carrying more than two-hundred Venezuelans, a group of Salvadorans, and one Nicaraguan.\nOn March 28th, the Trump Administration filed an emergency application to the Supreme Court, asking it to lift Boasberg\u2019s injunction. Ten days later, by a vote of 5\u20134, the Justices ruled that the plaintiffs in the case, known as J.G.G. v. Trump, had chosen both the wrong venue and the wrong principle on which to file suit. Rather than claim a breach in administrative procedure before a district court in Washington, as the plaintiffs had done, the Court found that they should have filed petitions for habeas corpus in Texas, where the men were held prior to their removal. Nevertheless, the ruling was unequivocal on one point: anyone detained under the Alien Enemies Act had to be given notice before they were removed and an opportunity to contest their deportation.\nThe outcome effectively undid Boasberg\u2019s injunction against the removals on March 15th, but it reinforced certain aspects of his ruling. \u201cThe Court effectively said that the Constitution flatly prohibits the Government from doing exactly what it did that Saturday, when it secretly loaded people onto planes, kept many of them in the dark about their destination, and raced to spirit them away before they could invoke their due-process rights,\u201d Boasberg wrote in an opinion that he issued on April 16th. In that opinion, he also found that there is \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that the Trump Administration could be held in contempt of court for having disregarded his initial order.\nBy that time, the government had arranged for two more planes to transport detainees to the same Salvadoran prison. The Trump Administration was no longer invoking the Alien Enemies Act, but it didn\u2019t share the detainees\u2019 names; there was no official record. On March 31st, the State Department announced that it had sent seventeen more migrants to the prison. Ten were Salvadorans, the rest Venezuelans. Two weeks later, Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, posted on X, \u201cLast night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador.\u201d\nWhen Boasberg wrote that there was \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe the government had ignored his orders, he was, in effect, initiating a more sustained investigation into what had happened on March 15th. But this wasn\u2019t the only case in which Bove seemed to be at odds with a judge\u2019s instructions. The Department of Homeland Security was planning to deport people apprehended on U.S. soil to third countries, often without adequate procedures or legal justifications. Several such cases prompted a separate lawsuit before a different judge about whether the government, in accordance with the Convention Against Torture, had properly determined that the migrants would not be tortured after their removal. After that judge temporarily blocked those removals, Reuveni raised questions within the Justice Department about whether the Administration was, once again, ignoring a judge\u2019s injunction. On April 1st, according to Reuveni, he received a call from an acting Assistant Attorney General who told him that \u201cBove was very unhappy that Mr. Reuveni had contacted counsel at various agencies to ascertain whether DOJ had violated a court order.\u201d Reuveni was instructed to stop sending e-mails and to restrict his future communications to phone calls.\nOn April 4th, Reuveni was in court, in Washington, when he admitted to a judge that an administrative error had led to the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran who was on one of the March 15th flights, despite an order from an immigration court prohibiting his removal to El Salvador. The next day, Todd Blanche, the Deputy Attorney General, placed Reuveni on leave, and soon after that he was fired. \u201cAt my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cAny attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\u201d In early May, three weeks before Trump nominated Bove to the appellate bench, Reuveni filed his whistle-blower complaint with the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Justice. The Times reported that the inspector general let the information sit, unaddressed, for more than two months.\nOn June 24th, as Bove\u2019s nomination was gaining momentum among Senate Republicans, Reuveni and his lawyers decided to make his account public, in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Chuck Grassley, the committee\u2019s chair, who has in the past taken pride in his reputation as a protector of whistle-blowers, dismissed Reuveni\u2019s account as \u201ca coordinated political strike.\u201d Two other anonymous whistle-blowers then came forward with further allegations about Bove. These claims, a Grassley staffer on the committee told the press, \u201creek of a bad faith attempt to sink a nominee who\u2019s already received committee approval.\u201d A month later, by a Senate vote of 50\u201349, Bove became a federal judge, a job that comes with a lifetime tenure.\nOn July 18th, after four months of being held incommunicado in El Salvador, two hundred and fifty-two Venezuelans were released to Venezuela, in a prisoner exchange. During their incarceration, a number of them said in news interviews and on social media, that they were beaten, threatened, denied medical care, and, in some cases, sexually abused. They held a hunger strike, and, when that was met with indifference from the guards inside the prison, they cut themselves with plastic drinking cups and wrote pleading messages in blood on their bedsheets. (Salvadoran officials have denied any mistreatment.)\nTheir liberation marked the end of an unconscionable ordeal, but it did little to answer the questions raised by the Administration\u2019s actions or to dispel concerns that something similar might happen again. To begin with, the number of men sent to Venezuela was news in its own right. The U.S. government still hasn\u2019t produced a full account of whom it sent to El Salvador. Initial journalistic reports put the number of Venezuelan men deported at two hundred and thirty-eight, but advocates added names as more Venezuelans came forward saying that their family members had disappeared. \u201cThe lack of evidence makes it impossible to confirm that there were actually two hundred fifty-two people,\u201d Michelle Bran\u00e9, the executive director of the nonprofit Together and Free, said. She and her colleagues have tried to work out a provisional tally, based on partial lists obtained by journalists and on information gleaned from leaked government documents, but they say that some of the Venezuelans sent to El Salvador remain unaccounted for. The U.S. government\u2019s own documents, according to ProPublica, reveal that officials knew most of them were innocent of any criminal charges. Yet the Administration continues to claim that they were gangsters, terrorists, and \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d At least one of the men has already filed a lawsuit against the D.H.S. for damages. \u201cI want to clear my name,\u201d he told the Times.\nAn appeals court is currently considering whether the Trump Administration lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act. But, as the divergent paths of Boasberg and Bove suggest, the government may have already succeeded in prosecuting its political agenda. Boasberg twice incurred the Administration\u2019s wrath\u2014first for issuing an injunction against the President\u2019s policy and then for, in effect, opening an investigation into whether D.H.S. had deliberately violated his order. Back in March, Trump called for Boasberg\u2019s impeachment. The President\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, described judges like Boasberg, who blocked or tempered the Administration\u2019s policies, as \u201cradical communists.\u201d\nBoasberg now also stands accused of publicly doubting whether Trump would obey federal-court orders. The allegation is based on a story published last month in the right-wing news outlet the Federalist, which obtained a leaked memorandum summarizing a private gathering of federal judges, known as the Judicial Conference of the United States, on March 11th. Dozens of judges were in attendance, including Boasberg and John Roberts. According to the Federalist, Boasberg told Roberts about concerns he\u2019d been hearing from other judges about the prospect of Trump flouting judicial orders. The D.O.J. apparently considers this proof that Boasberg \u201cattempted to transform a routine housekeeping agenda into a forum to persuade the Chief Justice and other federal judges of his preconceived belief that the Trump Administration would violate court orders.\u201d In fact, as the Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeck wrote in his Substack, \u201cIt appears that Boasberg was simply doing his job\u2014relaying concerns raised by his colleagues to the Chief Justice, almost certainly in response to a specific prompt that he do so.\u201d\nEarlier this month, a two-judge majority on a D.C. appeals-court panel quashed Boasberg\u2019s inquiry into whether the Administration had violated his order. The judges, both of whom are Trump appointees, found that, because the Supreme Court eventually stayed Boasberg\u2019s injunction, the government couldn\u2019t be held in contempt for ignoring it in the first place. Such an interpretation would invite the government to routinely ignore judges\u2019 rulings on the chance that they might eventually be reversed on appeal. \u201cThat\u2019s not how contempt works,\u201d Vladeck told me. \u201cThis is a ruling by judges who either don\u2019t appreciate the peril that the federal courts are in, or don\u2019t care.\u201d\nThe D.O.J\u2019s misconduct complaint against Boasberg for bias against the President is now before Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge of the D.C. Court of Appeals. It is hard to imagine a finding against Boasberg, given the dubiousness of the allegations. But that doesn\u2019t mean the complaint will be summarily dismissed. Srinivasan may toss it out, but he may also rule that there\u2019s grounds for review by a full panel of judges. Whatever the case, the message is unmistakable. Judges are \u201cbeing vilified and pilloried left and right for doing nothing other than their job,\u201d Vladeck said. Perhaps more than any other case to date, J.G.G. v. Trump has become a proving ground for the Administration. It has defied the federal courts and the rule-bound order they represent. A new crop of judges is emerging in their place: fidelity over independence, Bove over Boasberg. \u2666"

      "text": "In the first week after the White House effectively seized control of Washington, DC\u2019s police force and deployed federal agents and troops to the district, the city saw a moderate drop in reported crime \u2014 and a far larger surge in arrests of immigrants, a CNN analysis of government data found.\nIn the week beginning August 12, the first full day the Trump administration had control of the Metropolitan Police Department, property crimes dropped roughly 19% compared to the week before, and violent crime dipped by about 17%, according to the most recent public data published by the MPD.\nThose trends vary widely by types of crimes, however. While robberies and car break-ins were down by more than 40%, other thefts were flat week-to-week and there was a 6% increase in burglary cases and a 14% increase in cases of assault with a dangerous weapon, the data shows. There have been two murders since President Donald Trump signed his executive order taking control of the department, which is consistent with recent weeks in DC, though none since August 13.\nThe drop in overall crime comes as federal agencies have embedded themselves with local officers, assisting in arrests, searches, warrant executions and other local police work as they drive around the district in vehicles only marked by their occasional flashing blue and red lights.\nAt the same time, the wave of ICE agents deployed to the district have fueled a much more dramatic increase in arrests of immigrants.\nSince August 7, federal officials have arrested 300 people in DC who don\u2019t have legal immigration status, the administration said \u2014 a more than tenfold increase over the typical ICE arrest numbers for the district, CNN\u2019s review found.\nOver the first six months of Trump\u2019s term, the agency arrested about 12 immigrants in DC per week on average, according to data published by the Deportation Data Project, a research group associated with the University of California, Berkeley law school.\nICE agents trail MPD officers, ready to respond if anyone pulled over or questioned has overstayed their visa or otherwise is in the country unlawfully, one law enforcement official told CNN.\nIn response to CNN\u2019s findings, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the media was trying to dismiss the \u201cexceptional results\u201d of Trump\u2019s efforts in DC.\n\u201cThe drops in crime are not \u2018moderate,\u2019 they are life-changing for the countless of DC residents and visitors who have not been murdered, robbed, carjacked, or victims of overall violent crime in the last week,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe priority of this operation remains getting violent criminals off the streets \u2014 regardless of immigration status.\u201d\nAccording to the administration, the immigrants arrested include people who have been arrested for committing crimes or have outstanding warrants, including for some serious offenses. CNN couldn\u2019t independently verify the details of those arrests or what percentage of arrestees have been accused of non-immigration offenses.\nThe noticeable spike in immigration numbers also echoes concerns by some DC leaders, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, that the true purpose of Trump\u2019s local takeover is to pursue undocumented immigrants.\nWhen asked Thursday whether Trump\u2019s crime emergency was a pretext to enforce the administration\u2019s immigration efforts, Bowser told reporters that a recent order from Attorney General Pam Bondi \u201calmost exclusively focused on immigration enforcement and homeless encampment enforcement.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll let you draw your own conclusion,\u201d Bowser said.\nDC\u2019s attorney general has filed a lawsuit challenging Bondi\u2019s order to ignore sanctuary laws on the books in DC, which previously limited the police force\u2019s ability to cooperate with ICE on immigration cases. During a hearing last week, however, the federal judge presiding over the case indicated that Trump\u2019s authority under the Home Rule Act likely allows him to order police to assist ICE.\nViral videos have circulated in DC this week of ICE agents \u2014 donning their now-signature masks \u2014 tackling immigrants, including some food delivery workers, and in one instance breaking car windows to arrest two men.\nDuring one evening of the heightened police presence this week, CNN tracked officers responding to reports of shootings, drug and firearm possessions and one stolen vehicle. Federal agents communicated over local police channels as they stopped and searched vehicles and responded to reports of crime, warning each other about DC\u2019s speed cameras.\nMPD and federal partners have also established traffic checkpoints in the past week \u2014 a law enforcement tool that\u2019s not common in the district \u2014 including a large checkpoint with dozens of officers and agents on a highway leading out of the city.\nOfficers were seen pulling over certain vehicles and conducting searches, though it was unclear how law enforcement were determining who to pull over and who to allow through.\nAs night fell, police chatter picked up, with local and federal officers weaving through the streets together in long lines of flashing lights and speeding unmarked cars.\nBut some incidents, like a shooting in one of the higher crime areas in the Southeast area of the city, were handled solely by MPD officers.\n\u201cThey only come when bad sh*t happens,\u201d one resident standing outside of the police tape following the shooting told CNN.\nOn Wednesday night, there appeared to be relatively few federal agents patrolling the streets of DC on foot, something that was commonly seen in the first few days of Trump\u2019s federal response. Instead, agents remained in their nondescript vehicles, waiting for calls to blip in through the radio.\n\u201cIt just feels like overkill,\u201d another DC resident told CNN during a night out on the popular U-Street corridor in the city, lined with restaurants, clubs and vape shops.\nRoughly eight in 10 DC residents oppose Trump\u2019s police takeover and his deployment of the National Guard and FBI to the city, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. Vice President JD Vance and other administration figures have dismissed that survey finding, claiming without citing evidence that the federal surge is popular with local residents.\nThe full picture of crime in DC under Trump\u2019s control is likely to keep evolving. The numbers analyzed by CNN are based on the preliminary data available Friday morning and could change over time, as some crimes take longer to be entered into the department\u2019s database. And the data does not cover all crimes in the city; only some types of offenses are reported daily by the department.\nThe statistics have also become a political pressure point in Trump\u2019s takeover. On Friday, the president on social media threatened \u201ca complete and total Federal takeover of the City,\u201d accusing Bowser of promoting \u201cfalse and highly inaccurate crime figures.\u201d\nWhile local officials have pointed to a decline in DC crime in 2024 and 2025 after a spike in 2023, the Trump Justice Department is now investigating whether MPD manipulated crime data.\nThe investigation comes following reports that an MPD commander was placed on administrative leave amid accusations that the department was falsifying crime data in one district, marking offenses as lower-level crimes than they might actually be. The MPD\u2019s own probe into the issue is ongoing.\nBut Trump has also overstated the impact of the federal takeover, proclaiming on Friday that it had caused a public safety \u201cmiracle\u201d unseen in recent memory \u2014 the nation\u2019s capital going a week without a single reported homicide.\n\u201cDC was a hellhole, and now it\u2019s safe,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday. \u201cI hate to say this, because it doesn\u2019t sound very good, but there have been no murders in DC in the last week. That\u2019s the first time in anybody\u2019s memory that you haven\u2019t had a murder in a week.\u201d\nIt\u2019s correct that there have been no murders in DC over the last week, according to the public MPD data. Two murders have taken place since Trump signed his executive order wresting control of the police department \u2013 one on the evening of August 11, the same day the order was signed, and another on August 13.\nThis is not the first recent week without homicides, as Trump claimed. There were no murders reported from May 4 through May 11, April 11 to 17, and a more than two-week-long period from February 25 through March 12.\nThere have been a total of 89 homicides committed so far in 2025, according to the district\u2019s data. In some cases, murders are confirmed and added into the public MPD database weeks or months after they occur, so it\u2019s possible that additional cases will be added.\nProtests against the crackdown have been sporadic, with residents in some neighborhoods taking to the streets after ICE or other federal agents are spotted, sometimes forming crowds around the officers and chanting for them to leave.\nIn court, Justice Department attorneys said Trump\u2019s authority over the MPD will expire at the end of the 30-day period set out in the Home Rule Act \u2014 which the president has cited for his authority.\nBut neither the DOJ nor the White House have said whether Trump will continue to use federal agents and the hundreds of National Guard members he has deployed after his month of control over the police department expires. The president himself has said he could keep them there \u201cas long as I want.\u201d\nThis article has been updated with additional information."

      "text": "What Trump has said about Jeffrey Epstein over the years, including on 2024 campaign trail\nRepublicans have fueled the Epstein intrigue for years.\nPresident Donald Trump continues to face backlash from his MAGA supporters over his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\nThe Justice Department and FBI said in a brief memo that a review found no Epstein \"client list\" and confirmed the disgraced financier died by suicide in prison while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.\nThe president has tried to shift focus away from the case, urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to release \"whatever she thinks is credible\" before going on to claim without evidence the entire thing was what he calls a \"Democratic hoax.\"\nSome Republicans have fueled the Epstein intrigue and conspiracies surrounding the case for years, with Trump himself weighing in several times.\nHere's what Trump has said about Epstein during his first term, on the campaign trail and now as pressure builds on him to release the Epstein files.\n2019: Trump distances himself from Epstein: 'Not a fan'\nAfter Epstein was arrested and charged with sex trafficking of minors in July 2019, Trump was asked about his 2002 comments in which he called Epstein \"terrific\" in a New York Magazine story.\nIn response, Trump repeatedly said he wasn't a \"fan\" of Epstein.\n\"Well, I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I mean, people in Palm Beach knew him. He was a fixture in Palm Beach. I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years. I wasn't a fan. I was not, yeah, a long time ago, I'd say maybe 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you. I was not a fan of his.\"\nIn August 2019, after Epstein's death, Trump retweeted a post that alleged Bill Clinton was connected to Epstein's death.\nWhen asked about his retweet in an interview, Trump said \"what we're saying is we want an investigation. I want a full investigation, and that's what I absolutely am demanding. That's what our attorney general -- our great attorney general -- is doing.\" The attorney general at the time was Bill Barr.\nPressed further on if he really believed the Clintons were involved, Trump didn't shut it down.\n\"I have no idea,\" he said, but encouraged further questions. \"So you have to ask: Did Bill Clinton go to the island? That's the question. If you find that out, you're going to know a lot,\" Trump said at the time.\nClinton has denied any knowledge of Epstein\u2019s crimes and has denied ever visiting Epstein\u2019s private island.\n2020: Trump suggested Epstein may have been killed\nIn August 2020, during the thick of his reelection campaign, Trump suggested Epstein may have been killed while in federal custody.\nThe comments went against the findings of then-Attorney General Barr and the New York City medical examiner who ruled the death a suicide.\nDuring an interview with Axios reporter Jonathan Swan, Trump was asked about Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of Epstein who at the time of the interview had just been arrested. She is currently serving a 20-year sentence for conspiring with and aiding Epstein in his sexual abuse of underage girls.\n\"Her boyfriend died in jail. And people are still trying to figure out how did it happen,\" Trump said. \"Was it suicide? Was he killed? And I do wish her well. I'm not looking for anything bad for her.\"\nIn August 2023, in an interview with Tucker Carlson, Trump was pressed further on if he believed Epstein committed suicide or not.\n\"Do you think it's possible that Epstein was killed?\" Carlson asked.\n\"Oh, sure, it's possible. I mean, I don't really believe -- I think he probably committed suicide,\" Trump said.\n2024: Trump asked about Epstein on the campaign trail\nIn June 2024, Trump was asked if he would release various files -- including the John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. assassination files and the Epstein files -- during an interview with Fox News.\n\"Would you declassify the Epstein files?\" Fox News' Rachel Campos-Duffy asked. Trump responded, \"Yeah, yeah, I would.\"\nThat clip was circulated widely online, including by the Trump War Room -- the social media account of Trump's campaign operation. The account posted it to X with the caption: \"President Trump says he will DECLASSIFY the 9/11 Files, JFK Files, and Epstein Files.\"\nBut Trump's full answer to the question wasn't shown until it played on Will Cain's radio show.\nTrump went on to say in the exchange with Campos-Duffy: \"I don't know about Epstein so much as I do the others. Certainly about the way he died. It'd be interesting to find out what happened there, because that was a weird situation and the cameras didn't happen to be working, etc., etc. But yeah, I'd go a long way toward that one.\"\nIn September 2024, Trump made a more firm pledge to release Epstein files during a podcast with Lex Fridman.\nFridman, in conversation with Trump, said \"it's just very strange for a lot of people that the list of clients that went to the island has not been made public.\"\n\"It's very interesting, isn't it? It probably will be, by the way, probably,\" Trump said.\n\"If you're able to, you'll be --\" Fridman started before Trump jumped in.\n\"Yeah, I'd certainly take a look at it. Now, Kennedy's interesting because it's so many years ago,\" Trump said. \"They do that for danger too, because it endangers certain people, et cetera, et cetera, so Kennedy is very different from the Epstein thing but I'd be inclined to do the Epstein. I'd have no problem with it.\"\n2025: Trump tries to dismiss Epstein files after DOJ, FBI memo prompts GOP backlash\nFor the first several months of his administration, talk of the Epstein files was mostly left to Trump officials, including Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. In April, Trump said he was unaware of when the files would be released.\nThen, after the DOJ and FBI released their memo on July 7, Trump reacted to outrage from his MAGA base.\nTrump tried to shut down a question about Epstein during a Cabinet meeting the next day, July 8, right after the deadly flash flooding of the Guadalupe River.\n\"Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?\" Trump shot back to a reporter. \"This guy's been talked about for years. You're asking. We have Texas, we have this. We have all of the things. And are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable.\"\nTrump then turned to defend Bondi in a lengthy social media post on July 12, in which he said his administration and his supporters should prioritize their focus elsewhere.\n\"We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and 'selfish people' are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,\" Trump wrote in the post.\nThe story, though, didn't die down and Trump only appeared to grow more angered by the pushback from his supporters.\nOn July 15, Trump appeared to put the onus on Bondi for what comes next, saying she should release \"whatever she thinks is credible\" on Epstein. Later that day, Trump said he didn't understand the interest in Epstein.\n\"It's pretty boring stuff. It's sordid, but it's boring, and I don't understand why it keeps going,\" Trump said. He added, \"I think really only pretty bad people, including fake news, want to keep something like that going.\"\nThe next day, on July 16, Trump took to social media baselessly blaming Democrats for the files and those who he called \"past supporters\" of his for the fixation on Epstein.\n\"Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this \"b------,\" hook, line, and sinker,\" Trump wrote on his own conservative social media platform.\n\"Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don't even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don't want their support anymore!\" Trump added.\nTrump doubled down on that claim in the Oval Office, calling it a Democratic \"hoax.\" When asked by ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce if the attorney general told him it was a hoax or what evidence he'd seen of that, Trump replied:\n\"The attorney general, no. I know it's a hoax. It's started by Democrats,\" Trump insisted. He added \"some stupid\" and \"foolish\" Republicans had fallen for it.\nABC News' Will Steakin contributed to this report."

      "text": "South Africa\u2019s most vulnerable struggle to find HIV medication after US aid cuts\nSouth Africa\u2019s most vulnerable struggle to find HIV medication after US aid cuts\nJOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 On a warm evening in Johannesburg, the news spread like wildfire among sex workers: Within 24 hours, several nonprofit clinics providing free HIV services would be closing as President Donald Trump announced the United States was slashing foreign aid.\nSome South Africans living with, or at risk of, HIV secured supplies of life-saving drugs just in time. Others did not.\nHalf a year later, the country with more people living with HIV than any other is struggling to treat its most vulnerable. Over 63,000 people were being treated in the 12 clinics across the nation that shut down. Up to 220,000 people have faced disruption to their daily HIV medication.\nSouth Africa\u2019s government has vowed it won\u2019t let the U.S. withdrawal of about $427 million in support collapse its HIV program, the largest in the world.\nSex workers, among the most vulnerable South Africans as their work is illegal, and transgender people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from families or communities. They described a new world of difficulty in obtaining HIV medication or the preventive medicine for people at risk of HIV.\nOne HIV-positive sex worker and mother of three said she was off medication for almost four months after being turned away from public hospitals, which the government\u2019s health department says should not be happening.\n\u201cThe only thing that I could think of was my kids, and that I am going to die, and how am I going to explain to my kids that I am sick because of the line of work that I chose?\u201d she said. The 37-year-old said she finally obtained a month\u2019s supply of medication in June from a mobile clinic that was introduced after the funding cuts. She didn\u2019t know what she would do after that.\nAnother HIV-positive sex worker said she had resorted to illegally buying medication on the black market, where the pills have nearly doubled in price.\nThe U.S. has since issued a limited waiver allowing the resumption of certain life-saving HIV services globally, but the dismantling of much of U.S. foreign aid has created chaos. And for many people affected, harm is already done.\nOverall, experts warn of hundreds of thousands of new infections in the next few years in South Africa, and tens of thousands of additional deaths, if the cuts in aid aren\u2019t restored or covered by other means.\nTurned away from hospitals\nA major challenge for those who lost access to the U.S.-funded nonprofit clinics is finding help elsewhere, including public hospitals.\n\u201cI have tried local clinics, three of them, and I have been refused treatment because I don\u2019t have a referral letter from my previous clinic,\u201d the 37-year-old sex worker said.\nKate Rees, a public health specialist at Anova Health Institute in Johannesburg, said while it\u2019s ideal to have a transfer letter, it\u2019s not needed and people can\u2019t be turned away.\n\u201cBut people at the clinic, whether it\u2019s nurses, security guards, doctors, whoever actually, do turn them away,\u201d Rees said.\nIn response to AP questions, Foster Mohale, a spokesperson for South Africa\u2019s health department, said they were not aware of anyone who had been turned away and encouraged people to go to the nearest public health facility.\nAnother challenge at public hospitals and clinics is discrimination, especially for sex workers and transgender people.\n\u201cIn hospital, they said they only give PrEP to people who are in a relationship with someone who\u2019s HIV-positive and trying to have a baby,\u201d one transgender woman said. She decided to buy medication privately, moving in with her mother to save money to afford it.\n\u201cI am not going back to the clinic, with people who are going to make fun of me, like I\u2019m a clown,\u201d she said.\nThe health department didn\u2019t respond to questions on that issue.\nNot everyone can afford to buy medication privately or on the black market, where a bottle reportedly goes for about $25 \u2014 and whose contents might be unverified.\nThe withdrawal from regular health care by sex workers and others means that many are no longer being tested and don\u2019t know what level of the virus they have in body fluids \u2014 and whether they can pass it on to others.\nAnger with their countryman Musk\nEven before the U.S. cuts, about 2 million of South Africa\u2019s estimated 8 million people living with HIV were never on medication. Some didn\u2019t have the time or money to spend on traveling to clinics. Some were in denial or didn\u2019t believe in the drugs. Some had not yet been diagnosed.\nNow that number is rising.\nYvette Raphael, co-founder of the local Advocacy for Prevention of HIV and AIDS group, said she and fellow activists are worried that South Africa could go backwards.\n\u201cWe are scared that we are going to see people dying again,\u201d she said.\nThe concerns echo across Africa, the continent hardest hit by the U.S. aid cuts. The Trump administration has defended the cuts, saying the spending was not aligned with U.S. interests.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re $37 trillion in debt. So at some point, the continent of Africa needs to absorb more of the burden of providing this health care,\u201d Russell Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, told a hearing in June.\nAmong South Africans, some wonder whether Trump\u2019s stance may have been influenced by their countryman Elon Musk, who oversaw the early efforts to cut U.S. aid.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no civil words to express how I feel, but I just hate them for what they did,\u201d one transgender woman said. \u201cOur lives matter.\u201d\n___\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

      "text": "Timeline: Trump administration's words as critics press for Epstein records\nBefore the 2024 presidential election, both Donald Trump and JD Vance called for the release of more files related to convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein. In its first months in office, the new Trump administration has promised more transparency in government \u2014 but it hasn't released any trove of \"Epstein files\" that supporters have demanded.\nEpstein was found dead six years ago in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the federal detention facility where he was being held in Manhattan. Officials later concluded he died by suicide \u2014 but public skepticism about his death persists.\nThe names of a number of powerful figures have already appeared in documents related to Epstein's case that have been released, including President Trump and former President Bill Clinton, both of whom socialized with Epstein. But as NPR and other outlets have noted, appearing in Epstein's flight logs and other records is not an indication of wrongdoing.\nMany Trump supporters see the unreleased files as an unfulfilled promise. Prominent Republicans from House Speaker Mike Johnson to former Vice President Mike Pence have called for more transparency on the Epstein case, along with influential right-wing conspiracy promoters, including media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Laura Loomer.\nHere's a brief timeline of the Trump administration's shifting tone and actions on the Epstein case.\nFeb. 21: Attorney General Pam Bondi says the Epstein client list is \"sitting on my desk\" in an appearance on Fox News, in response to a question from John Roberts.\n\"The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients? Will that really happen?\" Roberts asks Bondi.\n\"It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm reviewing that,\" the attorney general replies.\nBondi later says she was referring to the Epstein files, not a client list. But her remark has echoed through discussions of the Epstein story so far this year.\nFeb. 27: The White House gives binders to far-right influencers bearing a Department of Justice seal and labels reading, \"Epstein Files: Phase 1\" and \"Declassified.\" But much of the information turns out to have been released before, and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, chairwoman of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, calls it \"old info.\"\nJuly 7: The Justice Department releases a memo saying it has found \"no incriminating 'client list'\" for Epstein, contradicting Bondi's February statement. The agency says it turned up more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence. It also states that \"Epstein harmed over one thousand victims.\" But the DOJ says those victims' sensitive information is \"intertwined\" in the materials and it concludes \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"\nThe memo addresses several hot topics on social media. In addition to rebutting the notion of a client list, it says there's no credible evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures or that his death was anything other than a case of suicide.\nJuly 12: \"We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening,\" Trump says on Truth Social in response to his supporters' criticisms of Bondi. The president accuses critics of trying to hurt his administration, \"all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.\"\nPeople should let Bondi do her job, Trump says, \"and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.\"\nJuly 15: Bondi refuses to address questions about her handling of the Epstein files. Trump voices his support, saying his attorney general has \"really done a very good job.\"\nTrump also suggests people who are fixated on Epstein should move on: \"He's dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is, I really don't. And the credible information's been given.\"\nJuly 16: Trump lashes out at fellow Republicans for fixating on Epstein, calling it a hoax.\n\"It's all been a big hoax. It's perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net. And so they try and do the Democrats' work,\" Trump tells reporters in the Oval Office.\nTrump also suggests he would approve of Bondi releasing some Epstein documents if they meet a standard: \"Whatever's credible, she can release. If a document is credible, if a document's there that is credible, she can release.\"\nAs NPR's Dominico Montanaro later reports, it's one of many instances of Trump emphasizing that \"credible evidence\" from the Epstein records should be shared.\nJuly 17: Trump slams The Wall Street Journal after the paper publishes what it says is a risqu\u00e9 birthday note Trump wrote to celebrate Epstein's 50th birthday, stating, \"the supposed letter they printed by President Trump to Epstein was a FAKE.\"\n\"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,\" Trump writes on Truth Social.\nJuly 18: Trump files a defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal over its coverage of his relationship with Epstein, including the birthday note that Trump says he didn't write.\nOn the same day, the DOJ files a motion in the Southern District of New York to unseal grand jury testimony related to Epstein's 2019 indictment charging him with sex trafficking offenses, citing \"extensive public interest\" following the agency's July 6 memo.\nThe DOJ later asks to unseal related exhibits, including a PowerPoint presentation and four pages of call logs.\nThe agency files similar motions in New York regarding the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime partner who was sentenced to a 20-year prison term, as well as in Florida, where Epstein agreed to a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors in 2007 over the abuse of minor girls.\nJuly 19: Trump posts on Truth Social about his administration's grand jury request, saying he \"asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval.\"\nJuly 22: Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche says he is talking with Maxwell's lawyer and expects to meet with her, at Bondi's direction. Trump says he thinks the plan \"sounds appropriate.\"\nJuly 23: The Wall Street Journal reports that Bondi and other Justice Department officials told Trump in May that his name \"is among many in the Epstein files.\" The newspaper says the officials feel the files contain \"unverified hearsay\" about hundreds of people, including Trump, who were in the same social orbit as Epstein.\nThe same day, federal judge Robin Rosenberg in Florida denies release of grand jury transcripts related to Epstein.\nJuly 24: Blanche meets with Maxwell in prison for two days, according to Democratic senators. The DOJ says it's mulling whether to release transcripts of their meeting.\nJuly 29: Trump says he and Epstein had a falling out over Epstein hiring girls from his Mar-a-Lago resort, resulting in Epstein being kicked out. A prominent Epstein accuser, the late Virginia Giuffre, had said she was a teenager working at Mar-a-Lago when she first met Maxwell and Epstein.\nAug. 1: The Bureau of Prisons says it has moved Maxwell from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Fla., to a women's minimum-security prison camp in Bryan, Texas.\nAug. 5: The House Oversight Committee subpoenas the Department of Justice for records related to Epstein and Maxwell. It seeks \"all documents and communications relating or referring to\" the pair and their respective court cases, setting a deadline of Aug. 19.\nAug. 11: Federal judge Paul Engelmayer in New York denies Bondi's request to unseal grand jury materials from the Maxwell case, saying most of the records are already public. In a rebuke to the DOJ, the judge adds that an observer \"might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at 'transparency' but at diversion \u2014 aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.\"\nAug. 18: House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., says the DOJ will send the first batch of Epstein documents to the panel on Aug. 22, three days after the committee's original deadline. \"It will take the Department time to produce all the records and ensure the identification of victims and any child sexual abuse material are redacted,\" Comer says.\nAug. 20: Federal judge Richard M. Berman denies Bondi's request to unseal records related to the Epstein case in New York, citing longstanding precedents of keeping grand jury proceedings secret and stating that the government did not prove \"special circumstances\" that might justify unsealing the records.\nAug. 22: The DOJ is scheduled to begin handing over files to the House Oversight Committee."

      "text": "Listen to more stories on hark\nDear Colleagues,\nFor three and a half decades as a career diplomat, I walked across the lobby of the State Department countless times\u2014inspired by the Stars and Stripes and humbled by the names of patriots etched into our memorial wall. It was heartbreaking to see so many of you crossing that same lobby in tears following the reduction in force in July, carrying cardboard boxes with family photos and the everyday remains of proud careers in public service. After years of hard jobs in hard places\u2014defusing crises, tending alliances, opening markets, and helping Americans in distress\u2014you deserved better.\nThe same is true for so many other public servants who have been fired or pushed out in recent months: the remarkable intelligence officers I was proud to lead as CIA director, the senior military officers I worked with every day, the development specialists I served alongside overseas, and too many others with whom we\u2019ve served at home and abroad.\nThe work you all did was unknown to many Americans, rarely well understood or well appreciated. And under the guise of reform, you all got caught in the crossfire of a retribution campaign\u2014of a war on public service and expertise.\nThose of us who have served in public institutions understand that serious reforms are overdue. Of course we should remove bureaucratic hurdles that prevent agencies like the State Department from operating efficiently. But there is a smart way and a dumb way to tackle reform, a humane way and an intentionally traumatizing way.\nIf today\u2019s process were truly about sensible reform, career officers\u2014who typically rotate roles every few years\u2014wouldn\u2019t have been fired simply because their positions have fallen out of political favor.\nIf this process were truly about sensible reform, crucial experts in technology or China policy in whom our country has invested so much wouldn\u2019t have been pushed out.\nIf this process were truly about reform, it would have addressed not only the manifestations of bloat and inefficiencies but also their causes\u2014including congressionally mandated budget items.\nAnd if this process were truly about sensible reform, you and your families wouldn\u2019t have been treated with gleeful indignity. One of your colleagues, a career diplomat, was given just six hours to clear out his office. \u201cWhen I was expelled from Russia,\u201d he said, \u201cat least Putin gave me six days to leave.\u201d\nNo, this is not about reform. It is about retribution. It is about breaking people and breaking institutions by sowing fear and mistrust throughout our government. It is about paralyzing public servants\u2014making them apprehensive about what they say, how it might be interpreted, and who might report on them. It is about deterring anyone from daring to speak truth to power.\nI served six presidents: three Republicans and three Democrats. It was my duty to faithfully implement their decisions, even when I didn\u2019t agree with them. Career public servants have a profound obligation to execute the decisions of elected leaders, whether we voted for them or not; that discipline is essential to any democratic system.\nMany of your fellow officers purged at the State Department were doing just that\u2014faithfully executing decisions that ran contrary to their professional advice and preferences. They may not have supported the cancellation of Fulbright scholarships, the resettlement of Afrikaners, the expulsion of the Afghan partners who fought and bled with us for two decades, but they implemented those policies anyway. Still, those officers were fired.\nTensions between elected political leaders and career public servants are hardly new. Each of the presidents I served harbored periodic concerns about the reliability and sluggishness of government bureaucracy. Although individual officers could be remarkably resourceful, the State Department as an institution was rarely accused of being too agile or too full of initiative. There is a difference, however, between fixing bureaucratic malaise and hammering professional public servants into politicized robots.\nThat\u2019s what autocrats do. They cow public servants into submission\u2014and in doing so, they create a closed system that is free of opposing views and inconvenient concerns. Their policy making, their ability to realize their aims, suffers as a result.\nVladimir Putin\u2019s foolish decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022 offers a powerful example. Putin operated within a tight circle in the run-up to the war. He relied on a handful of long-serving advisers who either shared his flawed assumptions about Ukraine\u2019s ability to resist and the West\u2019s willingness to support it, or had learned a long time ago that it was not career-enhancing to question Putin\u2019s judgment. The results, especially in the first year of the war, were catastrophic for Russia.\nFor all its flaws and imperfections, our system still allows disciplined dissent\u2014and it\u2019s better for it. Just as it is the duty of public servants to carry out orders we don\u2019t agree with, it is also our duty to be honest about our concerns within appropriate channels\u2014or to resign if we can\u2019t in good conscience follow those orders. Sound decision making suffers if experts feel like they cannot offer their candid or contrary insights.\nI could not have done my job as an ambassador, as a deputy secretary of state, or as the CIA director unless my colleagues were straightforward about their views. When I led secret talks with the Iranians more than a decade ago, I needed the unvarnished advice of diplomats and intelligence officers to help me navigate the complex world of nuclear programs and Iranian decision making. I needed colleagues to question my judgment sometimes, and offer creative, hard-nosed solutions.\nThere is a real danger in punishing dissent\u2014not only to our profession, but to our country. Once you start, policy can become an extension of court politics, with little airing of alternative views or consideration of second- and third-order consequences.\nLike some of you, I\u2019m old enough to have lived through other efforts at reform and streamlining. After the end of the Cold War, budgets were cut significantly, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency were absorbed into the State Department. Years later, when I was serving as the American ambassador in Moscow, we reduced staff by about 15 percent over three years. None of those was a perfect process, but they were conducted in a thoughtful way, respectful of public servants and their expertise.\nLong before any of us served in government, amid the escalation of the Cold War, in the 1950s, McCarthyism provided a vivid example of an alternative approach, full of deliberate trauma and casual cruelty. A generation of China specialists was falsely accused of being Communist sympathizers and driven from the State Department, kneecapping American diplomacy toward Beijing for years. Today\u2019s \u201creform\u201d process\u2014at State and elsewhere across the federal government\u2014bears much more resemblance to McCarthy\u2019s costly excesses than to any other era in which I\u2019ve served. And it\u2019s much more damaging.\nWe live in a new era\u2014one that is marked by major-power competition and a revolution in technology, and one that is more confusing, complicated, and combustible than any time before. I believe the United States still has a better hand to play than any of our rivals, unless we squander the moment and throw away some of our best cards. That\u2019s exactly what the current administration is doing.\nWe cannot afford to further erode the sources of our power at home and abroad. The demolition of institutions\u2014the dismantling of USAID and Voice of America, the planned 50 percent reduction in the State Department\u2019s budget\u2014is part of a bigger strategic self-immolation. We\u2019ve put at risk the network of alliances and partnerships that is the envy of our rivals. We\u2019ve even gutted the research funding that powers our economy.\nIf intelligence analysts at the CIA saw our rivals engage in this kind of great-power suicide, we would break out the bourbon. Instead, the sound we hear is of champagne glasses clinking in the Kremlin and Zhongnanhai.\nOf course we should put our own national interests first. But winning in an intensely competitive world means thinking beyond narrowly defined self-interest and building coalitions that counterbalance our adversaries; it requires working together on \u201cproblems without passports\u201d such as climate change and global health challenges, which no single country can solve on its own.\nAt our best, over the years I served in government, we were guided by enlightened self-interest, a balance of hard power and soft power. That\u2019s what produced victory in the Cold War, the reunification of Germany, the coalition success in Operation Desert Storm, peace in the Balkans, nuclear-arms-control treaties, and the defense of Ukraine against Putin\u2019s aggression. The bipartisan PEPFAR program is a shining example of America at its best\u2014saving tens of millions of people from the deadly threat of HIV/AIDS while also fostering some measure of stability in sub-Saharan Africa, establishing wider trust in American leadership, and keeping Americans safe.\nWe weren\u2019t always at our best, or always especially enlightened, as we stumbled into protracted and draining conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, or when we didn\u2019t press allies hard enough to contribute their fair share. Criticism of the current administration should not obscure any of that, or suggest a misplaced nostalgia for an imperfect past.\nThe growing danger today, however, is that we\u2019re focused exclusively on the \u201cself\u201d part of enlightened self-interest\u2014at the expense of the \u201cenlightened\u201d part. The threat we face is not from an imaginary \u201cdeep state\u201d bent on undermining an elected president, but from a weak state of hollowed-out institutions and battered and belittled public servants, no longer able to uphold the guardrails of our democracy or help the United States compete in an unforgiving world. We won\u2019t beat hostile autocrats by imitating them.\nMany years ago, when I was finishing graduate school and trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my professional life, my father sent me a note. He was a career Army officer, a remarkably decent man, and the best model of public service I have ever known. \u201cNothing can make you prouder,\u201d my dad wrote, \u201cthan to serve your country with honor.\u201d I\u2019ve spent the past 40 years learning the truth in his advice.\nI am deeply proud to have served alongside so many of you. Your expertise and your often quietly heroic public service have made an immeasurable contribution to the best interests of our country. You swore an oath\u2014not to a party or a president, but to the Constitution. To the people of the United States.\nTo protect us. To defend us. To keep us safe.\nYou\u2019ve fulfilled your oath, just as those still serving in government are trying their best to fulfill theirs. So will the next generation of public servants.\nAll of us have a profound stake in shaping their inheritance. I worry about how much damage we will do in the meantime. There is still a chance that the next generation will serve in a world where we curb the worst of our current excesses\u2014stop betraying the ideals of public service, stop firing experts just because their statistics are unwelcome, and stop blowing up institutions that matter to our future. There is still a chance that the next generation could be present at the creation of a new era for America in the world, in which we\u2019re mindful of our many strengths but more careful about overreach.\nThere is, sadly, room for doubt about those chances. At this pivotal moment, there\u2019s a growing possibility that we will inflict so much damage on ourselves and our place in the world that those future public servants will instead find themselves present at the destruction\u2014a self-inflicted, generational setback to American leadership and national security.\nBut what I do not doubt is the abiding importance of public service, and the value of what you have done with yours. And I know that you will continue to serve in different ways, helping to stand watch over our great experiment, even as too many of our elected leaders seem to be turning their backs on it.\nWith appreciation to you and your families,\nThis article appears in the October 2025 print edition with the headline \u201cYou Deserved Better.\u201d"

      "text": "European postal services suspend shipment of packages to US over tariffs\nEuropean postal services suspend shipment of packages to US over tariffs\nATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 The end of an exemption on tariff duties for low-value packages coming into the United States is causing multiple international postal services to pause shipping as they await more clarity on the rule.\nThe exemption, known as the \u201c de minimis\u201d exemption, allows packages worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty free. A total of 1.36 billion packages were sent in 2024 under this exemption, for goods worth $64.6 billion, according to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Agency.\nIt is set to expire on Friday. On Saturday, postal services around Europe announced that they are suspending the shipment of many packages to the United States amid confusion over new import duties.\nPostal services in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Italy said they will stop shipping most merchandise to the U.S. effective immediately. France and Austria will follow on Monday.\nThe U.K.'s Royal Mail said it would halt shipments to the U.S. on Tuesday to allow time for those packages to arrive before duties kick in. Items originating in the United Kingdom worth over $100 \u2014 including gifts to friends and family \u2014 will incur a 10% duty, it said.\n\u201cKey questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out,\u201d DHL, the largest shipping provider in Europe, said in a statement.\nThe company said starting Saturday it \u201cwill no longer be able to accept and transport parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the US.\u201d\nA trade framework agreed on by the U.S. and the European Union last month set a 15% tariff on the vast majority of products shipped from the EU. Packages under $800 will now also be subject to the tariff.\nThe U.S. duty-free exemption for goods originating from China ended in May as part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value Chinese goods. The exemption is being extended to shipments from around the world.\nMany European postal services say they are pausing deliveries now because they cannot guarantee the goods will enter the U.S. before Aug. 29. They cite ambiguity about what kind of goods are covered by the new rules, and the lack of time to process their implications.\nPostnord, the Nordic logistics company, and Italy\u2019s postal service announced similar suspensions effective Saturday.\n\u201cIn the absence of different instructions from US authorities ... Poste Italiane will be forced, like other European postal operators, to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing goods destined for the United States, starting August 23. Mail shipments not containing merchandise will continue to be accepted,\u201d Poste Italiane said Friday.\nShipping by services such as DHL Express remains possible, it added.\nBj\u00f6rn Bergman, head of PostNord\u2019s Group Brand and Communication, said the pause was \u201cunfortunate but necessary to ensure full compliance of the newly implemented rules.\u201d\nIn the Netherlands, PostNL spokesperson Wout Witteveen said the Trump administration is pressing ahead with the new duties despite U.S. authorities lacking a system to collect them. He said that PostNL is working closely with its U.S. counterparts to find a solution.\n\u201cIf you have something to send to America, you should do it today,\u201d Witteveen told The Associated Press.\nAustrian Post, Austria\u2019s leading logistics and postal service provider, stated that the last acceptance of commercial shipments to the U.S., including Puerto Rico, will take place Tuesday.\nFrance\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time for the French postal service to prepare for new customs procedures.\n\u2033Despite discussions with U.S. customs services, no time was provided to postal operators to re-organize and assure the necessary computer updates to conform to the new rules,\u2033 it said in a statement.\nPostEurop, an association of 51 European public postal operators, said that if no solution can be found by Aug. 29 all its members will likely follow suit.\n___\nAnderson reported from New York.

      "text": "Years after she was publicly accused in civil lawsuits and the press of helping Jeffrey Epstein groom and sexually abuse minors, Ghislaine Maxwell was an honored guest at the prestigious Clinton Global Initiative conference in September 2013, according to newly uncovered photos, video and documents reviewed by CNN.\nFootage discovered by CNN\u2019s KFile shows Maxwell rising to applause during a CGI luncheon on ocean conservation, recognized alongside other \u201cCommitment to Action\u201d leaders.\nPreviously unreported information reviewed by CNN lists Maxwell among those recommended for complimentary access to the conference \u2014 a list that, according to a source familiar with it, indicates her access was personally recommended by either Bill or Hillary Clinton.\nMaxwell was at the CGI conference representing the now-defunct TerraMar Project, an ocean conservation non-profit she founded in 2012. An online agenda from CGI lists the organization as having pledged that year to rally international support for including oceans in the United Nations\u2019 global priorities.\nBy the time Maxwell was honored at the 2013 CGI conference, the allegations that she had recruited girls for Epstein and even participated in their abuse had been covered in major British and American outlets, and had prompted Clinton staff to bar her from official events by 2011 \u2014 making her public recognition at CGI two years later all the more striking.\nBeing named a \u201cCommitment to Action\u201d partner at CGI was widely regarded as a prestigious affiliation. And it was one that lent Maxwell and her organization public credibility by placing them alongside major global figures in philanthropy and policy, at a time when her public reputation had been damaged by links to allegations of sexual abuse by Epstein.\nA representative with the Clinton Foundation told CNN, \u201cThere were more than 600 comps approved at CGI in 2013. The decisions on those comps were made, as they have been historically, at the staff level, which included the office of President Clinton.\u201d\nA spokesperson for former President Bill Clinton added, \u201cThis is about someone working on ocean conservation attending a charitable conference 12 years ago, along with thousands of other people, and nothing more. As we have consistently said, the Clintons know nothing about Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s terrible crimes.\u201d\n\u201cThe TerraMar Project, along with a dozen more organizations, made Commitments to Action to protect the oceans announced in 2013 at a CGI meeting. These were part of more than 4,000 commitments made since 2005,\u201d the Clinton Foundation person added.\nClaims of abuse begin to surface\nAllegations against Maxwell first surfaced in May 2009, when Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, in a Florida civil lawsuit against Epstein, claimed Maxwell recruited her as a teenager, groomed her for sexual abuse, participated in that abuse, and arranged sexual encounters with Epstein.\nThe following month, the Palm Beach Post covered the lawsuit on its front page, reporting Giuffre\u2019s allegation that Maxwell had recruited her for Epstein. That September, while Maxwell was at the Clinton Global Initiative session in New York, she was served with a subpoena in the case \u2014 an incident that was covered by the New York Post\u2019s Page Six. CNN has reviewed archival footage confirming her attendance at the event that year.\n\u201cTo say she was upset about being publicly served at this function is an understatement,\u201d Bradley Edwards, an attorney for Giuffre and other Epstein accusers would write in his 2020 book, \u201cRelentless Pursuit.\u201d Maxwell was never deposed as part of that lawsuit, and Giuffre settled with Epstein in December 2009.\nThe allegations against Maxwell drew limited public attention until a February 2011 story on Prince Andrew, in which Giuffre gave an interview to the Daily Mail claiming that Maxwell had recruited her as a teenager for Epstein and had once told her that Epstein wanted her to have his child.\nA few days later, the Daily Mail ran a story focused solely on Maxwell, noting: \u201cDamningly, several of the girls alleged that Ghislaine Maxwell had procured them, and one of the girls \u2014 who has since settled her civil case out of court with Epstein \u2014 even alleged that Ghislaine had taken part in the sexual abuse herself.\u201d\nIn another interview two days later in the Daily Mail, Giuffre dove deeper into allegations against Maxwell. \u201cShe told me to take off my clothes. He had sex with me,\u201d she said, referring to Epstein.\nMaxwell publicly denied the allegations. She threatened legal actions against the papers, which she never took.\nBut the interview and article would also prompt expanded coverage in the British media of Giuffre\u2019s legal claims and her allegations about Epstein and Maxwell, including that Maxwell participated in Giuffre\u2019s abuse. The coverage also included a high-profile Vanity Fair story on Prince Andrew that reported Giuffre\u2019s claim that Maxwell had recruited her as Epstein\u2019s \u201csex slave\u201d when she was 15 years old. Prince Andrew settled with Giuffre in 2022 and has denied any wrongdoing. Giuffre died by suicide in April.\nThat renewed scrutiny spurred top Clinton aide Doug Band to instruct an aide in an October 2011 internal email to \u201cremove Ghislaine, from all lists\u201d for Clinton-related events, according to information seen by CNN and past reporting in Vanity Fair and The Spectator.\nThe person at the Clinton Foundation familiar with CGI told CNN, \u201cIf Doug Band instructed anyone to bar Maxwell, he didn\u2019t communicate it broadly and didn\u2019t say why.\u201d\nBill Clinton and Epstein had been friendly in the early 2000s, with the former president appearing on Epstein\u2019s private jet logs at least 16 times between 2002 and 2003 for trips he said were related to Clinton Foundation work. Clinton would later write that his relationship with Epstein had ended by 2003 before he was aware of the financier\u2019s crimes.\nClinton has never been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing related to Epstein.\nBut Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s closest associate, was and remained in the Clintons\u2019 orbit for years \u2014 continuing to appear at CGI events, co-hosting fundraisers for Hillary Clinton in 2007 and the Clinton Presidential Library in 2003, and maintaining social ties with the family.\n\u201cDear Ghislaine, Thank you for hosting such a terrific event for Hillary. I had a great time at Capitale, and I appreciate everything you did to make the fundraiser such an unqualified success. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible without your efforts,\u201d read a 2007 letter reviewed by CNN drafted for Bill Clinton to send to Maxwell, thanking her for co-hosting a major fundraiser for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 part of a batch of thank-you notes prepared for event hosts. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for your friendship.\u201d\nIt is unclear from the draft whether it was ultimately sent.\nLater, Maxwell vacationed with the Clintons\u2019 daughter, Chelsea Clinton, in 2009 and attended her wedding in 2010.\nA Clinton family spokesperson told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Chelsea was \u201cfriendly\u201d with Maxwell because of a mutual friend. \u201cWhen that relationship ended, Chelsea\u2019s relationship with her ended as well,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until 2015 that Chelsea became aware of the horrific allegations against Ghislaine Maxwell and she hopes that all the victims find justice.\u201d\nThe new details come amid renewed attention to Epstein and Maxwell. The Trump administration\u2019s refusal to release files and documents related to Epstein as promised has caused a political firestorm for President Donald Trump. The House Oversight Committee has also subpoenaed both Bill and Hillary Clinton as part of its ongoing investigation into Epstein\u2019s network, with depositions scheduled for October.\nMaxwell has found herself at the center of new scrutiny. Following hourslong interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche over two days last month, she was transferred from a prison in Florida to a minimum\u2011security federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas. The move is highly unusual for a convicted sex offender and has prompted sharp criticism and Congress to demand explanations from Justice Department officials.\nTranscripts and audio of those interviews were released by the Justice Department on Friday.\nIn her interview, Maxwell insisted that Bill Clinton never went to Epstein\u2019s island and described his trips on Epstein\u2019s plane as strictly connected to humanitarian projects. She also portrayed herself as a behind-the-scenes supporter in Clinton\u2019s post-presidency, claiming she helped conceive of the Clinton Global Initiative.\nShe told investigators that she had visited the Clintons\u2019 house in Chappaqua, New York, \u201ca few times\u201d as an invited guest and described the former president as a friend.\nMaxwell claimed that she was the one who introduced Clinton to Epstein and suggested that Epstein make his private plane available for Clinton\u2019s travel. \u201cThey met because of me, and the plane was because of me.\u201d\nAn \u2018honored\u2019 commitment partner at CGI\nBy 2012, Band, Clinton\u2019s right-hand aide, had left the former president\u2019s orbit after co-founding the consulting firm Teneo. And in 2013, Maxwell was back at CGI.\nDuring the 2013 luncheon session focusing on oceans, Maxwell was among a group whose commitment to work with CGI was honored during comments by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres, the former president of Costa Rica and co-chair of the Global Ocean Commission.\nFigueres invited those making commitments to rise, saying, \u201cCan we have all of you we are honoring today please stand up so you can be recognized?\u201d\nMaxwell, representing the TerraMar Project, rose to applause alongside other ocean initiative leaders, according to archival video and photos of the segment.\n\u201cIt was rare, prestigious and an honor to be acknowledged the way Ghislaine was at the CGI annual meeting,\u201d a source familiar with the inner workings of CGI told CNN.\nAn archived copy of TerraMar\u2019s \u201ccommitment to action\u201d pledge on the Clinton Foundation\u2019s website notes, \u201cleading the public facing side is Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell, TM\u2019s founder and director.\u201d Being named a \u201cCommitment to Action\u201d partner at CGI was widely regarded as a prestigious affiliation and one that lent credibility to Maxwell and her organization by placing them alongside major global players in philanthropy and policy.\nTerraMar would come to be widely seen as Maxwell\u2019s attempt to rehabilitate her image after her ties to Epstein came under scrutiny.\nMaxwell promoted the project on high-profile stages in 2013 and 2014 \u2014 giving TED Talks, speaking at the United Nations and Council on Foreign Relations, writing blog posts for the Huffington Post, and appearing on outlets such as Bloomberg and CNN International.\nCritics noted the organization produced little tangible conservation work, and its publicly available paperwork shows it gave out no large charitable grants.\nAs late as March 2015, according to the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, the Clinton Foundation was giving updates on TerraMar\u2019s commitment.\nThe TerraMar Project shut down in 2019, shortly after Epstein\u2019s arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges.\nAfter Maxwell was found guilty of sex-trafficking charges in 2021, her lawyers cited her ocean nonprofit work, and alleged she \u201chelp[ed] launch the Clinton Global Initiative\u201d in support of a less severe sentence.\nShe was later sentenced to 20 years in prison.\nA longtime Clinton associate\nMaxwell\u2019s ties to the Clintons extended well beyond CGI events. As far back as 1993, photos show Epstein and Maxwell visiting then-President Clinton at the White House.\nThe New York Post in 2001 reported Maxwell attended a dinner with Bill Clinton at a fancy Manhattan restaurant. In February 2002, Maxwell and Clinton reportedly were seated together at a charity gala. In September 2002, Maxwell accompanied the former president and Epstein on an overseas trip tied to Clinton\u2019s charitable work and was photographed with Clinton outside Epstein\u2019s private plane.\nIn July 2003, she was listed on the host committee for a Clinton Library fundraiser in New York, according to an archived copy reviewed by CNN and New York Post coverage at the time. The Mail on Sunday reported at the time her \u201clikely date\u201d for the event was Epstein.\nIn 2007, Maxwell was listed as co-host for a major fundraiser for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign that occurred at the Capitale event space in New York City, according to information reviewed by CNN. Other reported hosts for the event included Harvey Weinstein, according to the New York Times. Christina Aguilera performed.\nMaxwell donated the maximum $2,300 allowed by law at the time to Clinton\u2019s campaign that year.\nShe also attended a February 2014 small, personal dinner with Bill Clinton in Los Angeles, according to Daily Beast reporting in 2020.\nSpeaking with the Justice Department this summer, Maxwell could not provide a clear memory of the last time met with Clinton, offering only a broad, uncertain range of years and circumstances.\n\u201cIt was in \u2014 was late \u201918 \u2014 2000 and, I don\u2019t know, \u201916, \u201917, \u201918, something \u201919 in \u2013 it was in Los Angeles,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he was hosting something or he was at an event and I was in LA and I had dinner with him.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Em Steck contributed to this story."

Additionally, Chairman Comer issued a subpoena to the U.S. Department of Justice for records related to Epstein. These subpoenas follow recent action by an Oversight Subcommittee, which approved motions to subpoena these records and compel witness testimony.\nOn July 23, 2025, Republicans and Democrats on the Federal Law Enforcement Subcommittee approved by voice vote a motion offered by Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) to direct the Chairman to subpoena Bill and Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Merrick Garland, Robert Mueller, William Barr, Jeff Sessions, and Alberto Gonzales.\nThe Subcommittee also approved an amended motion offered by Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.) by a vote of 8-2 to direct the Chairman to subpoena the Department of Justice to release records related to the Epstein case. Rep. Andy Biggs\u2019 (R-Ariz.) amendment to include the release of all communications between President Biden and/or Biden Administration officials and the Department of Justice related to Jeffrey Epstein was adopted by voice vote.

      "text": "The 1988 Trap: Democrats Are in Danger of Repeating a Painful Lesson\nWhy Democrats Must Work to Avoid Repeating Another Devastating Loss\nA Republican celebrity, once dismissed as a political lightweight, just won an overwhelming second term as President of the United States. He reshaped American politics, demoralized the Democratic Party, scrambled traditional coalitions, and seemed to rise in popularity no matter what.\nThat was 1984.\nRonald Reagan was the man in question. But it could just as easily describe the moment we find ourselves in now with Donald Trump. The parallels are striking, and for Democrats looking to 2028, it serves as a flashing yellow light.\nSince World War II, every time a sitting President could not\u2014or did not\u2014seek re-election, their party lost control of the White House. Except once. The year was 1988, and yes, I was a high school senior. While it was almost 40 years ago, I can\u2019t stop thinking about it (and not just because I still listen to U2\u2019s The Joshua Tree on repeat).\nIf Democrats aren\u2019t careful, we are about to relive one of the most painful and avoidable election outcomes for our party in modern American politics.\nThree Warnings from 1988\nIn 1988, the Reagan revolution was ending. After two terms in the White House and decades in the public eye, Americans signaled fatigue. The Reagan administration was mired in scandal, the economy was struggling, deficits were rising, the stock market was volatile, and the Soviet Union loomed large.\nDemocrats seemed poised to benefit. While not the initial favorite, the eventual Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis, was a competent governor and self-described \u201ctechnocrat.\u201d\nOn first impression, Americans seemed to approve. Dukakis held a steady lead in the early polling, even ballooning to a 17-point lead after the Democratic convention. And many thought that being \u201canti-Reagan/Bush\u201d would be enough to carry him over the finish line.\nBut as the race intensified and the Bush campaign sharpened its attacks, Dukakis struggled to respond\u2014and, most importantly, failed to drive home a compelling vision for the future. Voters soured on him, and George H.W. Bush won in a relative landslide.\nSo why did Dukakis lose a race that many considered inevitable for him to win? Three moments from the campaign tell the story that Democrats should remember as warnings ahead of 2028:\n1. Bush declared, \u201cRead my lips, no new taxes.\u201d\nBush\u2019s famous line was ultimately a policy trap that hurt him in 1992. But in 1988, it worked because it was simple, declarative, and easy to remember. In just six words, he conveyed that he understood voters\u2019 economic struggles and was on their side. Dukakis, by contrast, never found a message that stuck; his campaign cycled through more than half a dozen in the campaign\u2019s final months, none of which resonated with voters.\n2. Dukakis\u2019s infamous tank photo op\nWhile the Dukakis tank photo op has been lampooned for nearly 40 years (and even in the moment, one aide said, Dukakis \u201clooked like an idiot\u201d), the damage with voters went far beyond just looking goofy. He looked weak. Americans want strong leaders. This has been true since George Washington. Their safety and security will always be top of mind, and one of the most basic expectations they have of the government. Strong isn\u2019t reckless, cruel, or intimidating; it\u2019s competent, confident, and decisive. Dukakis could never convey that, and the photo in the tank brought his weakness to life.\n3. Dukakis struggling to answer questions about his wife\u2019s hypothetical murder\nIn front of 67 million viewers, Dukakis\u2019s response to a deeply personal debate question revealed another weakness: an inability to connect emotionally. His detached, almost clinical, and definitely bizarre answer\u2014pivoting to drugs and a \u201chemispheric summit\u201d\u2014left voters questioning whether he had values they could trust. Whether voters agreed with him on the death penalty, his answer gave them no sense of his core values \u2014 or whether he shared theirs.\nFast Forward To 2028\nIn the era of algorithms, influencers, and instant virality, Democrats can\u2019t afford to repeat the mistakes of 1988.\nThe notion that we can just be \u201canti-Trump\u201d or \u201canti-MAGA\u201d and ride a wave of discontent to victory in 2028 is a fantasy. With Democrats at their lowest favorability rating in 35 years (63% unfavorable) and Republicans holding trust advantages on every major economic issue\u2014inflation (+10), tariffs (+7), immigration (+24)\u2014we must prove we are a credible alternative with real answers to the challenges voters care most about.\nThat begins with the economy. Voters need to know, in plain and memorable terms, that Democrats are laser-focused on their pocketbooks and the future of American prosperity. Dukakis had a staff full of brilliant advisors and produced an endless stream of plans, but never offered a clear economic vision that could be repeated and remembered. We can\u2019t make that mistake again\u2014expertise and policy detail are valuable, but they have to be distilled into a simple, powerful message that cuts through the noise. Somewhere, my buddy James Carville is raising his whiskey glass and screaming, \u201cIt\u2019s always the economy, stupid!\u201d\nVoters also want leaders who project strength, competence, and control. The Cold War is over(ish?), but crime, immigration, and public safety remain top of mind. Too often, Democrats avoid these topics for fear of \u201cplaying on Republican turf.\u201d That approach only cedes the ground. Meeting voters where they are, validating their concerns, and offering credible leadership is essential. Pretending problems don\u2019t exist\u2014or burying them in charts and academic plans\u2013will only push swing voters further away.\nEqually important are values. Dukakis\u2019s ramblings when asked if he would support the death penalty for his wife\u2019s hypothetical murder confirmed for many voters that he was culturally out of step. Whether on crime, family, or identity, candidates must hold their values authentically but communicate them with empathy. Voters will accept differences on cultural issues if they believe a candidate truly understands their perspective and is aligned with them on the economy.\nAnd while it will be up to the prospective candidates to make their case to voters, the larger Democratic infrastructure bears responsibility, too. It needs to ensure candidates are positioned to succeed, giving them the tools to navigate what will surely be a contentious and crowded primary.\nWhile there needs to be, and will be, a bigger conversation about how the presidential primary should work, some ideas already out there are worth a closer look:\nDon\u2019t hold primary debates on single, non-economic issues. In 2020, there was a push for the party to sanction debates on individual topics like climate change, reproductive rights, etc. While these issues matter deeply, we have only a few chances to break through in today\u2019s fractured media environment. Those moments should highlight our economic vision. We can\u2019t afford high-profile events\u2013on TV, TikTok, or elsewhere\u2013that distract from the economy.\nWhen debates are sanctioned, be thoughtful about the qualifying criteria. Organizers should avoid creating perverse incentives that push candidates to cater to an activist base in ways that will excite a primary audience but alienate the swing voters we\u2019ll need to win the general election.\nDon\u2019t publicly box candidates into unpopular positions. Third Way, a mainstream Democrat-aligned think tank, has done a lot of research on this, and Democrats would be wise to weigh the risks and benefits before going down that path.\nDon\u2019t split the mainstream vote in the primary. It is hard to ask a candidate who has spent years of their life and sacrificed so much that it is time to throw in the towel. But, if too many mainstream contenders stay in the race, Democrats could end up with an outside the mainstream nominee winning with only a plurality of votes\u2013just like Trump in the 2016 GOP primary. And while Trump went on to win the general election, that\u2019s hardly a playbook Democrats should want to recreate.\nThe point is simple: how we run our primary will shape which Democrat emerges to carry our banner in 2028. If the process produces a nominee who hasn\u2019t been tested on economic vision, on strength, and on values, we\u2019ll be setting ourselves up to lose to Trumpism all over again.\nDukakis\u2019s failure wasn\u2019t just his\u2014it was a system that never forced him to sharpen a simple, memorable economic message. We can\u2019t afford to repeat that mistake. Because in 2028, the opponent won\u2019t be Reagan. It will be Trumpism: darker, more divisive, and more corrosive. And if Democrats once again fail to inspire trust, we already know how this movie ends.\nU2 is the greatest rock band of all time. But when I go to sleep on November 7, 2028, I hope The Joshua Tree is the only thing that reminds me of 1988.\nNow, Before the Midterms: There should be a massive effort to place a billboard on every major highway on the outskirts of every major town in every Red District in the Country identifying by name the U.S. Representative who voted for the Big Ugly Bill listing the eventual damages it will do to its citizens. The same should be done in every State with a Republican Senator up for reelection. Much of the bad stuff will not be apparent to voters until after the midterms; consequently, Democratic Party messaging between now and then is critical! We need to be in Republican Faces Every Day like they are in ours.\nJust listened to your interview on Morning Joe. Claire McCaskill was right\u2014your new Substack should be required reading for every Democratic Party candidate. I\u2019ll go further: it should also be required reading for every local Democratic Town Committee.\nAnd the DNC needs to take it seriously enough to craft and execute a Project 2028 immediately. The opposition already has its playbook in Project 2025. If Democrats want to safeguard democracy and build a future majority, the planning, message discipline, and mobilization must begin now\u2014not later."

      "text": "A \u2018MAHA Box\u2019 Might Be Coming to Your Doorstep\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. appears to have a plan to ship fresh food directly to Americans. Well, sort of a plan.\nListen to more stories on the Noa app.\nMillions of Americans might soon have mail from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The health secretary\u2014who fiercely opposes industrial, ultraprocessed foods\u2014now wants to send people care packages full of farm-fresh alternatives. They will be called \u201cMAHA boxes.\u201d\nFor the most part, MAHA boxes remain a mystery. They are mentioned in a leaked draft of a much-touted report that the Trump administration is set to release about improving children\u2019s health. Reportedly, the 18-page document\u2014which promises studies on the health effects of electromagnetic radiation and changes in how the government regulates sunscreen, among many other things\u2014includes this: \u201cMAHA Boxes: USDA will develop options to get whole, healthy food to SNAP participants.\u201d In plain English, kids on food stamps might be sent veggies.\nThe idea might seem like a throwaway line in a wish list of policies. (Kush Desai, a deputy White House press secretary, told me that the leaked report should be disregarded as \u201cspeculative literature.\u201d) But MAHA boxes are also referenced in the budget request that President Donald Trump sent Congress in May. In that document, MAHA boxes full of \u201ccommodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households\u201d are proposed as an option for elderly Americans who already get free packages of shelf-stable goods from the government. When I asked the Department of Health and Human Services for more information about MAHA boxes, a spokesperson referred me back to the White House; the Department of Agriculture, which runs the food-stamp program, did not respond.\nMAHA boxes are likely to come in some form or another. Some of the packages might end up in the trash. Lots of people, and especially kids, do not enjoy eating carrots and kale. Just 10 percent of U.S. adults are estimated to hit their daily recommended portion of vegetables. But if done correctly, MAHA boxes could do some real good.\nFor years, nutrition experts have been piloting similar programs. A recent study that provided diabetic people with healthy meal kits for a year found that their blood sugar improved, as did their overall diet quality. Another, which provided people with a delivery of fruits and vegetables for 16 weeks, showed that consumption of these products increased by nearly half a serving a day. It makes sense: If healthy food shows up at your door, you\u2019re probably going to eat it. \u201cPretty much any American is going to benefit from a real healthy food box,\u201d Dariush Mozaffarian, the director of the Tufts Food Is Medicine Institute, told me.\nSending people healthy food could be a simple way to deal with one of the biggest reasons why poor Americans don\u2019t eat more fruits and veggies. The food-stamp program, otherwise known as SNAP, provides enrollees with a debit card they can use for food of their choosing\u2014and a significant portion of SNAP dollars goes to unhealthy foods. Research finds that has less to do with people having a sweet tooth than it does the price of a pound of brussels sprouts. Several studies have found that, for food-stamp recipients, price is one of the biggest barriers to eating healthy. Many states already have incentives built into SNAP to encourage consumption of fruits and vegetables. MAHA boxes would be an even more direct nudge.\nMost nutrition experts I spoke with for this story were much more supportive of MAHA boxes being sent to Americans in addition to food stamps than as a replacement for them. Exactly how the care packages would fit into other food-assistance programs isn\u2019t yet clear. Despite its shortcomings, SNAP is very effective at limiting hunger in America. Shipping heavy boxes of produce to the nation\u2019s poor is a much bigger undertaking than putting cash on a debit card.\nThere\u2019s also the question of what exactly these MAHA boxes will include. If the \u201cwhole, healthy food\u201d in each care package includes raw milk and beef tallow\u2014which Kennedy has promoted\u2014that would only worsen American health. (His own eating habits are even more questionable: Kennedy once said that he ate so many tuna sandwiches that he developed mercury poisoning.) In May, after the Trump administration mentioned MAHA boxes in its budget request, a White House spokesperson told CBS News that the packages would be similar to food boxes that the first Trump administration sent during the pandemic in an effort to connect hungry families with food that would otherwise go to waste. According to a letter signed by Trump that was sent to recipients, each box was supposed to come with \u201cnutritious food from our farmers.\u201d News reports at the time suggested that wasn\u2019t always the case. One recipient reportedly was shipped staples such as onions, milk, some fruit, and eggs, along with seven packages of hot dogs and two blocks of processed cheese. Another described their box as \u201ca box full of old food and dairy and hot dogs.\u201d\nThe COVID-era program did eventually deliver some 173 million food boxes. But it was still a failure, Gina Plata-Nino of the Food Research & Action Center, an organization that advocates for people on food-assistance programs, told me. The logistics were such a mess that they prompted a congressional investigation. Nonprofits, which helped distribute the packages, received \u201crotten food and wet or collapsing boxes,\u201d investigators were told. And the setup of the program was apparently so rushed that the government did not bother to check food distributors\u2019 professional references; investigators concluded that a \u201ccompany focused on wedding and event planning without significant food distribution experience\u201d was awarded a $39 million contract to transport perishables to food banks.\nThis time around, the White House doesn\u2019t have to navigate the urgency of a sudden pandemic in its planning. But questions remain about who exactly will be responsible for getting these boxes to millions of Americans around the country. The White House will likely have to partner with companies that have experience shipping perishable items to remote areas of the country. And although the White House budget says that MAHA boxes will replace a program that primarily provides canned foods to seniors through local food banks, it remains to be seen whether these organizations would have the resources to administer a program of this size.\nPerhaps the Trump administration has already thought through all of these potential logistical hurdles. But trouble with executing grand plans to improve American health has been a consistent theme throughout Trump\u2019s tenures in office. In 2020, for example, he pledged to send seniors a $200 discount card to help offset rising drug costs. The cards never came amid questions about the legality of the initiative.\nAmericans do need to change their eating habits if we hope to improve our collective problems of diet-related disease. Getting people excited about the joys of eating fruits and vegetables is laudable. So, too, are some of Kennedy\u2019s other ideas on food, such as getting ultraprocessed foods out of school cafeterias. But Kennedy still hasn\u2019t spelled out how he will deliver on these grand visions. The government hasn\u2019t even defined what an ultraprocessed food is, despite wanting to ban them. The ideas are good, but a good idea is only the first step."

      "text": "Family members of a prominent Jeffrey Epstein accuser said they were \u201coutraged\u201d by the Justice Department\u2019s decision to release transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s testimony last month to a federal prosecutor, arguing it provided Maxwell a \u201cplatform to rewrite history.\u201d\n\u201cThe content of these transcripts is in direct contradiction with felon Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s conviction for child sex trafficking,\u201d the family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre said in a statement. The family added, \u201cThis travesty of justice entirely invalidates the experiences of the many brave survivors who put their safety, security, and lives on the line to ensure her conviction, including our sister.\u201d\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last month questioned Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence on sex trafficking charges, for two days as part of a stated effort by the Trump administration to uncover more information about Epstein\u2019s crimes.\nThe Justice Department on Friday released audio and transcripts of the two-day interview, during which Maxwell disputed several allegations of wrongdoing against her and Epstein, including by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.\nGiuffre accused Maxwell of grooming her to be sexually abused by Epstein and trafficked to several of his powerful friends, including Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Giuffre separately sued Andrew in 2021 alleging he sexually abused her as a minor, which he has denied. The two later settled the case for an undisclosed amount in 2022.\nDuring the interview last month with Blanche, Maxwell said Giuffre\u2019s allegation against Andrew \u201cdoesn\u2019t hold water,\u201d and disputed key facts in the case, including an alleged photo of Giuffre with Andrew.\n\u201cI believe that this whole thing was manufactured, and I can point you to some potentially corroborating evidence of this,\u201d Maxwell told Blanche.\nGiuffre\u2019s family accused the deputy attorney general of not sufficiently challenging Maxwell\u2019s assertions during her testimony, suggesting that by publicly releasing the interview, the Justice Department provided Maxwell the opportunity to dispute her case in the court of public opinion.\n\u201cDuring [Deputy Attorney General] Todd Blanche\u2019s bizarre interview, she is never challenged about her court-proven lies, providing her a platform to rewrite history,\u201d the family statement read.\nMaxwell also said she never witnessed any inappropriate conduct from any man, including Donald Trump. She denied the existence of an incriminating \u201cclient list\u201d of individuals who benefited from Epstein\u2019s crimes and maintained her innocence after being convicted of sex trafficking in 2021.\nOn Sunday, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., criticized Maxwell\u2019s statements to Blanche, claiming that she has the motivation to say anything that could potentially get her pardoned.\n\u201cThey go and they do this interview without the presence of a prosecutor who actually knows the facts,\u201d Schiff told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d referring to Blanche.\n\u201cShe wants a pardon. She says exactly what her lawyers tell her is going to be necessary to get a pardon. No one should be surprised here,\u201d Schiff added.\nIn a statement, Maxwell's attorney David Oscar Markus called Schiff \"flat-out wrong.\"\n\"Ghislaine Maxwell has been consistent from day one, and her testimony is backed by documents \u2014 not politics. If she wanted to make up stories to curry favor, she could have targeted Democrats like President Clinton. She didn\u2019t because she\u2019s telling the truth. The good Congressman may fancy himself a mind reader, but on this he\u2019s flat-out wrong,\" Markus said.\nGiuffre\u2019s family has for months been critical of the Justice Department\u2019s interactions with Maxwell amid the Trump administration\u2019s claimed push to uncover more information about Epstein\u2019s crimes, a key topic of interest among Trump\u2019s base.\nIn late July, after Maxwell met with Blanche, the family urged the government not to provide Maxwell any favorable treatment, describing her then as a \u201cmonster who deserves to rot in prison for the rest of her life.\u201d\nTrump has not ruled out the idea of pardoning Maxwell, whom he has known for several decades. When asked last month about the prospect of granting Maxwell legal relief, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m allowed to do it, but it\u2019s something I have not thought about.\u201d\nAbsent a pardon from Trump, Maxwell is seeking legal relief from the Supreme Court, which has indicated it will decide whether to review Maxwell\u2019s appeal of her conviction during a private conference in September.\nGiuffre\u2019s family also condemned the Justice Department\u2019s decision to transfer Maxwell to a minimum-security prison following her meeting with Blanche.\n\u201cBy moving convicted felon Maxwell to a minimum-security, country club prison, the DOJ sends a disturbing message that child sex trafficking is acceptable and will be rewarded,\u201d the family said Saturday in a statement.\nFederal officials moved Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s co-conspirator and confidant, from a co-ed, low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to a women-only, minimum-security facility in Bryan, Texas. The Bureau of Prisons at the time did not specify why Maxwell was transferred to the facility, which also houses reality television star Jen Shah and disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.\nThe release of the Maxwell transcripts came as the Justice Department also partially fulfilled a subpoena by the House Oversight Committee for all files related to the federal investigation of Epstein. The Justice Department released roughly 33,000 documents, however Democrats on the committee have said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the records included in the first batch were already public."

      "text": "Jeffrey Epstein files: Tracing the legal cases that led to sex-trafficking charges\nNearly six years after Jeffrey Epstein's death in federal custody, speculation abounds over what information might be in transcripts and other documents related to investigations of the wealthy financier who was a convicted sex offender and accused of sex trafficking young women and girls as young as 14.\nThe Trump administration is under increasing pressure to release \"the Epstein files\" \u2014 a call that President Trump has sometimes joined, even as his own ties to Epstein come under renewed scrutiny.\nIn a process spanning decades, criminal cases against Epstein culminated in charges that he operated a sex-trafficking ring preying on young women and underage girls. Prosecutors say he was aided by Ghislaine Maxwell, his long-time associate who is currently in prison.\nBut while thousands of pages of depositions and other legal documents have been filed \u2014 and some have been released \u2014 public calls have grown for a release of all the files.\nInterest in the case has persisted along with the perception that Epstein used his wealth and elite status \u2014 hosting powerful people on private jets and socializing in Palm Beach, Fla., New York, London and a Caribbean island \u2014 not only to commit heinous crimes, but to avoid responsibility for them.\nHere's a brief timeline of the legal cases against Epstein:\n2005\nMarch: Police open a criminal investigation into Epstein in Palm Beach, Fla., after a 14-year-old girl's parents say he paid her for a massage.\nPolice gather more allegations from underage girls who say he sexually abused them at his mansion, in encounters that often began as massages. Federal prosecutors later say the abuse began as early as 2002.\n2006\nJuly 19: A Palm Beach County grand jury indicts Epstein on one state felony charge of solicitation of prostitution. But the Palm Beach Police Department's chief and lead detective then refer the case to a nearby FBI office, saying the charge doesn't reflect \"the totality of Epstein's conduct,\" according to the Justice Department's review of the case.\n2007\nMay: An assistant U.S. attorney \u2014 who has been working with two FBI agents to find more victims \u2014 submits a draft indictment outlining 60 criminal counts against Epstein, along with a memo summarizing the evidence assembled against him.\nJuly: Epstein's attorneys meet with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida. The top prosecutor was then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta (who in 2017 would become President Trump's Labor Secretary). The U.S. Attorney's Office offers to end its investigation if Epstein pleads guilty to two state charges and agrees to accept a prison term, register as a sexual offender, and set up a way for his victims to obtain monetary damages.\nThe much-criticized deal includes a controversial nonprosecution agreement, or NPA, in which the federal prosecutor's office grants immunity to Epstein, four co-conspirators, and \"any potential co-conspirators,\" the Justice Department says. Prosecutors agree not to tell Epstein's victims about the NPA, which is filed under seal.\n2008\nJune 30: Epstein pleads guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18 \u2014 and is sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security facility.\nBut the wealthy businessman is allowed to leave for 12 hours a day to work at a foundation that he had recently incorporated, according to the Justice Department.\nJuly 7: A victim identified as \"Jane Doe\" files a federal lawsuit under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, saying she and other victims were not informed that the Epstein case was being resolved with a plea deal. In 2019, a judge ruled in their favor.\n2009\nJuly 22: Epstein is released after serving less than 13 months.\nSeptember: Two years after the nonprosecution deal was signed, a Florida judge orders that the document giving Epstein federal immunity should be made public, in response to lawsuits from Epstein's victims and news outlets.\n2010\nEpstein has settled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by his victims.\n2015\nSept. 21: Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre sues longtime Epstein confidante and associate Ghislaine Maxwell for defamation, after Maxwell called her a liar for claiming to be a victim of a sexual conspiracy run by Maxwell and Epstein. (In 2021, Maxwell was found guilty of helping Epstein operate a sex-trafficking ring that preyed on teens and young women and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.)\n2017\nMay: Maxwell settles Giuffre's lawsuit, a matter in which Epstein had repeatedly sought to avoid testifying. But journalist Julie K. Brown and the Miami Herald later file motions to unseal records from the case, citing the public right of access and its coverage of the abuse of \"dozens of underage minors.\"\n2018\nNov. 28: The Miami Herald publishes a series of investigative reports into Epstein and the role of then-U.S. Attorney Acosta in Epstein's plea deal. The reports spark intense interest in Epstein's actions, including the notion that powerful people might have known about or been involved in his illegal actions.\nDec. 4: A week after the Herald report, Epstein reaches a last-minute settlement in a defamation case with attorney Bradley Edwards, who represented women alleging that Epstein abused them when they were minors. The settlement puts an end to a case that had been anticipated to bring court testimony from Epstein's victims for the first time.\n2019\nJuly 6: Federal agents arrest Epstein. He is charged in the Southern District Court of New York with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.\nJuly 12: Acosta resigns as labor secretary, saying the Epstein matter is a distraction from his agency's work.\nAug. 10: Epstein is found dead in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the federal detention facility where he was being held in Manhattan. The New York City chief medical examiner later concludes that Epstein died by suicide.\nAug. 27: U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman holds a hearing on a motion to dismiss the indictment against Epstein. In a remarkable move, he also says the court will hear \"the testimony of victims here today\" \u2014 an offer taken up by many women that day, under their own names or as \"Jane Doe.\"\nCourtney Wild, who had helped start the first proceedings against Epstein in Florida more than 10 years earlier, is among those who step forward.\n\"Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health,\" she said. \"Jeffrey Epstein has done nothing but manipulate our justice system, where he has never been held accountable for his actions, even to this day.\""

  "argos_summary": "The article chronicles the Trump administration\u2019s stalled efforts to release and investigate the Jeffrey Epstein files, highlighting the DOJ\u2019s failed attempts to obtain grand jury transcripts, the release of a largely uninformative Maxwell interview, and the House Oversight Committee\u2019s ongoing subpoenas. Public opinion remains skeptical, with many Americans believing the administration is hiding information and that Trump may be implicated. The piece also notes the broader political fallout, including congressional investigations, court rulings, and the administration\u2019s broader use of federal resources for immigration enforcement and other controversial policies. Overall, the narrative portrays a perception of political maneuvering and a lack of substantive transparency regarding Epstein\u2019s case. ",
