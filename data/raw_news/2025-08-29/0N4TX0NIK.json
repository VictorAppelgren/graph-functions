      "text": "ZenaTech (ZENA) announces the formation of its new Quantum Computing Division. The new division will focus on development of R&D initiatives that harness the next generation of computing power to solve very complex challenges in modern defense and autonomous drone systems that can utilize ZenaDrone\u2019s drone solutions. The US Department of Defense, along with other federal agencies, has called for advancements in quantum-resistant communications, post-quantum cybersecurity, and quantum sensing for drone navigation in GPS-denied environments to ensure US defence and aerospace superiority. In line with these priorities, ZenaTech\u2019s Quantum Computing Division will focus on the development of both hardware and software quantum innovations for use cases such as encryption and secure communications for mission-critical operations, enhanced navigation without GPS, and AI drone fleet optimization for a variety of ISR defense applications. The current 12-person quantum team will grow to 20 by year-end consisting of a multidisciplinary team of AI and machine learning experts, quantum hardware researchers, computational scientists, and professionals in physics, computer science, engineering, and systems design. ZenaTech\u2019s Quantum Computing Division will also further two existing Quantum R&D projects. The Sky Traffic project is focused on the use of AI-enabled drones and quantum computing to optimize traffic flows and support public safety for government applications. The Clear Sky project is focused on leveraging AI drone swarms and quantum computing to improve localized weather forecasts and extreme weather predictions, helping save lives and reduce economic losses.\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\n- Take advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off!

      "text": "ZenaTech (ZENA) signed an offer to acquire a Florida-based FAA-certified flight school that trains professional pilots for FAA Part 61 certification to be qualified as an airplane pilot and also for complex BVLOS drone pilot operations. Upon completion, the acquisition will enable the company to build an internal team of Part 61-certified pilots and be positioned as drone regulations evolve and opportunities grow in the DaaS, government, and defense markets, including military contracts that mandate a Part 61 pilot-in-command. Today, the most common commercial drone pilot credential is Part 107, like a drone \u201cdrivers\u2019 licence\u201d but without a flight test, it is obtained with only a written test and a few weeks of study. However, there are waivered or special flights that require additional pilot qualifications, such as when operating in restricted airspace, when coordination with air traffic control is required, and for complex BVLOS operations involving longer distances, higher risk, heavier payloads, or more challenging airspace. Some big government or military drone jobs especially ones where the drone flies far beyond the pilot\u2019s view or in special, restricted airspace, require the person in charge of flying to be a licensed manned-aircraft pilot. This is often because the work is complex, involves high-risk areas, or needs close coordination with air traffic control, just like regular airplanes. The FAA is moving toward a new system and drone rules where companies get a standing license to run BVLOS such as for specialized cargo drones, but they must prove they have the right people, training, aircraft, and procedures in place. Pilots will likely need extra BVLOS-specific credentials and larger drones may push the FAA to require Part 61-level training for the people in command.\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\n- Take advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off!

Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\nMatthew Galinko has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that highlight ZenaTech, Inc.\u2019s strategic positioning and growth potential. The company has demonstrated significant revenue growth, particularly in its Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) segment, which has been bolstered by a series of strategic acquisitions of land survey engineering firms. This approach not only enhances ZenaTech\u2019s operational capabilities but also positions it uniquely in the market as it builds a comprehensive DaaS platform.\nFurthermore, ZenaTech is poised to benefit from increasing demand for drone technology in defense and commercial sectors, supported by more favorable regulatory conditions. Despite a wider adjusted EBITDA loss due to increased spending on scaling operations, the company\u2019s robust balance sheet and access to revolving credit provide financial stability. Galinko\u2019s confidence is further reflected in the maintained price target of $9.00, based on a 10-year discounted cash flow analysis, underscoring the long-term growth prospects of ZenaTech.\nAccording to TipRanks, Galinko is a 4-star analyst with an average return of 8.5% and a 37.74% success rate. Galinko covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Ondas Holdings, Adeia, and Unisys."
