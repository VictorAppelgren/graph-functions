  "content": "MADRID \u2014 Real Madrid said it \u201cfirmly rejects\u201d having a regular-season Spanish league game played in the United States and warned of \u201ca turning point in the world of football.\u201d\n\nVillarreal, in contrast, is promising free travel and tickets for season-ticket holders if its match against Barcelona in Miami is approved in what would be a first for the league. The 17th-round match in La Liga would be played at the Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nMadrid said Tuesday it has taken action to keep the Dec. 20 match from happening in the U.S., claiming it would hurt the \u201cintegrity of the competition\u201d and the \u201clegitimacy of the results.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe measure, which was taken without prior information or consultation of the clubs participating in the competition, infringes the essential principle of territorial reciprocity, which applies in two-legged league competitions (one match at home and the other at the home of the opposing team), upsetting the competitive balance and giving an undue sporting advantage to the applicant clubs,\u201d Madrid said.\n\nThe club said the match would set \u201can unacceptable precedent that opens the door to exceptions based on non-sporting interests, clearly affecting sporting integrity and risking the adulteration of the competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this proposal were to be carried out, its consequences would be so serious that it would be a turning point in the world of football,\u201d Madrid said.\n\nThe Italian soccer federation said in July that a plan was in motion to play the Serie A match between AC Milan and Como in the Australian city of Perth in February.\n\nMadrid said it has asked FIFA, UEFA and Spain\u2019s top sports body to not authorize the game in the U.S.\n\nMadrid and Spanish league President Javier Tebas have often been at odds on various issues.\n\nVillarreal earlier Tuesday said its season ticket-holders can travel for free and receive free tickets for the match. It said those who don\u2019t want to go, or can\u2019t go, will get a 20% discount on their season tickets.\n\nStaging a match abroad has long been part of the league\u2019s goal to promote soccer and its brand in other countries.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether it would be Villarreal or the league paying for the travel and tickets for the club\u2019s fans this time.\n\nThe attempts to play in the U.S. are part of the league\u2019s long-term partnership with sports and entertainment group Relevent Sports, which is part of Stephen Ross\u2019 portfolio of companies including Hard Rock Stadium, the Miami Dolphins, the Formula One\u2019s Miami Grand Prix and the Miami Open tennis tournament.\n\nIt has become routine for U.S. pro sports leagues to stage games in Europe, Asia and South America that help build their brands and fan bases.",
