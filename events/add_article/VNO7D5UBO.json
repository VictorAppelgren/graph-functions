      "summary": "The article argues that the Federal Reserve is constrained by fiscal dominance from the Trump administration, creating a stagflation scenario where high inflation and low growth coexist. It claims that the Fed’s rate hikes are limited by the need to service a ballooning debt, while Trump seeks cuts to spur growth, potentially undermining the dollar. The piece warns of an imminent financial system bust driven by asset bubbles and fiscal mismanagement, suggesting the Fed may be setting Trump up as a scapegoat. It also critiques the Phillips curve and Keynesian models as inadequate for today’s economic conditions.",
