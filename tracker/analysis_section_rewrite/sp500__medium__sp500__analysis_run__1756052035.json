      "feedback": "Strong scaffold and horizon alignment, but tighten the causal logic, quantify the core bets, and enforce strict source‑anchoring. Actionable edits in one pass: (1) Replace the current narrative weave with a formal 3–6 month scenario map: Base Case (core thesis on quality/defensives driving leadership), Alt 1 (clear small‑cap rotation if IPO cadence and earnings quality improve), Alt 2 (persistent mega‑cap AI leadership with narrow breadth and higher dispersion). For each, state a one‑line thesis, 1–2 concrete catalysts, and a concrete invalidation (e.g., Alt 1 invalidated if IPOs fail to materialize or Russell 2000 underperforms over 2–3 straight months). (2) Tie triggers/invalidations to explicit timing windows and data: IPO cadence (95 deals in 2025 and $12.9B raised as a near‑term flow signal from Q7VVGNSQE); small‑cap breadth/earnings signals (Russell 2000 valuation gap vs. S&P, also from Q7VVGNSQE); macro/defensive tilt signals from IUSV XLV factor inputs (quality/low volatility scores) per 4661GWFP7 and 2YP1X9B4T. Add named thresholds (e.g., if 3‑month relative performance IUSV/XLV vs. S&P moves >X%). (3) Quantify exposures and link to scenariams: propose target weights (e.g., core 40–60% IUSV/XLV/PG/AXP/TXN/XOM/HON; ballast 20–30% cash/short hedges) and describe path‑dependence if flows accelerate or reverse. (4) Strengthen first‑principles grounding: couple cash‑flow durability, dividend growth, and balance‑sheet quality (cite PG, AXP, TXN, XOM, HON from YX2J8NHZ1) with a crisp risk of multiple expansion/valuation rerating under a low‑growth regime. (5) Increase numeric rigor: quote the IPO cadence (95 deals, $12.9B) and the 3–4 line metrics for XLV/IUSV (quality/low‑vol metrics) and the Motley Fool dividend list as anchor points, not as afterthoughts; avoid vague labels. (6) Citation discipline: attach the source IDs after every factual assertion tied to them (U3ZK13ZQI for Disney, 4661GWFP7 for IUSV, 2YP1X9B4T for XLV, YX2J8NHZ1 for dividend names, Q7VVGNSQE for Russell 2000 IPO/data) and reconcile any conflicts by stating where views converge/diverge (e.g., dividend‑tilt strength vs small‑cap breadth). (7) Trim and sharpen the prose to remove tangents (Disney example is useful but should be a micro‑catalyst tied to consumer behavior and monetization discipline rather than a stand‑alone theme). (8) End with a clean, labeled section: Base Case, Alt 1, Alt 2, Risks, Watch‑list signals, and Confidence, each with one‑line thesis and 1–2 data points. (9) Consider a short appendix of factor scores from the ETF reports (IUSV XLV) to quantify “quality/low volatility” vs. “growth/dividend” exposures. (10) Explicitly acknowledge potential conflicts (e.g., small‑cap upside versus AI megacap concentration) and explain how they are hedged or mitigated within the proposed weights. This will elevate depth, precision, and testability while meeting the SECTION FOCUS requirements. (Cited: U3ZK13ZQI; 4661GWFP7; 2YP1X9B4T; Q7VVGNSQE; YX2J8NHZ1)",
