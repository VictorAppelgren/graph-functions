  "description": "In this rally's case, a rising tide did indeed lift all boats.",
  "content": "Cryptocurrency markets skyrocketed into new territory Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that interest rate reductions could be imminent, pushing the Dow to its first 800-point plus gain this year. That ended the Dow\u2019s longest streak without a new high since Dec. 4, 2024, according to Dow Jones Market Data, and signaled a major surge of optimism at the prospect of some economic policy relief.\n\nCryptos were major stars of that rally.\n\nEthereum (ETH) climbed over 15% to reach a new all-time high of $4,885, surpassing its previous record from November 2021, while Solana (SOL) swung between 8% to 12.5% in a 24-hour period, nudging just past the longtime \u201cpsychological\u201d mark of $200 for a high of $201.94. Bitcoin (BTC) lovers also had their moment when it approached $70,000.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies and stocks soared, the probability of a September Fed rate cut jumped to 90% following the speech, Reuters reports.\n\nSo why all the enthusiasm?\n\nSimply put: When the market feels more secure, it invests in places considered riskier bets. Cryptocurrencies and other fintechs that are part of emerging technology sit squarely in those crosshairs.\n\nThis time it appears institutional investors led the charge as they look for investments that can balance out a shaky U.S. dollar, general volatility and risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a relief rally,\u201d Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cMarkets had anticipated more angst.\u201d\n\nThe optimism from the market is a sign monetary easing is a reversal of that angst, and could be a change in fortune for the sector, which has whipsawed in recent trading, said Steve Lee, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital and investor in BlockTower Capital.\n\n\u201cI see this as constructive in the short term, and it may help reverse this week\u2019s sell-off. The key question is whether this momentum holds beyond the low-liquidity weekend. Since BTC and ETH price action is increasingly institutionally driven, spot ETF flows today and Monday will be a strong indicator of whether we are set for another leg higher,\u201d Lee told CoinDesk.\n\nWhat did Powell say?\n\nAs usual, Powell got straight to the point during his Wyoming speech on Friday.\n\n\u201cDownside risks to employment are rising,\u201d Powell said at the Jackson Hole Symposium. \u201cAnd if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\u201d\n\nPowell also said recent policy moves from the Trump administration could affect inflation.\n\n\u201cWith policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\u201d he said, adding that tariffs could push inflation higher, at least temporarily. \u201cA reasonable base case is that the effects will be relatively short lived, a one-time shift in the price level.\u201d\n\nYou can read Powell\u2019s entire speech here.\n\nSo how high did we go?\n\nIn this rally\u2019s case, a rising tide did indeed lift all boats.\n\nThe broader S&P 500 also saw strong gains, rising 1.5%, its best performance since May, and equities were a bright spot on the NASDAQ Composite, which advanced 1.9%.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, the index used by Wall Street to gauge how frightened investors might be, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) plummeting more than 14% to its lowest level this year. The VIX is a favorite of trading pros and shows how turbulent the market feels.\n\nThose gains across the board are an encouraging sign for both the buyside and the sellside, experts said.\n\n\u201cCorrelations between cryptos and equities are high, and we see a market mood that will be highly sensitive to this week\u2019s comments from the Jackson Hole meeting of monetary authorities, as well as from any reactions from fiscal authorities,\u201d wrote Manuel Villegas, an analyst at Julius Baer, in a research note.\n\nWhile nothing is a given once the opening bell rings, some analysts are already predicting which companies they think will continue to do well.\n\nAnalysts at Monarq Asset Management told CoinDesk that there\u2019s still more room for Ethereum to grow, and that they expect to see the coin top $5,000 in near-term trade.\n\n\u201cWe maintain our overall bullish stance. Market internals remain constructive, with few signs of overheating and, as you point out, a clear path to new all-time highs in both BTC and ETH,\u201d Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management\u2019s Directional Fund, told CoinDesk.\n\n\u201cOur house view is that Powell\u2019s dovish pivot has cleared the way for $5,000+ in the near term, also not the hardest call to make,\u201d Gaer said. \u201cDemand from treasury vehicles should increase into the fall as many of the deals announced this summer close or de-SPAC, in addition to ongoing institutional and retail inflows.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s rally was a perfect example of how sensitive global markets are to Fed policy, particularly after a long period of no rate cuts. Analysts, traders and every other player in finance have been attempting to read Powell\u2019s tea leaves for years with only moderate success, and even a major rally like Friday\u2019s can\u2019t fortify a very fragile market.\n\nWhile know one can be entirely certain what Powell and the Fed will do next week, market watchers across the board are bullish on the move. \u201cThe Fed isn\u2019t going to be the party-pooper,\u201d Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, told the WSJ.\n\nHow much that rate cut might matter in the long run remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still doubtful that a September cut points to a prolonged interest rate cutting cycle. Risks to inflation are real and coming from many angles,\u201d Lauren Goodwin, economist and chief market strategist at New York Life Investments, wrote in a Friday note.",

That has prompted asset managers to call for new all-time highs for bitcoin\nWhat Powell said?\nIn one of his most important speeches, Powell suggested that the labor market could benefit from lower borrowing costs, having held the benchmark interest rate steady at 4.25% for eight months.\n\u201cDownside risks to employment are rising,\u201d Powell said in prepared remarks for his keynote speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium, adding that the possibility of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs having only a short-lived effect on inflation is \u201creasonable.\u201d\n\u201cWith policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\u201d he noted.\nCryptocurrencies and stocks soared, and the probability of the September Fed rate cut jumped to 90% following the speech. Most analysts expect the momentum to continue in the days ahead.\nAnalysts see new highs for BTC and ETH above $5K\nAnalysts at Monarq Asset Management anticipate that ether's price will rise above $5,000 in the coming days.\n\"We maintain our overall bullish stance. Market internals remain constructive, with few signs of overheating and, as you point out, a clear path to new all-time highs in both BTC and ETH,\" Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management's Directional Fund, told CoinDesk.\n\"Our house view is that Powell\u2019s dovish pivot has cleared the way for $5,000+ in the near term (also not the hardest call to make). Demand from treasury vehicles should increase into the fall as many of the deals announced this summer close or de-SPAC, in addition to ongoing institutional and retail inflows,\" Gaer added.\nEthereum's native token ether has already gained nearly 10% in 24 hours, hitting record highs above $4,800. As of writing, it changed hands at $4,700, according to CoinDesk data. Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin traded near $115,600, slightly down from the overnight high of $117,400.\nData from Deribit-listed options shows that ether's rally has sparked renewed demand for upside bets, or call options. At press time, risk reversals were positive across all tenors, implying relative richness of calls. The sentiment wasn't so bullish in BTC options.\nGaer stated that over-the-counter desks and market makers are experiencing stronger demand for ETH compared to BTC, suggesting that ether may outperform ahead.\nThat said, BTC looked strong on its own too. \"The BTC pullback from ATH was ~9.6%\u2014far less than earlier drawdowns this year\u2014indicating strong demand, as evidenced by whale wallet accumulation around the $113k level,\" Gaer said.\nSpencer Yang, managing partner at BlockSpaceForce, a crypto treasury advisory firm, said more rate cuts could happen after September, ensuring the momentum extends well into the year-end.\n\"We\u2019re now fully expecting rate cuts to happen in September. It will be the first cut since Trump became President this year. This is significant, and many more will come,\" Yang said, calling new highs in the crypto market.\n\"The major 5 that we pay attention to: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, LINK. These will do well given the various parts of the crypto industry they impact,\" Yang added.\nFocus on ETF flows\nSteve Lee, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital and investor in BlockTower Capital, called Powell's dovish turn a short-term constructive development for cryptocurrencies while stressing the importance of continued inflows into bitcoin and ether spot ETFs.\n\"I see this as constructive in the short term, and it may help reverse this week\u2019s sell-off. The key question is whether this momentum holds beyond the low-liquidity weekend. Since BTC and ETH price action is increasingly institutionally driven, spot ETF flows today and Monday will be a strong indicator of whether we are set for another leg higher,\" Lee told CoinDesk.\nLee highlighted Base, Monad, Story, and SUI as key projects of interest that he is closely monitoring in his capacity as an early-stage venture capitalist.\nGaer, meanwhile, favored Solana and the SOL ecosystem, including high-beta SOL tokens such as JITO and JUP. Raydium and PUMP on both a \"fundamental and forward-demand basis.\"\nPotential headwinds\nWhile Powell\u2019s dovish stance has set the stage for a rally, traders should remain cautious about potential pitfalls from corporate treasury cryptocurrency adoption and volatility in equity markets.\n\"Digital asset treasuries (DAT) are an innovative vehicle for public market investors to gain exposure to the digital asset space. However, we have started to see the quality of DAT deals \u2013 from banking relationships, compliance, management team, and deal structure perspectives \u2014 dropping, which shows early signs of a 'bubble,\" Lee said.\nNaqsdaq-listed Strategy started this trend of corporate BTC adoption in 2020. Since then, more than 100 publicly-listed firms have accumulated a total of 984,971 BTC, according to data source Bitcoin Treasuries.\n\"The trend may continue, but it is obvious that the risks associated with this are not ignorable,\" Lee added.\nGaer called for closely tracking risks from an overheated equity market and \"potential for macro or geopolitical shocks.\"\nOmkar Godbole\nOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor and analyst on CoinDesk's Markets team.

      "text": "August 22, 2025\nMonetary Policy and the Fed\u2019s Framework Review\nChair Jerome H. Powell\nAt \u201cLabor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy,\u201d an economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming\nOver the course of this year, the U.S. economy has shown resilience in a context of sweeping changes in economic policy. In terms of the Fed's dual-mandate goals, the labor market remains near maximum employment, and inflation, though still somewhat elevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. At the same time, the balance of risks appears to be shifting.\nIn my remarks today, I will first address the current economic situation and the near-term outlook for monetary policy. I will then turn to the results of our second public review of our monetary policy framework, as captured in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we released today.\nCurrent Economic Conditions and Near-Term Outlook\nWhen I appeared at this podium one year ago, the economy was at an inflection point. Our policy rate had stood at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for more than a year. That restrictive policy stance was appropriate to help bring down inflation and to foster a sustainable balance between aggregate demand and supply. Inflation had moved much closer to our objective, and the labor market had cooled from its formerly overheated state. Upside risks to inflation had diminished. But the unemployment rate had increased by almost a full percentage point, a development that historically has not occurred outside of recessions.1 Over the subsequent three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, we recalibrated our policy stance, setting the stage for the labor market to remain in balance near maximum employment over the past year (figure 1).\nThis year, the economy has faced new challenges. Significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are remaking the global trading system. Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth. Over the longer run, changes in tax, spending, and regulatory policies may also have important implications for economic growth and productivity. There is significant uncertainty about where all of these polices will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be.\nChanges in trade and immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply. In this environment, distinguishing cyclical developments from trend, or structural, developments is difficult. This distinction is critical because monetary policy can work to stabilize cyclical fluctuations but can do little to alter structural changes.\nThe labor market is a case in point. The July employment report released earlier this month showed that payroll job growth slowed to an average pace of only 35,000 per month over the past three months, down from 168,000 per month during 2024 (figure 2).2 This slowdown is much larger than assessed just a month ago, as the earlier figures for May and June were revised down substantially.3 But it does not appear that the slowdown in job growth has opened up a large margin of slack in the labor market\u2014an outcome we want to avoid. The unemployment rate, while edging up in July, stands at a historically low level of 4.2 percent and has been broadly stable over the past year. Other indicators of labor market conditions are also little changed or have softened only modestly, including quits, layoffs, the ratio of vacancies to unemployment, and nominal wage growth. Labor supply has softened in line with demand, sharply lowering the \"breakeven\" rate of job creation needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. Indeed, labor force growth has slowed considerably this year with the sharp falloff in immigration, and the labor force participation rate has edged down in recent months.\nOverall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\nAt the same time, GDP growth has slowed notably in the first half of this year to a pace of 1.2 percent, roughly half the 2.5 percent pace in 2024 (figure 3). The decline in growth has largely reflected a slowdown in consumer spending. As with the labor market, some of the slowing in GDP likely reflects slower growth of supply or potential output.\nTurning to inflation, higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods. Estimates based on the latest available data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in July. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent, above their level a year ago. Within core, prices of goods increased 1.1 percent over the past 12 months, a notable shift from the modest decline seen over the course of 2024. In contrast, housing services inflation remains on a downward trend, and nonhousing services inflation is still running at a level a bit above what has been historically consistent with 2 percent inflation (figure 4).4\nThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether these price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem. A reasonable base case is that the effects will be relatively short lived\u2014a one-time shift in the price level. Of course, \"one-time\" does not mean \"all at once.\" It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks. Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\nIt is also possible, however, that the upward pressure on prices from tariffs could spur a more lasting inflation dynamic, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. One possibility is that workers, who see their real incomes decline because of higher prices, demand and get higher wages from employers, setting off adverse wage\u2013price dynamics. Given that the labor market is not particularly tight and faces increasing downside risks, that outcome does not seem likely.\nAnother possibility is that inflation expectations could move up, dragging actual inflation with them. Inflation has been above our target for more than four years and remains a prominent concern for households and businesses. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations, however, as reflected in market- and survey-based measures, appear to remain well anchored and consistent with our longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent.\nOf course, we cannot take the stability of inflation expectations for granted. Come what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem.\nPutting the pieces together, what are the implications for monetary policy? In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment to the downside\u2014a challenging situation. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. Our policy rate is now 100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance. Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\nMonetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach.\nEvolution of Monetary Policy Framework\nTurning to my second topic, our monetary policy framework is built on the unchanging foundation of our mandate from Congress to foster maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We remain fully committed to fulfilling our statutory mandate, and the revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions. Our revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we refer to as our consensus statement, describes how we pursue our dual-mandate goals. It is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy, and that understanding is important both for transparency and accountability, and for making monetary policy more effective.\nThe changes we made in this review are a natural progression, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. We continue to build upon the initial consensus statement adopted in 2012 under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. Today's revised statement is the outcome of the second public review of our framework, which we conduct at five-year intervals. This year's review included three elements: Fed Listens events at Reserve Banks around the country, a flagship research conference, and policymaker discussions and deliberations, supported by staff analysis, at a series of FOMC meetings.5\nIn approaching this year's review, a key objective has been to make sure that our framework is suitable across a broad range of economic conditions. At the same time, the framework needs to evolve with changes in the structure of the economy and our understanding of those changes. The Great Depression presented different challenges from those of the Great Inflation and the Great Moderation, which in turn are different from the ones we face today.6\nAt the time of the last review, we were living in a new normal, characterized by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound (ELB), along with low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve\u2014meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy.7 To me, a statistic that captures that era is that our policy rate was stuck at the ELB for seven long years following the onset of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in late 2008. Many here will recall the sluggish growth and painfully slow recovery of that era. It appeared highly likely that if the economy experienced even a mild downturn, our policy rate would be back at the ELB very quickly, probably for another extended period. Inflation and inflation expectations could then decline in a weak economy, raising real interest rates as nominal rates were pinned near zero. Higher real rates would further weigh on job growth and reinforce the downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations, triggering an adverse dynamic.\nThe economic conditions that brought the policy rate to the ELB and drove the 2020 framework changes were thought to be rooted in slow-moving global factors that would persist for an extended period\u2014and might well have done so, if not for the pandemic.8 The 2020 consensus statement included several features that addressed the ELB-related risks that had become increasingly prominent over the preceding two decades. We emphasized the importance of anchored longer-term inflation expectations to support both our price-stability and maximum-employment goals. Drawing on an extensive literature on strategies to mitigate risks associated with the ELB, we adopted flexible average inflation targeting\u2014a \"makeup\" strategy to ensure that inflation expectations would remain well anchored even with the ELB constraint.9 In particular, we said that, following periods when inflation had been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\nIn the event, rather than low inflation and the ELB, the post-pandemic reopening brought the highest inflation in 40 years to economies around the world. Like most other central banks and private-sector analysts, through year-end 2021 we thought that inflation would subside fairly quickly without a sharp tightening in our policy stance (figure 5).10 When it became clear that this was not the case, we responded forcefully, raising our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points over 16 months. That action, combined with the unwinding of pandemic supply disruptions, contributed to inflation moving much closer to our target without the painful rise in unemployment that has accompanied previous efforts to counter high inflation.\nElements of the Revised Consensus Statement\nThis year's review considered how economic conditions have evolved over the past five years. During this period, we saw that the inflation situation can change rapidly in the face of large shocks. In addition, interest rates are now substantially higher than was the case during the era between the GFC and the pandemic. With inflation above target, our policy rate is restrictive\u2014modestly so, in my view. We cannot say for certain where rates will settle out over the longer run, but their neutral level may now be higher than during the 2010s, reflecting changes in productivity, demographics, fiscal policy, and other factors that affect the balance between saving and investment (figure 6). During the review, we discussed how the 2020 statement's focus on the ELB may have complicated communications about our response to high inflation. We concluded that the emphasis on an overly specific set of economic conditions may have led to some confusion, and, as a result, we made several important changes to the consensus statement to reflect that insight.\nFirst, we removed language indicating that the ELB was a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, we noted that our \"monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions.\" The difficulty of operating near the ELB remains a potential concern, but it is not our primary focus. The revised statement reiterates that the Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum-employment and price-stability goals, particularly if the federal funds rate is constrained by the ELB.\nSecond, we returned to a framework of flexible inflation targeting and eliminated the \"makeup\" strategy. As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021.11\nWell-anchored inflation expectations were critical to our success in bringing down inflation without a sharp increase in unemployment. Anchored expectations promote the return of inflation to target when adverse shocks drive inflation higher, and limit the risk of deflation when the economy weakens.12 Further, they allow monetary policy to support maximum employment in economic downturns without compromising price stability. Our revised statement emphasizes our commitment to act forcefully to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, to the benefit of both sides of our dual mandate. It also notes that \"price stability is essential for a sound and stable economy and supports the well-being of all Americans.\" This theme came through loud and clear at our Fed Listens events.13 The past five years have been a painful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of necessities.\nThird, our 2020 statement said that we would mitigate \"shortfalls,\" rather than \"deviations,\" from maximum employment. The use of \"shortfalls\" reflected the insight that our real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment\u2014and hence of \"maximum employment\"\u2014are highly uncertain.14 The later years of the post-GFC recovery featured employment running for an extended period above mainstream estimates of its sustainable level, along with inflation running persistently below our 2 percent target. In the absence of inflationary pressures, it might not be necessary to tighten policy based solely on uncertain real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.15\nWe still have that view, but our use of the term \"shortfalls\" was not always interpreted as intended, raising communications challenges. In particular, the use of \"shortfalls\" was not intended as a commitment to permanently forswear preemption or to ignore labor market tightness. Accordingly, we removed \"shortfalls\" from our statement. Instead, the revised document now states more precisely that \"the Committee recognizes that employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without necessarily creating risks to price stability.\" Of course, preemptive action would likely be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price stability.\nThe revised statement also notes that maximum employment is \"the highest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability.\" This focus on promoting a strong labor market underscores the principle that \"durably achieving maximum employment fosters broad-based economic opportunities and benefits for all Americans.\" The feedback we received at Fed Listens events reinforced the value of a strong labor market for American households, employers, and communities.\nFourth, consistent with the removal of \"shortfalls,\" we made changes to clarify our approach in periods when our employment and inflation objectives are not complementary. In those circumstances, we will follow a balanced approach in promoting them. The revised statement now more closely aligns with the original 2012 language. We take into account the extent of departures from our goals and the potentially different time horizons over which each is projected to return to a level consistent with our dual mandate. These principles guide our policy decisions today, as they did over the 2022\u201324 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.\nIn addition to these changes, there is a great deal of continuity with past statements. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. For this reason, our policy actions depend on the economic outlook and the balance of risks to that outlook. We continue to believe that setting a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.\nWe also continue to view a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent as most consistent with our dual-mandate goals. We believe that our commitment to this target is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Experience has shown that 2 percent inflation is low enough to ensure that inflation is not a concern in household and business decisionmaking while also providing a central bank with some policy flexibility to provide accommodation during economic downturns.\nFinally, the revised consensus statement retained our commitment to conduct a public review roughly every five years. There is nothing magic about a five-year pace. That frequency allows policymakers to reassess structural features of the economy and to engage with the public, practitioners, and academics on the performance of our framework. It is also consistent with several global peers.\nConclusion\nIn closing, I want to thank President Schmid and all his staff who work so diligently to host this outstanding event annually. Counting a couple of virtual appearances during the pandemic, this is the eighth time I have had the honor to speak from this podium. Each year, this symposium offers the opportunity for Federal Reserve leaders to hear ideas from leading economic thinkers and focus on the challenges we face. The Kansas City Fed was wise to lure Chair Volcker to this national park more than 40 years ago, and I am proud to be part of that tradition.\n1. For example, after the July 2024 employment report, the 3-month average of the unemployment rate had increased more than 0.5 percentage point above its lowest value over the previous 12 months.

In early September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish a preliminary estimate of benchmark revisions to the level of nonfarm payrolls as of March 2025, based on data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. Data available to date suggest that the level of nonfarm payrolls will be revised down materially. The final benchmark revision will be incorporated into the monthly employment data in February 2026. Return to text\n3. The total downward revision of 258,000 between May and June was spread across private-sector industries as well as state and local government employment, particularly education, and reflected both additional information from surveyed establishments and the re-estimation of seasonal factors.

Using the consumer price index and other information, an estimate of the contribution of housing services to 12-month core PCE inflation in July was 0.7 percentage point, while core services excluding housing contributed 2.0 percentage points. The contribution from each of these categories remains slightly above its average during the 2002\u201307 period, during which core PCE inflation averaged about 2 percent. In contrast, the contribution of core goods to 12-month core PCE inflation in July was about 0.25 percentage point, compared with the 2002\u201307 average of \u22120.25 percentage point.

  "argos_summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s dovish remarks at the Jackson Hole symposium spurred a sharp rally in equities and cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin nearing $70,000 and Ethereum breaking its 2021 record at $4,885. The rally lifted the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq, and lowered the VIX to its lowest level of the year, while the probability of a September Fed rate cut jumped to 90%. Analysts and institutional investors see the move as a short\u2011term boost that could push ETH above $5,000 and BTC toward new all\u2011time highs, but they caution that the momentum may falter over the low\u2011liquidity weekend and that corporate treasury crypto adoption and equity volatility pose risks. Powell\u2019s speech also highlighted rising downside risks to employment and the potential inflationary impact of tariffs, prompting a review of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy framework. Overall, the market optimism reflects expectations of easing policy, though the long\u2011term effect remains uncertain.",
