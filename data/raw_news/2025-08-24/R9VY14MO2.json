  "description": "The button on your car door handle is part of the keyless entry system, allowing quick locking and unlocking once the car recognizes your key fob nearby.",
  "content": "What Is That Little Button On Your Car Door Handle For?\n\nCars these days incorporate numerous features to make our lives safer and more convenient. For instance, electronic stability control, emergency braking, and forward collision warnings are among the best modern car safety features. These typically work without the need for any engagement from the driver and are activated only when the systems deem it necessary. However, not every feature is as intuitive or autonomous. Some require drivers to first understand their inner workings before actually using them. A great example is keyless entry via button, a feature that lets drivers lock or unlock the doors by pressing a little button on the door handle, without having to take the key out of their pocket. More modern systems even get rid of the button entirely and work by simply touching the door handle. Here is everything you need to know about car keyless entry \u2014 how it works, why it is useful, and if it can be trusted.\n\nThe keyless entry process starts with the car recognizing and authenticating a key when it comes close to the vehicle. Most systems use RFID technology or related encrypted communication protocols to establish the connection between the key and the vehicle. The car then checks for authorization by determining what a recognized key is allowed to control. Once a correct and secure connection is established, the system allows for the car to be locked or unlocked via buttons on the door handles. The benefits of keyless entry are fairly self-explanatory since the system allows you to lock and unlock the car without pressing any keys on the key fob. This practically eliminates hot-wiring as a means to steal a car while also allowing drivers to benefit from automatic locking. Automatic locking is especially useful since it works by locking the vehicle once the key leaves its vicinity, even if you forget to lock it. Although this feature is typically found in more modern cars, remote keyless entry can also be added to classic cars or retrofitted to those that didn't get it from the factory. Moreover, keyless entry is often paired with keyless start, a system that lets drivers start the car remotely or with the push of a button instead of a traditional key.\n\nSpeaking to CBS News, cybersecurity expert Jack Reedy explained that thieves are \"capturing the radio signal from your key fob and then they are playing it again next to the vehicle, [which] allows them to drive away with it.\" This means that, even though these features eliminate more traditional means of car theft, they do introduce new vulnerabilities, some of which can be extremely easy to exploit. Thankfully, there are a few tips and tricks you can use to spot thieves targeting your car before it's stolen. You can use signal-blocking Faraday bags to store your key fob, park your car more strategically, or install alarm systems that work by deterrence. For a thief to even be able to recognize the signal, it needs to be in a relatively close proximity, so always be vigilant about who is standing near the vehicle. Thieves can also use signal jammers once you exit the vehicle in order to disengage the system when you try to lock it. Therefore, always check whether the car has actually been locked after you press the button. Lastly, it's also wise to consult your insurance policy, as some companies may require owners to take certain precautions, such as using Faraday bags to store keys. A lack of forced entry, as with signal theft, can often be grounds for denying coverage or make it difficult to prove personal belongings have been stolen from the car.",

      "text": "Can You Add Remote Keyless Entry To Your Classic Car?\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nFor those into faithful classic vehicle restoration, the idea of modernizing anything might be akin to nails on a chalkboard. But, while the automotive community can agree on its love of vintage car design, you can't argue that today's features, such as remote keyless entry, aren't incredibly convenient.\nThe automobile industry is always evolving, as evidenced by any number of old car features that you never see anymore. For further proof of ongoing change, some brands like Tesla have moved beyond the key fob and into a keycard technology, in a move that may change the industry going forward.\nHowever, if you want to take advantage of the current remote keyless entry technology, can you add it to a time-honored classic car? Yes, in fact, there are a variety of kits specifically made to add this technology to older vehicles. But, there are a few considerations you should be aware of, such as fit, cost, and installation complexity.\nInstallation kits: universal vs model specific\nYou can find many different remote keyless entry kits online, which essentially come in two flavors: a universal/one-size-fits-all product and a specialized system corresponding to your vehicle year and model.\nWith the universal systems, you can either purchase a kit or purchase the various components separately. Be cautious, however: some of these kits are missing key parts, such as the door lock actuators or actuator rods, both of which are what make it possible to lock and unlock the doors.\nYou can also choose to purchase a kit specifically made for your model or series of vehicle. The advantage of this type of remote keyless entry kit is that everything should fit properly and seamlessly. Repudiable retailers that offer these specialized products may also provide additional information, such as which variations of the vehicle model won't work with the product, helping to prevent future headaches during installation. However, you'll pay dramatically more for these kits, as they retail for well over $200 vs around $40 for the universal systems.\nDo-it-yourself or professional installation?\nThe choice between completing the job yourself or hiring a shop to install a remote keyless entry system is entirely dependent on your level of experience and skill. These systems require you to take apart your car doors, reference a wiring diagram, run, strip, crimp, and cover wiring (removing any piece of the vehicle's interior out of the way for access), and install and mount the actuator components, among other steps. If you have experience in these areas, installing a remote keyless entry kit could be a rewarding and fun process. However, without the appropriate level of knowledge or the proper tools, things could get frustrating quickly.\nMany custom car shops and even some locksmiths can also install a remote keyless entry system into your car. However, the cost can vary depending on the vehicle, with some estimates approaching $300. While remote keyless entry is undoubtedly a useful feature, you can't beat the nostalgia of these classic car features that are probably gone forever."

      "text": "7 Of The Best Modern Car Safety Features Available Today\nMost of us have a good idea of what we want when we step onto a showroom floor when shopping for a new car. For some, lots of cargo space is a must, while for others, it's a user-friendly infotainment system. While it may not be at the forefront of our minds, car safety features are something we'd all do well to prioritize when looking for a new car. That's they not only minimize our chance of getting into a serious accident but also substantially lower our risk of injury.\nWhen we talk about car safety features, we're referring to anything designed to help prevent accidents or lessen a crash's impact. Government-mandated features like airbags, seatbelts, and antilock brakes are just a few that come to mind when most of us think of car safety. You expect these features to come standard on any modern car and probably don't give them a second thought.\nBut modern car safety is about a lot more than just surviving a crash \u2014 it's about avoiding one altogether. That's why car manufacturers are constantly adding to the list of features to help keep us safe on the road. And these advanced safety features are no longer limited to luxury cars \u2014 many are now available across a range of vehicles at different prices.\nAutomatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection\nMost drivers have had to slam on the brakes at some point. Maybe a child stepped out onto the street unexpectedly, or a car ran a red light just as you were about to cross the intersection. These split-second decisions can make the difference between a close call and a serious accident. We don't always have enough time to react in time to prevent a collision, but if your car comes with automatic emergency braking, it'll have your back in these situations.\nAutomakers won't be required to include automatic emergency braking in new passenger cars until 2029. However, vehicles like the 2025 Honda Civic SI and the luxurious 2024 Kia Telluride already come with the technology. Automatic emergency braking uses radar, cameras, or lidar to detect a potential collision and automatically apply the brakes if you don't react in time. The technology works best during the day, and also when traveling under 25 mph, making it effective at preventing daytime crashes in parking lots and urban areas where heavy traffic is common.\nWhile full-speed automatic emergency braking has become more common since 2020, at high speeds it's only effective at slowing a car down, not stopping it. When the new standard mandating all vehicles be sold with automatic emergency braking goes into effect, it will have to stop cars going up to 62 mph, and must also include pedestrian detection, which will let cars identify and react to pedestrians both day and night.\nBlind-spot collision warning\nWhen we learn how to drive, we're constantly reminded to check the blind spot before changing lanes or merging into traffic. A vehicle's blind spot is the area around the back and sides of your car that you can't see by just checking your mirrors. Blind spots make it hard for us to see cyclists, pedestrians, or other vehicles approaching, increasing the risk of accidents. Blind-spot collision warning systems act as an extra set of eyes, detecting cars in hard-to-see areas and letting us know they're there before we change lanes.\nBlind-spot collision warning systems use your car's rear bumper sensors to monitor vehicles in areas that aren't in your field of vision when turning your head or checking your side-view mirrors. If the system identifies a car in your blind spot and you try to change lanes, it will warn you by flashing an amber light in the side mirror, sounding an alert, or vibrating the steering wheel, depending on your vehicle's make and model. While the government hasn't mandated the use of blind-spot collision warning systems in passenger vehicles, many cars, including the affordable 2025 Hyundai Elantra N and the sublime BMW Z4 M40i, come with this technology.\nAutomatic crash notification\nIf you get into a car accident, automatic crash notification lets first responders know your location, even if you're unable to do it yourself, so they can get to you faster. Automatic crash notification works with your car's built-in cellular connection or a paired phone, sending an alert as soon as it detects an accident. Some advanced automatic crash notification systems can do more than just call for help \u2014 they can let first responders know what type of injuries you and any passengers may have suffered, based on their assessment of the impact of the crash.\nAutomatic crash notification was once a subscription-based service. However, that's changing as more and more car manufacturers offer it free with new cars. It's one of the Toyota RAV4's hidden features and is also available on the fun 2025 Mazda CX-30 Turbo and other Mazda vehicles through the manufacturer's automatic 911 dialing service. Automakers that don't include automatic crash notification free with the purchase of a new car often offer buyers a several-years-long free trial. With automatic crash notification, you know that even if you're unconscious or unable to call for help after a collision, emergency services will be able to find you.\nElectronic stability control\nElectronic stability control has been standard in all vehicles sold in the U.S. since the 2102 model year, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that the technology saved more than 7,000 lives just between 2011 and 2015. Whether you buy a solid new 2025 Nissan Altima or are driving an older version, if your vehicle is a 2012 model or newer and you purchased it in the U.S., it came with this safety feature standard.\nElectronic stability control's job is to help you keep your car steady and on the right path. It uses your car's sensors to track wheel speed, steering, and sideways motion. If the system detects you're losing control of the vehicle, it automatically adjusts the brakes and engine power to help keep you heading in the right direction. This is especially useful for vehicles with a higher center of gravity, like SUVs and pickup trucks, reducing the risk of fatal single-vehicle crashes and rollovers in them.\nWhen driving, we encounter all types of obstacles before reaching our destination, and electronic stability control lets you swerve to avoid hitting an object and return to your lane safely without fishtailing or spinning out. You'll come across many names for electronic stability control while car shopping, with some of the most common being vehicle stability control, electronic stability program, and dynamic stability control.\nBackup cameras\nUnless you've only driven cars made after 2018, when backup cameras became mandatory in the U.S., you've had the unpleasant experience of twisting and turning your head as you back out of a parking space or garage, trying to ensure nothing was behind you. But it's just not possible to see everything behind you when backing up, whether we're talking about a toy that's out of sight or someone walking behind your car.\nThat's what makes backup cameras, also known as rearview cameras, so useful. They're positioned in the back of a vehicle, typically near the trunk or license plate, and are automatically activated when you put your car into reverse. Then you see what's going on behind your car on a display screen inside your vehicle. Before backup cameras became mandatory in new cars, the NHTSA estimated that nearly 300 people were killed and 18,000 injured each year in backover accidents.\nBackup cameras have made it much easier for drivers to spot pedestrians and objects behind their vehicles when backing up. Most cameras have parallel lines corresponding to the car's width to help guide you as you back up. Advanced backup camera systems take it a step further with bending guidelines that move as you turn the wheel, giving you a clear idea of where your car is headed. For those with cars made before 2018, it's possible to install a highly rated backup camera system for your vehicle to improve visibility while backing up.\nLane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist\nWe've all seen a car drift into another lane without the driver being aware of it. Whether distracted by a car's infotainment system or simply tired after a long day's work, any of us could temporarily lose focus and stray from our lane. Lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist help keep us in our lane so we arrive at our destinations safely.\nWhile they sound similar and are often found together, they have different functions. As the name suggests, a lane-departure warning system alerts you when you're getting too close to a lane marker. Depending on the car, that warning can be a visual cue, a sound, a physical vibration, or all three. This safety feature uses a front-facing camera to track your car's position in relation to lane markers. It doesn't work when your vehicle's turn signal is on.\nLane-keeping assist is an advanced version of lane-departure warning, and many carmakers pair the two, calling it \"lane-departure warning with steering assist.\" Where lane-departure warning just tells you that you're getting too close to a lane marker, lane-keeping assist intervenes, using your car's steering wheel to guide you back to your lane. Both systems are usually activated by default in vehicles that use them but can be deactivated, usually by pushing a button on the steering wheel. While automakers aren't required to include them, you can find them on the stylish, spacious 2025 Volkswagen Taos, the fuel-sipping 2025 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, and many others.\nForward collision warning\nIf you've been driving long enough, you've likely had a close call where you had to slam on the brakes to avoid rear-ending someone. Rear-end accidents are especially common in urban areas, where stop-and-go traffic requires drivers to follow at a close distance, and there's often little room for error. That's where forward collision warning comes in, using a vehicle's front sensors to detect when a pedestrian or car is in a driver's path. Forward collision warning comes standard with many new vehicles, including the impressive but frustrating 2025 Chevy Blazer. However, the government has not yet mandated that all cars be equipped with it.\nForward collision warning works by alerting drivers when a car or object is directly in their path. The alert can come in the form of a visual warning, an audible alarm, a vibration in the steering wheel, or some combination of these. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, forward collision warning can reduce rear-end accidents by 27%.\nSome systems include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection to alert drivers when a pedestrian crosses directly in front of their vehicle. While forward collision warning won't stop your vehicle if it detects a car in your path, it often works together with automatic emergency braking systems, which automatically brake if you don't respond in time."

      "text": "How To Spot Thieves Targeting Your Car Before It's Stolen\nCar theft doesn't usually happen in the blink of an eye \u2014 it's a well-planned crime. Thieves often study your habits, test your car's security, and wait for the perfect moment to strike. It doesn't matter if you own a worn-out Honda or a brand-new BMW; if your car looks like an easy target, thieves might be watching. That's why spotting the early signs is key. Keep an eye out for people loitering nearby, cars idling at odd hours, or small, unusual markings on your vehicle.\nSome thieves also run signal jamming tests to interfere with key fobs or use tricks like placing a coin in the door handle to prevent locking. If your fob starts acting up or your mirrors are out of place, don't ignore it. These seemingly small signs could mean that someone was checking how easy it is to steal your car. One false alarm may not mean much, but if it happens more than once, it's worth paying attention.\nWhile any car can be a target, some vehicles are more attractive to thieves than others. Older cars with fewer security features, pickups with high resale parts, and luxury models like BMWs or Audis are common picks. Recently, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 became the most commonly stolen pickup truck, leaving behind the Ford F-150.\nWarning signs that thieves might be watching your car\nA thief rarely just strolls up, hops in, and drives away. Often, they leave subtle cues that can warn you about an impending theft. For instance, if you see scratches near your door lock, it could mean someone has already tested your car's security. Similarly, tampered wiring, a triggered alarm, broken glass, or even a missing item could all be signs of an attempted break-in \u2014 not just carelessness.\nSome thieves use chalk, chewing gum, stones, or stickers to mark potential targets. Beyond checking your car, keep an eye on your surroundings. Is the same unfamiliar car always parked across the street? Are people regularly loitering near your driveway, or perhaps you've seen someone taking photos of your car? None of that is random \u2014 it could mean that thieves are getting ready to steal your car.\nEven repeated false alarms could be more than a glitch; it could be someone testing the waters. One red flag on its own might not mean much, but it never hurts to stay vigilant.\nWhat you can do to stay ahead?\nJust locking your car isn't always enough to keep it safe from theft. As car tech improves, thieves adapt, so it's important to stay a step ahead. For example, if your car uses smart keys, keep your fob in a Faraday pouch to block relay attacks. Another tip: When buying a used car, always reprogram the keys. If the keys weren't reprogrammed, a thief could still use an old fob to get in.. For extra safety, consider installing a steering wheel lock or a brake pedal lock, as they're simple, visible, and surprisingly effective.\nAnother thing to consider is how and where you park. Turn your wheels toward the curb, park under lights, and avoid secluded areas. Make it a habit to always physically check that your car is locked, especially in high-traffic areas like mall parking lots and gas stations, where signal jamming is a risk.\nDash cams, GPS trackers, and alarm system stickers \u2014 even fake ones \u2013 can also scare off potential thieves before they ever try to make a move. Lastly, if you're selling a car, never hand over the keys or let someone test drive it without you. That moment of trust can be all a scammer needs to drive off for good."

      "text": "Security experts, police offer advice on how to prevent keyless car thefts\nNEW YORK -- Car thefts are surging nationwide and now some thieves have figured out a hack to access key fobs, even if the fob is inside your house. They can then drive away with your car without the key.\nAs CBS2's Carolyn Gusoff reports, there are simple fixes to protect yourself.\nA Nassau County woman, who did not want to be identified, locked her car. Her keys, she thought, were safely in the kitchen.\n\"The keys were 100 percent in the house,\" she said. \"Someone was that close and stole our car. It's just frightening and appalling.\"\nHer recent car theft doesn't fit the pattern police have emphasized for months. Almost all stolen cars had been left unlocked with key fobs left inside.\nNow owners are locking up, but tech-savvy thieves have figured out a workaround.\n\"It's a fob extender or a fob enhancer. It enhances the signal between the car and the fob,\" Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said.\nCybersecurity expert Jack Reedy explained the hack. The key fob emits a radio signal. Thieves, often working in pairs, use a device that captures the fob's signal and extends the range.\n\"They are capturing the radio signal from your key fob and then they are playing it again next to the vehicle,\" Reedy said. \"Allows them to drive away with it.\"\nWhat do thieves do once they drive off without your key? Experts say they have essentially cloned your key fob's signal and can use it over and over again to restart your stolen car.\n\"They basically got your fob,\" Reedy said. \"It's literally they are taking a capture of and making a temporary new key fob in their hand.\"\n\"The unscrupulous individuals of the world have realized they can if the fob is close enough just walk up to the vehicle and jump and start it up,\" said Robert Sinclair of AAA Northeast.\nA simple fix? Store the fob as far away as possible from the car and away from glass doors and windows. Or, buy an inexpensive RF-blocking box or pouch. It's lined with metal and will interrupt the signal.\nRyder says add another step to your routine to protect your investment.\n\"Take the fob in, lock the car, and now put in a pocketbook, put it in a bag, put it in your bedroom. Don't just leave it by a window,\" Ryder said.\nAutomakers are already onto this. Newest models have added layers of key fob verification.\nThe National Insurance Crime Bureau told CBS2 there is no conclusive evidence these devices are a contributor in the rising auto theft problem. Most victims left cars unlocked. Cybersecurity experts say the crime is vastly underreported because victims may have no idea how their car was broken into."
