  "title": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip Stock Will Skyrocket After Aug. 27 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
  "description": "After Nvidia reports its second-quarter earnings this week, investors should keep a keen eye on another important AI chip stock.",
  "content": "\u2022 Accelerating AI infrastructure spending by hyperscalers and governments is a good indicator that GPU demand will remain high.\n\u2022 On the surface, Nvidia appears to be the chip company that's best positioned to benefit from rising AI infrastructure spending.\n\u2022 The growing demand for AI training and inference also bodes well for high bandwidth memory specialists like Micron.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology \u203a On Wednesday, semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will release its second-quarter earnings report. Between the advent of DeepSeek, shifting U.S. trade policies anchored by President Donald Trump's tariff agenda, and a fluid situation regarding its business in China, this has been the most challenging year of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution yet for Nvidia. Despite the noise, however, recent developments suggest the AI chip behemoth remains firmly on track. While Wall Street's attention will be focused on Nvidia's results, savvy investors may want to look elsewhere in the semiconductor space for potentially seismic stock moves next week. In particular, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is positioned to benefit handsomely if Nvidia delivers upbeat results, given that its mission-critical solutions are also part of the AI supply chain. Let's discuss why Micron stock could skyrocket after Nvidia's Q2 report, and assess whether now would be a good time to scoop up shares. Why Nvidia is going to crush its Q2 earnings Over the past month, investors have gotten some previews of what to expect from Nvidia's upcoming earnings report. The hyperscalers -- Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- continue to make record-breaking capital expenditures to build out new data centers and cloud computing infrastructure. Much of this spending is directed toward infrastructure that can support AI -- including networking equipment, servers, and, most importantly, graphics processing units (GPUs), which remain Nvidia's core products. Another bullish signal came from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The world's largest third-party chip foundry recently reported a blowout quarter with $30 billion in revenue. Because TSMC is Nvidia's key foundry partner, Taiwan Semi's results can effectively be taken as a proxy for demand for Nvidia's GPUs. When you combine robust AI spending from the hyperscalers with surging order flow at the top AI chip manufacturer, it points to one conclusion: Nvidia's Q2 earnings report is likely to deliver the kind of growth that will please even the most aggressive investors.\n\nMicron is an under-the-radar way to invest in the AI infrastructure boom While much of Nvidia's sales growth is being driven by hyperscalers' insatiable demand for GPUs, those chips don't operate in isolation. High-performance memory chips are also essential to handle the massive data loads generated by AI models -- and this is where Micron plays a pivotal role. In addition, large-scale initiatives such as Project Stargate highlight just how expansive those data center buildouts have become. From cloud services providers to sovereign government AI projects, data centers are being designed with next-generation GPUs, advanced networking, and high-performance memory and storage. Another important trend is the broadening scope of AI investments. The first wave focused on acquiring GPUs with which to train large language models (LLMs). The next wave is about deploying AI software into enterprise workflows. This shift requires more than just additional training power -- it demands hardware with more robust inference capabilities. Inference workloads are memory-intensive, as they involve the processing of enormous volumes of real-time data. Micron's DRAM and high bandwidth memory (HBM) solutions are both designed to support these protocols, positioning the company as a critical player in the downstream adoption of AI. Taken together, the surging capex from hyperscalers, megaprojects like Stargate, and the rise of AI inference workloads converge to show that demand for computing power is still rising. While GPUs may be the headline act of the AI infrastructure show, HBM is a key player backstage, ensuring that the show goes on. For this reason, Micron will continue to benefit from the world's massive AI infrastructure outlays -- quietly capturing incremental revenue each time money is spent on GPUs, servers, and data center upgrades. As Nvidia's sales scale up further, Micron is positioned to scale up right alongside it -- and its shares could easily witness some pronounced buying on the heels of a positive report from Nvidia next week. Micron is trading at deep value levels compared to others in the semiconductor landscape As the chart below illustrates, chip giants like Nvidia, Broadcom, TSM, and Advanced Micro Devices all trade at far richer valuations than Micron. That's because investors clearly see how surging demand for GPUs and networking equipment drives revenue and profits for these businesses. Where I think investors are missing the mark is in how they view Micron. It's true that the high bandwidth memory business is much different from the GPU business. GPUs function as the backbone of generative AI development, and each company's chips have unique value propositions. HBM is more commoditized. That said, what investors may be overlooking is that each new dollar spent on AI GPUs designed by Nvidia and AMD and manufactured by TSMC multiplies the need for complementary solutions like high bandwidth memory to keep those accelerators running at maximum efficiency. Moreover, when you consider that Micron's HBM products are already integrated with Nvidia's flagship GPUs, it positions the company as a direct beneficiary of AI infrastructure spending. Nevertheless, the valuation gap is striking. Micron's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sits well below those of its tangential peers, suggesting the market has yet to fully recognize the importance HBM will play in the next phase of AI growth. That's why I see Micron as an underappreciated opportunity when valued against the most obvious chip beneficiaries at the moment. While the stock could exhibit some volatility in the short term, I don't recommend trying to \"market time\" your entry points. Instead, a more reliable strategy for investors to use is dollar-cost averaging -- gradually building a position in a stock by purchasing set dollar amounts at regular intervals. Using this approach with Micron will allow investors to buy the stock at different prices while riding the long-term secular tailwinds of the AI infrastructure narrative.

      "text": "Although it's only August, 2025 has already played out like a modern-day Greek tragedy for semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%). Its year has been marked by a litany of setbacks, comebacks, and everything in between.\nEarlier this year, more than $1 trillion of Nvidia's market value was wiped out. Yet today, the company boasts a market cap of $4.4 trillion -- reclaiming the crown as the most valuable company in the world.\nAt the center of Nvidia's headaches in 2025 is China -- and no, not because of DeepSeek. The real culprit has been a wave of sweeping tariff policies and export controls that have curtailed Nvidia's influence in the Chinese AI market.\nNow, after months of negotiations with regulators in Washington, it appears that the tide may be turning. Nvidia could be on the precipice of reestablishing its presence in one of its most crucial Asian markets.\nLet's unpack the details of Nvidia's new deal structure in China and examine why it should be celebrated as a massive win for investors.\nHow big an opportunity is China for Nvidia?\nAccording to accounting and consulting firm Deloitte, the global total addressable market (TAM) for semiconductors, as measured by sales, reached $627 billion in 2024. Deloitte projects that the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% over the coming decades -- ultimately reaching $2 trillion by 2040.\nOutside of the U.S., China remains one of the most important markets fueling demand for high-performance chipsets, particularly graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has estimated that the AI opportunity in China alone could be worth as much as $50 billion.\nIn 2024, Nvidia generated $130 billion in revenue, with China capturing roughly 13% of this sum. During the first quarter of 2025, Nvidia's $5.5 billion of China sales accounted for roughly 12.5% of total revenue.\nThis leveling trend underscores how the current administration's policies toward China have started to constrain Nvidia's growth potential in the region.\nWhy is Nvidia's new China deal so important?\nAccording to multiple news outlets, Nvidia has reached an agreement with Washington regarding its operation in China. Under the terms, Nvidia will pay 15% of its China-based sales to the U.S. government. In effect, the arrangement provides Nvidia with a pathway to penetrate this critical market through its tailored H20 chips.\nWhile this might initially resemble a tax, investors should avoid viewing it through that lens. First, the agreement applies to sales of Nvidia's AI chips rather than to profits, unlike traditional forms of taxation. Moreover, the 15% rate does not appear to be variable in structure like a royalty, which is typically tied to intellectual property (IP) and subject to fluctuate.\nWhile this deal might appear unusual at first glance, these structures are not without precedent in global business practices. For example, energy companies that extract natural resources or commodities in foreign countries often operate under similar revenue-sharing agreements with host nations in exchange for distribution rights.\nIn my view, dedicating a modest share of sales to secure access to China represents a strategic trade-off. In the long run, it allows Nvidia to preserve its dominant position in one of the world's most important AI markets and prevents domestic rivals such as Huawei from eroding its competitive moat.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\nWhile Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been expanding recently, levels remain muted compared to peaks reached previously during the AI revolution. In my view, part of this multiple compression reflects concerns surrounding China -- perhaps overly so.\nNvidia's new agreement in Washington offers the company renewed momentum, securing revenue in a critical market without forfeiting much in the way of profits -- even with the 15% remittance to the U.S. government.\nOver the long term, I see this arrangement as a strategic mechanism for Nvidia to strengthen its position overseas and deliver durable growth across the global AI infrastructure market.\nAs these fundamentals take hold, I think the company's valuation multiples could expand further, potentially driving the stock to new highs sooner than many investors may be expecting. For that reason, I see Nvidia stock as a no-brainer opportunity to buy hand over fist right now and hold for years to come."

That's because investors clearly see how surging demand for GPUs and networking equipment drives revenue and profits for these businesses.\nWhere I think investors are missing the mark is in how they view Micron. It's true that the high bandwidth memory business is much different from the GPU business. GPUs function as the backbone of generative AI development, and each company's chips have unique value propositions. HBM is more commoditized.\nThat said, what investors may be overlooking is that each new dollar spent on AI GPUs designed by Nvidia and AMD and manufactured by TSMC multiplies the need for complementary solutions like high bandwidth memory to keep those accelerators running at maximum efficiency. Moreover, when you consider that Micron's HBM products are already integrated with Nvidia's flagship GPUs, it positions the company as a direct beneficiary of AI infrastructure spending.\nNevertheless, the valuation gap is striking. Micron's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sits well below those of its tangential peers, suggesting the market has yet to fully recognize the importance HBM will play in the next phase of AI growth. That's why I see Micron as an underappreciated opportunity when valued against the most obvious chip beneficiaries at the moment.\nWhile the stock could exhibit some volatility in the short term, I don't recommend trying to \"market time\" your entry points. Instead, a more reliable strategy for investors to use is dollar-cost averaging -- gradually building a position in a stock by purchasing set dollar amounts at regular intervals.\nUsing this approach with Micron will allow investors to buy the stock at different prices while riding the long-term secular tailwinds of the AI infrastructure narrative."

      "text": "DeepSeek burst onto the scene in early 2025. The Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up's open-source large language model (LLM) relies on a technique known as interference-time computing. This approach only activates the most relevant portions of the model to perform each query, which saves time and money.\nThe private Chinese company was formed in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, who created it with money from his hedge fund. It released its latest AI model in mid-January 2025; the model reportedly only cost about $6 million to make, a fraction of the roughly $1 trillion leading U.S. AI companies like OpenAI, Alphabet's (GOOG 2.98%) (GOOGL 3.1%) Google, and Meta Platforms (META 2.04%) plan to plow into AI infrastructure in the coming years. If DeepSeek can truly build AI models for such a low investment -- because it requires significantly fewer specialized semiconductors from companies like Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) -- it could cause a massive disruption to the AI industry in the coming years.\nArtificial Intelligence\nGiven the company's quick rise to fame, many investors wonder how to get in on this potentially game-changing AI company. Here's everything you need to know about how to invest in the AI sector and DeepSeek before its initial public offering (IPO).\nIs DeepSeek publicly traded?\nIs DeepSeek publicly traded?\nDeepSeek was not a publicly traded company as of early 2025. Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, founded and run by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, owns DeepSeek and is the sole funder of the AI start-up.\nIPO\nWhen will DeepSeek IPO?\nDeepSeek didn't have an IPO on the calendar as of early 2025. The AI start-up likely won't go public anytime soon. The company is still a very early stage start-up that hasn't yet started to commercialize its latest AI model, so it could be quite some time before the company goes public.\nIPO\nHow to buy\nHow to buy DeepSeek stock\nSince DeepSeek hasn't completed an IPO, you can't buy shares of the AI stock in your brokerage account. As of early 2025, you also couldn't buy pre-IPO shares of the company because it's wholly owned and funded by High-Flyer, a Chinese hedge fund.\nWhile you can't currently invest directly in DeepSeek, you can invest in the AI trends driving its popularity through another leading AI company. Three DeepSeek alternatives to consider investing in are:\nNvidia\nNvidia is a leader in developing the advanced chips required for developing AI training models and applications. DeepSeek uses Nvidia's chips; its founder, Liang Wenfeng, reportedly stockpiled them before the U.S. banned the export of AI chips to China. It reportedly used Nvidia's cheaper H800 chips instead of the more expensive A100 to train its latest model. However, many in the tech sector believe DeepSeek is significantly understating the number of chips it used (and the type) due to the export ban. But even if DeepSeek isn't understating its chip usage, its breakthrough could accelerate the usage of AI, which could still bode well for Nvidia.\nMicrosoft\nMicrosoft (MSFT 0.56%) is a leader in AI. The technology titan was an early investor in OpenAI, the developer of the breakthrough ChatGPT chatbot. The company has been integrating AI into all aspects of its business to help users improve productivity. While DeepSeek is a potential rival to ChatGPT, Microsoft still stands to benefit from its potential breakthrough in cost. It would make AI cheaper to implement, which could enable the technology company to make more money in the future.\nMeta Platforms\nMeta Platforms is investing heavily in AI. It announced plans to invest as much as $65 billion to expand its AI infrastructure in early 2025, days after DeepSeek unveiled its lower-cost breakthrough. That's an eye-popping 50% increase from the prior year. The company expects this massive investment to drive its core products and business in the coming years. Meta would benefit if DeepSeek's lower-cost approach proves to be a breakthrough because it would lower Meta's development costs.\nIt's easy to invest in one of these DeepSeek alternatives or another IPO in 2025. Here's a step-by-step guide to add them to your portfolio:\n- Step 1: Open your brokerage app: Log into your brokerage account where you handle your investments.\n- Step 2: Search for the stock: Enter the ticker or company name into the search bar to bring up the stock's trading page.\n- Step 3: Decide how many shares to buy: Consider your investment goals and how much of your portfolio you want to allocate to this stock.\n- Step 4: Select order type: Choose between a market order to buy at the current price or a limit order to specify the maximum price you're willing to pay.\n- Step 5: Submit your order: Confirm the details and submit your buy order.\n- Step 6: Review your purchase: Check your portfolio to ensure your order was filled as expected and adjust your investment strategy accordingly.\nIs it profitable?\nIs DeepSeek profitable?\nDeepSeek is a privately held AI start-up owned solely by a Chinese hedge fund, so there isn't currently any financial data available on the company.\nShould I invest?\nShould I invest in DeepSeek?\nYou can't currently invest in DeepSeek because it's a privately held company owned by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer.\nHowever, if the company does complete an IPO, there are several factors you should consider before buying IPO stock in the company. A big one is whether the company is being completely transparent about the number and types of chips it's using to train its AI model. Many in the tech industry believe the company is understating the chips it's using due to an export ban on certain AI chips. It might cost more -- potentially significantly more -- to train its AI model than the $6 million figure initially reported in the media.\nInvestors also need to consider the risks of investing in Chinese companies. These risks include geopolitical issues (such as the export ban on certain AI chips), the potential for the lack of transparency in its finances, the greater possibility of fraud due to less oversight, security and privacy concerns, and other possible factors that could negatively affect an investment in the company.\nETFs\nETFs with exposure to DeepSeek\nYou can't currently use an exchange-traded fund (ETF) to gain passive exposure to DeepSeek because it's not a publicly traded company. However, you can use ETFs to invest broadly in trends like AI, robotics, and Chinese technology stocks. Some top options to consider include:\n- Invesco China Technology ETF (CQQQ 5.96%): This fund invests broadly in Chinese technology stocks. It owned around 150 companies in early 2025, led by top-holding Tencent (TCEHY 1.86%) at 9.7% of its net assets. The fund has a 0.65% ETF expense ratio.\n- Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ 2.86%): This AI ETF aims to invest in companies that should benefit from the increased usage and adoption of AI. The fund held around 45 stocks in early 2025, led by Nvidia (13% of its assets). The ETF had a 0.68% expense ratio.\n- iShares Future AI & Tech ETF (ARTY 1.79%): This fund focuses on AI innovators that are at the forefront of areas like generative AI, AI data and infrastructure, AI services, and AI software. The ETF held about 50 AI stocks in early 2025, including Nvidia as the fourth-largest holding at 4.4% of the fund's assets. It had a 0.47% expense ratio.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line\nThe bottom line on DeepSeek\nDeepSeek has sent shockwaves through the AI sector after unveiling its much cheaper approach to training AI models. While there are some questions about how much its model actually costs, the implications are significant. It could disrupt some AI leaders while potentially enhancing the use of the technology in the future. That makes DeepSeek a very interesting company to watch.\nFAQs\nInvesting in DeepSeek FAQs\nWhat company owns DeepSeek AI?\nChinese hedge fund High-Flyer owns DeepSeek. The hedge fund's founder, Liang Wenfeng, also founded DeepSeek.\nWhat is the best AI company to invest in?\nThere are many great AI technology companies. However, as DeepSeek's breakthrough shows, there's a high risk for disruption in the sector. Investors should consider investing in a basket of the top AI stocks, like industry leaders Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others, to help protect their portfolio from the potential that an AI start-up could make today's top AI stock tomorrow's laggard.\nWhat is the ticker for DeepSeek?\nThere is no ticker for DeepSeek. The AI start-up is a privately held company owned and funded by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, an entity founded and run by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng.\nIs DeepSeek publicly traded?\nDeepSeek isn't a publicly traded company. It's a private AI start-up owned and funded by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer.\nIs DeepSeek a threat to Nvidia?\nDeepSeek is a potential threat to Nvidia. While it doesn't develop AI chips, the company built its AI model on lower-cost chips. As a result, Nvidia might not be able to sell as many of its premium AI chips in the future if DeepSeek's novel approach becomes the new industry standard."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
