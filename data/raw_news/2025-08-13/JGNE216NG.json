  "description": "Using LinkedIn's wealth of job-related data, a new list looks at which schools are setting students up for success in an AI-focused world.",
  "content": "With artificial intelligence progressing at a rate that can generously be described as unprecedented, many students considering college are wondering what a traditional degree may have to offer in these rapidly changing times.\n\nIn fact, AI skills and background education were top of the list of factors taken into account as LinkedIn assembled its first-ever list of top colleges, which was released on August 12. While the list also prioritizes other categories culled from its data\u2014including hiring rates, job mobility, and alumni networks\u2014the special breakout category that many will surely be most interested in is the one that shows the highest percentages of grads entering the workforce in AI-focused jobs. Many grads are probably concerned about the ability of traditional four-year programs to equip them for this new job landscape, which is understandable as most professionals are currently unclear about how it will impact their companies\u2019 futures.\n\nAccording to LinkedIn, 81% of C-suite executives are favoring job candidates that are comfortable with AI tools. Which schools are most AI focused? The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) comes in at the top of two lists, including the highest percentage of recent graduates going into AI fields, and the highest percentage of new grads listing AI literary and engineering skills on their LinkedIn profiles. LinkedIn also found that Caltech offers a range of AI-focused classes and overall programs, including AI4Science initiative, which the website describes as an initiative aimed at bringing \u201cAI researchers with experts from other disciplines to push modern AI tools into every area of science and engineering.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) came in second in both categories, with University of California-Berkeley, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon University, Harvey Mudd, and University of California-San Diego also appearing on both lists. Schools with the highest percentage of recent grads going into AI occupations Schools with the highest percentage of recent grads adding AI-related skills on LinkedIn profiles While these two breakout categories are particularly relevant for those considering tech fields, the larger list looks at more traditional considerations for students, including job placement, recruiter demand, career success, network strength, and knowledge breadth. They also specify notable skills listed by grads from the top schools. For the overall list, Princeton took home the top spot, with Duke and the University of Pennsylvania taking the second and third spots. The entire list can be found on LinkedIn\u2019s website.",

      "text": "LinkedIn Top Colleges 2025: The 50 best colleges for long-term career success in the U.S.\nThe decision to attend college \u2014 and where \u2014 is one of the most important financial and life choices a student and their family will ever make. A four-year bachelor\u2019s degree is a significant investment of time and money, especially as tuition costs rise and the job market shifts. For millions of Americans, the return-on-investment is worth it. Those who earn the degree can see an enduring impact on their earning potential and overall career trajectory.\nAnd where they earn that degree can have an even bigger impact: graduates of top programs often land jobs sooner, build strong professional networks and advance into leadership faster. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for prospective students to know which programs are worth the investment.\nLinkedIn\u2019s first-ever Top Colleges ranking identifies the 50 U.S. schools that best set graduates up for long-term success. The ranking is built on exclusive LinkedIn data looking at career outcomes of alumni, such as job placement rates and advancement into senior-level positions, or how many alumni held an internship during their degree or started their own company post-grad. You can read our full methodology at the bottom of this article.\nIf you\u2019re not sure a traditional degree is the right choice for you, LinkedIn editor Taylor Borden breaks down alternative paths to success (in fact, nearly one-fifth of jobs on LinkedIn today don\u2019t require a college degree). But if you\u2019re considering heading to campus, this list can help you identify the best school for your career goals.\nHere are this year\u2019s 50 Top Colleges in the U.S. \u2014 and join the conversation using #LinkedInTopColleges.\nLooking for the top schools in a specific area of interest? You can also check out the top public universities, liberal arts colleges and HBCUs.\nUndergraduate enrollment numbers are rounded to the nearest five. \u201c\ud83c\udfc6 Where they stand out\u201d insights indicate the schools that scored in the top 5 on each of our methodology pillars.\nAn earlier version of this article included \u201cstudent hotspots\u201d for each school, drawn from Lyft data on popular student destinations.

Job placement tracks the percentage of alumni from recent graduate cohorts (2019-2024) that start a full-time position or a graduate school program within the same year of graduating. This assessment is based on LinkedIn hiring data. Internships and recruiter demand tracks the percentage of alumni from recent cohorts who completed an undergraduate internship; and labor market demand for recent cohorts, based on InMail outreach data. Career success tracks the percentage of alumni with post-graduate entrepreneurship or C-suite experience. Network strength tracks how connected alumni of the same school are to each other, as well as how connected alumni from recent cohorts are to all past alumni and current students. Knowledge breadth tracks unique fields of study and unique skills gained among recent cohorts during their degree.\nEach of the five pillars is weighed equally. Most pillars are made up of two metrics, each accounting for half of that pillar's weight \u2014 except for job placement, which is based on a single metric accounting for the full weight of the pillar.\nTo be eligible, colleges must be U.S.-based, regionally accredited four-year baccalaureate programs that are actively enrolling first-year students. Programs must have at least 2,000 total alumni, with at least 500 of them graduating within the recent cohort (2019-2024), based on LinkedIn data. We exclude military service academies, for-profit colleges, highly-specialized colleges and colleges that offer only online programs or degree completion programs from our analysis. Depending on the specific metric in question, our methodology either encompasses all alumni or recent graduate cohorts, as defined by alumni who graduated between 2019 and 2024. This analysis represents the world seen through the lens of LinkedIn data, drawn from the anonymized and aggregated profile information of LinkedIn\u2019s members around the world.\nAdditional insights\nData reflects aggregated public member data from active LinkedIn profiles and includes alumni profiles associated with the program on LinkedIn. Top industries and locations measure the most common industries and locations associated with a member\u2019s first job position after graduating. Unique skills were derived from measuring the most frequent skills members added to their profile for a given program, while being more rare across other programs during their undergraduate degree.\nMethodology and insights by: Caroline Liongosari\nCorrection: Dartmouth's undergraduate population is approximately 4,450. A previous version misstated this figure by referring to the size of the Class of 2028 rather than the total undergraduate student body.\nPresident, HealthPro Associates, Inc.\nNowAll great schools. But I have to question the credibility when UCLA, the #1 public university, is excluded! And, yes I have a bias \ud83d\ude0a\nSales and Marketing, Business Development\n2mReally?\n--\n3mHappy to see these Indiana and Michigan universities on the list as well, and these are public schools! 33. Purdue University, 34. University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, 47. Indiana University Bloomington. Kudos to my alma mater 8. University of Notre Dame!!\nPeople, Process, & Policy Integration | Strategic Operations & Enablement Leader | Growth-Stage Builder\n4mAs the Service Academies don't hit the checkbook (they are costly in the commitment that is made), they aren't listed. It's a shame because they produce some of the most dedicated and brightest individuals there are."

      "text": "Across science\u2014from astrophysics to molecular biology to economics\u2014researchers are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of data they are collecting. But, this problem is better viewed as an opportunity since, with the right computing resources and algorithmic tools, scientists might unlock new insights from the swathes of data to carry their field forward.\nAI4science (or artificial intelligence for science) is an initiative at Caltech led by Anima Anandkumar and Yisong Yue that aims to bring together AI researchers with experts from other disciplines to push modern AI tools into every area of science and engineering. Launched in the summer of 2018, the initiative organizes talks, courses, and tutorials aimed at training researchers from across the scientific spectrum in the theory and practice of machine learning algorithms. Weekly AI4science office hours also allow researchers to ask computer scientists for help\u2014hopefully stimulating new interdisciplinary research at Caltech. Additionally, seed grants for researchers applying AI to new applications in the sciences are allocated yearly through the Carver Mead New Adventures program.\nHere are a few examples of Caltech professors transferring artificial intelligence and machine learning research to other disciplines.\nTo find out more about this new initiative, visit the AI4science website.\nAI4neuro\nJoel Burdick, Richard L. and Dorothy M. Hayman Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Bioengineering, is applying machine learning algorithms (some designed by Caltech's Professor Yisong Yue) to help patients with spinal cord injuries to walk again. The so-called \"neural prosthesis\" is a device which plugs into a human's nerve endings, reads the electrical signals and uses them to control a mobility-assisting device.\nAI4climate\nAndrew Stuart, Bren Professor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, is applying machine learning algorithms to build more fine-grained climate models. Working with Professor Tapio Schneider in Caltech's Climate Dynamics Group, Stuart hopes to build better predictive models of the Earth's changing climate.\nAI4physics\nMaria Spiropulu, Professor of Physics, is applying machine learning methods to try to make sense of the floods of data coming in from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Currently most of the roughly one petabyte of data collected every second at CERN must be thrown away, so even deciding which data to keep is an important problem in the hunt for signals in the dark.\nAwards\nThe flagship programs of the AI4Science initiative are the selection of AI4Science Graduate and Postdoctoral Fellows and the Cloud Credit Grant program, both of which are sponsored by Amazon AWS. The recipients of this are listed below. Additionally, the AI4Science initiative sponsors awards through the Carver Mead New Adventures Fund and organizes workshops, seminars, summer schools, and other events centered around AI and its applications.\nAI4Science/Amazon AWS Fellows\nZhoufan (Francesca) Li (Advisor: Frances H.
