      "text": "In exclusive interviews with Fox News Digital, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev described a U.S.-brokered peace deal as a \"historic\" opportunity to end more than three decades of conflict and to launch a new era of cooperation in the South Caucasus.\nSpeaking separately, both leaders credited former President Donald Trump and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff for guiding months of negotiations that produced the framework agreement.\nThey outlined plans for trade, infrastructure and investment while acknowledging that key political and humanitarian issues may still need to be resolved before the deal is finalized.\nTRUMP TO HOST ARMENIA, AZERBAIJAN LEADERS AHEAD OF PEACE PLEDGE AS WHITE HOUSE EYES NOBEL PEACE PRIZE\nCompeting views on constitutional changes\nAliyev said the agreement cannot be formally signed until Armenia amends its constitution, which he claims still questions Azerbaijani sovereignty.\n\"It\u2019s kind of their homework,\" Aliyev said. \"As soon as it is done \u2026 the final peace agreement will be signed.\"\nPashinyan rejected that condition, insisting Armenia is already committed to respecting territorial integrity and has \"no territorial claims\" towards any neighbor. He confirmed that his government is drafting a new constitution but called it an \"internal issue\" unrelated to the peace terms.\nEconomic cooperation and the TRIPP corridor\nOne central pillar of the deal is the creation of the \"TRIPP corridor,\" or Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, a transport and trade route designed to connect Armenia and Azerbaijan more directly while integrating the South Caucasus into broader international shipping and energy networks.\nAliyev called the project \"one of the important parts of international transportation,\" saying it would link the Caspian Sea region with markets in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The corridor is expected to carry goods, energy supplies, and potentially serve as a rail hub for cross-regional trade.\nPashinyan described the agreement to open communications \"based on principles of territorial integrity, sovereignty, jurisdiction, reciprocity and internationally recognized borders\" as a breakthrough.\n\"Now we have de facto peace \u2026 it is time to have common investment projects, to have economic cooperation,\" he said. \"The involvement of the U.S. will make this whole story even more attractive for potential investors.\"\nHumanitarian issues remain\nThe status of refugees and detainees from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains unsettled. Tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians fled the region after Azerbaijan regained control in the 2020 war and a 2023 military operation. Many resettled in Armenia, but disputes continue over the right to return, property claims and the fate of those detained during and after the fighting.\nAzerbaijan maintains that prisoners in its custody are combatants or saboteurs, while Armenia and international human rights groups describe many of them as political prisoners. Pashinyan cautioned that raising \"very sensitive issues\" too aggressively could risk reigniting tensions.\n\"The issue of refugees is important, but we need to concentrate on signing the peace agreement \u2026 to poke continuously some very sensitive issues could revive the conflict, you know, and I think it is very important now for both Armenia and Azerbaijan to concentrate on implementation what already has been agreed.\"\nFROM TALK TO TACTICS: TRUMP PIVOTS ON RUSSIA STRATEGY TO END WAR\nPraise for Trump, criticism of Biden\nAliyev praised Trump\u2019s direct involvement in the peace process and criticized what he called unfair portrayals of Azerbaijan under the Biden administration. He pointed to Azerbaijan\u2019s cooperation with U.S. military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and said Trump\u2019s return to active diplomacy made the current breakthrough possible.\n\"It was only President Trump \u2026 immediately he jumped in the [peace] process,\" Aliyev said, adding that if Trump had remained in office after the 2020 election, \"probably what we are experiencing today \u2026 [would have happened] earlier.\"\nWhite House ceremony and regional significance\nThe interviews came hours after Pashinyan and Aliyev joined Trump at the White House to announce the agreement \u2014 a rare moment of public unity in a region long defined by war, blockades and mistrust.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhile the framework sets the stage for normalized relations, both leaders acknowledged that decades of hostility will not disappear overnight. \"It isn\u2019t possible to change everything during a day, a week or even a year,\" Pashinyan said. \"But this is a very bright expression of what we want \u2014 both leaders, President Aliyev and myself \u2014 we want to change this whole situation.\"\nFor Trump, the event marked a high-profile example of his deal-making credentials on the world stage. For Armenia and Azerbaijan, it was a step toward a future that both say they are ready to build \u2014 if the remaining disputes can be resolved."

      "text": "New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani traveled uptown to the Bronx on Thursday for the fourth day of his \"Five Boroughs Against Trump\" tour, arguing that President Donald Trump's administration is hurting small businesses.\n\"We are here today on the fourth stop of our five borough tour, to speak about how Bronx sites can not afford the city that they call home, Mamdani said. \"That is a struggle that many residents of the Bronx feel individually. It's also a struggle that I know our small businesses are feeling at this moment. From 2020 to 2022, the population of the Bronx dropped by 6.3%. That's more than any other borough in New York City. People are leaving this further, leaving this city because it's too expensive. We are the most expensive city in the United States of America.\"\nThroughout the week, Mamdani has connected Trump to his leading competitor in the race, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani in June and is now running as an independent candidate.\nThe theme continued on Thursday as the Mamdani campaign visited Nohble, a small business in the Bronx, where he argued that both Trump and Cuomo have handed \"tax breaks to billionaires and megacorporations\" throughout their political careers. Meanwhile, Mamdani has made affordability the central message of his campaign.\nTrump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" which narrowly passed Congress last month, has been widely celebrated by Republicans for extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts and adding deductions on tipped wages and overtime, while reducing spending on Medicaid and clean energy and strengthening border security.\nBut Democrats have been quick to claim that Trump's megabill handed tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting benefits to the most vulnerable \u2013 a key Democratic message ahead of competitive midterm elections expected in 2026.\nMAMDANI ZINGS CUOMO IN RENT-STABILIZED HOUSING SPAT DURING ANTI-TRUMP TOUR STOP\nWhile Republicans argue the bill only cuts waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), about 10 million more people will be uninsured by 2034 due to Trump's mega-bill.\nAs national Democrats slam Trump's tax breaks, Mamdani has criticized Cuomo's own record as governor, which includes offering $3 billion in tax breaks for the failed Amazon HQ2 deal in Queens, expanding $420 million-a-year film industry credits and launching \"Tax-Free NY\" zones to give businesses 10 years without state taxes.\nThroughout the week, Mamdani has criticized Cuomo following The New York Times report that Trump spoke on the phone with Cuomo about how to defeat Mamdani in November. Meanwhile, Mamdani has described how his administration would be Trump's \"worst nightmare.\"\n\"As we see Donald Trump and Andrew Cuomo trip over themselves to reward those who already have a fortune, we will stand up and fight for those that have been forgotten,\" Mamdani said on Staten Island on Wednesday at an anti-Trump event focused on immigration.\nTrump made waves on the 2024 presidential campaign trail when he held a rally in the Bronx and then visited a local barber shop in the borough.\nThe focus on deep blue New York City was seen as politically unusual for a Republican candidate, but Trump spent weeks in New York City for his criminal trial and often used the Big Apple as his own personal campaign trail.\nDuring the rally, Trump vowed to \"turn New York City around,\" promising to make the city \"bigger, better and greater than ever before.\"\nThe Republican candidate also spoke with voters at Knockout Barbershop in the Bronx, taking questions from locals grappling with economic hardship.\n\"We see far too many parallels between Donald Trump and Andrew Cuomo, far too many stories that make clear that both administrations have been characterized by corruption, by a sense of impunity, by an inability of an executive to understand that no means no, a prioritization of the interests of billionaires over working people, and an agenda that is driven by little else beyond the retention and accumulation of power,\" Mamdani said on Monday in Manhattan.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's comment request, but said on Monday, ahead of Mamdani's first anti-Trump event, \"The American people have repeatedly rejected this Communist agenda and the more Mamdani shares his radical policies, the more the American people will recoil.\""

      "text": "FIRST ON FOX \u2014 A pro-Trump legal group founded by White House aide Stephen Miller filed a FOIA request Thursday seeking all crime records and data compiled by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, as part of an effort to scrutinize information and crime statistics that senior adminis tration officials allege have been \"manipulated.\"\nThe request by the America First Legal Foundation (AFL) includes demands for a wide range of documents from D.C.'s police force, including all email communications or internal guidance reflecting any changes in the department's tracking or reporting of crimes in the city, as well as any records \"reflecting the falsification or non-publication\" of crime data and statistics, among other things.\nIt is part of a broader investigation AFL launched on Thursday, just four days after President Donald Trump issued his order to temporarily federalize D.C. both by deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops into the city, and temporarily taking federal control of D.C.'s police force to crack down on crime.\nIn the FOIA request, AFL also asked for records of \"all communications\" related to Michael Pulliam, the D.C. police officer who was placed on administrative leave in May, after he was accused of changing crime statistics to minimize crimes.\nTRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON VOTING BLOCKED BY FEDERAL JUDGES AMID FLURRY OF LEGAL SETBACKS\nPulliam formerly served as a police commander for the Metropolitan Police Department's Third District, which includes Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights.\nThe Pulliam investigation has become something of a political lightning rod in recent days, as Trump officials have pointed to the investigation and his leave as evidence that MPD has sought to manipulate or massage crime statistics in the nation's capital.\nNews of the AFL probe comes as President Donald Trump and White House officials have blasted what they describe as a \"ridiculous\" amount of crime in D.C., and claimed repeatedly that the crime statistics in question might not be an accurate portrayal of the situation on the ground \u2014 something critics argue is simply justification for the administration to push through its executive order.\nWhite House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told NewsNation in an interview earlier this week that Washington, D.C., \"is more violent than Baghdad.\"\n\"As each day passes, new horrific examples of violent crime are reported across the district,\" AFL's lead attorney, Will Scolinos, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"AFL is investigating whether, as described by recent reports, official D.C. crime statistics may have been deliberately falsified to make the city seem safer than it is.\"\n\"President Trump has stepped up to make Washington D.C. safer for all residents and visitors to the nation\u2019s capital\u2014but the Left is lockstep in defending D.C. as \u2018safe enough.'\" Scolinos added. \"Americans know better.\"\nTrump, in his August 11 executive order, declared a \"crime emergency\" in the nation's capital. That order invokes Section 740 of D.C.'s Home Rule Act, saying that federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department is needed to maintain law and order in D.C to protect the nation's capital \u2014 including federal buildings, property, and monuments\u2014 and to ensure \"conditions necessary\" for the orderly functioning of the federal government.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nIn announcing their investigation Thursday, the AFL also cited a report published Thursday morning by the Washington Free Beacon involving a D.C. settlement agreement with a former police sergeant, Charlotte Djossou, who allegedly sued MPD leaders in 2020 for \"misclassifying offenses\" to deflate D.C. crime statistics.\nThat settlement was not included in AFL's FOIA request, and Fox News Digital could not immediately confirm the details of the report, or the nature of the settlement agreement in question.\nStill, news of the AFL probe comes as senior Trump officials and allies of the president have seized on the Pulliam investigation as a means of calling into question the accuracy of federal crime data in D.C. The administration has sought to undermine preliminary federal statistics published in January 2025 that said violent crime in the nation's capital had dropped to its lowest point in more than 30 years.\nFEDERAL JUDGES GRILL TRUMP LAWYERS OVER 'LIBERATION DAY' TARIFFS ON EVE OF ENFORCEMENT\nD.C. officials, for their part, have conceded that the drop in violent crime might be overstated (data on the MPD website now shows a 26% drop between 2023 and 2024).\nBut they've pushed back on the notion that artificially deflated crime data is to blame. In an interview with NBC News earlier this week, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said that a recent review of all MPD crime data found 552 fewer victims of violent crime in the first eight months of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. Crime is down across all seven districts, with anomalies in just one, she told NBC.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,\" she said in a televised interview Sunday.\nAmerica First Legal, though not officially part of the Trump administration, was founded by longtime Trump advisor Stephen Miller after Trump's first presidential term. Miller stepped down from AFL before rejoining the White House in 2025 as Trump's deputy chief of staff."

      "text": "President Donald Trump said Thursday that Sen. Elizabeth Warren has \"got to take a drug test\" when asked to respond to her claims of him trying to cut Social Security.\nTrump made the remark during an event at the White House celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act, where the president said he would strengthen the program \"for generations to come.\"\n\"It's so vicious what they do. Elizabeth Warren said she was an Indian. We call her Pocahontas. She's a liar. She lied her whole career,\" Trump said. \"Based on the fact that she was an Indian, she was able to get into certain colleges, get certain jobs, get into certain universities to work there. And she's a liar and a mean person.\n\"She's a nutjob. I watched her the other night. She's all hopped up endorsing a communist in New York City, and she was all excited and jumping up and down,\" Trump said in reference to Warren supporting democratic socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. \"She's got to take a drug test. She really, though, she's got to take a drug test. There's no way somebody can act that way and be normal.\"\nTOP DEMOCRAT SENATOR REVEALS SOCIALIST MAMDANI IS WHAT HER PARTY SHOULD LOOK LIKE\nWarren, a Democrat representing Massachusetts, wrote an op-ed for Fox News earlier this year in which she said that under the Trump administration, \"Social Security is under attack like it has never been before.\n\"Billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said seniors won\u2019t complain if they miss a Social Security check. Elon Musk called Social Security the \u2018world\u2019s biggest Ponzi scheme.\u2019 Musk then sent his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to gut the agency by indiscriminately firing workers, closing down offices, and trying to cut phone services,\" Warren wrote.\nWARREN: SOCIAL SECURITY IS UNDER ATTACK.

      "text": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration is announcing the launch of a new tool it says will be instrumental in enabling agencies across the federal government to efficiently implement artificial intelligence at scale and take a major step forward rolling out the president's \"AI Action Plan.\"\nTrump's U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) said on Thursday it has launched USAi, a tool the agency describes as a \"secure generative artificial intelligence evaluation suite that enables federal agencies to experiment with and adopt artificial intelligence at scale\u2014faster, safer, and at no cost to them.\"\nThe agency says that the platform, available starting Thursday at 10 a.m. through USAi.gov, gives government users access to \"powerful\" tools like chat-based AI, code generation and document summarization with the goal of \"supercharging employee productivity.\"\n\"USAi isn\u2019t just another tool, it\u2019s infrastructure for America\u2019s AI future,\" GSA Chief Information Officer David Shive explained. \"USAi helps the government cut costs, improve efficiency, and deliver better services to the public, while maintaining the trust and security the American people expect.\"\nAI TECH DETECTS HIDDEN HEART DISEASE DOCTORS OFTEN MISS\nGSA Deputy Administrator Stephen Ehikian told Fox News Digital that this latest application is an \"on ramp\" to A.I. that will be the \"tip of the spear\" on the A.I. front similar to the way GSA previously implemented the cloud.\nThe Trump administration rolled out its A.I. Action Plan in July after Trump ordered the federal government in January to develop a plan of action for artificial intelligence in order to \"solidify our position as the global leader in AI and secure a brighter future for all Americans.\"\nTrump has made U.S. A.I. growth a cornerstone of his administration, such as notching multi-billion deals with high-tech firms such as Oracle and OpenAI for the Stargate project, which is an effort to launch large data centers in the U.S, as well as a $90 billion energy and tech investment deal specifically for the state of Pennsylvania to make it the U.S. hub for AI.\n\"USAi means more than access\u2014it\u2019s about delivering a competitive advantage to the American people,\" GSA Deputy Administrator Stephen Ehikian said in press release.\n\"The launch of USAi shows how GSA is translating President Trump\u2019s AI strategy into action and accelerating AI adoption across government. USAi will put mission-ready tools directly into the hands of agencies to modernize faster, boost security, and lead globally.\"\nThe A.I. Action Plan includes a three-pillar approach focused on American workers, free speech and protecting U.S.-built technologies.\n\"We want to center America's workers, and make sure they benefit from AI,\" A.I. and crypto czar David Sacks told the media in July when details of the A.I. plan were made public.\nSCOOP: TRUMP ADMIN, OPENAI PARTNER TO UNLEASH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\"The second is that we believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy. And then the third principle that cuts across the pillars is that we believe we have to prevent our advanced technologies from being misused or stolen by malicious actors. And we also have to monitor for emerging and unforeseen risks from AI.\"\nAdvancing the federal government's use of A.I. and expanding employee access are core to the GSA\u2019s efforts to fulfill Trump\u2019s directive to preserve U.S. leadership in the global technology race, GSA Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum explained to Fox Digital in an interview earlier this month.\n\"As we kind of examined the President's AI action plan, heard the call to action of, \u2018Hey, this is a race, and we are going to win this race.\u2019 From our perspective, all that meant, synonymously, was widespread adoption,\" he told Fox Digital of delivering AI to federal employees.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe rollout of the USAi tool follows GSA announcing earlier in August that OpenAI's ChatGPT Enterprise is now available to all federal agencies to incorporate into their workflow at $1 per agency. The deal with OpenAI, the tech company behind ChatGPT, is part of GSA's OneGov Strategy that aims to modernize \"how the federal government purchases goods and services\" under the Trump administration.\nGSA also notched another deal with A.I. company Anthropic this month providing all three branches of government access to large language model Claude.\nGruenbaum told Fox News Digital that Thursday's announcement will be critical for agencies for creating efficiencies to help turn the federal workforce into \"the most nimble, smart, efficient, agile, and agentically tech-forward workforce out there so that this country can continue to compete and win the AI race.\""

      "text": "The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan brushed off any threat of backlash from neighboring powers Iran and Russia following a U.S.-brokered peace accord \u2014 an agreement hailed as the start of a new era, ending more than three decades of war and hostility in the South Caucasus.\nIn exclusive Fox News Digital interviews, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev both praised President Donald Trump and his envoy for their role in brokering the framework agreement. They emphasized that the deal, which promised increased regional economic integration and political cooperation, is not directed at any third party \u2014 and may actually provide strategic advantages to Moscow and Tehran.\n\"This is not a zero-sum game,\" Pashinyan said. The agreement \"contains quite tangible benefits for Iran and for Russia as well.\"\n\"Iran would have access through railway from the Persian Gulf to the Black Sea and Russia and Iran will have opportunity to have a railway connection between the two countries.\"\nRussia \u2014 a long-standing ally of Armenia and a presence in the region through its border guards \u2014 welcomed peace but sent a warning about U.S. involvement. Its foreign ministry described the accord as \"positive,\" expressing hope for stability in the Caucasus, but warned that foreign involvement should complement, not complicate, the peace process.\nThe ministry emphasized that regional solutions should include neighbors like Russia, Iran and Turkey, and cautioned against repeating the pitfalls of Western-led interventions in the Middle East.\nAliyev echoed Pashinyan\u2019s remarks and declined to see U.S. diplomatic involvement as a provocation toward Moscow.\n\"It will be very difficult for any country \u2014 whether far away or in our region \u2014 to say something bad about today\u2019s agreement,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"We\u2019ve taken the final step toward peace.\"\nHe added: \"It\u2019s not against anyone. It\u2019s a connectivity project which will be one of the most important parts of international transportation.\"\nAt the heart of the pact is the planned Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP) \u2014 a roughly 27-mile transit route linking mainland Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave, passing through Armenian territory. Armenia has granted the U.S. exclusive development rights via a 99\u2011year lease, allowing for infrastructure projects such as roads, rail lines, pipelines, fiber optics and possibly power transmission, aimed at opening new trade and transit paths in the region.\nThis bold move shifts regional dynamics, offering Washington a powerful strategic foothold while bypassing traditional Russian and Iranian routes.\nIran, in contrast, has responded with hostility.\nAli Akbar Velayati, a key advisor to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, warned of serious consequences if the \"Zangezur Corridor\" \u2014 as Iran calls the route \u2014 is enacted, asserting that it \"will not become a passage owned by Trump, but rather a graveyard for Trump\u2019s mercenaries,\" according to the semi-official news agency Tasnim.\nIran has even signaled readiness to use military means to block the route.\nZELENSKYY NOT INVITED TO UPCOMING TRUMP, PUTIN TALKS \u2013 WHITE HOUSE SAYS THIS WAS THE REASON\nDomestically, Pashinyan faces opposition. Armenian nationalists, already fierce critics of any deal with Azerbaijan, view the agreement as a betrayal. The Republican Party of Armenia has declared that Pashinyan lacks the mandate to sign such a treaty, demanding full transparency and an end to concessions made under external pressure.\nPashinyan, however, is undeterred. He said the accord could transform Armenia\u2019s investment climate and attract foreign capital.\n\"We expect to have some criticism, and that\u2019s part of democracy,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"But we are confident we made the right decision.\"\nOnce the dominant power in the South Caucasus, Russia is losing its grip. The war in Ukraine, mounting sanctions and resource strains have depleted its regional influence, enabling the U.S., Turkey and the European Union to expand their diplomatic reach.\nRelations with Azerbaijan particularly soured following the December 2024 downing of Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243. Aliyev accused Moscow of accidentally shooting the passenger jet with Russian air defenses during operations against Ukrainian drones, killing 38 people.\nAliyev told Fox News Digital he didn't believe the incident was an intentional attack by Russian leadership, but demanded a formal admission of guilt, punishment for those responsible and full compensation \u2014 moves Russia has resisted, apologizing only vaguely for what they called a \"tragic incident.\"\nAnd amid political divisions, Pashinyan finds himself in a conflict with one of the country's most respected institutions \u2014 the Armenian Apostolic Church, where figures like Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan have led public protests against Pashinyan\u2019s decision to return border villages to Azerbaijan.\nOn June 25, authorities arrested Galstanyan, a leading figure in the church and of the \"Sacred Struggle\" opposition movement, accusing him of orchestrating a terrorist plot to overthrow the government. Armenia's Investigative Committee alleged he had recruited more than 1,000 former police and military personnel to stage bombings, disrupt power grids and paralyze transportation networks.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nPashinyan assured that the judiciary system acted independently of his government and \"in full accordance with the law of Armenia, respecting all the rights of all people.\""

      "text": "Actor Jussie Smollett on Wednesday offered fresh criticism of the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and the city's former mayor, Rahm Emanuel, calling them \"villains\" for their role in his conviction over an alleged hate crime hoax.\nSmollett, who is Black and gay, originally reported to Chicago police that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two men wearing ski masks in January 2019.\nHe was convicted in 2021 of staging the hate crime himself, but it was later overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court on due process grounds, ruling that Smollett had originally reached an agreement with the state to avoid prosecution. The court did not rule on the actor's guilt or innocence in the case.\n\"The villains are the two people who assaulted me, the Chicago Police Department and, if I may be so brave, the mayor,\" Smollett told Variety, referencing Emanuel, who served as the mayor of Chicago from 2011 to 2019.\nJUSSIE SMOLLETT DONATES $50,000 TO CHARITY IN CHICAGO SETTLEMENT, MAINTAINS HIS INNOCENCE\nAccording to Variety, the former \"Empire\" star alleged that the \"Chicago establishment\" conspired to frame him and questioned whether Emanuel played a part in covering up evidence in the police killing of a Black teenager in Chicago \u2014 a case that led a federal judge to order the CPD to adopt dozens of reforms just two days after Smollett reported being attacked.\n\"Could it be that they had just found out about the missing minutes and the missing tape from the murder of Laquan McDonald? Could it be that the mayor helped hide that?\" Smollett asked, referencing the police killing of teenager Laquan McDonald in 2014. \"We\u2019re living in a world where the higher-ups, their main mission, in order to do all of the underhanded things that they\u2019re doing, is to distract us with the shiny object.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to the CPD and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel for comment but did not immediately receive responses. Emanuel declined comment to Variety.\nVariety reported that Smollett became \"worked up\" as he maintained his original story, that he was attacked by two masked MAGA supporters who shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him before placing a noose around his neck and pouring bleach on him.\nWhile he refrained from criticizing the two brothers who claimed to have helped the actor stage the hate crime hoax, Smollett contended that he is the only person involved with the case whose story hasn't changed multiple times.\n\"All I can say is, God bless you, and I hope it was worth it,\" he told the outlet in reference to the brothers. \"Every single other person\u2019s story has changed multiple times. Mine has never. I have nothing to gain from this.\"\nIn reference to an upcoming documentary by Netflix titled \"The Truth About Jussie Smollett?\" \u2014 which hints that the actor may be innocent after all \u2014 Variety asked Smollett why the \"exculpatory evidence\" of his innocence didn't emerge sooner.\n\"To be honest with you, I don\u2019t really know,\" he told the outlet. \"I\u2019m not an investigative reporter or a detective. I can\u2019t sit and tell you exactly, beat by beat, what happened. I can only tell you what did not happen. And what did not happen is the story that\u2019s been out there for almost seven years, that somehow I would have even a reason to do something as egregious as this.\"\nSmollett also described how he felt once the CPD shifted its focus from investigating the alleged hate crime to investigating, and eventually arresting, the actor himself. The former \"Empire\" star likened his experience to that of the late \"King of Pop,\" Michael Jackson, who faced multiple sexual abuse allegations and police investigations before and after his eventual death, which Smollett suggested were part of a broader conspiracy.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\"I saw firsthand how narratives are built. I saw firsthand the way that someone can take the exact opposite of who you are and literally sell it,\" he told the outlet. \"And people will be like, \u2018I believe it!\u2019 God rest his soul, but homeboy Michael Jackson tried to warn us.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSmollett reached a settlement with the City of Chicago in May, agreeing to donate $50,000 to charity as part of the agreement to have a lawsuit against him dismissed.\nFox News' Lauryn Overhultz contributed to this report."

      "text": "A former top executive for liberal billionaire George Soros' Open Society Foundations (OSF) between 2017 and 2020 is back in the spotlight amid reports highlighting his involvement with Zohran Mamdani's New York City mayoral campaign and connecting Obama world to the campaign.\nPatrick Gaspard, who has served in several high-profile political positions, including advising former President Barack Obama's historic 2008 campaign, serving as the Democratic National Committee's executive director, and being tapped as the Center for American Progress (CAP) president in 2021, has been informally advising Mamdani on the side and recently introduced Obama campaign architect David Axelrod to him, a recent New York Times article revealed.\nA New York Times opinion piece that was published on Wednesday explained how Obama world operatives were starting to coalesce around Mamdani and have been in communication with his campaign behind the scenes. Obama reportedly called Mamdani after his Democratic primary victory in June, offering advice about the importance of governing and giving constituents optimism in dark times.\nGaspard, who was reportedly at Mamdani's victory party in late June, has played a growing role advising Mamdani and accompanying him to meetings, the piece noted. He also introduced Axelrod to Mamdani last month when the former Obama advisor visited the campaign headquarters in Manhattan.\n\"What I found when I went over to that office was a familiar spirit that I hadn\u2019t seen in a while of just determined, upbeat idealism,\" Axelrod told the Times. \"You may not agree with every answer he\u2019s giving, or every idea he has, but he\u2019s certainly asking the right questions, which is how do we make the country work for working people?\"\nEarlier this year, Fox News Digital reported that the Mamdani campaign has been dishing out millions to a media strategist with ties to the Obama world through Axelrod and David Plouffe.\nThe piece also noted how former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau and former Obama advisor Dan Pfeiffer, who are often referred to as the \"Obama bros\" of the \"Pod Save America\" podcast, were in contact with a top Mamdani advisor and have been keeping close tabs on the race. While Obama world's influence could play a major role over the next couple of months ahead of the general election, Gaspard's past ties to the Soros foundations could help Mamdani tap into wealthy donors who support his agenda.\nGaspard, who made millions of dollars serving as the OSF president between 2017 and 2020, has been a staunch defender of Soros, saying earlier this year that he was \"inspired by the selection of my friend George Soros, who is one of our leading defenders of inclusive and accountable democracy and vibrant civil society,\" after then-President Joe Biden announced he would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\"His accomplishments, in the face of distortions and threats from extremists, will be lauded well into the future,\" he continued. In a long 2023 X thread, Gaspard also attempted to deflect blame away from Soros amid reports that Soros and his network were pouring millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of radical DAs and far-left groups that emphasized social justice programs and gave lenient sentences to violent criminals.\n\"George Soros is as concerned about public safety as anyone else. But he recognizes that our criminal justice system is badly broken, and in need of new ideas and new approaches \u2013 a view that enjoyed bipartisan consensus in the before times,\" Gaspard claimed.\n\"It is also important to note that in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and all over the country voters keep electing and re-electing reformers,\" he continued. \"To suggest that the reason they are doing so is because of Soros contributions is an insult to ordinary people.\"\nThe Mamdani campaign has already benefited from several far-left groups who have received tens of millions of dollars in funding from OSF over the years, including the democratic socialist-friendly Working Families Party, which has received over $23 million from OSF, the New York Post reported last month.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe report went on to say that Gaspard has played a \"key role\" in guiding Mamdani through the campaign and listed several of the groups that are aligned with or have endorsed Mamdani, which include Jewish Voice for Peace Action, Make The Road Action and Community Voices Heard.\nJewish Voice for Peace Action has established itself as one of the most prominent groups in the country speaking out against Israel and Fox News Digital previously reported that the group was active at college campuses in 2024 backing anti-Israel protests.\nInfluence Watch describes the group as \"a left-wing, nominally Jewish group that opposes U.S. assistance to the state of Israel and supports allowing Palestinians to live on land within Israel vacated by Arabs during the Israeli War of Independence.\"\nThe Center for American Progress, Fox News Digital previously reported, played a significant role in staffing and policymaking in the Biden administration, with at least 70 CAP employees leaving the group to fill key posts within the administration.\nFox News Digital reached out to the Mamdani campaign and Gaspard for comment."

More than 40% of Roblox's users are under the age of 12, she said, adding that the lawsuit was part of a broader effort to address an uptick in sex crimes against minors.\n\"The number of tips that come in now compared to the number of tips that we used to get about 10 years ago, it's stunning,\" Murrill said. \"The numbers have gone up exponentially. \u2026 It's become so much harder because of social media sites that not only invite our children in but they facilitate their exploitation.\""

      "text": "The former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed 10 years ago for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples is now asking the Supreme Court to review its landmark decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, with her attorney telling Fox News Digital there\u2019s a \"good chance\" it will end up on their docket.\nKim Davis, a devout Christian, made national headlines in 2015 when she refused to sign the marriage licenses of same-sex couples over her religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. Davis' lawyer, Mat Staver, is helping her appeal a ruling that she must pay $360,000 in legal fees and expenses to plaintiffs David Ermold and David Moore.\n\"The First Amendment should be an absolute defense to Kim Davis. And secondly, we're asking the Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell, the 2015 decision that ultimately caused this problem in the first place,\" Staver told Fox News Digital.\n\"For them not to review the matter I think is terrible for Kim Davis and also terrible for the country because they've damaged the Constitution and only the court can fix it,\" Staver added.\nDECADE AFTER LANDMARK RULING, REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR SAME-SEX MARRIAGE CRATERS\nStaver also told Fox News Digital, \"I think we have a good chance at having the Supreme Court take up this case because you have three of the justices still on the bench that were part of the four dissenters in 2015\" in Obergefell v. Hodges, \"including the chief justice, who gave a very strong dissent.\"\n\"There's only two justices still on the bench that were on the bench in the majority in 2015, and that would be Kagan and Sotomayor,\" Staver added. \"This is the case with the most compelling facts that can challenge and overturn Obergefell.\"\nREAD THE ORDER BELOW. APP USERS, CLICK HERE:\nThe case, if it reaches the Supreme Court, would be heard by Justices Clarence Thomas, John Roberts and Samuel Alito, who dissented to Obergefell v. Hodges; Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagen, who affirmed the decision; and four newly appointed justices.\nIn March, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit wrote in a ruling that \"As Davis sees it, issuing Plaintiffs a marriage license would have violated her own constitutionally protected religious beliefs; thus, she asserts, she cannot be held liable. We disagree.\"\n\"Davis cannot raise a Free Exercise Clause defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect,\" the ruling added.\nREVISITING JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019S SAME-SEX MARRIAGE DISSENT: PROPHETIC OR INFLAMMATORY?\nA petition for writ of certiorari filed last month on behalf of Davis is appealing that decision.\n\"Obergefell was wrong when it was decided and it is wrong today because it was grounded entirely on the legal fiction of substantive due process,\" the filing said.\n\"Overturning Obergefell would not undo any marriage licenses in effect at the time. All marriage licenses, including those between same-sex couples, would continue to be recognized. They would be \u2018grandfathered.\u2019 Going forward, marriage would return to the states as it was prior to Obergefell. It would be up to each state to define marriage,\" it added.\nWilliam Powell, an attorney representing Ermold and Moore, and a Senior Counsel with the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, told Fox News Digital that \"We are confident the Supreme Court, like the court of appeals, will conclude that Davis's arguments do not merit further attention.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Marriage equality is settled law,\" he added.\nFox News Digital\u2019s Maria Lencki contributed to this report."

      "text": "California is center stage on Thursday in the national battle over congressional redistricting ahead of next year's midterm elections.\nTwo-term Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom teamed up with congressional Democrats and legislative leaders in the heavily blue state at an event in Los Angeles.\nThat's where they unveiled their game plan to counter the push by President Donald Trump and Republicans to create up to five GOP-friendly congressional districts in Texas at the expense of currently Democrat-controlled seats.\n\"Today is liberation day in the state of California,\" Newsom said. \"Donald Trump, you have poked the bear and we will punch back.\"\nNEWSOM VOWS TO FIGHT \u2018FIRE WITH FIRE\u2019 IN CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING BATTLE\nAnd Newsom vowed to \"meet fire with fire\" with his push for rare\u2014but not unheard of\u2014mid-decade redistricting.\nNewsom says Trump missed a deadline to stand down on his push to redistrict in Texas.\n\"DONALD \u2018TACO\u2019 TRUMP, AS MANY CALL HIM, \u2018MISSED\u2019 THE DEADLINE!!! CALIFORNIA WILL NOW DRAW NEW, MORE \u2018BEAUTIFUL MAPS,\u2019 THEY WILL BE HISTORIC AS THEY WILL END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY (DEMS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE!),\" Newsom wrote earlier this week in a social media post posted by his press office, which was meant to mock how Trump writes his own social media posts.\n\"BIG PRESS CONFERENCE THIS WEEK WITH POWERFUL DEMS AND GAVIN NEWSOM \u2014 YOUR FAVORITE GOVERNOR \u2014 THAT WILL BE DEVASTATING FOR \u2018MAGA.\u2019 THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER! \u2014 GN,\" he added.\nThe Republican push in Texas, which comes at Trump's urging, is part of a broader effort by the GOP across the country to pad their razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\nNEWSOM DEMANDS TRUMP GIVE UP TEXAS REDISTRICTING PUSH\nTrump and his political team are aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House, when Democrats stormed back to grab the House majority in the 2018 midterms.\nBut while the Republican push in Texas to upend the current congressional maps doesn't face constitutional constraints, Newsom's path in California is much more complicated.\nIn GOP-dominated Texas, Republicans plan to enact the new maps they drew up once enough state Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent the legislature from passing the measure return to Texas.\nThe governor is moving to hold a special election this year, to obtain voter approval to undo the constitutional amendments that created the non-partisan redistricting commission. A two-thirds majority vote in the Democrat-dominated California legislature would be needed to hold the referendum.\nDemocratic Party leaders are confident they'll have the votes to push the constitutional amendment and the new proposed congressional maps through the legislature.\n\"Here we are in open and plain sight before one vote is cast in the 2026 midterm election and here [Trump] is once again trying to rig the system,\" Newsom charged.\nNewsom said his plan is \"not complicated. We\u2019re doing this in reaction to a President of the United States that called a sitting governor in the state of Texas and said \u2018find me five seats.\u2019 We\u2019re doing it in reaction to that act.\"\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) charged that \"Newsom\u2019s made it clear: he\u2019ll shred California\u2019s Constitution and trample over democracy - running a cynical, self-serving playbook where Californians are an afterthought and power is the only priority.\"\nBut Newsom defended his actions, saying \"we\u2019re working through a very transparent, temporary and public process. We\u2019re putting the maps on the ballot and putting the power to the people.\"\nThursday's appearance by Newsom, who is considered a likely contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, will also serve as a fundraising kickoff to raise massive amounts of campaign cash needed to sell the redistricting push statewide in California.\nSCHWARZENEGGER'S NEW STARING ROLE: PUSHING BACK AGAINST NEWSOM'S REDISTRICTING DRIVE\nThe non-partisan redistricting commission, created over 15 years ago, remains popular with most Californians, according to public opinion polling.\nThat's why Newsom and California Democratic lawmakers are promising not to scrap the commission entirely, but rather replace it temporarily by the legislature for the next three election cycles.\n\"We will affirm our commitment to the state independent redistricting after the 2030 census, but we asking the voters for their consent to do midterm redistricting,\" Newsom said.\nBut their efforts are opposed by a number of coalition of figures supportive of the non-partisan commission.\nAmong the most visible members is former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the last Republican elected governor in Democrat-dominated California.\nSchwarzenegger, during his tenure as governor, had a starring role in the passage of constitutional amendments in California in 2008 and 2010 that took the power to draw state legislative and congressional districts away from politicians and place it in the hands of an independent commission.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Most people don't really think about an independent commission much, one way or another. And that's both an opportunity and a challenge for Newsom,\" Jack Pitney, an American politics professor at California's Claremont McKenna College, told Fox News.\nBut he added that \"it's going to take a lot of effort and money to energize Democrats and motivate them to show up at the polls\" and that Newsom's effort \"is all about motivating people who don't like Trump.\""
