  "description": "The Oslo music fest boasted highlights from Charli xcx, Queens of the Stone Age, Mk.Gee and more.",
  "content": "Norway\u2019s \u00d8yafestivalen wrapped over the weekend with girl in red \u2014 one of the country\u2019s best musical exports \u2014 bringing a raucous conclusion to four days of genre-spanning music. In addition to the Norwegian singer-songwriter, the Aug. 6-9 festival was headlined by Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Queens of the Stone Age \u2014 an impressive international lineup for a festival that hosts around 20,000 people each day (by most festival standards, that\u2019s a cozy crew).\n\u2022 None Jennifer Lopez Isn't Bugged by Cricket Crawling Up Her Neck Mid-Concert: 'It's Tickling Me!'\n\u2022 None Amid Protests, Mexican Governor Brings Marilyn Manson to State Fair in an Act of 'Cultural Justice'\n\nSituated in Oslo\u2019s lovely T\u00f8yen Park, \u00d8ya Festival is a bit reminiscent of New York City\u2019s Governors Ball back when it took place on Randall\u2019s Island: there are plenty of trees to hide under and thick grass to sit on, so it feels like a functional park, even after four days and thousands of feet (at some outdoor fests, the grass gets trampled into the dirt within hours). Another nice bonus is how accessible the festival is from the city\u2019s (very clean) subway \u2014 or, if you\u2019re feeling more adventurous, it\u2019s an easy 30-minute walk from downtown. The grounds are walkable, too: at most, you\u2019ll stroll 10 minutes between the main stage and the farthest food stand. (Pro tip: the falafel and pastries are fantastic \u2013 really, anything involving bread in Norway is a cut above the usual.) Some of the stages are quite close (all of a one-minute walk apart), though oddly don\u2019t suffer from sonic bleeding. For the most part, the sound quality at \u00d8ya was top-notch \u2014 when Roan was belting out her most challenging notes, you could really feel how magnificent her voice is.\n\nFrom internationally renowned stars to homegrown talent, there was a lot to savor at \u00d8yafestivalen 2025 \u2013 here are some of the best moments Billboard experienced.\n\nBillboard\u2019s travel and accommodations for \u00d8yafestivalen were provided by Music Norway, founded by the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Equality.\n\n\u201cGod, what have you done?\u201d Roan imagines her mother wailing on the irresistible, autobiographical \u201cPink Pony Club.\u201d At \u00d8yafestivalen on Wednesday night (Aug. 6), Roan\u2019s mother \u2013 who was in the audience \u2014 got to hear her daughter and a crowd of some 15,000 fans sing those words back to her. Despite the song\u2019s lyrics to the contrary, one can\u2019t help but think mama was proud. After all, Chappell\u2019s headlining set, which also saw her rip through Heart\u2019s \u201cBarracuda\u201d and give \u201cThe Subway\u201d its first post-release performance, was goddess level.\n\nNorwegian singer-songwriter Anna Lille has some soul-baring moments on her 2025 EP how did I let this get so serious?, but she can also deliver the pop delights, as evidenced during a spirited run-through of unreleased pop tune \u201cManiac.\u201d After her Wednesday set wrapped, Lille struck a couple of Hannah Montana poses as \u201cThe Best of Both Worlds\u201d blared out from the speakers.\n\nEcuadorian-Swiss duo Hermanos Guti\u00e9rrez brought their expressive, reverb-soaked Latin guitars to the fest\u2019s first day, providing the perfect chill soundtrack for a laid-back afternoon set \u2014 and proving that you don\u2019t need theatrics (or even lyrics) to hold a crowd\u2019s attention.\n\nIn addition to playing the proper festival, HILLARI \u2013 an up-and-coming Filipino-Norwegian singer \u2013 performed an acoustic rooftop set Wednesday morning atop Oslo\u2019s historic Folketeater building. The 20-year-old boasts a rich vocal control and an easygoing, commanding stage presence, particularly on her soulful Gen Z anthem \u201cTwo Cents.\u201d (If you live near NYC, you can catch HILLARI IRL on Sept. 10 at Manhattan\u2019s Racket.)\n\nAfter teasing \u201cJoachim Trier summer\u201d during her Coachella set earlier this year, Charli xcx made a surprise appearance at an Oslo movie theater to introduce Sentimental Value, a new film from the Norwegian director, just hours before her headlining set on Thursday (Aug. 7). Between performances of brat tracks at \u00d8ya, she hailed Norway\u2019s \u201cvibe,\u201d \u201cinterior design\u201d and \u201cfilmmakers, if you know what I mean.\u201d Perhaps the British pop star \u2013 who has separate film projects coming up with Aidan Zamiri and Takashi Miike \u2013 has something in the works with Joachim Trier, too?\n\nDuring her Thursday set, Lola Young had the crowd eating out of her hand, at least when that hand wasn\u2019t busy pinching herself. \u201cI\u2019m happy this song was the one to take me places,\u201d Young said, marveling at the massive crowd in front of her before belting out \u201cMessy,\u201d an unapologetic anthem that\u2019s struck a chord with audiences around the globe, taking her to No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Pop Airplay and Alternative Airplay charts.\n\nUp-and-coming singer Tolou recently made waves with \u201cCoco,\u201d a slinky, vibey R&B bop that occupies the unlikely space between Scandinavian and African pop. Though she grew up in Troms\u00f8, one of the northernmost cities in Norway, her father hails from Nigeria, and her rhythmic pop carries both flavors. Wearing a sunshine-yellow shredded skirt, Tolou served vocals and choreo during her performance, especially on the bouncy, early \u201800s pop throwback \u201cDem Boyz.\u201d\n\nYes, Norwegian people have a reputation for being fairly reserved, but thanks to Edvard Munch, Oslo is a great city for a Scream \u2013 and Wet Leg went the extra mile during their jugular-grabbing Thursday show. Amidst a setlist that covered new album faves (\u201cMangetout\u201d) and viral hits (\u201cChaise Longue\u201d), frontwoman Rhian Teasdale led the all-too-ready crowd in a \u201cscream therapy\u201d session. After a sustained 40 seconds of fan-made noise, she flashed a wicked grin: \u201cThat was pretty beautiful.\u201d\n\nRABO, a fresh face on the Norwegian pop scene, impressed not once but twice during the week. On Thursday morning, she captivated a boatload of industry professionals with an acoustic four-song performance. And yes, it was a literal boatload \u2013 RABO sang her effervescent single \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d the unreleased, Marilyn Monroe-inspired \u201cNorma Jean\u201d and two more tunes on a watercraft as it traversed the gorgeous Norwegian fjords. Two days later, she played the proper festival, and despite holding the less-than-enviable 2 p.m. slot, managed to pull in a massive crowd.\n\nThough Queens of the Stone Age are best known for riff-heavy, sludgy rock, they can bring the beauty when they want. During QOTSA\u2019s Friday (Aug. 10) night headlining set, frontman Josh Homme led the crowd, from the front row to the very back, in a sing-along to \u201cEmotion Sickness.\u201d \u201cIt sounds so good,\u201d Homme said as the harmonies hit him on the hillside stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night here.\u201d\n\nPom Poko\u2019s name \u2013 inspired by a 1994 anime by Studio Ghibli \u2013 is more than just a random pop culture reference. The Norwegian four-piece brings the oddball detours and off-kilter sweetness of a Ghibli film to their tuneful, careening garage rock, which injected a sugary, cacophonous energy into the festival\u2019s rock-centric Friday lineup.\n\nAt \u00d8yafestivalen, most of the homegrown talent sang in English but spoke to the crowd in Norwegian; brenn., however, kept it fully local, using Norwegian while bantering with the crowd and belting out their hard-charging rock. And why not? Guitars don\u2019t need a translator.\n\n\u201cOn the way here I we lost all our instruments in Copenhagen, so it sounds a little different,\u201d Nil\u00fcfer Yanya revealed on Thursday with an understandable touch of sadness. \u201cThe festival kindly sorted us out with new ones.\u201d Despite that not-insignificant setback, the British singer-songwriter and her band sounded perfectly at home on their borrowed instruments \u2013 and thankfully, her nuanced vocals aren\u2019t the kind of thing that can get left behind in Denmark.\n\nTouring behind last year\u2019s Romance, Fontaines D.C. have grown into one of the best rock bands on the touring circuit, delivering a deft mix of emotional pathos, rich theatricality and idiosyncratic post-punk on bold, eclectic tracks like \u201cStarburster,\u201d \u201cFavorite\u201d and \u201cBug.\u201d While comparing notes with a variety of attendees, their set was uniformly cited as a favorite.\n\nMarie Ulven Ringheim, aka girl in red, has serious range. From queer indie-pop confessionals like \u201cI Wanna Be Your Girlfriend\u201d to immaculately constructed pop bangers such as \u201cToo Much\u201d to the garage-punk of \u201cBad Idea!\u201d, there seems to be very little the Norwegian singer-songwriter doesn\u2019t excel at \u2014 all of which was on glorious display during her Saturday (Aug. 9) night headlining set.\n\nToward the end of her set, she tagged in Honningbarna, who had brought their blistering Norwegian punk fury to \u00d8ya two nights prior. Together, they turned her \u201cBad Idea!\u201d into a gleefully uninhibited duet: flames licked the stage; electric guitars ripped through the air like buzzsaws; Ringheim raced around the stage like a wildcat. When she and Honningbarna singer Edvard Valberg launched themselves into the front row, crowdsurfing atop a sea of undulating fans without missing a lyric, it may have been the best moment of the entire festival.\n\nOslo\u2019s own Anna of the North shines while making dreamy, cinematic synth-pop \u2013 the kind of laid-back yet earnest music that absolutely makes sense coming from Norway. From the synthy splendor of \u201cLovers\u201d to buoyant new single \u201cGive Me Your Love,\u201d the Norwegian pop star brought exactly the right amount of energy and chill you want from an afternoon set on the final day of a four-day festival.\n\nSomeone up there must be looking out for Mk.gee. On the festival\u2019s final day, the otherwise accommodating Oslo sky opened up, unleashing an absolute deluge \u2013 and he was the only artist performing under a fully-tented stage. \u201cThe rain is doing funky stuff to our gear, but we\u2019re gonna get through it,\u201d the New Jersey artist promised. Mk.gee was greeted with one of the festival\u2019s most hyped crowds, who eagerly sopped up his atmospheric soundscapes and expressive wails. Toward the end of his set, there was a magical moment when the rain relented and an orange-gold blast of sunshine filled the tent. As far as I could tell, mk.gee was the only artist who played an encore during the four-day festival, with the rabid crowd forcing him back onstage for a repeat performance of \u201cRockman.\u201d\n\nSl\u00f8tface, an excellent, lyrically clever Norwegian pop-punk outfit led by Haley Shea, didn\u2019t play the festival this year (they rocked the \u00d8ya stage back in 2023), but they did steal the post-festival spotlight. During Saturday night\u2019s wee hours, Sl\u00f8tface led Oslo night owls (including members of Honningbarna and Brenn.) through a deliriously fun live-band karaoke party that encompassed Kelly Clarkson, Nirvana, Beastie Boys and beyond. Rest assured: the right to party was indeed fought for and won.\n\u2022 None Chart Rewind: In 1989, New Kids on the Block Were 'Hangin' Tough' at No. 1\n\u2022 None H.E.R. & Chris Brown 'Come Through' to No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay Chart\n\nSign up for Billboard's Newsletter.

      "text": "H.E.R. & Chris Brown \u2018Come Through\u2019 to No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay Chart\nThe new champ extends both H.E.R. and Brown's run of chart-topping success at the radio format.\nH.E.R. expands her dominance on Billboard\u2019s Adult R&B Airplay chart as \u201cCome Through,\u201d featuring Chris Brown, climbs to No. 1 on the list dated Jan. 1. The song advances from No. 3 \u2013 having previously reached No. 2 \u2013 despite a less than 1% gain in plays in the week ending Dec. 26, according to MRC Data, to become the most played song on U.S. monitored adult R&B stations. (The previous week\u2019s No. 1, Wizkid\u2019s \u201cEssence,\u201d featuring Tems, falls to No. 2 with a 9% decline in plays.)\n\u201cCome Through\u201d gives singer-songwriter H.E.R. a seventh No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay among 10 total career entries on the chart. With the new addition, here\u2019s her updated roster:\nSong Title, Artist (if other than H.E.R.), Weeks at No. 1, Date Reached No. 1\n\u201cFocus,\u201d one week, Oct. 6, 2018\n\u201cBest Part,\u201d Daniel Caesar featuring H.E.R., four, Oct. 20, 2018\n\u201cSlow Down,\u201d with Skip Marley, three, May 23, 2020\n\u201cMake the Most,\u201d Lonr. featuring H.E.R., one, Oct. 24, 2020\n\u201cGotta Move On,\u201d Toni Braxton featuring H.E.R., two, Feb. 20, 2021\n\u201cDamage,\u201d eight, June 26, 2021\n\u201cCome Through,\u201d featuring Chris Brown, Jan. 1, 2022\nIn addition, a seventh champ pushes H.E.R. into a tie for fourth place for the most No. 1s among all artists since the chart began in 1993. Check out the current leaderboard:\n12, Alicia Keys\n11, Toni Braxton\n8, Charlie Wilson\n7, H.E.R.\n7, Kem\n7, Maxwell\n7, R. Kelly\nFor Chris Brown, meanwhile, \u201cCome Through\u201d sustains his Adult R&B Airplay success streak with a third consecutive leader. The single follows his two other champs, \u201cNo Guidance,\u201d featuring Drake, an 11-week No. 1 in 2020 and \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d with Young Thug, which reigned for seven weeks in 2020-21.\n\u201cCome Through\u201d continues the newfound radio breakthrough for Brown with adult R&B audiences. After some success with his initial 14 chart appearances from 2006-16, the hitmaker has grown into a favorite of adult R&B radio programmers and audiences in recent years. In 2019, he found his first top five success on his 15th try, with \u201cUndecided\u201d reaching No. 4 before the three No. 1s streak.\n\u201cCome Through\u201d appears on H.E.R.\u2019s debut full-length studio album, Back of My Mind. The set, released in June, debuted at No. 1 on Top R&B Albums and led for one week."

      "text": "In Norwegian-Nigerian artist Tolou, the melancholic cool of Scandinavia meets the warm embrace of Africa. It\u2019s this duality of her music \u2013 and her spirit \u2013 that has earned Tolou a global record deal, scores of adoring fans and a promising pathway forward in the industry. But wherever her Afro-Scandi pop talent takes her, Tolou always finds her way home to her mother\u2019s living room floor in the world\u2019s northernmost city of Troms\u00f8, where the pair spend days on end working on a pivotal part of her identity: her microbraids\nDoes musical artist Tolou believe in fate? \u201cGirl, absolutely,\u201d she responds with a smile, a bright blue headband holding her signature, superfine blonde microbraids back from her freckled face. \u201cI believe in God, I believe everything has meaning, that everything happens for a reason,\u201d the Norwegian-Nigerian 26-year-old says. Whether or not you\u2019re also a believer, you can\u2019t deny something powerful is at play when it comes to Tolou\u2019s journey.\nFittingly, it all began in a church. The Arctic Cathedral, to be specific, with its imposing triangular facade jutting out from the mountainous landscape of Troms\u00f8, the northernmost city in the world and Tolou\u2019s Norwegian hometown. \u201cIt\u2019s so far north, if you go on a map, it\u2019s as north as you can get. We\u2019re right up near the North Pole,\u201d she giggles. Within the towering angular walls of the remote cathedral, Tolou, with her natural vocal talent, directed the youth choir. And one day, as fate would have it, legendary Haitian rapper and record producer Wyclef Jean \u2013 renowned for his work with Destiny\u2019s Child, Whitney Houston, and Fugees, to name a few \u2013 just so happened to walk through the cathedral\u2019s doors. \u201cHe was here in Troms\u00f8 performing and they were filming an acoustic music video,\u201d Tolou explains. After seeing her perform, Jean invited her to his concert, and then, with his manager, challenged her to sing on the spot. \u201cI did, of course,\u201d she says, her confident tone never wavering.\nBy this point Tolou was in her early twenties, but her foray into music came much, much earlier. \u201cMy mum has tapes from when I was about four,\u201d she says. \u201cI was just singing, singing, singing all the time. Rihanna, Shakira, all of it. My first album was Crazy in Love by Beyonc\u00e9. As a girl in Troms\u00f8, I didn\u2019t see anyone who looked like me. But then I see Beyonc\u00e9, this amazing pop star, and she looks a bit like me, you know what I\u2019m saying? I had my role model, wow.\u201d\nNorwegian singer Tolou in her home in Troms\u00f8. Blazer. Stylist\u2019s own. Lace long sleeve top, \u20ac62, Lace stockings, \u20ac58. Both Orobl\u00f9. Pearl pendant earrings, \u20ac210. Pearl Octopuss.y. Ring. Stylist\u2019s own. Vintage gold belt.

Tolou\u2019s musical passion is so palpable that even the way she speaks is melodic, with staccato rhythms and syncopated pauses leading into breathy, rapid-fire riffs of words.\nTolou credits her unfaltering confidence, in part, to the time she spent working with Jean, albeit remotely; their collaboration coincided with the Covid lockdown, which left her stuck in the distant northern reaches of Norway. \u201cIt made me even more independent,\u201d she explains. \u201cOften as a female artist, you go to a studio with a producer and you\u2019re just sitting at the back. You don\u2019t know yourself or what you can do.\u201d But by necessity during lockdown, Jean had Tolou writing, producing beats, recording and mixing all by herself, in Troms\u00f8. \u201cIt really taught me that not everybody else knows better than me sometimes,\u201d she says. \u201cI should trust myself.\u201d\nEventually lockdown lifted and her work served as a stepping stone to the US, sparking a series of further serendipitous events. After attending Boss\u2019 spring/summer \u201923 runway show in Miami, a sense of freedom dawned on her, bolstered by the fact that she was fresh out of a relationship in Norway. \u201cI literally decided to stay because I was heartbroken and needed the sun,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I followed my intuition and my gut and I stayed in LA for two months.\u201d During that time, she caught the eye of a music executive in the elevator at Soho House. \u201cHe noticed me because of my style, I am always extra with my style,\u201d she says. Suddenly she was introduced to more big names in the business, leading her to the holy Mecca for any pop musician: the office of Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group. \u201cHe just signed me on the spot to the global company,\u201d she recounts, simply.\nThe \u2018suits\u2019 of the music business instantly recognised a star quality in Tolou and her sound, which she has no trouble putting into words. \u201cI\u2019m an Afro-Scandinavian pop girlie. I\u2019m using both of my influences. As a Scandinavian, I can say Scandinavians are the best at pop. We\u2019re the best. I don\u2019t have to say it. You already know,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it\u2019s like the cold of northern Norway, that\u2019s just naturally in me, so my melodies are kind of cool and beautiful and melancholic. Then I bring in the warmth of Nigeria, because that always makes me so happy and it\u2019s so danceable.\u201d Put more simply, Tolou is \u201cthe cold from the north and warmth from the south\u201d.\nDespite the belief and confidence in her artform \u2013 and the backing of a major record deal \u2013 Tolou acknowledged that it wouldn\u2019t feel right for her \u201cspiritually, in her heart\u201d to release a track without ever having visited her father\u2019s homeland of Nigeria. \u201cIt was something I had looked forward to my whole life, because it was weird, not understanding that other part of me,\u201d she says. She had some preconceptions about Nigeria, but describes being enveloped in a welcoming warmth by family she had never met before. \u201cThey were sitting in a circle and giving me their blessing, praying for me to be a star\u201d, she smiles, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for it, it was just incredible.\u201d Shortly thereafter, she released the song \u2018Coco\u2019, her biggest hit to date.\nTolou is as well-known for her voice as she is for her microbraids, a nod to her African heritage. Velvet top, \u20ac390. Elliot. Photo: Ole Martin Halvorsen\nThough it was her first time in Africa, Tolou\u2019s Norwegian mother Cathrine Kjeldsberg \u2013 who raised her daughter by herself \u2013 did her best to keep that part of Tolou\u2019s cultural makeup present in her day-to-day life (this is most evident in the Nigerian art that dots their home). So, when faced with the problem of having a young daughter with Afro hair but no Afro salons available in Troms\u00f8, Kjeldsberg reached out to her African girlfriends in London to learn how to do traditional Afro hairstyles herself. Tolou had her first microbraids by her mother\u2019s hands at the age of six and has maintained the waist-skimming style to this day. \u201cIt\u2019s a very intentional choice, the microbraids, because it\u2019s an African hairstyle,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I wear them, I wear my identity. I'm not just a tanned Norwegian person, I\u2019m an African Norwegian person.\u201d\nKjeldsberg has no difficulty in executing her self-taught braiding skills. Carving out the time to do them around her full-time job is the challenge. \u201cI rush home from work and stay up for long hours, and use my days off and weekends to expedite the process\u201d she says. \u201cOn those days, we see little sleep. Tolou is a busy young woman and finding the time isn\u2019t easy.\u201d But mother and daughter do always find the time, something for which Tolou is expressly grateful. \u201cThe amount of love and dedication that my mum puts into the braids has made me the person I am, loving and dedicated,\u201d Tolou says. \u201cThat dedication comes through in how I put my heart and soul into my music. Everything I do, I do with meaning and I think it comes from her because she does everything with so much meaning and integrity.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a very intentional choice, the microbraids. When I wear them, I wear my identity\nTolou\nThe centuries-old cultural significance of braids is synonymous with community, with the hours upon hours required for the intricate and deeply personal craft doubling as bonding time between family, friends and tribes. For Tolou and her mother, these countless hours form a sacred space for just the two of them to share. \u201cWe have a lot of quality time. Honestly, I'm so grateful for this hair for that reason, because I get to spend so much time with my mum,\u201d Tolou says. Kjeldsberg mirrors the sentiment, describing it as \u201ca wholesome, enjoyable opportunity\u201d to talk, catch up on their favourite series, or simply enjoy the quiet moments together. \u201cAs the years go, I believe these sessions give my daughter a little space in her hectic life, some grounding time that allows her to stay true to her most authentic self.\u201d \u201cMy mum keeps me grounded, literally grounded,\u201d Tolou echoes. \u201cI sit on the floor of the living room as she does my microbraids and we talk about everything.\u201d\nRelated: How jazz-sensation Laufey turned lockdown into a world tour: The Icelandic artist's untold story\nAside from her Spotify plays and live performance dates, Tolou\u2019s popularity is most evident on social media where she\u2019s racked up legions of fans \u2013 her recent drop \u2018A Little Bit Sad\u2019, which addresses the heartbreak that kept her, fatefully, in LA, resonated on her buzzy TikTok account. But Tolou is unfazed by the attention. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun when I see all those views on my videos, but it doesn\u2019t really affect me. Us people from northern Norway, we\u2019re very authentic. We just are who we are. Like, we\u2019re not that mysterious,\u201d she smiles.\nAs her star rises and her name becomes more internationally recognised, Tolou\u2019s sincere authenticity cannot be shaken. \u201cI want to make global music and I want to be wherever the music takes me,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople ask me, \u2018Why don\u2019t you go somewhere else for your braids when you\u2019re in the UK or USA? Why don\u2019t you just have someone else do it?\u2019, but I need to go back home for my soul. It\u2019s crucial for me to stay connected to Norway and my mum, to remind myself of my values and where I came from.\u201d\nPhotographer: Ole Martin Halvorsen\nStylist: Afaf Ali\nTalents: Ida Tolou, Cathrine Kjeldsberg\nHair Stylist and Makeup Artist: Charlotte Wold\nPhotographer Assistant: Sture Nordhagen\nProduction: Kiffa"

      "text": "Chart Rewind: In 1989, New Kids on the Block Were \u2018Hangin\u2019 Tough\u2019 at No. 1\nThe Boston boy band topped the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 with its breakthrough album and the set's title cut, respectively.\nIn every era of pop music, boy bands have elicited irrepressible shrieks from adoring fans. In the \u201960s, it was the Beatles. In the \u201970s, the Jackson 5. More recently, the likes of Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, who then passed the boy band baton to One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer.\nIn 1989, it was New Kids on the Block\u2018s turn to rule music like only boy bands can.\nAfter Boston-based producer-songwriter Maurice Starr had formed New Edition, which reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1985 with \u201cCool It Now,\u201d he followed with New Kids on the Block \u2013 brothers Jonathan and Jordan Knight, Joey McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg and Danny Wood. While their self-titled first LP didn\u2019t hit the Billboard 200 upon its release, follow-up Hangin\u2019 Tough filled the late-\u201980s boy band void, yielding five infectious Hot 100 top 10s, including the quintet\u2019s first No. 1 in June 1989, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Loving You (Forever).\u201d The ballad followed the No. 10-peaking \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Go Girl\u201d and the No. 3 hit \u201cYou Got It (The Right Stuff),\u201d which built even more buzz.\nOn Sept. 9, 1989, New Kids\u2019 rise culminated in the set and its title track taking over atop the Billboard 200 and Hot 100, respectively. The set was a slow-burner that took 55 weeks to reach the Billboard 200 summit, completing one of the longest climbs to No. 1 in the chart\u2019s history.\nBy years\u2019 end, New Kids on the Block had charted at last on the Billboard 200, reaching No. 25, and generated its own top 10, the group\u2019s No. 8 cover of the Delfonics\u2019 \u201cDidn\u2019t I (Blow Your Mind).\u201d The group even gleaned a top 10 from a third album, the holiday set Merry, Merry Christmas, when \u201cThis One\u2019s for the Children\u201d reached No. 7. In between, Hangin\u2019 Tough\u2018s fifth single \u201cCover Girl\u201d rose to No. 2.\n(On their summer 1989 tour, New Kids on the Block \u2013 and former Billboard publisher Tommy Page, then in his teen-idol days [he passed in 2017] \u2013 set out as the opening acts for Tiffany. By the end of the tour, Tiffany and New Kids had swapped spots.)\nThe Kids\u2019 blend of street (i.e., Wahlberg\u2019s semi-rap on \u201cHangin\u2019 Tough\u201d) and sweet (Jordan Knight and McIntyre served as the voices of the band\u2019s biggest ballads) helped make them a chart, touring and merchandise powerhouse, one that continued with 1990\u2019s Step by Step. Like its predecessor, the album and its title song became respective Billboard 200 and Hot 100 No. 1s. Follow-up single \u201cTonight,\u201d which playfully name-checks several of the act\u2019s earlier hits, rose to No. 7.\nUltimately, the group earned the honor of Billboard\u2018s top artist of both 1989 and 1990.\nAs musical trends shifted from pure-pop to rap and grunge, New Kids on the Block released the No. 37-peaking Face the Music (billed as NKOTB) in 1994 before taking a hiatus. With enough time passed for nostalgia to help restore its image (along with a return to prominence for pop music), the band blew back in 2008 with the No. 2 hit album The Block (featuring a track with then-new act Lady Gaga), which yielded the quintet\u2019s first top 40 Hot 100 hit since 1992, the No. 36-peaking \u201cSummertime.\u201d Its 2013 album 10 hit No. 6. In between, the act embraced its place in boy band lineage: In 2011, it released NKOTBSB, a collaborative set with Backstreet Boys, which hit No. 7. The acts\u2019 partnership continued in the form of Nick & Knight, aka BSB\u2019s Nick Carter and New Kid Jordan, in 2014.\nMost recently, New Kids on the Block released the album Still Kids, which launched at No. 4 on the Top Album Sales chart in June. Lead single \u201cKids\u201d has hit both the Adult Pop Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, marking the group\u2019s first appearance on the latter list in nearly 35 years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of not wanting to let each other down,\u201d Wahlberg said when the group chatted with Billboard in New York in May. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency that I think you can sometimes hear in the voices, of wanting to deliver the best of a performance. I think that\u2019s present in this record, even in the writing.\u201d"

      "text": "Janet Jackson\u2019s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 Hits\nHere's a look at the pop icon's history on the chart.\nAs Janet Jackson celebrates her birthday (May 16), Billboard takes a look at the singer\u2019s history on the Billboard Hot 100.\nBorn as the youngest of 10 children to Joseph and Katherine Jackson, Janet was almost pre-destined to enter the music industry with her brothers and sisters. By her fifth birthday, five of her brothers \u2014 as The Jackson 5 \u2014 had already scored four Hot 100 No. 1 hits. Following in her family\u2019s musical footsteps, Janet made her Hot 100 debut in 1982 with \u201cYoung Love,\u201d at 16 years old. Though that single and her second career entry, 1984\u2019s \u201cCome Give Your Love to Me,\u201d both peaked outside the top 50, Jackson found her hit-making stride with 1986\u2019s Control. Among its many hits, she landed her first of 10 No. 1s on the chart with \u201cWhen I Think of You,\u201d which reigned for two weeks.\nThrough the next 15 years, Jackson remained a Hot 100 force: Her next four albums, Janet Jackson\u2019s Rhythm Nation 1814, janet., The Velvet Rope and All for You, each all generated at least one Hot 100 champ. Thanks to her decades of hits, Jackson is one of the most influential female artists to cross through the pop, R&B and dance genres, with 19 and 15 No. 1s on the Dance Club Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts, respectively. She\u2019s also scored seven No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, between 1986 and 2015.\nJackson (who first broke through with TV roles on sitcoms Good Times and Diff\u2019rent Strokes) has won five Grammy Awards and has been nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award.
