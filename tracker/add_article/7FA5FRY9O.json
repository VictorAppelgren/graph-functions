      "summary": "Health officials in Wyoming are warning that up to 500 visitors to bat‑infested cabins at Grand Teton National Park may have been exposed to rabies, after bats were found in several cabins. None of the tested bats tested positive, but officials are erring on the side of caution and recommending prophylactic shots for people who may have had contact with bats, especially deep sleepers and young children. The cabins have been closed since July 27 and there are no plans to exterminate the bats, though measures are in place to prevent re‑entry. The alert is being sent to residents of 38 states and seven countries through health agencies and the CDC. The situation underscores the importance of rapid post‑exposure treatment to prevent the almost always fatal rabies virus in humans.",
