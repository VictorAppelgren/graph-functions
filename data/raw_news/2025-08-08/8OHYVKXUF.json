  "title": "Are Wall Street Analysts Bullish on Amphenol Stock?",
  "description": "Amphenol has significantly outperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks, and analysts remain strongly bullish on the stock\u2019s prospects.",
  "content": "Wallingford, Connecticut-based Amphenol Corporation (APH) designs, manufactures, and markets electronics and fiber optic connectors in the U.S., China, and internationally. With a market cap of $133.7 billion, Amphenol operates through Harsh Environment Solutions, Communications Solutions, and Interconnect and Sensor Systems segments.\n\nThe electronic components manufacturer has significantly outperformed the broader market over the past year. Over the past 52 weeks, APH rallied 80.8% outpacing the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 21.9% returns. In 2025, APH is up 56.3% outpacing SPX\u2019s 7.8% gains on a YTD basis.\n\u2022 Cathie Wood Is Buying Shares of This Little-Known Ethereum Treasury Company.

Sign Up Now!\n\nZooming in further, APH has also outperformed the S&P 500 Technology Sector SPDR\u2019s (XLK) 33.4% returns over the past 52 weeks and 13.2% gains on a YTD basis.\n\nDespite delivering impressive growth figures, Amphenol\u2019s stock prices dipped 1.1% following the release of its Q2 results on Jul. 23. Driven by strong organic growth across its end markets including exceptional organic growth in the IT datacom market along with contribution from acquisitions, the company\u2019s overall topline for the quarter soared 56.5% year-over-year to $5.7 billion, surpassing the Street\u2019s expectations.\n\nFurthermore, the company\u2019s adjusted EPS skyrocketed 84.1% year-over-year to $0.81, beating the consensus estimates by 22.7%. Following the initial dip, APH stock prices soared 3.7% in the subsequent trading session.\n\nFor the full fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts expect APH to deliver an adjusted EPS of $2.98, up 57.7% year-over-year. Furthermore, the company has a robust earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street\u2019s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.\n\nThe stock has a consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating overall. Of the 16 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 12 \u201cStrong Buys\u201d and four \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nThis configuration has remained stable in recent months.\n\nOn Aug. 5, BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained a \u201cNeutral\u201d rating on APH and raised the price target from $110 to $120.\n\nAPH\u2019s mean price target of $114 represents a modest 5% premium. Meanwhile, the street-high target of $126 suggests a 16.1% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Sarawgi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
