      "text": "Results\n22\nMidstream oil and gas companies, specifically pipeline operators, are well-positioned to benefit from Trump\u2019s executive orders on fossil fuels enacted in early 2025. \u2013 \u2013 These policies aim to accelerate infrastructure development by streamlining environmental reviews and permitting processes, such as those under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$314.9b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$156.55\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n6.3%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$70.0b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.46\n7D\n-0.7%\n1Y\n30.2%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$59.7b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.67\n7D\n-0.8%\n1Y\n26.5%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$51.1b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$230.14\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n24.4%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$49.3b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$162.34\n7D\n0.9%\n1Y\n-9.8%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$47.1b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$73.93\n7D\n-0.7%\n1Y\n-15.5%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.5b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$103.41\n7D\n-1.1%\n1Y\n37.1%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.7b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.17\n7D\n-1.1%\n1Y\n12.5%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.7b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$17.91\n7D\n-2.9%\n1Y\n23.0%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$40.82\n7D\n-1.2%\n1Y\n-6.2%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$23.29\n7D\n5.8%\n1Y\n-36.6%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.4b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$29.01\n7D\n6.3%\n1Y\n21.2%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.3b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$21.76\n7D\n5.4%\n1Y\n0.05%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$500.0m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.40\n7D\n4.8%\n1Y\n-26.6%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$404.0m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.31\n7D\n4.5%\n1Y\n-36.5%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$245.9m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$20.86\n7D\n-14.6%\n1Y\n-40.1%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$81.8m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.48\n7D\n-1.1%\n1Y\n1.7%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$40.7m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.83\n7D\n-14.1%\n1Y\n-58.5%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$736.6k\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0014\n7D\n27.3%\n1Y\n-84.3%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"

  "argos_summary": "The article highlights how President Trump\u2019s 2025 executive orders on fossil fuels are expected to boost U.S. midstream oil and gas companies, listing 22 firms that could benefit from streamlined permitting and increased production on federal lands. It notes that revenue is projected to decline 5.6% annually over the next three years, while Asian oil and gas revenues remain flat, and provides a snapshot of Singapore\u2019s market performance, where the energy sector gained 1.58% over the past week. The piece also focuses on RH PetroGas Limited, a Singapore\u2011listed Indonesian oil and gas holder, reporting strong earnings growth (11.1% annualized) and a 15.8% net margin, though its stock underperforms the broader SG oil and gas industry and market over the past year. Overall, the article combines policy analysis, company performance data, and market context to assess opportunities and risks in the oil and gas sector.",
