  "content": "Move over Eagles, another raptor is taking over the gridiron.\n\nOspreys who chose to raise their chicks in a nest on top of a light pole at a high school football stadium in Minnesota now have the whole field to themselves.\n\nOspreys are a federally and state protected species, and because of their nesting location, the Apple Valley High School Eagles football team must rearrange their schedule.\n\n\"When you tell someone this story of \u2018Wow, we have to reschedule because there\u2019s an osprey nest in our stadium,\u2019 they\u2019re like, \u2018You can\u2019t make this type of stuff up, right?\u2019\" Cory Hanson, athletic director at the school, whose mascot is the Eagles, told The Associated Press.\n\nRARE SIGHTING AS THREATENED BIRD SPECIES LIKELY GOT LOST, ENDING UP 1,000 MILES FROM HOME IN WISCONSIN\n\nThe Eagles must now play all of their home games during the day because turning on the floodlights where the birds have their nest could hurt them.\n\nHeidi Cyr, of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, said the school can remove the nest once the osprey chicks are able to fly away, which shouldn\u2019t take too long.\n\n\"Luckily for Apple Valley, they should be able to remove the nest within probably a week because the birds have already taken some of their first flights,\" Cyr explained.\n\nThe school, which became aware of the nest in June, has been sending a drone up every few days to check on the chicks\u2019 progress.\n\nSchool officials plan to relocate the nest to another platform on school grounds and build deterrents on the stadium lights once the chicks leave, hoping the ospreys will return next year.\n\n\"So if anyone sees that happening, don\u2019t worry,\" Cyr said. \"The birds are safe. They\u2019ve successfully left the nest, and they\u2019re on their way to becoming adults themselves.\"\n\nOspreys are a large bird of prey with a wingspan of up to six feet, and they like to build nests I high places with clear views.\n\n\"When you see these large birds flying across your field with these humongous sticks, you start to ask questions like, \u2018What is going on here?\u2019\" Hanson said. \"And you take one look at that nest, right? And you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, this is not your average bird.\u2019\"\n\nHe said that other schools have been helpful in finding alternate locations and times for games.\n\nThe department sometimes issues nest removal permits when ospreys make nests on critical infrastructure like utility poles and cellphone tower, but they are usually denied if chicks remain.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOspreys were removed from the Minnesota species of special concern list in 2015 following efforts to rebuild their population.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",
