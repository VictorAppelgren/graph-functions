      "feedback": "This draft is strong in its attempt to fuse macro policy, AI/semis momentum, and energy dynamics into a regime-based valuation frame, but it needs a tighter, first-principles causal chain, a single, explicit base-case with transparent regime weights, and concrete, source-grounded quantification; otherwise the analysis reads as a thematic synthesis rather than a testable framework. Actionable edits: 1) fix horizon and regime mapping—establish a single three-regime (A/B/C) framework for discount rates, risk premia, and currency, with explicit definitions, a unified probability vector (e.g., A ~50%, B ~30%, C ~20%), and a consistent transmission path from each regime to equity valuations; 2) articulate a concrete first-principles chain—show how tariffs (10% baseline and episodic spikes) and China reciprocity drive input costs and supply-chain resilience, lift productivity only gradually, attenuate inflation and real yields, and thereby reprice risk premia; explicitly tie Nvidia/AI/semis capex momentum to the timing and magnitude of capex cycles and to S&P 500 sectors; 3) restructure into a clean, three-scenario narrative with explicit catalysts and invalidation criteria—cite tariff pass-through durability, AI/semis capex cadence, Jackson Hole policy signals, wage-growth momentum, and oil-supply shifts as triggers; define invalidation as e.g., inflation persistence that sustains higher discount rates or a tariff shock beyond baseline; 4) quantify aggressively—attach numeric anchors to each claim (e.g., 0.30%–0.40% MoM core CPI, oil path to Brent mid-60s/WTI low-60s under Regime A, 2.5% 2014–2024 revenue CAGR for related firms, Ford Q2 EV losses ~$1.3B with 4.3% adj. EBIT and 10.1% ROIC); translate those into expected equity/sector returns under each regime; 5) sharpen the cross-source coherence—explicitly map every assertion to one or more IDs (SGB2PAZGK, STBVARD8F, 22PL3Q360, T1QE6JPIX, Y6SQOEK69, 15, 9, R3WNA7L7A, NL5YYTLF2) and reconcile conflicts by presenting regime-specific parameter sets rather than a single blended view; 6) improve Euro-area consistency—keep the Regime A/B/C interpretation aligned with the US framework and clearly state any cross-regional links or divergences; 7) tighten wording for precision and avoid vague phrases; define every acronym on first use where possible and ensure every claim that hinges on a source is explicitly sourced; 8) craft a concise watch-list with 6 decisive signals (tariff-shock realization, durable tariff pass-through, AI/semi capex cadence, Nvidia momentum persistence, wage-growth ticks, oil-supply/demand pivots, Jackson Hole hints) and attach trigger thresholds. This will elevate coherence, falsifiability, and actionable decision rules without sacrificing the density of cited sources.",
