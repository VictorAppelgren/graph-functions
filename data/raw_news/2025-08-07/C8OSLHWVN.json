  "title": "Why is JD Vance visiting Indiana today? Learn more amid GOP redistricting push",
  "description": "JD Vance's visit to Indiana follows redistricting efforts in other states like Texas and California.",
  "content": "Vice President JD Vance is visiting Indianapolis, located less than two hours from downtown Louisville, on Aug. 7 to meet with Indiana's Republican leaders as the Trump administration urges state officials to redistrict congressional districts in the GOP's favor.\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Braun said he and others would discuss several topics with the vice president, but any conversation about redistricting would be \"exploratory.\" Here's what we know.\n\nWhen will JD Vance be in Indiana?\n\nThe official reason is to attend an RNC fundraiser as well as discuss several topics with Braun and other leaders, according to a statement from the vice president's office.\n\n\"Vice President Vance will visit Indianapolis on Thursday, where he will be headlining an RNC fundraiser. He will also meet with Governor Braun and other state officials to discuss a variety of issues,\" Communications Director for the Vice President William Martin said.\n\nWhat Indiana leaders is Vance meeting with?\n\nVance will meet with Braun, Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston of Fishers and Senate Pro Tempore Rodric Bray of Martinsville.\n\nIt is currently unclear. Redistricting efforts are already happening in Texas to give the GOP five additional seats in the U.S. House. Meanwhile, California Democrats are toying with the idea of redistricting the Golden State to negate any Republican gains.\n\nAs a result, the Trump administration is exploring the possibility of encouraging other state leaders to redistrict as well ahead of next year's elections, which includes Republican-controlled Indiana.\n\nOthers are reading: A tight bond with JD Vance led to appointment of new US attorney in Louisville\n\nBraun said he hasn't ruled out calling a special session to redraw the Hoosier State's congressional districts.\n\n\"I'm going to listen and see where they're coming from,\" Braun said. \"And again, I'm going to be listening along with the other two leaders in the legislature and everybody's going to probably have a little different point of view.\"\n\nIndyStar reporters Brittany Carloni and John Tufts contributed to this article.

      "text": "Trump says Republicans are 'entitled' to more congressional seats in Texas\nPresident Donald Trump defended Republican efforts to redraw Texas' congressional maps that would add five GOP seats, saying Democratic-leaning states have also used gerrymandering to tilt the scales in their party's favor.\nRepublicans hold a narrow 220-212 majority in the House of Representatives and the president's political operatives are fearing a blue wave in next year's midterms, which could hamper his final two years in office if Democrats take control.\n\"We have an opportunity in Texas to pick up five seats, we have a really good governor and we have good people in Texas, and I won Texas... and we are entitled to five more seats,\" Trump said during an Aug. 5 appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box.\nThe plan has ignited a nasty and partisan tug-of-war with Democratic governors in Illinois, New York and California pledging to return the favor and redraw their congressional maps to add more Democratic districts.\nTrump called out Texas Democrats for fleeing to liberal states, saying those places have been using the same tactics when crafting their congressional districts.\n\"Do you notice they go to Illinois for safety, but that's all gerrymandered,\" he said. \"California is gerrymandered. We should have many more seats in Congress. It's all gerrymandered.\"\nStates are required by law to draw up with new boundaries for Congress every decade based on the U.S. Census to reflect population changes, but occasionally legislatures step in earlier. Some states, such as California, have empowered independent commissions to draft their congressional maps, but Gov. Gavin Newsom said the Golden State is contemplating rewriting state law in response to Texas' changes.\n\"Donald Trump called up (Texas) Gov. (Greg) Abbott for one simple reason: to rig the 2026 elections,\" Newsom said at a July 25 press conference joined by Texas Democrats. \"California's moral high ground means nothing if we\u2019re powerless because of it.\"\nTrump explained his rationale for the mid-decade maneuver, arguing that his margin of victory in the Lone Star State justifies changing the maps. The president noted how all nine of Massachusetts' congressional delegation are made up of Democrats even though he won roughly 36% of the vote last year.\n\"We should have a couple of Congress people, but we have none,\" Trump said.\nThis story will be updated."

      "text": "'They're trying to rig the system': Sen. Padilla says Dems should fight fire with fire\nCalifornia's Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla said his party should be willing to fight fire with fire, in light of Texas' potential, controversial gerrymandering plans.\n\"If Republicans were confident on their policy agenda, they'd be eager to defend it with the people and to defend it at the ballot box next November,\" Padilla said in an Aug. 3 interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\"But they know they're in trouble,\" he continued. \"And so they're trying to rig the system to hold on to power.\"\nThe California senator was referencing Texas Republicans' proposed new map of their state's congressional districts, following President Donald Trump's urging that the GOP find a way to flip as many as five seats in next year's midterm elections.\n\"Just a very simple redrawing, we pick up five seats,\" Trump told reporters on July 15.\nPadilla likened Trump's ask of Texas Republicans to his request during his first term in office that a top Georgia official \"find 11,780 votes\" to put him over the top in the Electoral College for the 2020 election.\nRedistricting in the middle of the decade, rather than every ten years after new census data is collected, is rare. And the pushback from Democrats across the country has been widespread.\nBlue state leaders have threatened tit-for-tat responses, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has suggested redrawing his state's map to counteract Texas' efforts. (Newsom faces the challenge of a bipartisan redistricting commission, which oversees California's maps, unlike Texas, where lawmakers dictate the boundaries.)\nSome California Democrats are wary, warning that a redistricting arms race could spiral and erode trust with voters.\nIn response to those concerns, Padilla told NBC he believes it's appropriate for the Democrat-controlled state to evaluate its options.\n\"The ideal scenario,\" he said, \"is for Texas to stand down. They don't have to do this; they shouldn't do this. But if they were to go forward and deliver Trump his five additional Republicans ... the stakes are simply too high\" for Democrats not to respond.\nPadilla also addressed recent comments from his fellow Democrats about the state of politics and American democracy, including Sen. Cory Booker's call for his party to \"have a backbone.\"\n\"It's time for us to fight. It's time for us to draw lines,\" Booker said from the Senate floor on July 29.\nAsked whether Booker's defiant approach was the appropriate stance for Democrats under the Trump administration, Padilla said, \"Look, I think the extreme way in which this administration is conducting itself calls for higher and higher profile ways of pushing back.\"\nAfter announcing that she would not be running for California governor in 2026, former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on CBS's \"The Late Show\" with Stephen Colbert.\nIn her interview on July 31, Harris told Colbert, \"Recently, I made the decision that, for now, I don't want to go back into the system. I think it's broken.\"\nPadilla agreed, in part, with Harris' take, saying, \"I think the system is under duress.\"\n\"Democrats are doing our part to try to stand up and push back,\" he added."

Redistricting efforts are already happening in Texas to give the GOP five additional seats in the U.S. House. Meanwhile, California Democrats are toying with the idea of redistricting the Golden State to negate any Republican gains.\nAs a result, the Trump administration is exploring the possibility of encouraging other state leaders to redistrict as well ahead of next year's elections, which includes Republican-controlled Indiana.\nWill Indiana redistrict to favor Republicans?\nBraun said he hasn't ruled out calling a special session to redraw the Hoosier State's congressional districts.\n\"I'm going to listen and see where they're coming from,\" Braun said. \"And again, I'm going to be listening along with the other two leaders in the legislature and everybody's going to probably have a little different point of view.\"\nIndyStar reporters Brittany Carloni and John Tufts contributed to this article.

Huston was selected by House members to serve as Indiana House Speaker in 2020 and he currently leads the 100-member chamber, including the 70-member Republican supermajority.\nThanks in part to Huston's strong push for tax cuts during the 2025 legislative session, taxpayers are expected to save more than a billion dollars over the next two years via tax relief. With continued cuts to the individual state income tax, hardworking Hoosiers will have one of the lowest rates in the nation by 2027. House Republicans have cut taxes for Hoosiers every year over the last decade, saving taxpayers more than $20 billion.\nIndiana's new budget increases funding for K-12 education to its highest level yet, continuing our commitment to Hoosier students. Huston successfully led efforts to further expand school choice this year, empowering all Hoosier families to send their child to the school that best meets their needs. Huston received the 2021 Champion of School Choice Award from the Institute for Quality Education for championing expansions of Indiana's Choice Scholarship program.\nHuston also led efforts to advance a fiscally responsible, balanced state budget that maintains Indiana's AAA credit rating while investing in key priorities. The budget increases funding for State Police to strengthen public safety and makes investments in housing to support our growing Hoosier communities.\nHuston previously served on the Hamilton Southeastern School Board, Hamilton Southeastern Schools Foundation Board, Fishers Planning Commission and Indiana Leadership Forum Board of Directors. Additionally, former Gov. Mitch Daniels twice called on Huston to serve the state, first with a four-year term as a member of the Indiana State Board of Education, and from 2006 to 2009 as a member of the Indiana Education Roundtable.\nHuston and his wife, Denise, reside in Fishers and have two adult children, Elizabeth and Jake.\nHouse District 37 includes a portion of Hamilton County in central Indiana.

It's my expectation for state lawmakers to take action to further protect life when we return to the Statehouse for a special session.

Also, the law creates an appeals process for businesses who are ordered by a health department to pay a fine or shut down.

Hoosiers are anxious to reopen their businesses and get back to work.

Expanding and increasing jobless benefits will have an immediate impact on those who have suddenly found themselves, perhaps for the first time, out of work and anxious about their future. I'm encouraged by the federal government's aggressive and swift response, and I hope this relief is expedited directly to those who need it most.\n\"The federal legislation also provides direct financial assistance to the state and local governments to assist with the COVID-19 response, but this funding may not fill all of the gaps created by a dramatic decline in state and local tax revenues. Our fiscal prudence and strong reserves serve as a critical buffer to ensure the continuation of essential state government services, but it's also clear that all levels of government must prepare now to tighten their belts.\"\nSTATEHOUSE (March 24, 2020) \u2013 \u201cGovernor Holcomb has shown tremendous leadership during this complicated and overwhelming public health crisis, which continues to evolve daily. All levels of government and the private sector are coordinating efforts at an unprecedented level to slow the spread. I appreciate the level of transparency his administration continues to provide, and I encourage Hoosiers to stay informed and do their part to protect themselves and others so that we can all bounce back more quickly.\"\nSTATEHOUSE (March 23, 2020) \u2013 \u201cRest assured, the governor and all state leaders are working together to engage necessary resources to protect our most vulnerable while understanding the tremendous urgency to get employees and businesses back to work as soon as possible. We all have to pull together now and do our part to protect our families, friends and communities, so that we can accelerate our state's recovery.\"\nSTATEHOUSE (March 20, 2020) \u2013 \u201cIn the face of an unprecedented public health emergency, Gov. Eric Holcomb and Secretary of State Connie Lawson, with the support of both political parties, are making the right call by pushing back our primary election to June 2. I also support the option of allowing all voters to use mail-in absentee ballots for the primary election to preserve citizens' rights while protecting Hoosiers.\"\n\u201cHoosiers across this state are feeling the effects of this unprecedented health event, and Gov. Eric Holcomb is taking bold, decisive action to make sure Indiana is utilizing all available resources to help bridge the gap until the economy recovers. Cutting red tape for unemployed workers, delaying tax payments and penalties for Hoosiers and businesses, giving necessary guidance for schools, and providing flexibility to those who need social services programs are all important steps to providing relief and security.\"\nSTATEHOUSE (March 12, 2020) \u2013 \u201cWe successfully brought the legislative session to a close after taking our priorities across the finish line, including supporting our educators and schools, and taking important steps to address rising health care costs.\nSTATEHOUSE (March 9, 2020) \u2013 The Indiana House of Representatives today voted to select State Rep.

Chuck Goodrich\u2019s (R-Noblesville) bill that would break down barriers to career opportunities for students from low-income families.\nIndiana's fiscal turnaround over the last decade can be attributed to the simple philosophy that state government should manage tax dollars like Hoosier families manage their households: stick to a budget, don't buy anything you can't afford in the long run, avoid debt, plan for a rainy day, and invest extra money wisely.\nNote to the Press: Please include the following statement from House Speaker-elect Todd Huston (R-Fishers) in your coverage of today\u2019s State of the Judiciary address by Indiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta H. Rush:\n\u201cGovernor Holcomb continues to provide strong leadership and vision for our state, and we look forward to working closely with him this session as we complete the people\u2019s work on time and under budget. He is a tremendous ambassador of Indiana\u2019s success story, and finds ways to get big wins for Hoosiers. We are excited about the record-setting pace of our economic development efforts, and we look forward to seeing the results play out in communities across our state,\u201d said House Speaker Brian C. Bosma (R-Indianapolis).\n\u201cOur state continues to earn the spotlight with our fiscal stability and top-ranked economic environment, which attracts businesses large and small that support families across our state. With a structurally balanced budget and healthy reserves, we are on the right track to continue funding our state\u2019s priorities and building on our momentum. Governor Holcomb has shown great leadership, and we will continue working together to support all Hoosiers,\u201d said House Speaker-elect Todd Huston (R-Fishers).\nSTATEHOUSE (Dec. 10, 2019) \u2013 \u201cGovernor Holcomb\u2019s Next Level agenda highlights many of our shared legislative priorities, and we will work together to tackle the issues important to Hoosiers. From investing cash reserves in one-time capital projects with the potential to save the state more than $120 million in interest, to addressing rising health care costs, we have a busy session ahead. Legislators are preparing to hit the ground running, and I\u2019m confident we will deliver on our goals and continue the state\u2019s positive momentum.\u201d\nSTATEHOUSE (Dec. 2, 2019) \u2013 Indiana House Republicans met today at the Statehouse in Indianapolis and selected State Rep. Todd Huston (R-Fishers) to serve as the next House speaker.\nAs we move closer to the start of the 2020 legislation session, I have talked with Hoosiers in our community on a variety of issues. Recently, education has been a topic at the forefront of many conversations. As I listen to educators and parents, I am encouraged by the progress and leadership our local schools have demonstrated in many areas, including raising teacher pay.\nHoosiers across Indiana, including in Fishers, rely on safe and reliable roads as an essential resource to live out their daily lives, which is why communities must make crucial road repairs sooner rather than later. To help fuel those projects, Indiana increased transportation funding 76 percent since 2016, with more than $850 million dedicated to roads just this year.\nBright orange cones and barrels will be a common sight while traveling along State Road 37 through Fishers, which may cause some delays and frustration. While this may be a temporary inconvenience, we need to think about the purpose of this project. With roughly 50,000 cars traveling this road every single day, the state and local communities are investing $124 million to turn this roadway into an expressway-style thoroughfare with roundabouts.\nThe Centers for Disease Control is investigating more than 1,000 lung injury cases and 18 deaths across the country, including in Indiana. That is because all those reported patients have a history of using e-cigarettes. In the Hoosier state, e-cigarette use \u2013 commonly known as \u201cvaping\u201d \u2013 has skyrocketed almost 400% over the past six years. The majority of those users are between the ages of 18 and 34 years old. This data is alarming and serves as a wakeup call that more needs to be done to make sure fewer young people choose to use e-cigarettes or vapes.\nSTATEHOUSE (Aug. 29, 2019) \u2013 \u201cAs a father of two teenagers, it is disturbing that we are seeing exponentially more young Hoosiers choosing to vape. I support the governor and the department of health\u2019s comprehensive strategy to raise awareness about the dangers of vaping and point Hoosiers in the right direction to quit. I also look forward to supporting legislative action next year aimed at addressing this issue.\u201d\n\u201cIndiana\u2019s surge in revenue is proof that our low tax, pro-business environment and strong record of fiscal responsibility continues to pay dividends for Hoosier taxpayers. I strongly support the governor\u2019s prudent recommendation to use this one-time money to pay cash for much-needed capital projects, which would otherwise require debt financing. This proposal could save over $100 million in interest payments over the next 20 years and free up those funds for important priorities like education and child protection. We look forward to working with Governor Holcomb in the coming months as we finalize plans for the 2020 session.\u201d\nSTATEHOUSE (April 29, 2019) \u2014 \u201cToday\u2019s signing reflects our ongoing commitment to schools, workforce programs, veterans and the safety of Hoosier children. Our $34 billion balanced biennial budget is the culmination of many months of hard work. We funded the state\u2019s priorities, protecting Indiana\u2019s healthy reserves and valuable AAA credit rating without straining our finances or burdening future generations with debt.\u201d\nSTATEHOUSE (April 24, 2019) \u2013 Indiana lawmakers successfully passed Indiana\u2019s next two-year state budget, which includes a historic investment in K-12 public education, according to State Rep. Todd Huston (R-Fishers) and State Sen. Ryan Mishler (R-Bremen).\n\u201cThis structurally balanced budget is a reflection of collaboration and extensive work on all sides, and we are confident it covers the state\u2019s most pressing needs while safeguarding vital reserves. Our proposal strengthens our commitment to students and teachers with record increases to education, fully funds the Department of Child Services, and makes critical investments into workforce development. We are ready to get this fiscally sound budget over the finish line on behalf of all Hoosiers.\u201d\nSTATEHOUSE (April 1, 2019) \u2013 Two Cathedral High School graduates are gaining experience as interns with State Rep. Todd Huston (R-Fishers) and his fellow members of the House of Representatives during the 2019 legislative session.\nMax and Owen Adams, residents of Indianapolis, are the sons of Dave and Aileen Adams.\nMax is currently a law student at the Indiana University McKinney School of Law, and earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in English and public policy from Indiana University Bloomington. As a policy intern, he analyzes amendments and bills, prepares committee reports for legislators, researches Indiana Code and is a bill reader on the House Floor.\nOwen is an Indiana University Bloomington graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism and a minor in history. He works as an intern in the House Majority Communications Office, where he writes press releases, creates legislative handouts and assists with media relations.\nSTATEHOUSE (March 21, 2019) \u2013 State Rep. Todd Huston (R-Fishers) Tuesday at the Statehouse honored local We the People teams with a resolution recognizing their top-place finish in the 2018-2019 state competition.\nIn December, teams from Hamilton Southeastern High School and Fishers Junior High School won the We the People state championship in the high school and middle school competitions, respectively.\nSTATEHOUSE (March 11, 2019) \u2014 \u201cBased on the corrected data from the Indiana Department of Education, the House proposed school funding formula has been updated and provides a better estimate of tuition support for each school corporation. The reduction in the statewide complexity index aligns with the latest certified data showing fewer Hoosier families are enrolled in public assistance.\u201d\nSTATEHOUSE (Feb. 25, 2019) \u2014 \u201cThe House budget proposal funds Indiana\u2019s vital services and addresses top priorities while remaining fiscally responsible and maintaining healthy reserves. We kept our commitment to educators and Hoosier children by increasing funding for education, school safety and the Department of Child Services. This is a strong start, and I look forward to working on this budget with our Senate colleagues.\u201d\nCAPTION: (From left to right) Hamilton County legislators, State Reps.

Todd Huston (R-Fishers) to help direct more money to teachers.\nHouse Bill 1003 would establish clear spending goals to help local school districts prioritize teacher pay. Teacher pay decisions are made at the local level through collective bargaining and budget decisions. Huston said the proposal sets a target for public schools to make every reasonable effort to ensure that 85 percent of their state funds are going to the classroom.\n\u201cGovernor Holcomb\u2019s proposed two-year state budget is responsibly balanced based upon the revenue forecast and reflects many of our shared priorities, including increasing funding for Hoosier schools. The state\u2019s latest fiscal outlook confirms Indiana\u2019s economy is running strong, and we will continue working with Governor Holcomb and our counterparts in the Senate to keep the momentum going.\u201d\nSTATEHOUSE (Dec. 19, 2018) \u2013 Local lawmakers encourage students who want to learn more about state government to participate in the Indiana House Page Program during the 2019 legislative session.\nSTATEHOUSE (Oct. 16, 2018) \u2013 All schools within the Hamilton Southeastern School District recently received Gold Star recognition from the Indiana Department of Education, according to State Rep.

The Governor\u2019s Workforce Cabinet will be able to work on effectively connecting state efforts with job creators to ensure more Hoosiers develop the skills needed to be competitive and successful in high-demand, high-wage careers.

Bumgarner as Vance\u2019s editor.\n\"I just offered moral support, I suppose,\u201d Bumgarner joked in a June interview.\nBumgarner, who worked as a lawyer specializing in civil issues in Bowling Green for about a decade before taking the role of federal prosecutor in June, said he was appointed by President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi at the recommendation of Vance.\nThe pair met while working as clerks in U.S. District Court Judge David Bunning's office in the early 2010s, he said, and have stayed in touch. In the closing pages of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" Vance thanked Bumgarner for \u201chelpful feedback early in the writing process.\u201d\nU.S. attorneys are traditionally appointed by the president at the recommendation of a state's senators. Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s office acknowledged a request for comment for this article but did not provide one, while Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s representatives did not reply to emails as to whether he\u2019d weighed in on the nomination.\nNeither have publicly mentioned the appointment. In 2017, when now-Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman was appointed in Trump's first term, McConnell issued a statement commending the president for his \"outstanding decision.\" Coleman had previously worked for McConnell before his nomination and had spent time in the FBI.\nIn a June interview at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in downtown Louisville, where he discussed his priorities, Bumgarner said he\u2019s \u201cengaged with (McConnell and Paul's) offices\u201d since taking over on June 3, \u201cand we\u2019re fully committed to all the problems that I\u2019m speaking of. They\u2019re a critical part of the success of this office.\u201d\nCarl Tobias, a University of Richmond professor who studies federal appointments, said it isn't necessarily unusual for a U.S. attorney to be appointed at the recommendation of a vice president, who \"usually has the full trust of the president for whom he serves.\" Vance and Bumgarner worked together as clerks in \"an office that was doing federal work,\" he noted, under a judge who has \"a really fine reputation outside the district.\" (Bunning presided over the Kim Davis controversy in 2015, though Vance and Bumgarner had left the office by then.)\nA spokesperson for the vice president did not respond to emails seeking comment.\nNew federal prosecutor's previous experience\nBumgarner said problems facing the Western District of Kentucky, which covers 53 counties in the western half of the state, include violent crime, the drug epidemic and exploitation of kids and seniors. As U.S. attorney, the top law enforcement officer in the district, he believes he has the background to take them on.\nWhile he hadn't previously worked in a federal prosecutor's office, Bumgarner said he's \"engaged in federal criminal work throughout my career,\" including representing indigent defendants as part of the district's Criminal Justice Act Panel after his time in Bunning's office.\nHe built \"meaningful working relationships\" with federal prosecutors in his new office in that time, he said.\nBefore the recent appointment, he also spent more than a decade at Bowling Green's Kerrick Bachert law firm, where attorney and shareholder Shawn Rosso Alcott said he became \"one of the finest, most talented lawyers I've ever had the privilege of practicing with\" as he rose to the rank of partner.\n\"He quickly got into our caseload at the highest level, handling complex litigation, high-stakes transactional things, advising sophisticated institutional clients,\" Alcott told The Courier Journal. \"There really wasn't a thing he wasn't involved in.\"\nBumgarner managed a staff of about 30 people at the law firm in Bowling Green, where his wife Kori Beck Bumgarner serves as the region's commonwealth's attorney. As U.S. attorney, he now leads a federal office with about 80 staffers. It's \"certainly a slightly larger staff than I've managed before,\" he acknowledged, but he said the managerial aspects he picked up as partner at Kerrick Bachert remain \"a critical part of this job.\"\nAlcott said he played a key role in managing the firm, \"which is hard to do because that's not your full-time job. You're trying to juggle that along with all your client needs.\" And Bumgarner, whose staff bio said he specialized in commercial and employment law, praised staff at the prosecutor's office who have helped him ease into the role.\nBumgarner has been in the position for just more than a month. On July 1, he hosted his first press conference as U.S. attorney, announcing alongside other law enforcement groups two investigations that led to more than 20 arrests on allegations of drug trafficking and firearm offenses.\nBut he still has not been confirmed by the Senate, a required step to take on the role permanently (typically, U.S. attorneys serve through a president's time in office). The chamber's Judiciary Committee takes feedback from the nominee's home state senators and offers a recommendation to the full Senate, which then votes to confirm the appointment.\nIf a vote doesn't take place within 120 days, an interim U.S. attorney appointment is made by the nominee's district court until the vacancy is filled. It would be \"unusual\" for judges in the district to appoint someone other than the president's nominee as U.S. attorney, Tobias said, \"but it happens\" \u2014 though the judges are likely familiar with Bumgarner through his years as a private lawyer.\nFor his part, Bumgarner is operating like he'll be here for the long haul.\n\"I did not shut down a civil practice in Bowling Green to move here for 120 days,\" he said. \"I'm settling in as though I'm leading this office through the course of the president's administration.\"\nBumgarner, Vance and 'Hillbilly Elegy'\nBumgarner spoke highly of Vance. The current vice president worked as a clerk in Bunning\u2019s office with Bumgarner, then as the office\u2019s senior clerk, after graduating from Yale in 2013.\nAt that time, Bumgarner said, \"Hillbilly Elegy\" was \u201cjust kind of a thought, an idea.\u201d He can remember seeing Vance typing away on a laptop at a mandated legal training course \u2014 \u201cI was, like most lawyers, halfway paying attention,\u201d he joked \u2014 and learned he had just started to write a book.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know his story,\u201d Bumgarner said. \u201cI had worked with him for several months. I did not know his story until I read the first few chapters of the book. I don\u2019t know that I offered him any criticism. I certainly offered him my support really to tell his story, because it\u2019s such a remarkable story. It\u2019s great commentary.\u201d\nThe book vaulted Vance to stardom after Trump was first elected in 2016, as it was viewed as an explanation for the president\u2019s popularity in places like Appalachian Kentucky. He would go on to be elected to an Ohio U.S. Senate seat in 2022 and earn a place on Trump\u2019s ticket as vice president two years later.\nBumgarner was in the nation\u2019s capital in January to watch his friend\u2019s inauguration.\n\u201cIt was such an honor to be a part of that, to witness it,\u201d Bumgarner said. \u201cThat\u2019s at the core of our democracy, so having the opportunity to watch that, and that peaceful transition of power, it was just a remarkable, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201d\nReach Lucas Aulbach at laulbach@courier-journal.com."

  "argos_summary": "Vice President JD Vance is visiting Indianapolis on August 7 to meet with Indiana Republican leaders, including Governor Mike Braun, to discuss various issues, including potential redistricting of congressional districts. The Trump administration is encouraging GOP-controlled states like Indiana to redraw districts in their favor ahead of the upcoming elections, with discussions described as 'exploratory' by Braun. Meanwhile, Texas is already implementing redistricting efforts to gain additional Republican seats, prompting Democratic leaders in states like California to consider countermeasures.",
