  "title": "Inventing Emergencies Is Trump\u2019s Superpower",
  "description": "Lying about conditions in the country, like the fake D.C. crime wave, has allowed the president to seize more authority time and again.",
  "content": "By itself, President Trump misstating facts is hardly a news event. He became a master of hype while working as a real-estate developer and reality-TV host; now, he invariably exaggerates or fabricates descriptions of objective reality to fit his own purposes. Most often, Trump twists or simply makes up facts to dramatize the unbelievable depravity of his opponents (e.g., his unsupported assertions that millions of non-citizens cast illegal votes for Democrats in national elections) or the world-historical brilliance of his own accomplishments (e.g., the booming economy he claims to have built, notwithstanding contrary evidence from the Bureau of Labor Statistics). Personally, it troubles me that the chief executive of my country lies through his teeth so very often. But, apparently, Trump\u2019s fans, who are said to \u201ctake him seriously but not literally,\u201d aren\u2019t bothered at all and may derive amused pleasure from the very height of his tall tales.\n\nDuring his second term, however, Trump\u2019s penchant for making stuff up has assumed a central role in his relentless efforts to expand presidential powers at the expense of Congress, the courts, and Americans\u2019 liberties. That\u2019s because he is relying more than any of his predecessors on asserting emergency powers in circumstances where there is no actual emergency, as the Associated Press reported in June:\n\nDespite insisting that the United States is rebounding from calamity under his watch, President Donald Trump is harnessing emergency powers unlike any of his predecessors. Whether it\u2019s leveling punishing tariffs, deploying troops to the border or sidelining environmental regulations, Trump has relied on rules and laws intended only for use in extraordinary circumstances like war and invasion. An analysis by The Associated Press shows that 30 of Trump\u2019s 150 executive orders have cited some kind of emergency power or authority, a rate that far outpaces his recent predecessors.\n\nHe shows no signs of slowing down, as his most recent astounding power grab, the takeover of law enforcement in the District of Columbia, shows. Even by Trump\u2019s standards, however, his claims of a crime emergency in D.C. requires a lot of mendacity. In his press conference announcing the takeover, Trump tossed out a pastiche of not-so-recent crime-trend statistics layered with inflammatory rhetoric about the sheer hellishness of life in Washington. Fact-checkers had a field day:\n\nBy virtually any standard, violent crime in D.C. is falling, not rising, and there\u2019s no \u201cemergency\u201d requiring unprecedented federal intervention in local law enforcement and abrogation of a half-century tradition of home rule. However, the 1973 congressional statute that gave Washington home rule provides for a temporary (but extendable) federal takeover of Washington\u2019s police force in cases of a presidentially declared emergency. So facts be damned, that\u2019s what Trump declared, just as he has declared fake emergencies to justify his usurpations of congressional powers over tariffs and trade, and his authoritarian measures to detain and deport immigrants.\n\nInventing emergencies isn\u2019t just a strategy to mobilize Trump\u2019s supporters and intimidate his opponents \u2014 it\u2019s his superpower, giving him permission slips to sweep aside laws, policies, precedents, and other public institutions that stand in his way. Emergency provisions are invariably drafted with more responsible presidents in mind, and courts will typically give any president considerable deference, even if they suspect or even know this president is fabricating pretexts in order to inflate his own power.\n\nSo Trump\u2019s extraordinary disregard for verifiable facts (most often expressed, ironically, via his Truth Social platform) is more precious to him than all the gold with which he has adorned the White House. It\u2019s an emergency, in law if not in fact, if the president says it is. And so Trump gets to play police chief and emperor in the city he considers Mar-a-Lago on the Potomac.",

      "text": "Taking Trump Seriously, Not Literally\nThe Republican candidate took his case to a shale-industry gathering, and found a welcoming crowd.\nPITTSBURGH\u2014\u201cRunning for president is a very important endeavor,\u201d Donald Trump said. \u201cWhat is more important, right?\u201d\nHe leaned forward on his chair, separated by a heavy black curtain in a makeshift green room from the crowd waiting to hear him speak at the Shale Insight Conference.\n\u201cI am running because, number one, I think I will do a very good job. Number two, it\u2019s really about making American great again.\u201d He paused, as if realizing that repeating his campaign slogan might not seem genuine.\n\u201cI mean that; I really do want to make America great again,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what it is all about.\u201d\nThe 70-year-old Republican nominee took his time walking from the green room toward the stage. He stopped to chat with the waiters, service workers, police officers, and other convention staffers facilitating the event. There were no selfies, no glad-handing for votes, no trailing television cameras. Out of view of the press, Trump warmly greets everyone he sees, asks how they are, and, when he can, asks for their names and what they do.\n\u201cI am blown away!\u201d said one worker, an African American man who asked for anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the press. \u201cThe man I just saw there talking to people is nothing like what I\u2019ve seen, day in and day out, in the news.\u201d\nJust before he takes the stage, I ask whether there\u2019s one question that reporters never ask but that he wishes they would. He laughs. \u201cHonestly, at this stage, I think they\u2019ve asked them all.\u201d\nThen he stops in his tracks before pulling back the curtain and answers, so quietly that is almost a whisper: \u201cYou know, I consider myself to be a nice person. And I am not sure they ever like to talk about that.\u201d\nOn stage, Trump began by addressing the unrest in Charlotte. He praised police, condemned \u201cviolent protestors,\u201d and called for unity. \u201cThe people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African American residents who live in these communities,\u201d he said.\nTurning to the subject at hand, Trump proceeded to tell shale-industry executives from around the country about his \u201cAmerica First energy plan\u201d that, he vowed, would sideline the Obama administration\u2019s climate-change blueprint, ease regulations, and support the construction of energy-based infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines.\nThe plan, he insisted, would revive the slumping shale-oil and -gas industries, beset by low prices for several years, and \u201cunleash massive wealth for American workers and families.\u201d\nTroy Roach of Denver, Colorado, has seen how the reversal of fortunes in the shale and natural gas industries affected his own community. The 46-year-old vice president of health, safety and environment at Antero Resources says he was open-minded about voting and thought about Hillary Clinton, but ultimately decided on Trump.\n\u201cWith her, there is too much uncertainty on how she will work with the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at my company and the impact it has had, not only with jobs but charitable work in the area. Just last week we bought a truck for the local EMS.\u201d\nClinton also was invited to speak at the conference but declined, organizers said. In March, during a town-hall discussion of the transition to \u201cclean energy,\u201d the Democratic nominee declared: \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d Later, she declared it a \u201cmisstatement.\u201d Two weeks ago, she again ignited controversy, describing half of Trump\u2019s supporters as coming from a \u201cbasket of deplorables \u2026 racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\u201d\nLike Barack Obama\u2019s description of his opponent\u2019s supporters\u2014\u201cthey get bitter, they cling to guns or religion\u201d\u2014eight years ago in San Francisco, Hillary\u2019s remarks appalled many voters in this region, many of whom work in the energy sector or are affected by it.\nOne of the things Trump says he wants to accomplish as president is to bring the country together\u2014no small task. He says the first black president has struggled with the issue, one at which he should have excelled.\n\u201cFirst of all, the country is divided, and we have no leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would think we would have the perfect leader for that but we don\u2019t.\u201d\nHe hammered at the importance of better opportunities in black communities as a remedy to quell today\u2019s unrest: \u201cWe have to have education and jobs in the inner cities or they are going to explode like we have never seen before. You already see signs of that already all over the country.\u201d\nThe best way, he says, is to provide good education and good jobs in these areas. \u201cFifty-eight percent of black youth cannot get a job, cannot work,\u201d he says. \u201cFifty-eight percent. If you are not going to bring jobs back, it is just going to continue to get worse and worse.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a claim that drives fact-checkers to distraction. The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the unemployment rate for blacks between the ages of 16 and 24 at 20.6 percent. Trump prefers to use its employment-population ratio, a figure that shows only 41.5 percent of blacks in that age bracket are working. But that means he includes full time high-school and college students among the jobless.\nIt\u2019s a familiar split. When he makes claims like this, the press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally.\nWhen I presented that thought to him, he paused again, \u201cNow that\u2019s interesting.\u201d\nI asked him whether the birther controversy\u2014his insistence for years that the first black president in the United States release his long-form birth certificate in order to prove that he is an American\u2014would prevent him from winning over black voters.\nHe dismissed that suggestion, pointing to recent campaign events addressing black communities in Philadelphia, Detroit, and Cleveland: \u201cThey are looking for something that is going to make it better. It\u2019s so unsafe \u2026 I always say, \u2018I\u2019ll fix it\u2014what do you have to lose?\u2019 I am going to fix it.\u201d\nChicago, he said, has had more than 3,000 people shot this year. \u201cCan you believe that?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s worse than Afghanistan \u2026 our cities are in worse shape.\u201d\nDemocrats who have run many of America\u2019s major cities for the past 100 years haven\u2019t fixed things, he argued, \u201cso that is what I say, what have you got to lose? I can fix it. The Democrats certainly haven\u2019t.\u201d\nThe crowd received Trump warmly, greeting him with roaring applause when he addressed the importance of lesser regulations, lower taxes for businesses and producing more energy as a central part of his plan to \u201cmake America wealthy again.\"\nOutside the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, hundreds of protesters organized by the state Democrats, unions, and progressive groups voiced their displeasure with him mostly over fracking and climate change.\nTrump faces a difficult fight over the next 45 days; he says he plans on winning that fight in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, where a rich trove of energy voters live and work, many of them are from union families whose blood-lines trace to the long-gone boom days of coal and steel. Opinion-poll averages show him narrowly ahead in Ohio, and down by six in Pennsylvania.\n\u201cTrump does have a chance in this area since the electorate is populated with base Republicans, fed-up independents, and working-class Democrats,\u201d explained Jeff Brauer, a political science professor at Keystone College in Northeastern Pennsylvania. \u201cHe especially has to camp out in Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio, where so many of these types of voter live. But he will also particularly need to convince the moderate Republicans in the Philadelphia suburbs that he and his temperament are an acceptable choice.\u201d\nTrump seemed eager to meet that challenge. \u201cI like Pittsburgh, I like the people \u2026 you are going to see a lot of me here, I think, between now and Election Day,\u201d he said as he walked toward the stage, smiling and nodding at a convention-center maintenance worker juggling a dolly stacked high with bottled water.\nTrump finished his day in Western Pennsylvania at the elegant Duquesne Club in downtown Pittsburgh with a campaign fundraiser; an organizer said the event was expected to raise more than $1.5 million for the Republican nominee."

      "text": "In recent days, President Donald Trump has ramped up his rhetoric against a familiar foe, denouncing Washington, D.C., as one of the most dangerous cities in the world. Now he says he\u2019s ordering a federal takeover of law enforcement in the nation\u2019s capital, which he claims he will \u201cliberate.\u201d Here are the latest developments.\nTrump\u2019s fake homicide chart\nPer the New York Times, this is why you don\u2019t print out a too-nuts-to-be-true chart J.D. Vance retweeted last week and then show it to a room full of reporters, even if that chart confirms all your biases:\nThe table cites the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Statista and local government statistics, but most of the figures could not immediately be corroborated, and it was not clear how recent they were. The cited U.N. data, for example, lists a homicide rate of 7.7 per 100,000 for Lima, the capital of Peru, but that figure is from 2016. The figure also appears to mix up the flags of Mexico and Ethiopia, and it incorrectly refers to Lagos as the capital of Nigeria. (It was moved to Abuja in 1991.)\nA separate table was on display at the news conference, and was later shared by Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, which showed a different selection of cities and different homicide rates.\nTrump\u2019s fake emergencies\nI just wrote about how inventing emergencies is the president\u2019s superpower:\nBy virtually any standard, violent crime in D.C. is falling, not rising, and there\u2019s no \u201cemergency\u201d requiring unprecedented federal intervention in local law enforcement and abrogation of a half-century tradition of home rule. However, the 1973 congressional statute that gave Washington home rule provides for a temporary (but extendable) federal takeover of Washington\u2019s police force in cases of a presidentially declared emergency. So facts be damned, that\u2019s what Trump declared, just as he has declared fake emergencies to justify his usurpations of congressional powers over tariffs and trade, and his authoritarian measures to detain and deport immigrants.\nInventing emergencies isn\u2019t just a strategy to mobilize Trump\u2019s supporters and intimidate his opponents \u2014 it\u2019s his superpower, giving him permission slips to sweep aside laws, policies, precedents, and other public institutions that stand in his way. Emergency provisions are invariably drafted with more responsible presidents in mind, and courts will typically give any president considerable deference, even if they suspect or even know this president is fabricating pretexts in order to inflate his own power.\nRead the rest here.\nThe National Guard troops Trump deployed in California were probably just for show\nThe New York Times checks in on how things are going in California, where Trump deployed the National Guard against the wishes of Governor Newsom following mass anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles in June:\nSince July 1, the Pentagon has released most of the roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard who were federalized, along with 700 Marines. A sprawling tent city that was erected in June to house thousands of soldiers at a military base south of Los Angeles in Los Alamitos is being dismantled. Only about 300 troops remain.\nTestifying in federal court on Monday, William Harrington, who until last week was the deputy chief of staff for the Army task force with tactical control over the Guard troops, said that those still on duty in Los Angeles were \u201csupporting the request for assistance\u201d from federal law enforcement agents. But officials at the California National Guard and the military\u2019s Northern Command, which is overseeing the force, said earlier Monday that the remaining troops were mostly on standby or guarding federal buildings and not being used for immigration enforcement.\nThe Times previously reported that the deployed troops have complained about how they aren\u2019t given much to do:\nOn the base near Los Angeles where the troops have been stationed, soldiers have complained that only a small fraction of them were even given assignments beyond the base. Those who were sent out typically were ordered to guard federal facilities or provide backup to immigration agents delivering warrants or conducting arrests.\nIn July, for example, one National Guard contingent sat in trucks while immigration agents conducted a show of force in MacArthur Park in Los Angeles. Another contingent faced protesters in a field outside a cannabis farm during a raid in Ventura County.\nThe mission was supposed to end on August 6; instead it\u2019s been extended through at least early November.\nThe California mission and the D.C. mission vary in important ways, but from the Times report, it certainly seems as though the California deployment has mostly just been a show of force.\nMembers of Congress to revive bill to give D.C. control of National Guard\nIn the wake of the Trump administration deploying members of the D.C. National Guard into the city\u2019s streets, D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen intend to reintroduce their legislation that would give the District of Columbia control of the National Guard when Congress returns in September.\nThe District of Columbia Police Home Rule Act would declare the D.C. mayor the \u201cCommander-in-Chief of the D.C. National Guard\u201d as well as repeal the aspect of the city charter that grants the president the power to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s unprecedented federalization of the D.C. Police today and his activation of the D.C. National Guard without D.C.\u2019s consent underscore the necessity of D.C. statehood,\u201d Norton said in a statement. \u201cUntil we get the full protections that statehood would provide, our bills repealing the president\u2019s authority to federalize the local D.C. police department and to give D.C.\u2019s mayor control over the D.C. National Guard, like governors of states have over their National Guards, places D.C. closer to having control over some of its most vital affairs.\u201d\nMayor Bowser calls federal takeover \u2018unsettling\u2019\nDuring an afternoon press conference, Mayor Bowser held a press conference suggested that Trump\u2019s perspective on Washington, D.C. is \u201cshaped by his Covid-era experience during his first term,\u201d reiterating her past statements that crime is actually down in the city.\n\u201cCrime isn\u2019t just down from 2023, it\u2019s also down from 2019 before the pandemic, and we\u2019re at a 30-year violent crime low,\u201d she said.\nBut the mayor signaled that she wasn\u2019t shocked by the action the administration took Monday. \u201cWhile this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\u201d she said.\nBowser sought to ease potential concerns from residents from how the city will function moving forward. \u201cI can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud. We will balance our budgets, we will deploy our services. Our kids are going to start school on August 25,\u201d she said.\nNewsom weighs in\nIn a social media post, California Governor Gavin Newsom invoked Trump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles to quell ICE protests, saying that action was only the beginning.\n\u201cHe was just getting warmed up in Los Angeles. He will gaslight his way into militarizing any city he wants in America. This is what dictators do,\u201d he wrote.\nTrump commands these National Guard troops\nNotes the Washington Post, the way Trump ordered the deployment gives him the ultimate authority:\nDan Meyer, a partner who specializes in national security law at the law firm Tully Rinckey, said the administration put the forces under Title 32 orders because that \u201cputs the president in charge. That\u2019s why they are doing it in D.C. The president is the president and the governor in this situation.\u201d \u2026\nMeyer said by utilizing Title 32, the Guard can take direct action, such as conducting arrests, against Americans. An Army official told The Washington Post that so far there were not plans for troops to engage in law enforcement, but they could conduct arrests if needed.\nD.C. Police union backs federal takeover\nIn a statement published by WUSA9, the D.C. Police union expressed support for Trump\u2019s takeover of the agency, but described the action as \u201ctemporary. \u201cWe stand with the President in recognizing that Washington, DC, cannot continue on this trajectory. Crime is out of control, and our officers are stretched beyond their limits,\u201d chairman Gregg Pemberton said.\nRepublicans praise Trump\u2019s move\nUnsurprisingly, Republicans gave their full-throated support to Trump\u2019s takeover of D.C.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X, \u201cEvery American should be able to visit and enjoy Washington, D.C. without fear. House Republicans support this effort to CLEAN UP Washington, END the crime wave, and RESTORE the beauty of the greatest capital in the world.\u201d\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said that crime in D.C. had hit a \u201cbreaking point\u201d:\nKentucky Congressman Andy Barr said Trump had his full support, adding that the issue was personal to him as someone working in his office was robbed in \u201cbroad daylight\u201d in D.C. \u201cJust like he cleaned up the border, Trump will clean up DC. Our capital is overrun with crime, corruption, and homelessness,\u201d he said.\nDemocrats condemn the federal government\u2019s D.C. actions\nDemocratic members of Congress expressed their outrage following the news of the D.C. National Guard\u2019s imminent deployment in the capital.\nRepresenative Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C. congressional delegate, called the Trump administration\u2019s action, \u201can historic assault on D.C. home rule.\u201d\nSenator Andy Kim of New Jersey said in a statement that the federalization of the National Guard is Trump \u201cgaslighting the American people so he can seize more power.\u201d\nOn X, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland wrote, \u201cTrump\u2019s raw authoritarian power grab in DC is part of a growing national crisis. He\u2019s playing dictator in our nation\u2019s capital as a dress rehearsal as he pushes democracy to the brink. This assault on freedom is exactly why we\u2019ve fought for DC statehood & to give DC control of its National Guard.\u201d\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also rejected the president\u2019s premise that crime in Washington, D.C. is out of control:\nSenator Chris Coons of Delaware used Trump\u2019s move to question his handling of the January 6 rioters. \u201cCrime in DC is at record lows. If Trump is really worried about crime in the capital, then why was one of his first acts as president to pardon hundreds of cop-beaters and violent criminals who participated in the January 6 riot in Washington?,\u201d he wrote on X.\nD.C. attorney general calls Trump administration\u2019s actions \u2018unlawful\u2019\nIn a statement, the office of D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb called the Trump administration\u2019s actions \u201cunprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year and is down another 26% so far this year. We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents,\u201d it read.\n800 Guardsmen will be on the capital streets within the week\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said members of the D.C. National Guard were officially mobilized this morning and residents should see Guardsmen \u201cflowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\u201d\n\u201cThey will be strong, they will be tough, and they will stand with their law enforcement partners,\u201d he said.\nTrump indicated during his remarks that he\u2019s open to increasing the number of Guardsmen \u201cif necessary.\u201d\nWhat other agencies are involved?\nLast week, the Trump administration directed other federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in the district. Among the agencies patrolling are the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration; U.S. Park Police; and U.S. Marshals Service; as well as the Department of Homeland Security, per NPR.\nReporters in the briefing room were given a printed handout detailing some of the arrests made by these officers over the weekend, which involved charges that included illegal weapons possession and driving under the influence:\nFederalizing law enforcement provides nice protective coloration for ICE\nWhile it\u2019s tempting to attribute Trump\u2019s abrupt federal takeover of D.C. policing to a purely impulsive presidential overreaction, there\u2019s likely a political strategy at work, as well.\nUntil now, the rapidly escalating deployment of ICE agents in cities around the country was a conspicuous exception to the general rule that law enforcement is a local government responsibility. This tradition has always been a problem for right-wing demagogues in Washington who want to posture as \u201claw and order\u201d champions. Thus, the mass deportation program has looked a lot like a federal invasion \u2014 and a violation of local autonomy, particularly given the potential role of military assets in conducting raids and herding immigrants into holding pens and onto planes.\nIf the federalization of law enforcement signified by the D.C. takeover spreads, rationalized by a fake crime emergency, then ICE will have some protective coloration. These masked agents won\u2019t be the only feds roaming city streets.\nHow much is this going to cost?\nExact figures are not yet clear, but the Pentagon estimated that the administration\u2019s deployment of 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines earlier this year in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles cost $134 million.\nWhat does the Home Rule Act say about federal control of the D.C. police?\nTrump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to take federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department, the city\u2019s main law enforcement agency.\nAccording to the act\u2019s text, upon determining that there\u2019s an emergency that requires it, the president can direct the mayor of D.C. to provide the Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s services \u201cas the President may deem necessary and appropriate.\u201d Typically, the president can federalize the police department for 48 hours, but this period can be extended to 30 days if congressional leadership is notified. Congress would also have to authorize any further extensions.\nIf Trump wanted to try a full permanent federal takeover of D.C., that would require Congress to repeal the Home Rule Act.\nWill Trump try this in other (blue) cities?\nThere are far more significant legal barriers to doing this in cities beyond D.C., but Trump said that\u2019s what he wants to do, calling D.C. a \u201cmodel\u201d for others:\nIt\u2019s going to be a model. And then we\u2019ll look at other cities also. But other cities are studying what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re going to have a safe, beautiful capital, and it\u2019s going to happen very quickly.\nTrump is really enjoying himself\nWatching the president\u2019s interminable press conference announcing his takeover of D.C. law enforcement, it\u2019s very clear how much this strange old man is enjoying himself.\nAs his attorney general and defense secretary, both deeply experienced sycophants, tried to maintain straight faces, Trump put on a virtuoso performance of \u201cthe weave,\u201d fusing together a vast number of sentence fragments on wildly unrelated topics. An entirely imaginary crime emergency was the ostensible reason for this event, but the president happily moved across a vast landscape of his brilliant accomplishments and the perfidy of his enemies (including California Governor Gavin \u201cNewscum\u201d), with particular emphasis on his upcoming meeting in Alaska with best frenemy Vladimir Putin.\nYou get the sense he would love to turn his final term in office into one long press conference, making a hash of every precedent, mocking any effort to hold him accountable to the law or any sort of objective reality, and relying on loyal retainers to keep the wheels from falling off. This is why he took on the arduous process of recapturing the White House in 2024 and forcing us all to watch his bizarre act every day is his ultimate revenge.\nTrump rambles on about other stuff, like statues\nAfter his initial announcement, Trump began rambling to the assembled press corps about whatever topic came to mind, including Nord Stream 2, his impulsive water release in California after returning the White House, and another thing he loves talking about: statues.\nIn an extended bit, Trump complained about the \u201cradical left\u201d looking to take down statues of historical figures, claiming there used to be an old law from the 1900s that would put people in jail for ten years for removing a monument in the city.\n\u201cYou remember, they started to rip down the statue of Abraham Lincoln. I said, \u2018That\u2019s a tough one to rip down.\u2019 He was pretty good; I think he was pretty good,\u201d Trump said.\nThe president decried the change of perspective on former presidents like Andrew Jackson and Thomas Jefferson, and claimed that George Washington\u2019s name was removed from schools in numerous places. \u201cThis was a sick, woke culture that I think we\u2019ve largely ended.\u201d\nHe also lied about what he\u2019s done to end it:\nThis D.C. takeover is Trump 2.0 in a nutshell\nDonald Trump\u2019s abrupt takeover of the D.C. police force and his deployment of National Guard units \u2014 apparently triggered by the beating of the infamous former DOGE programmer Edward \u201cBig Balls\u201d Coristine \u2014 is, in many respects, a microcosm of the president\u2019s second term.\nHe is exploiting and likely abusing emergency powers created to deal with genuine crises in a completely noncritical situation. According to official statistics, violent crime is rapidly dropping in Washington, D.C. But Trump simply dismisses the numbers as fake, much as he dismissed the July jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics before firing the agency\u2019s commissioner.\nIn his mind, crime is \u201cout of control\u201d in D.C. and nationally, justifying federal intervention in a way that fundamentally violates more than a half-century of home rule for the nation\u2019s capital. His rambling remarks announcing the takeover hinted at similar actions in other cities, along with the threat of military deployments to usurp local law enforcement everywhere.\nThis is authoritarianism in action.\nTrump suggests he may also deploy the military\nAs he moved to deploy members of the National Guard in the streets of Washington, D.C., Trump did not rule out utilizing the military, as well, down the line.\n\u201cWe will bring in the military if needed,\u201d he said.\nTrump waxes poetic about attack on DOGE staffer \u2018Big Balls\u2019\nThe president alluded to the recent attack on Edward \u201cBig Balls\u201d Coristine, the former DOGE staffer whose mugging appears to have acted as the catalyst for Trump\u2019s actions.\nTrump described the attack in dramatic detail, claiming Coristine was \u201csavagely beaten by a band of roving thugs\u201d and \u201cleft dripping in blood.\u201d\nPer the Washington Post, here\u2019s what D.C. police said happened during the incident on August 3:\nThe attempted carjacking occurred about 3 a.m. Sunday in the 1400 block of Swann Street NW, a residential, tree-lined stretch just off a busy thoroughfare. According to a D.C. police report, about 10 juveniles approached Coristine and one other person, who were \u201cstanding next to their vehicle,\u201d then \u201cdemanded the vehicle and assaulted one of the victims.\u201d\nDuring the assault, a D.C. police cruiser \u201cpulled into the block causing the suspects to flee,\u201d the police department said. Officers stopped two suspects, the police report says.\nOne of the victims was treated on the scene. It was not a targeted attack, a D.C. police spokesman said.\nNew DEA administrator will run D.C. police\nTrump announced that Terry Cole, who was sworn in as the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration in July, will be interim federal commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department.\nTrump likens D.C. to foreign cities\nTrump alleged that the murder rate in Washington, D.C., was higher than those of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, and Mexico City, claiming that the rate of carjackings in the city has tripled.\n\u201cDo you want to live in places like that? I don\u2019t think so; I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs, bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs, and homeless people, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it,\u201d he said.\nViolent crime in D.C. has been declining\nAccording to data analyzed by the Washington Post, violent crime in Washington, D.C., has been on a decline since 2023, which was considered the city\u2019s deadliest year in decades.\nMatthew Graves, the former U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., announced in January that violent crime in the city had reached a 30-year low, citing Metropolitan Police Department data that found violent crime was down 35 percent in 2024 from the previous year. Graves would leave office that month and was succeeded by Ed Martin and later Jeanine Pirro.\nTrump announces takeover of D.C. law enforcement\nTrump announced at a Monday morning press conference that he will be invoking Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to place the Metropolitan Police Department under \u201cdirect federal control.\u201d\nThe president said he would also be deploying the National Guard in the city to \u201chelp reestablish law, order and safety,\u201d but he did not immediately specify how many troops would be utilized.\n\u201cThis is Liberation Day in D.C., and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d he said.\nHow are D.C.\u2019s city leaders responding? Did anyone ask for this?\nIn an interview with MSNBC on Sunday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser emphasized that the city has consistently been driving down crime, saying violent crime specifically is down by 26 percent in 2025 compared to last year.\n\u201cAny comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,\u201d she said, in apparent reference to White House adviser Stephen Miller recently comparing the nation\u2019s capital to Baghdad.\nBowser said she suspects Trump\u2019s Monday morning announcement will be about surging federal law enforcement in the city, acknowledging that the president has the authority to deploy Guardsmen. But she said she disagrees with the premise that Washington, D.C., is experiencing an uptick in crime.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep talking to the president, working with his people on the issues that are high priority for him,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the priority is to show force in an American city, we know he can do that here, but it won\u2019t be because there\u2019s a spike in crime.\u201d\nTrump vows to \u2018liberate\u2019 the nation\u2019s capital\nAhead of his planned 10 a.m. press conference, Trump took to TruthSocial:\nWashington, D.C. will be LIBERATED today! Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR. I will, MAKE OUR CAPITAL GREAT AGAIN! The days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people, are OVER! I quickly fixed the Border (ZERO ILLEGALS in last 3 months!), D.C. is next!!! Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT"

      "text": "The U.S. economic news is bad, so President Donald Trump is shooting the messenger. On Friday, after the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 surprisingly weak monthly jobs report suggested his tariff war was having a brutal impact on U.S. hiring, Trump announced that he was firing widely respected BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer. Here\u2019s how the firing played out, as well as analysis and reaction. Additional commentary is here.\nEconomic authoritarianism\nEconomist and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers\u2019s response to the news:\nFiring the head of a key government agency because you don\u2019t like the numbers they report, which come from surveys using long established procedures, is what happens in authoritarian countries not democratic ones. This is surely not the most serious threat to our democracy that @realDonaldTrump\nposes, but it is the one closest to what we economists do. I don\u2019t see how serious members of the economics profession can stay in his administration.\nWelcome, once again, to the politicization of everything under Trump\nThe president\u2019s firing of McEntarfer for publishing economic statistics that displeased him is disturbing in part because it reflects a broad and deep trend in the second Trump administration to politicize virtually every aspect of the executive branch.\nProtect Democracy\u2019s Ben Raderstorf cites the firing alongside five other very recent developments as demonstrating this pattern: (1) presidential interference in military promotions; (2) the constant hounding of the Federal Reserve Board; (3) the reward of a lifetime judicial appointment for personal Trump henchman Emil Bove; (4) the absolute loyalty to the president being demanded of the top ranks of the Justice Department; and (5) the establishment of a vast new Schedule G of federal employees who will be hired after demonstration of ideological suitability and devotion to the administration\u2019s policy goals. Raderstorf summarizes:\nBefore Donald Trump, our democratic system was quietly predicated on something I think of as the \u201cpolitical-administrative divide.\u201d\nThe notion was simple: Some aspects of government \u2014 national security, the judiciary, monetary policy, law enforcement, and the technical, day-to-day administration of basic functions like gathering employment statistics or assessing drug safety \u2014 are at risk of being undermined and corrupted by politics. And therefore our system needs to mediate, and at times insulate, between the political and administrative spheres.\nDonald Trump and the MAGA movement broke that bipartisan consensus. And now his administration is actively seeking to destroy the political-administrative divide in all areas of American government.\nIn many ways, this is the story of the Trump era. The attempted politicization of everyone in government, from statisticians to judges to civil servants to air traffic controllers, is perhaps the single biggest way this administration has reshaped American democracy (so far).\nThis should be impeachable\nWe constantly have to score the conduct of the 47th president on his own exclusive scale of power hunger and lawlessness. To be honest, I had the same initial thought as AEI\u2019s Scott Winship when I heard about the firing of McEntarfer:\nWe live, however, in a world where even an attempted insurrection occurring right there in the building where they worked did not convince a majority of Republican senators that Donald Trump had committed impeachable offenses, so why bother?\nTrump-appointed BLS commissioner issues stark warning\nFormer BLS commissioner William Beach and other members of the organization Friends of the BLS say the firing of McEntarfer could undermine the entire federal statistical system:\nToday, President Trump called into question the integrity of the Employment Situation report that the BLS released this morning. He accused BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of deliberately reporting false numbers to reflect poorly on this administration. This baseless, damaging claim undermines the valuable work and dedication of BLS staff who produce the reports each month. This escalates the President\u2019s unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system.\nThe President seeks to blame someone for unwelcome economic news. The Commissioner does not determine what the numbers are but simply reports on what the data show. The process of obtaining the numbers is decentralized by design to avoid opportunities for interference. The BLS uses the same proven, transparent, reliable process to produce estimates every month. Every month, BLS revises the prior two months\u2019 employment estimates to reflect slower-arriving, more-accurate information.\nThis rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers. U.S. official statistics are the gold standard globally. When leaders of other nations have politicized economic data, it has destroyed public trust in all official statistics and in government science.\nBLS operates as a federal statistical agency and is afforded autonomy to ensure the data it releases are as accurate as possible. To politicize the work of the agency and its workers does a great disservice not only to BLS but to the entire federal statistical system which this country has relied on for almost 150 years.\nYes, this could really backfire\nTrump clearly doesn\u2019t actually understand the jobs reports\nOr, you know, he\u2019s just suffering paranoid delusion:\nTrump claims jobs reports were \u2018rigged\u2019 against him\nAmid multiple MyPillow ads, Trump is spouting off again against the BLS on Truth Social:\nIn my opinion, today\u2019s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad \u2014 Just like when they had three great days around the 2024 Presidential Election, and then, those numbers were \u201ctaken away\u201d on November 15, 2024, right after the Election, when the Jobs Numbers were massively revised DOWNWARD, making a correction of over 818,000 Jobs \u2014 A TOTAL SCAM. Jerome \u201cToo Late\u201d Powell is no better! But, the good news is, our Country is doing GREAT!\nIt\u2019s a lie:\nIs Jerome Powell next?\nWe don\u2019t yet know if or when Trump will try to ax the Fed chairman, whom the president has repeatedly attacked over his reluctance to lower interest rates.\nMcEntarfer is widely respected\nNotes the New York Times\u2019 Ben Casselman:\nMcEntarfer was appointed to her post by President Biden after a long career at the Census Bureau and other agencies, where she served under presidents of both parties, including Trump. She is widely respected in the statistical community, and outside economists have often said they trust the data coming out of the bureau, thanks to her leadership.\nHer nomination received a rare show of bipartisan support in the Senate last year. She was confirmed by a 86-8 vote, with J.D. Vance among her backers.\nComments AEI director of economic policy studies Michael Strain on X:\nErika McEntarfer has devoted her career to public service. She has conducted herself as BLS Commissioner with great integrity. There is no evidence whatsoever that BLS data are politically biased. By incorrectly asserting that the data are biased, President Trump is undermining the integrity of the information that policymakers, businesses, households, and investors use to make important decisions that affect the welfare of the nation. It is imperative that decisionmakers understand that government statistics are unbiased and of the highest quality. By casting doubt on that, the President is damaging the United States.\nIn other Fed news\nFederal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler, who was nominated by Biden and confirmed in 2023, is resigning effective August 8. This will give Trump the ability to wield more power over Fed policy, the Washington Post reports:\nKugler is unexpectedly stepping down early from the central bank\u2019s powerful board of governors, creating an early vacancy that will give President Donald Trump an early opportunity to shape the Fed\u2019s leadership. \u2026 Though governors are appointed to staggered 14-year terms, it\u2019s common for them to leave early. Still, the timing of Kugler\u2019s departure hands Trump the chance to install a new voice as he pushes aggressively for the central bank to lower rates.\nDeputy BLS commissioner will take over, for now\nDeputy commissioner William Wiatrowski will become acting commissioner, according to Labor secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, who says she wholeheartedly supports Trump\u2019s decision to fire McEntarfer while also echoing what he said:\nI agree wholeheartedly with @POTUS that our jobs numbers must be fair, accurate, and never manipulated for political purposes. A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner. I support the President\u2019s decision to replace Biden\u2019s Commissioner and ensure the American People can trust the important and influential data coming from BLS. During the search for a replacement, Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as Acting Commissioner.\nThanks to President Trump, our economy is BOOMING, and with the help of fair trade deals and the One Big, Beautiful Bill, American workers will prosper!\nObjectivity is dead \u2014 only Trump-approved reality matters now\nAside from the authoritarian implications of the president firing a neutral arbiter of information because he doesn\u2019t like the numbers, we should be concerned about his commitment to fact-free characterizations of the economy. As he said in the Truth Social post announcing the dismissal of McEntarfer: \u201cThe Economy is BOOMING under \u2018TRUMP,\u2019\u201d despite the refusal of Federal Reserve Board chairman Jerome Powell to help it along with interest-rate cuts, making him very likely the next target for a political firing.\nSo how do we know the economy is booming? Because Trump says so, much as Trump claimed he won the presidential election in 2020, and carried the popular vote in 2016, and won by a historic landslide in 2024. Reality is simply what he says it is, and anyone contradicting him is cast aside.\nBLS has been in Trump\u2019s crosshairs\nRecaps CNBC:\nThe stunning demand came the same day that the BLS reported a gain of just 73,000 nonfarm jobs in July, below market expectations. In addition, the bureau revised the two previous months down sharply, cutting a combined 258,000 from the prior counts, putting the three-month growth rate at a paltry 35,000. It was the biggest two-month downward revision since April 2020, the early days of the Covid crisis.\nTrump and congressional Republicans have repeatedly criticized the BLS over the years for its data collection. In particular, the large revisions have been a target.\nIn his spending plan this year, Trump proposed an 8% reduction in staff at the bureau, raising questions over the integrity of its counts on employment, consumer prices and multiple other economic metrics. The bureau has had to impute a growing amount of estimated data into a number of its reports.\nTrump doesn\u2019t just work the refs. He fires them.\nOn any given day, the 47th president often says disturbing things of inordinate length on Truth Social. But his pronouncement today ordering the firing of McEntarfer because he was displeased by BLS\u2019s July jobs report officially sends the United States into Banana Republic territory.\nJobs reports, of course, often disappoint presidents whose economic stewardship is called into question by lagging growth or rising unemployment. It\u2019s bad enough that Trump often tries to work the refs by demanding favorable findings from neutral arbiters like BLS. But firing the refs and replacing them with more pliable appointees is a new one. We can only hope that markets react immediately and strongly to this removal of a key objective source of data, giving Trump something much more painful to cope with than a bad headline on jobs.\nHe can\u2019t fire Wall Street.\nTop White House official acknowledged the jobs report was accurate\nHours before Trump baselessly accused the government of making up numbers, the White House\u2019s top economic adviser acknowledged the report was accurate. \u201cThis jobs report isn\u2019t ideal. There\u2019s no way around that,\u201d Stephen Miran told CNN on Friday afternoon, calling the downward revision in numbers due to \u201canomalous factors.\u201d\nWhat Trump announced on Truth Social\nHe framed the move as ridding the government of another Biden mole out to sabotage his administration:\nI was just informed that our Country\u2019s \u201cJobs Numbers\u201d are being produced by a Biden Appointee, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, who faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala\u2019s chances of Victory. This is the same Bureau of Labor Statistics that overstated the Jobs Growth in March 2024 by approximately 818,000 and, then again, right before the 2024 Presidential Election, in August and September, by 112,000. These were Records \u2014 No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can\u2019t be manipulated for political purposes. McEntarfer said there were only 73,000 Jobs added (a shock!) but, more importantly, that a major mistake was made by them, 258,000 Jobs downward, in the prior two months. Similar things happened in the first part of the year, always to the negative. The Economy is BOOMING under \u201cTRUMP\u201d despite a Fed that also plays games, this time with Interest Rates, where they lowered them twice, and substantially, just before the Presidential Election, I assume in the hopes of getting \u201cKamala\u201d elected \u2013 How did that work out? Jerome \u201cToo Late\u201d Powell should also be put \u201cout to pasture.\u201d Thank you for your attention to this matter!"

      "text": "Since Donald Trump returned to office, his administration has been working to put the names of various Confederates who tried to destroy the United States to preserve slavery back in positions of honor. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s most recent effort in this crusade is particularly egregious:\nHegseth\u2019s post links to an opinion piece in The Blaze touting the Moses Ezekiel monument as a testament to the \u201cnational healing\u201d between north and south that was taking place when it was built in 1914.\nThe monument is actually a prime example of an attempt to revise and sanitize the actual history of the Civil War. As Arlington National Cemetery\u2019s own website explains (in text which may well soon be scrubbed by Hegseth\u2019s commissars), it presents a \u201cmythologized vision of the Confederacy\u201d:\nThe elaborately designed monument offers a nostalgic, mythologized vision of the Confederacy, including highly sanitized depictions of slavery. Standing on a 32-foot-tall pedestal, a bronze, classical female figure, crowned with olive leaves, represents the American South. She holds a laurel wreath, a plow stock and a pruning hook, with a Biblical inscription at her feet: \u201cThey have beat their swords into plough-shares and their spears into pruning hooks. \u2026\u201d\nTwo of these figures are portrayed as African American: an enslaved woman depicted as a \u201cMammy,\u201d holding the infant child of a white officer, and an enslaved man following his owner to war. An inscription of the Latin phrase \u201cVictrix causa diis placuit sed victa Caton\u201d (\u201cThe victorious cause was pleasing to the gods, but the lost cause to Cato\u201d) construes the South\u2019s secession as a noble \u201cLost Cause.\u201d This narrative of the Lost Cause, which romanticized the pre-Civil War South and denied the horrors of slavery, fueled white backlash against Reconstruction and the rights that the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments (1865-1870) had granted to African Americans. The image of the faithful slave, embodied in the two figures on the memorial, appeared widely in American popular culture during the 1910s through 1930s\nLike so many of the memorials that were taken down during the period of racial reckoning after the George Floyd protests, the \u201cReconciliation Monument\u201d was a project of the neo-Confederacy, the long and largely successful effort to revise the memory and meaning of the treasonous rebellion against the United States into a noble \u201cLost Cause,\u201d full of glorious if misunderstood motives. Its immediate purpose was less about honoring Confederate heroes than celebrating their vindication in the South\u2019s battle to overturn Reconstruction and build a racist Jim Crow society, which had been tacitly accepted by the North by the time all those monuments began going up in the early 20th century. It\u2019s not \u201chistory,\u201d but revisionist propaganda.\nMany of these monuments to the Lost Cause were financed and promoted by militant white southern groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy. This group was behind the \u201cReconciliation Monument,\u201d so when the movement to remove neo-Confederate symbols began in the last decade the Arlington statue was a natural target. Its removal was actually supported by a group of descendants of its Confederate veteran architect, Moses Ezekiel, as they explained in a 2017 letter to the Washington Post:\nOne of the most important memorials to the Confederacy is the statue at Arlington National Cemetery, unveiled in 1914. It was sculpted by Moses Jacob Ezekiel, a former Confederate soldier and a prominent sculptor of his time. Ezekiel was our relative.\nLike most such monuments, this statue intended to rewrite history to justify the Confederacy and the subsequent racist Jim Crow laws. It glorifies the fight to own human beings, and, in its portrayal of African Americans, implies their collusion. As proud as our family may be of Moses\u2019s artistic prowess, we \u2014 some twenty Ezekiels \u2014 say remove that statue. Take it out of its honored spot in Arlington National Cemetery and put it in a museum that makes clear its oppressive history.\nNothing has happened to rebut that argument in the ensuring years. It makes you wonder if the real \u201clemmings\u201d here are the people who want to engage with actual history or MAGA zealots like Hegseth, who want to spend $10 million in taxpayer dollars to continue whitewashing it.\nMore on Politics\n- Inventing Emergencies Is Trump\u2019s Superpower\n- All of Trump\u2019s Tacky and Trollish White House Renovations\n- Trump Moves Obama and Bush Portraits in Revenge Redecorating"

      "text": "Google Terms of Service\nEffective May 22, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDF\nCountry version: Sweden\nWhat\u2019s covered in these terms\nWe know it\u2019s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it\u2019s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google services, and what we expect from you.\nThese Terms of Service reflect the way Google\u2019s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we\u2019ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google\u2019s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:\n- What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services\n- What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services\n- Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services \u2014 whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others\n- In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms\nUnderstanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms. We encourage you to download these terms for future reference. We make these terms, and all previous versions, available at all times here.\nBesides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it\u2019s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nTerms\nService provider\nIn the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google services are provided by, and you\u2019re contracting with:\nGoogle Ireland Limited\nincorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland\n(Registration Number: 368047 / VAT Number: IE6388047V)\nGordon House, Barrow Street\nDublin 4\nIreland\nAge requirements\nIf you\u2019re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian\u2019s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.\nIf you\u2019re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you\u2019re responsible for your child\u2019s activity on the services.\nSome Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.\nYour relationship with Google\nThese terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of \u201cGoogle,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour,\u201d we mean Google Ireland Limited and its affiliates. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google\u2019s business works and how we earn money.\nWhat you can expect from us\nProvide a broad range of useful services\n- apps and sites (like Search and Maps)\n- platforms (like Google Shopping)\n- integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies\u2019 apps or sites)\n- devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)\nMany of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.\nOur services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.\nDevelop, improve, and update Google services\nWhile we use a broad definition of \u201cservices\u201d throughout these terms as described above, applicable law draws distinctions between \u201cdigital content\u201d, \u201cservices\u201d, and \u201cgoods\u201d in certain situations. That\u2019s why we use the more specific terms in this section and the Legal guarantee section.\nWe\u2019re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware.\nAs part of the continual evolution of our digital content, services, and goods, we make modifications such as adding or removing features and functionalities, increasing or decreasing usage limits, and offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also change our digital content or services for these other reasons:\n- to adapt to new technologies\n- to reflect increases or decreases in the number of people who use a particular service\n- to respond to key changes in the licenses and partnerships we have with others\n- to prevent abuse or harm\n- to address legal, regulatory, safety, or security issues\nIn particular, we sometimes make legally-required updates, which are modifications that keep digital content, services, or goods in conformity with the law. We make these updates to our digital content, services, and goods for safety or security reasons, and to make sure they meet the quality standards that you expect, such as those described in the Legal guarantee section. We may automatically install updates that address significant safety or security risks. For other updates, you can choose whether you want them installed.\nWe maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons.\nIf a modification negatively affects your ability to access or use our digital content or services, or if we stop offering a service all together, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice by email \u2014 including a description of the changes, when they\u2019ll take place, and your right to end your contract with us if our modifications create more than a minor negative impact \u2014 except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse or harm, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.

If you find that others aren\u2019t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.\nDon\u2019t abuse our services\nMost people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don\u2019t respect those rules, so we\u2019re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:\nYou must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems \u2014 for example, by:- introducing malware\n- spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures\n- jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our safety and bug testing programs\n- accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:\n- phishing\n- creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews\n- misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human\n- providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us\n- providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not\n- using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone\u2019s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights\n- reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law\n- using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)\n- using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology\n- hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms\n- providing services that encourage others to violate these terms\nPermission to use your content\nSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content.

Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nSuspending or terminating your access to Google services\nWithout limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:\n- you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies\n- we\u2019re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order\n- we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google \u2014 for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn\u2019t belong to you\nFor more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center page. If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.\nOf course, you\u2019re always free to stop using our services at any time.

If you\u2019re an EEA-based consumer, please contact us to resolve issues directly. The European Commission also offers an Online Dispute Resolution platform, but Google isn\u2019t legally required to use this or other alternative dispute resolution platforms.\nAbout these terms\nBy law, you have certain rights that can\u2019t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.\nThese terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don\u2019t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.\nWe want to make these terms easy to understand, so we\u2019ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.\nIf you don\u2019t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don\u2019t take action right away, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.\nWe may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business \u2014 for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.\nIf we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.

      "text": "Aside from adding a Diet Coke button and displaying the occasional Sharpie-scrawled map, during Donald Trump\u2019s first term his changes to the White House were in line with the design tweaks every president makes. But in his second term, the real-estate mogul is bringing his maximalist aesthetic to the White House, adding lots of gaudy d\u00e9cor and plotting grand renovations to the building and grounds.\nObviously, on the list of awful things Trump has done in his second term, adding tacky gold trinkets to the Oval Office, building a huge ballroom, and paving the Rose Garden rank pretty low. But the changes, and the taunting ways Trump and his team have shown them off, reflect the broader themes of his second term. It\u2019s like Trump has cast himself in an HGTV show about how to make your home reflect your kinglike abuses of power and quest for revenge.\nHere\u2019s a running list of Trump\u2019s most ridiculous White House renovations.\n.\nA paved over Rose Garden\nTrump has made the iconic space outside the Oval Office less of a Rose Garden and more of a Rose Patio. On August 3, 2025, Trump told reporters that the recently completed project was getting \u201cgreat reviews.\u201d But plenty of people are upset about the loss of the manicured lawn that was installed in 1913, and the before and after photos are jarring.\nHere\u2019s the Rose Garden on the day Barack Obama hosted the 2014 Easter Egg Roll:\nAnd here\u2019s Trump\u2019s freshly paved Rose Garden on July 29, 2025:\nTrump has been obsessing about paving the space all year. The paving of the Rose Garden \u201chas been the subject of almost daily discussions,\u201d according to a February New York Times report. Trump said the grass needed to be replaced because it makes for a less-than-ideal event space, repeatedly citing his concern for women in heels. But the paper suggested the renovation was really about Trump\u2019s desire to replicate Mar-a-Lago at the White House:\nMr. Trump has made clear to associates that he wants to recreate the patio experience at Mar-a-Lago, his members-only club and home in Palm Beach, Fla., creating a better space for entertaining guests. When he is at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump spends hours of his evenings on the patio, with club members and other V.I.P.s dropping by his table to pay their respects. He often holds an iPad, controlling the playlist and blasting Luciano Pavarotti and James Brown at earsplitting volumes.\nIn early August, Trump made the patio even more Mar-a-Lago-y when he installed the exact same patio furniture that he uses at his Florida resort:\nIt turns out Trump is more devoted to his budding DJ career than anyone realized.\n.\nA Mar-a-Lago-esque ballroom\nTrump, in one of his least relatable moments, boasted during a White House reception in February, \u201cI\u2019m very good at building ballrooms.\u201d He went on to claim that he offered to build the White House \u201ca beautiful, beautiful ballroom like I have at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d for free, during the Biden administration.\nSurprisingly, this might actually be true. Trump has been complaining about how White House state dinners are held in tents for years. In his book Believer: My Forty Years in Politics, David Axelrod confirmed that while he was working in the Obama White House, Trump called to pitch him on building a collapsible ballroom worth $100 million.\nOn June 6, 2025, Trump took a break from feuding with Elon Musk to announce that he\u2019d surveyed the site for a new White House ballroom, which will finally be built \u201ccompliments of a man known as Donald J. Trump.\u201d\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on July 31, 2025 that construction of a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom will begin in September, and is expected to be completed \u201clong before the end\u201d of Trump\u2019s term in January 2029. The White House said the president and other donors would pay for the project, but has yet to provide details:\nThe White House shared artists\u2019 renderings of the project:\nOffices in the East Wing will temporarily relocated during construction. That includes the offices of the First Lady, but it\u2019s not like they were getting much use.\n.\nAll gold everything\nTrump is so committed to adding Midas-like touches to the White House that he had his Mar-a-Lago \u201cgold guy\u201d flown in on Air Force One, as The Wall Street Journal reported in April:\nA cabinetmaker from south Florida who has worked on projects at Mar-a-Lago, John Icart helped add custom-made gold finishes to the Oval Office, including gilded carvings for the fireplace mantel and the molding that wraps around the most famous office in the world, administration officials said. Icart traveled to Washington with Trump on Air Force One, according to one of the officials. He declined to comment, referring questions to the White House.\nThis involved festooning the Oval Office with gold furniture and various trinkets, and adding gold carvings to the fireplace and crown molding:\nAdministration officials said Trump personally oversaw the installation of the gold carvings on the mantel in the Oval Office. He also brought gold cherubs from Mar-a-Lago to be installed in the White House.\nProminently displayed next to the Resolute Desk is a large gold FIFA World Cup trophy. Seven gold vases and urns decorate the mantle.\n\u2026 Trump has affixed a gold Trump crest over the door leading into the White House from the colonnade, a recent visitor said. There are gold coasters with Trump\u2019s name on side tables.\nFor comparison, this is what the Oval Office looked like in the last year of the Biden administration:\nAnd this is what it looks like now:\nThis is actually pretty impressive, considering that gold paint doesn\u2019t exist:\n.\nA cluttered Oval Office portrait display\nIs patriotism judged by the number of Founding Fathers you can showcase on your office wall? That\u2019s what Team Trump seems to think. Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino showed off the Oval Office\u2019s newly painting-covered walls in February. According to CNN, Trump has tripled the number of paintings in his office, and you can see at least 15 here:\n.\nA Trump near-assassination painting to replace Obama\u2019s portrait\nThe picture of Trump raising his fist after narrowly avoiding an assassin\u2019s bullet is undeniably cool. But does a painting based on the image need to be hanging on the wall in the White House that\u2019s usually reserved for the latest official presidential portrait? Perhaps not.\nThe Trump White House put the painting in the spot that most recently featured Barack Obama\u2019s portrait, then highlighted the move on social media.\nPetty! But at least the portraits of Trump\u2019s predecessors were just moved, not buried in a storage room. NBC News reported:\nObama\u2019s portrait was not the only one moved during the recent Trump redecoration. The 44th president\u2019s portrait was moved to the spot George W. Bush\u2019s occupied, and Bush\u2019s portrait is now in the staircase, according to a White House official.\n.\nAnother Trump portrait to troll the former First Ladies\nTrump squeezed another image of himself \u2014 the same one he uses as his Truth Social profile picture \u2014 in between the officials portraits of former First Ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton. Representative Jimmy Patronis, a Florida Republican, was first to flag the change to a portrait display on the ground floor of the White House:\nAnd days later, Trump himself showed it off to Glenn Beck:\n.\nA Declaration of Independence replica of unclear origin\nIs it terrible for the president to have a copy of the Declaration of Independence on display in the Oval Office? No. What\u2019s weird is that Trump initially asked to move the original copy of the declaration to his office, according to The Atlantic, though it\u2019s on public display at the National Archives Building in an oxygen-free, argon-filled case.\nInstead, Trump has displayed one of several historic copies that were in the government\u2019s possession. But when he showed it off to Laura Ingraham in a March interview, he acted like it was the original, and did not provide any information on this copy\u2019s historical significance.\n.\nTwo giant \u201cGulf of America\u201d maps\nOne addition that definitely has no historic significance: Trump\u2019s \u201cGulf of America\u201d map \u2014 or rather, maps. Trump joked in February that he was getting \u201cteary-eyed\u201d while looking at the Oval Office display, which is just a printout showing his new name for the Gulf of Mexico.\nEven weirder: At some point he swapped this out for a less-detailed depiction of the \u201cGulf of Mexico.\u201d During his March interview with Fox News\u2019s Laura Ingraham, he gestured to a slightly different map and declared he\u2019s \u201cvery proud of this.\u201d\n.\nTwo \u201cbeautiful\u201d flagpoles\nWhen you looked at the White House did you think, Looks okay, but definitely needs more flagpoles? Apparently that\u2019s what Trump has been doing for years, and now he\u2019s finally taken action.\nAfter he was spotted surveying the White House lawn with groundskeepers on April 23, Trump revealed his plan to install two \u201cbeautiful\u201d poles, which will support a pair of 100-foot-tall, \u201ctop of the line\u201d American flags.\n\u201cThey needed flagpoles for 200 years,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was something I\u2019ve often said, you know, they don\u2019t have a flagpole per se.\u201d Of course, there was already a flag on top of the White House, but apparently that did not count.\nThe new flagpoles were finally, uh \u2026 put up on June 18, 2025. Trump made sure not to use the \u201ce word\u201d at the ceremony, as he didn\u2019t want his fellow fourth graders making fun of him.\nThis post has been updated.\nMore Tremendous Content\n- Trump Moves Obama and Bush Portraits in Revenge Redecorating\n- Apple\u2019s Tim Cook Dazzles Trump by Gifting Him Hunk of Glass\n- Why Was Trump on the Roof?

      "text": "Pentagon is sending 1,500 active duty troops to help secure the US-Mexico border\nPentagon is sending 1,500 active duty troops to help secure the US-Mexico border\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump\u2019s return to Washington\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Pentagon said Wednesday it has begun deploying 1,500 active duty troops to help secure the southern border, putting in motion plans President Donald Trump laid out in executive orders shortly after he took office to crack down on immigration.\nActing Defense Secretary Robert Salesses said the troops will fly helicopters to assist Border Patrol agents and help in the construction of barriers. The Pentagon also will provide military aircraft for Department of Homeland Security deportation flights for more than 5,000 detained migrants.\nThe number of troops and their mission may soon change, Salesses said in a statement. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn short order, the department will develop and execute additional missions in cooperation with DHS, federal agencies, and state partners to address the full range of threats outlined by the President at our nation\u2019s borders,\u201d Salesses said.\nHundreds of immigrants rights supporters gathered in Los Angeles to oppose the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation proposals. The \u201cLA United, Strong, Resilient\u201d vigil was organized by the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), against a series of immigration-related Executive Orders. (AP Video by Eugene Garcia)\nDefense officials added that the department is prepared to provide many more troops if asked, including up to 2,000 more Marines.\nOfficials said there was no plan now for the troops to do law enforcement, which would put them in a dramatically different role for the first time in decades. Any decision on this would be made by the White House, they said.\nThe active duty forces will join the roughly 2,500 U.S. National Guard and Reserve forces already there. Until this deployment, there were no active duty troops working along the roughly 2,000-mile border.\nA couple hundred troops started moving to the border earlier Wednesday, according to a senior military official. The military official and a defense official briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details on the deployment. The troops will include 500 Marines from Camp Pendleton in California, and the remainder will be Army.\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports officials say the Pentagon will start sending active-duty troops to help secure the southern border.\nThe U.S. forces being used for the deportation flights are separate from the 1,500 deployed for the border mission. Those flights will involve four Air Force aircraft based in San Diego an El Paso, along with crews and maintenance personnel.\nTroops have done similar duties in support of Border Patrol agents in the past, when both Trump and former President Joe Biden sent active duty troops to the border.\nTroops are prohibited by law from doing law enforcement duties under the Posse Comitatus Act, but that may change. Trump has directed through executive order that the incoming secretary of defense and incoming homeland security chief report back within 90 days if they think an 1807 law called the Insurrection Act should be invoked. That would allow those troops to be used in civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.\nThe last time the act was invoked was in 1992 during rioting in Los Angeles in protest of the acquittal of four police officers charged with beating Rodney King.\nThe widely expected deployment, coming in Trump\u2019s first week in office, was an early step in his long-touted plan to expand the use of the military along the border. In one of his first orders on Monday, Trump directed the defense secretary to come up with a plan to \u201cseal the borders\u201d and repel \u201cunlawful mass migration.\u201d\n\u201cThis is something President Trump campaigned on,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary. \u201cThe American people have been waiting for such a time as this -- for our Department of Defense to actually implement homeland security seriously. This is a No. 1 priority for the American people.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, just as Trump fired the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, the service announced it was surging more cutter ships, aircraft and personnel to the \u201cGulf of America\u201d \u2014 a nod to the president\u2019s directive to rename the Gulf of Mexico.\nTrump said during his inaugural address on Monday that \u201cI will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places in which they came.\u201d\nMilitary personnel have been sent to the border almost continuously since the 1990s to help address migration. drug trafficking and transnational crime.\nIn executive orders signed Monday, Trump suggested the military would help the Department of Homeland Security with \u201cdetention space, transportation (including aircraft), and other logistics services.\u201d\nThere are about 20,000 Border Patrol agents, and while the southern border is where most are located, they\u2019re also responsible for protecting the northern border with Canada. Usually agents are tasked with looking for drug smugglers or people trying to enter the country undetected.\nMore recently, however, they have had to deal with migrants actively seeking out Border Patrol in order to get refuge in America \u2014 taxing the agency\u2019s staff.\nIn his first term, Trump ordered active duty troops to the border in response to a caravan of migrants slowly making its way through Mexico toward the United States in 2018. More than 7,000 active duty troops were sent to Texas, Arizona and California, including military police, an assault helicopter battalion, various communications, medical and headquarters units, combat engineers, planners and public affairs units.\nAt the time, the Pentagon was adamant that active duty troops would not do law enforcement. So they spent much of their time transporting Border Patrol agents to and along the border, helping them erect additional vehicle barriers and fencing along the border, assisting them with communications and providing some security for border agent camps.\nThe military also provided Border Patrol agents with medical care, pre-packaged meals and temporary housing.\nIt also was not yet clear if the Trump administration will eventually order the military to use bases to house detained migrants. The defense officials said such a request has not been made as of yet.\nBases previously have been used for that purpose, and after the 2021 fall of Kabul to the Taliban, they were used to host thousands of Afghan evacuees. The facilities struggled to support the influx.\nIn 2018, then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ordered Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, to prepare to house as many as 20,000 unaccompanied migrant children, but the additional space ultimately wasn\u2019t needed and Goodfellow was determined not to have the infrastructure necessary to support the surge.\nIn March 2021, the Biden administration greenlighted using property at Fort Bliss, Texas, for a detention facility to provide beds for up to 10,000 unaccompanied migrant children as border crossings increased from Mexico.\nThe facility, operated by DHS, was quickly overrun, with far too few case managers for the thousands of children that arrived, exposure to extreme weather and dust and unsanitary conditions, a 2022 inspector general report found.\n____\nAssociated Press writers Aamer Madhani and Rebecca Santana contributed to this report."

      "text": "Of all the fables Donald Trump has told to justify his past, present, and future claims of \u201cstolen\u201d elections, one of the most persistent has also been one of the least well founded: the idea that noncitizens are voting for Democrats in large numbers. After his 2016 win, Trump claimed he would have won the national popular vote (which he actually lost by more than 2.8 million votes) had not illegal voters flooded the polls to support Hillary Clinton. Did he offer any evidence for this allegation? Zilch, nada, nothing, which isn\u2019t unusual for Trump. The two major national studies of voting-fraud allegations, one from the conservative Heritage Foundation and the other from the nonpartisan but progressive Brennan Center, found no evidence of noncitizen voting in numbers significant enough to affect any elections. A frequently distorted 2014 analysis of noncitizen voting based on extrapolation of Arizona online-survey data suggested an upper range for noncitizen voting in the hundreds of thousands nationally and a lower range much, much smaller. But it included no verifiable examples, and the author has frequently complained about Trump\u2019s misuse of his data. Even though Trump and congressional Republicans have cynically demanded new laws cracking down on alleged noncitizen voting, it\u2019s already a crime under federal law, punishable by both a prison term and deportation.\nThis year, Trump has not just repeated unsupported claims of massive noncitizen voting but placed them near the heart of his campaign message. In a barely disguised version of the racist right-wing Great Replacement Theory, Trump has repeatedly alleged that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have \u201copened the border\u201d precisely in order to recruit illegal voters for their candidacies. Any evidence for this inflammatory claim? Of course not; it\u2019s supposed to be self-evident. If it were actually happening, of course, there would be concrete evidence in every direction. But in fact, even in red states, there\u2019s more and more evidence it\u2019s all a Trump hoax to motivate his base and perhaps justify another denial of the results. One clear case is in Ohio, as the BBC recently noted:\nEarlier this year, the office of Ohio\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose \u2014 a Trump supporter \u2014 examined around eight million registrations and found around 600 people on the state\u2019s voter rolls who could not prove their US citizenship.\nMeanwhile, the state also struck an additional 155,000 registrations from the rolls, largely because of address changes.\nFinding a handful of people who \u201ccould not prove their U.S. citizenship\u201d is not the same as proving they were noncitizens, and it\u2019s entirely possible some of these voters who lost their registration had been planning for vote for Trump. But beyond that, there\u2019s a new example of official red-state voting data that contradicts everything Trump is saying on this subject, as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports:\nAn audit uncovered 20 noncitizens out of 8.2 million registered voters in Georgia, according to findings announced by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Wednesday.\nNine of those 20 noncitizens cast ballots several years ago, before ID verification checks were in place, while the other 11 were registered but never actually voted, the audit showed. Election officials canceled their voter registrations and reported them to district attorneys for potential prosecution \u2026\n\u201cThis is the most comprehensive citizenship check ever conducted in the history of Georgia, if not the most comprehensive check ever conducted in the United States,\u201d said Raffensperger, a Republican. \u201cGeorgia is a model when it comes to preventing noncitizen voting.\u201d\nMore to the point, Georgia is a model when it comes to documenting the absence of noncitizen voting. That\u2019s not necessarily what Raffensperger expected when he initiated his audit; earlier this year, he penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed warning that \u201cprogressives\u201d wanted noncitizens to vote (though the examples he cited all involved local, not federal, elections, where, once again, noncitizen voting is already illegal). What\u2019s clear now is that the Republican election supervisor of one of the seven battleground states has definitively certified the voter rolls to be free of noncitizens. If Harris carries Georgia, what will Trump blame it on?\nYes, people deep in the tank for the 45th president will observe that, despite his Republican identity, Raffensperger is fatally unfriendly to Trump, as evidenced by his refusal in 2020 to \u201cfind\u201d enough additional votes to erase the Biden victory in Georgia that the secretary and his Republican boss, Governor Brian Kemp, duly certified (an act of independence that led Trump to try to purge them in the 2022 primaries, unsuccessfully). But it\u2019s increasingly clear that the facts are what\u2019s most unfriendly to the MAGA claim of massive \u201cillegal voting.\u201d\nMore on politics\n- Inventing Emergencies Is Trump\u2019s Superpower\n- All of Trump\u2019s Tacky and Trollish White House Renovations\n- Trump Moves Obama and Bush Portraits in Revenge Redecorating"

      "text": "From paving the Rose Garden to constructing a massive ballroom, President Trump is on a mission to transform the White House into Mar-a-Lago North. And one thing his coastal Florida residence definitely doesn\u2019t feature is artwork honoring some of his biggest presidential antagonists.\nSo now he has moved the official portrait of Barack Obama from the Grand Foyer of the White House to the top of the Grand Staircase, which means it will not be visible to the thousands of people who take public tours each day. As CNN reported, portraits of George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush have been moved to the same location.\nThis is not just a routine artwork rotation. White House protocol calls for the paintings of the most recent presidents to be placed at the public entrance to the executive mansion. (Joe Biden has been spared this revenge redecorating as his portrait is not yet finished.) Trump is reportedly heavily involved in all the recent White House renovations, and two sources told CNN that Trump directed staffers to move the Obama portrait.\nSince returning to office, Trump has been relocating portraits for maximum trolling. These changes have been highlighted by the president himself and on official social-media feeds. In April, Trump squeezed an image of himself \u2014 the same one he uses as his Truth Social profile picture \u2014 between portraits of former First Ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton:\nAround the same time, Obama\u2019s official portrait was moved across the Grand Foyer to make space for a painting of Trump with his fist raised after surviving an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania:\nApparently, Trump recently decided that being featured anywhere in public view is too good for the 44th president. As CNN noted, now only people with access to the private residence will be able to see the portraits of Obama and the two Bushes:\nCNN obtained a photo of the Obama portrait hanging at the top of the stairwell in a corner, at the landing of the entrance to the private residence. That area is heavily restricted to members of the first family, US Secret Service agents, and a limited number of White House and executive residence staff. It is firmly out of view for any visitor hoping to see the photorealistic Robert McCurdy painting of the former president, a source familiar with the matter confirmed.\nThis adds yet another weird wrinkle to the story. The president being so petty that he has to hide portraits of his predecessors is one thing. But why not just put the paintings in storage or some unused hallway? Instead, Trump put paintings of his presidential nemeses in a spot where he alone can see them as he plots his revenge. It\u2019s a real supervillain move.\nMore Tremendous Content\n- All of Trump\u2019s Tacky and Trollish White House Renovations\n- Apple\u2019s Tim Cook Dazzles Trump by Gifting Him Hunk of Glass\n- Why Was Trump on the Roof?

      "text": "Already numb to tariff twists, US importers see legal decisions as another price of doing business\nAlready numb to tariff twists, US importers see legal decisions as another price of doing business\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Businesses rattled by President Donald Trump\u2019s on again, off again tariffs absorbed more jolts on Thursday after a U.S. appeals court temporarily blocked a federal court order that would have halted most of his taxes on foreign imports.\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled late Wednesday that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency as justification for his wide-ranging tariffs.\nBut a federal appeals court on Thursday afternoon granted a motion allowing the government to continue collecting tariffs under the emergency powers law while the Trump administration challenges the trade court\u2019s decision.\nEven before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stepped in, business owners and the National Retail Federation had said that without a definitive word in the case, the Wednesday ruling only created more uncertainty and made it harder to budget and plan.\n\u201cThe ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade blocking most of President Trump\u2019s tariffs is just another chapter in this difficult journey toward a clear, consistent and strategic trade policy,\u201d Jonathan Gold, the trade group\u2019s vice president of supply chain and customs policy, said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe urge rapid resolution as this process continues in the courts.\u201d\nThe president invoked the emergency powers law in early April when he imposed varying import tax rates on products from dozens of countries, including the biggest trading partners of the U.S. After financial markets showed signs of panic, Trump lowered the rate to 10% for every country except China, whose goods were taxed at 145%.\nJonathan Silva, the owner of WS Game Company, said he did not intend to change his plans based on the ruling. He has the board games his company sells made in China,\n\u201cWe know that this will take time for the appeals process to take place and a final ruling to be instituted,\u201d Silva said. \u201cBut we are hopeful that this will be the beginning of a more academic use of tariffs in the coming months and years. All we want to do is have certainty in the environment that we are operating in, as the day-to-day retaliations and pauses are not conducive to business operations.\u201d\nThe CEO of electronics retailer Best Buy, Corie Barry, told reporters on Thursday that the legal news did not make her more or less optimistic but rather underscored the importance of continuing to remain agile while not changing course in response to near-daily tariff developments.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we would do differently based on the news overnight,\u201d Barry said. \u201cWhat I really tried to work with the team on is to not actually overreact to any given moment in time, but instead to stay maniacally focused on our customers and ensure we are bringing the right assortment, price, and (promotions) to them, whatever the backdrop.\u201d\nBarry told analysts that Best Buy has taken a variety of steps to offset higher tariff costs, including pushing vendors to spread out where they do manufacturing. The company is increasing some prices to absorb tariff-related costs, she said, calling the move \u201ca last resort.\u201d She declined to be specific given the fluid situation.\nJim Umlauf, whose business, 4Knines, based in Oklahoma City, makes vehicle seat covers and cargo liners for dog owners and others, said the court ruling did not offer reassurance but only further complicated his decision-making.\n\u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t know whether the decision will hold, whether it applies to (Trump\u2019s) original 2018 tariffs, or how it will be enforced,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout clarity, we\u2019re left planning around a moving target. Like many others, we\u2019ve already locked in quotes and made purchasing decisions assuming tariffs would remain in place. This development, rather than offering relief, introduces new logistical complications at the worst possible time.\u201d\nKelsey O\u2019Callaghan, the founder of a Salt Lake City kitchen and bathroom accessories company called Dorai Home, said she expected the trade war to continue. The constant flux since Trump\u2019s return to office has made her \u201cnumb,\u201d but O\u2019Callaghan said she has tried to make educated decisions.\nThe company already postponed the launch of several new products, laid off the CEO and some other key employees. It paused order shipments from China in early April but resumed some on a staggered basis when the president Trump lowered the rate for Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days.\nNow, Dorai Home plans to test price increases to see if shoppers will still buy its products.\n\u201cIn a business sense, you have to try to create as much certainty and stability as you can with the variables you can control,\u201d O\u2019Callaghan said.\nBut some businesses were more optimistic. Burlington Coat Factory CEO Michael B. O\u2019Sullivan said Thursday that the tariff pause might help discount retailers like his that buy excess inventory from other retail companies.\nThe court ruling and continued uncertainty may further fuel a production race that started when the tariff rate for Chinese products were substantially reduced, O\u2019Sullivan said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s now a huge rush on production and shipping across the industry. Now, the court decision last night could add to that rush,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of shortages, this topsy-turvy stop/start surge has the potential to create attractive buying opportunities.\u201d"

      "text": "Normal people have no reason to understand or appreciate the extraordinary individual and collective self-regard traditionally enjoyed by the Senate. Created by the Founders for the explicit purpose of restraining popular control over policy-making, the upper chamber has forever valued long, windy debates; operated according to arcane rules that limit the prerogatives of the majority; and treated individual senators as though they wear actual togas and defer to no one other than the gods (and occasionally constituents, though six-year terms provide quite a bit of job security). Senators typically look down on their theoretically co-equal House counterparts as grubby lilliputians stampeded through party-line votes by all-powerful leaders and spending every waking hour running for reelection.\nIn truth, Senate traditions have been eroding for a good while now. The chamber has been forced to create multiple loopholes inhibiting the power of the filibuster to obstruct both legislation and confirmations (the latter being a unique Senate responsibility) of judges and executive-branch appointees. For all the mythology of senators as independent actors, partisan polarization has affected them just like everyone else in American politics. They\u2019re vulnerable to disciplinary actions by partisan activists, powerful lobbyists, and most especially the White House with its ability to control and sometimes direct disbursements of federal funds.\nBut while both major parties have played a role in the gradual transformation of the Senate into an institution that often resembles the House, the Republican-controlled 119th Congress, operating under the whip of the president, may be finally breaking the Senate as we have known it.\nThe very appellation given to the budget-reconciliation bill utilized to enact Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signified the radical centralization of power in the White House and a handful of congressional leaders, at the expense, in particular, of Senate committees and individual senators, even those in the majority party. Most Republican senators, in fact, objected to the one-bill framework from the get-go, to no avail. But it\u2019s not just that Trump and his allies deployed to the maximum extent possible the tools available for draining senators of power and purpose; they created new tools that made a mockery of Senate traditions, most notably in blowing up the system (relying on nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office numbers and rulemaking by the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian) for ensuring that budget reconciliation bills don\u2019t increase budget deficits (to the tune of trillions of dollars in \u201cfree\u201d tax cuts).\nThe Senate\u2019s current management has at the same time made colleagues from the minority party as impotent as their House colleagues. With the filibuster off the table for most legislative content, the only pressure point Senate Democrats have had is the unsavory option (which just enough of them chose not to exercise) of forcing a government shutdown when stopgap spending bills ran out. Indeed, after initially promising to restore \u201cregular order\u201d in the construction of spending bills that would require bipartisan support, Senate Republicans have gone along with the demands of Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s budget director, to claw back previously approved spending through a process that just requires majority approval. And it appears that when the current stopgap spending measure expires at the end of September, they will again dare Senate Democrats to shut down the government if they don\u2019t accept a Republican blueprint dictated by the House.\nDemocrats have responded to all this wild partisanship and violation of Senate traditions by taking advantage of their time-honored ability to slow-walk confirmations, already made a bit of a joke by the Senate GOP\u2019s abject cowardice about challenging grossly unqualified Trump nominees for a host of offices. Are their Republican colleagues responding with offers to respect their own institution\u2019s traditions a bit more faithfully? No, as the New York Times\u2019 Carl Hulse reports, they\u2019re looking at killing the traditions altogether:\nSenate Republicans are actively exploring unilateral changes in Senate rules to speed confirmation of Trump administration nominees in the fall after they failed to break stiff Democratic resistance to executive branch picks before leaving on their August recess \u2026\nTriggering a rules change through majority muscle is known in the Senate as going nuclear because of the extreme partisan nature of such a move, as well as the cloud it can cast over the institution. An incendiary rules fight next month could poison relations just as Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline for funding the government and the Senate is making rare progress on individual spending bills.\nDid Democrats force Republicans to \u201cgo nuclear\u201d? It actually seems like they\u2019ve been engaged in good-faith negotiations despite massive pressure from party activists to \u201cfight\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d Trump at every opportunity:\nIn an initial round of talks, Democrats offered to clear the way for about 25 relatively noncontentious nominees. In exchange, they wanted the White House to release an array of funds it has held up, including $5 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $50 million for combating AIDS overseas and $142 million for UNICEF programs along with $300 million in humanitarian assistance for Gaza.\nWhen Republicans then pushed for more confirmations, Democrats countered with a demand that the White House commit in writing that it would not try to force any more spending cuts through Congress before Oct. 1.\nNegotiations broke down and Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Schumer on social media, telling him to \u201cGO TO HELL!\u201d Mr. Thune adjourned the Senate and sent lawmakers home.\nWhile Thune may have been willing to play ball, his Lord and Master pitched a temper tantrum and renewed demands that the proud U.S. Senate be run like Mar-a-Lago \u2014 and, for that matter, like Mike Johnson\u2019s House, but with bigger offices.\nThe odds are pretty good that Republicans will hang onto the Senate in 2026 thanks to an exceptionally friendly landscape. But they may find themselves controlling the empty shell of an institution with as much tradition and dignity as the cheesy gilded White House that rules it."

      "text": "The 911 presidency: Trump flexes emergency powers in his second term\nThe 911 presidency: Trump flexes emergency powers in his second term\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Call it the 911 presidency.\nDespite insisting that the United States is rebounding from calamity under his watch, President Donald Trump is harnessing emergency powers unlike any of his predecessors.\nWhether it\u2019s leveling punishing tariffs, deploying troops to the border or sidelining environmental regulations, Trump has relied on rules and laws intended only for use in extraordinary circumstances like war and invasion.\nAn analysis by The Associated Press shows that 30 of Trump\u2019s 150 executive orders have cited some kind of emergency power or authority, a rate that far outpaces his recent predecessors.\nThe result is a redefinition of how presidents can wield power. Instead of responding to an unforeseen crisis, Trump is using emergency powers to supplant Congress\u2019 authority and advance his agenda.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s notable about Trump is the enormous scale and extent, which is greater than under any modern president,\u201d said Ilya Somin, who is representing five U.S. businesses who sued the administration, claiming they were harmed by Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs.\nBecause Congress has the power to set trade policy under the Constitution, the businesses convinced a federal trade court that Trump overstepped his authority by claiming an economic emergency to impose the tariffs. An appeals court has paused that ruling while the judges review it.\nGrowing concerns over actions\nThe legal battle is a reminder of the potential risks of Trump\u2019s strategy. Judges traditionally have given presidents wide latitude to exercise emergency powers that were created by Congress. However, there\u2019s growing concern that Trump is pressing the limits when the U.S. is not facing the kinds of threats such actions are meant to address.\n\u201cThe temptation is clear,\u201d said Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program and an expert in emergency powers. \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable is how little abuse there was before, but we\u2019re in a different era now.\u201d\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who has drafted legislation that would allow Congress to reassert tariff authority, said he believed the courts would ultimately rule against Trump in his efforts to single-handedly shape trade policy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Constitution. James Madison wrote it that way, and it was very explicit,\u201d Bacon said of Congress\u2019 power over trade. \u201cAnd I get the emergency powers, but I think it\u2019s being abused. When you\u2019re trying to do tariff policy for 80 countries, that\u2019s policy, not emergency action.\u201d\nThe White House pushed back on such concerns, saying Trump is justified in aggressively using his authority.\n\u201cPresident Trump is rightfully enlisting his emergency powers to quickly rectify four years of failure and fix the many catastrophes he inherited from Joe Biden \u2014 wide open borders, wars in Ukraine and Gaza, radical climate regulations, historic inflation, and economic and national security threats posed by trade deficits,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\nTrump frequently cites 1977 law to justify actions\nOf all the emergency powers, Trump has most frequently cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to justify slapping tariffs on imports.\nThe law, enacted in 1977, was intended to limit some of the expansive authority that had been granted to the presidency decades earlier. It is only supposed to be used when the country faces \u201can unusual and extraordinary threat\u201d from abroad \u201cto the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.\u201d\nIn analyzing executive orders issued since 2001, the AP found that Trump has invoked the law 21 times in presidential orders and memoranda. President George W. Bush, grappling with the aftermath of the most devastating terror attack on U.S. soil, invoked the law just 14 times in his first term. Likewise, Barack Obama invoked the act only 21 times during his first term, when the U.S. economy faced the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression.\nThe Trump administration has also deployed an 18th century law, the Alien Enemies Act, to justify deporting Venezuelan migrants to other countries, including El Salvador. Trump\u2019s decision to invoke the law relies on allegations that the Venezuelan government coordinates with the Tren de Aragua gang, but intelligence officials did not reach that conclusion.\nCongress has ceded its power to the presidency\nCongress has granted emergency powers to the presidency over the years, acknowledging that the executive branch can act more swiftly than lawmakers if there is a crisis. There are 150 legal powers \u2014 including waiving a wide variety of actions that Congress has broadly prohibited \u2014 that can only be accessed after declaring an emergency. In an emergency, for example, an administration can suspend environmental regulations, approve new drugs or therapeutics, take over the transportation system, or even override bans on testing biological or chemical weapons on human subjects, according to a list compiled by the Brennan Center for Justice.\nDemocrats and Republicans have pushed the boundaries over the years. For example, in an attempt to cancel federal student loan debt, Joe Biden used a post-Sept. 11 law that empowered education secretaries to reduce or eliminate such obligations during a national emergency. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually rejected his effort, forcing Biden to find different avenues to chip away at his goals.\nBefore that, Bush pursued warrantless domestic wiretapping and Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the detention of Japanese-Americans on the West Coast in camps for the duration of World War II.\nTrump, in his first term, sparked a major fight with Capitol Hill when he issued a national emergency to compel construction of a border wall. Though Congress voted to nullify his emergency declaration, lawmakers could not muster up enough Republican support to overcome Trump\u2019s eventual veto.\n\u201cPresidents are using these emergency powers not to respond quickly to unanticipated challenges,\u201d said John Yoo, who as a Justice Department official under George W. Bush helped expand the use of presidential authorities. \u201cPresidents are using it to step into a political gap because Congress chooses not to act.\u201d\nTrump, Yoo said, \u201chas just elevated it to another level.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s allies support his moves\nConservative legal allies of the president also said Trump\u2019s actions are justified, and Vice President JD Vance predicted the administration would prevail in the court fight over tariff policy.\n\u201cWe believe \u2014 and we\u2019re right \u2014 that we are in an emergency,\u201d Vance said last week in an interview with Newsmax.\n\u201cYou have seen foreign governments, sometimes our adversaries, threaten the American people with the loss of critical supplies,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about toys, plastic toys. I\u2019m talking about pharmaceutical ingredients. I\u2019m talking about the critical pieces of the manufacturing supply chain.\u201d\nVance continued, \u201cThese governments are threatening to cut us off from that stuff, that is by definition, a national emergency.\u201d\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers have tried to rein in a president\u2019s emergency powers. Two years ago, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate introduced legislation that would have ended a presidentially-declared emergency after 30 days unless Congress votes to keep it in place. It failed to advance.\nSimilar legislation hasn\u2019t been introduced since Trump\u2019s return to office. Right now, it effectively works in the reverse, with Congress required to vote to end an emergency.\n\u201cHe has proved to be so lawless and reckless in so many ways. Congress has a responsibility to make sure there\u2019s oversight and safeguards,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who cosponsored an emergency powers reform bill in the previous session of Congress. He argued that, historically, leaders relying on emergency declarations has been a \u201cpath toward autocracy and suppression.\u201d\n\u2014-\nContact AP\u2019s global investigative team at [email protected] or https://www.ap.org/tips/"

Send counter-notices to the same addresses listed above and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider\u2019s address is located, or, if the content provider\u2019s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.\nIf a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company\u2019s discretion.\nIf the Sites receive more than one Notice of Copyright Infringement concerning a user, the user may be deemed a \u201crepeat copyright infringer.\u201d The Sites reserve the right to terminate the accounts of \u201crepeat copyright infringers.\u201d\nMaterial on our Sites may include inaccuracies or typographical errors.

We are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaching these Terms or our failing to use reasonable care and skill. However, you understand that to the extent permitted under applicable law, in no event will we or our officers, employees, directors, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, subcontractors or licensors be liable under any theory of liability (whether in contract, tort, statutory, or otherwise) for any unforeseeable, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of revenues, profits, business, business interruption, business opportunity goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if such parties were advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your (or anyone using your account\u2019s) use of the Services. We will not be liable for damages which you could have avoided by following our advice, including to apply an update, patch or error correction offered to you free of charge or to have in place the minimum system requirements advised by us. We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or any delay in the performance of, any of our obligations under these Terms that is caused by any event or circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including any failure of public or private telecommunications networks or any delays or latency due to your physical location or your wireless data service provider\u2019s network. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, in no event shall our liability to you exceed the amount of fees you paid us (if applicable) for a period of three months prior to the date you submit a claim.\n17. Exclusions and Limitations\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent that we may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of our liability shall be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.\n18. Indemnification\nYou agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us, our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants, subcontractors and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from your (or anyone using your accounts) violation of these Terms. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim. You shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: \u201cA general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.\u201d\n19. Arbitration Agreement\nPlease read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Vox Media, LLC, and any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, brands and entities that it controls, including Curbed, Eater, Grub Street, New York Magazine, Polygon, POPSUGAR, Recode, SB Nation, Select All, The Cut, The Daily Intelligencer, The Dodo, The Strategist, The Verge, Thrillist, Vox, Vulture, and other affiliated sites, properties, or applications (collectively \u201cVox Media,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. Both you and Vox Media acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Vox Media\u2019s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof. Any arbitrations filed after the date these terms go into effect must comply with these arbitration provisions.\nThe parties agree that this Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16.\nPre-Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Procedure\nThe parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Vox Media must be emailed to TOS.Disputes@voxmedia.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). A Notice to you by Vox Media must be sent to the email address associated with your Vox Media subscription or Membership, if applicable. Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; and (if different) the email address associated with the relevant Vox Media subscription or Membership; (ii) if you are submitting the Notice, how and when you became a member, your membership history, and current membership status; (iii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, including any relevant facts, and if you are submitting the Notice, facts pertaining to your use of Vox Media communities and sites ; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice; and (vi) if you are the claimant and are represented by counsel, your signed statement authorizing Vox Media to disclose your Vox Media membership details to your attorney while seeking to resolve your claim. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute.\nAfter receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually-convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules).\nCompliance with this section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures. All of the procedures are essential so that you and Vox Media have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of these procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these procedures in arbitration.\nArbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement\nIf such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitrationThe arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by the NAM. (If the NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 5.) The NAM Rules are available online at https://namadr.com/ by calling NAM at 1-800-358-2550, or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. For all U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held (i) at a location determined under the applicable NAM rules and procedures that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. For all non-U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held in Washington, DC, District of Columbia.\nYou and we agree as otherwise expressly provided herein and except as to the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution requirements referenced above and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented).\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement, applicability of the SOL, whether claim can or should be brought in small claims, whether a plaintiff or the company has complied with the pre-arbitration notice and negotiation requirements, or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration (including whether a dispute is subject to this Arbitration Agreement or a previous arbitration provision between you and Vox Media), which are for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.\nAt the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Vox Media and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.\nAs in court, you and Vox Media agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.\nExcept as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including the awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in accordance with applicable law. You and we agree that dispositive motions shall be allowed in any arbitration if requested by either party.\nIn any arbitration between you and Vox Media, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing.\nCosts of Arbitration\nUnless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b). The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees.\nSmall Claims Court; Infringement\nEither you or Vox Media, LLC may elect to have any claim that qualifies for small claims court in the United States county where you live or work heard by such small claims court. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.\nWaiver of Jury Trial\nYOU AND VOX MEDIA WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Vox Media are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Vox Media over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND VOX MEDIA WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.\nWaiver of Class or Consolidated Actions\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Vox Media is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth below.\nMass Filings Procedure\nIf, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements herein, until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Arbitrator selection for each batch or stage shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and shall be subject to any rights to strike an arbitrator provided under applicable state law if the rights granted by law exceed those provided for in the NAM rules, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.\nStage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Vox Media shall each select 10 claims per side (20 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Vox Media shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee.\nStage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Vox Media shall each select 20 claims per side (40 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Vox Media shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee.\nStage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Vox Media shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge.\nIf your claim is not resolved as part of the staged process identified above, either:\nOption One: You and Vox Media may separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have the claim heard in court consistent with the Agreement. You may opt out of arbitration by providing your individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out by sending Vox Media an email to TOS.Disputes@voxmedia.com. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to opt out of arbitration within 30 days after the conclusion of Stage 3 or the elective mediation associated with Stage 3. Vox Media may opt your claim out of arbitration by sending an individual, personally signed notice of its intention to opt out to your counsel within 14 days after the expiration of your 30 day opt out period. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.\nOR\nOption Two: If neither you nor Vox Media elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 200, then 200 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 200, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 200 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims.\nA court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement.\nYou and Vox Media agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Vox Media acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.\nOpt-out\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address:\nVox Media Inc., 1701 Rhode Island Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement. Notices sent to any other address, or sent by electronic mail or communicated orally, will not be accepted or effective. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Vox also will not be bound by it.\nExclusive Venue\nIf you send the opt-out notice and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Vox Media to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then both you and Vox Media agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Washington, DC, District of Columbia, or the federal district in which that county falls.\n20.

Contact Us\n1.\nInformation We Automatically Collect\nCategories of Information. We and our third-party service providers (including any third-party content, advertising, and analytics providers) automatically collect certain information from your device or web browser when you interact with the Services to help us understand how our users use the Services and to target advertising to you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as \u201cUsage Data\u201d). For example, each time you visit the Services we and our third-party service providers may automatically collect your location, IP address, mobile device identifier or other unique identifier, browser and computer type, Internet service provider used, clickstream information, access time, the Web page you came from, the URL you go to next, the Web page(s) that you access during your visit and your interaction with content or advertising on the Services. We may contract with third parties to collect this information on our behalf for analytics purposes.\nPurposes For This Information. We and our third-party service providers use such Usage Data for a variety of purposes including to diagnose problems with our servers and software, to administer the Services, to gather demographic information and to target advertising to you on the Services and elsewhere online. Accordingly, our third-party advertising networks and ad servers will also provide us with information, including reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked on the Services in a manner that does not identify personally any specific individual. The Usage Data we collect is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Data.\n2.\nCookies/Tracking Technologies\nWe use tracking technologies, such as cookies, local storage, and pixel tags.\nCookies and Local Storage\nCookies and local storage may be set and accessed on your computer. Upon your first visit to the Services, a cookie or local storage will be sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. \u201cCookies\u201d and local storage are small files containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer\u2019s browser and stored on your device when you visit a website. Many major Web services use cookies to provide useful features for their users. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, if you reject cookies, you will not be able to sign in to the Services or take full advantage of our Services. Additionally, if you clear all cookies on your browser at any point after setting your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent, you will have to again reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nFor more information, please read our Cookie Policy.\nPixel Tags\nWe also use \u201cpixel tags,\u201d which are small graphic files that allow us and third parties to monitor the use of the Services and collect Usage Data. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of the device that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie previously placed by that server on your computer.\nWe use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third-party advertisers, service providers and ad networks, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our sites and Services and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you. Pixel tags also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit the Services or other websites.\nLog Files\nA log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, such as your service use data. We collect log files and other usage information when you access, use and interact with the Services (even if you have not created an account or logged into your account on the Services), including IP address, date and time that you signed up for an account, language setting, browser type, operating system type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, page you requested, user agent, date and time stamps, clickstream data, and information about your search and click activity.\nDevice Fingerprinting\nDevice fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device\u2019s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of your device and uniquely identify your device and apps.\nApp Technologies, Customization, and Usage\nThere are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in our apps that allow us to collect information about your installation, use, and updating of our apps as well as information about your device, including your unique mobile device identifier (\u201cUDID\u201d) and other technical identifiers. More specifically, these tracking technologies allow us to collect data about your device and your use of our apps, the pages, videos, other content, or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, and items you download. These tracking technologies are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us to track our conversions and communicate with you across devices, bring you advertising both on and off the Services, customize the app to your interests and preferences and link such across platforms and devices, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.\nLocation-Identifying Technologies\nGPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect location data when you enable location-based services through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device\u2019s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.\nIn addition, we use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes essential to the operation of our sites and business.\nFor more information about the use of cookies and similar technology on our Service, please review Section 13 of this Privacy Policy and our Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy. You can also find more information about cookies and how they work, what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them here and here.\n3.\nInformation You Choose To Submit\nYou can visit the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as \u201cPersonal Data\u201d). If, however, you wish to register to become a member of the Services, you are required to provide certain Personal Data (for example, your name and email address), and you must also provide a username and password. We use your Personal Data to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve our Services, to contact you from time to time about us and our products and services, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.\nWe refer collectively to all information we collect that is not Personal Data, including Usage Data, demographic data and de-identified Personal Data, as \u201cNon-Personal Data\u201d. If we combine Non-Personal Data with Personal Data, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.\nPersonal Data, Non-Personal Data, and User Submissions are referred to in this Privacy Policy collectively as \u201cUser Information.\u201d\nYou may choose to enter contests, sweepstakes, competitions, participate in surveys, subscribe to newsletters, comment articles, use message boards, chat rooms, reader photo upload areas, reader ratings and reviews, save articles or other content on our Services, reader-created content upload areas, contact us and customer support areas, and areas that allow you to register for SMS text messaging and mobile alerts, or otherwise interact with us in similar ways (\u201cInteractive Areas\u201d). These Interactive Areas may require that you provide Personal Data corresponding with the activities.

We may also use and disclose this information for advertising purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.\nIn addition, you are required to provide certain Personal Data when you submit a job application and supporting materials. You can also choose to submit or we may collect additional information about yourself, such as demographic information (for example your gender, birth date, or zip code) and information about your preferences and interests. Failure to provide any required Personal Data will prevent us from being able to provide the Services you request (e.g., member registration or submission of job application) or otherwise inhibit our ability to provide the Services.\nHere are examples of User Information we may collect:\n- Contact Data - your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.Credentials - passwords, password hints, and other information for authentication and account access.\n- Demographic Data - demographic information including your age, gender, and country.\n- Payment Data - data necessary to process your payment if you make a purchase, including your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument.

If at any time you display your Personal Data in any communication submitted to such areas, other individuals may collect and use your Personal Data. We are not responsible for, nor can we guarantee the protection of, any Personal Data you disclose in a communication submitted to such areas for posting or contained in an email or other communication submitted to us for such posting, and thus, you acknowledge that if you disclose Personal Data in any such material, you do so at your own risk.\n4.\nInformation We Receive From Other Sources\nWe may supplement the information we collect with outside records in order to learn more about our users, to better tailor the content and offers we show you, and for other purposes. We may receive this information about you from public sources or third parties, including without limitation consumer data resellers, social networks, and advertisers.

For example, we may share your information with our related entities including our parent and sister companies for customer support, marketing, and technical operations. We share User Information, including Personal Data, as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, and under the following circumstances.\nService Providers\nFrom time to time, we enter into relationships with third parties who provide services to us (for example, analytics and research companies, advertisers and ad agencies, data management and storage services, credit card processing services, merchandise sales facilitators, sweepstakes or contest prize fulfillment). We share your information with third parties for the purposes of facilitating your requests (such as when you choose to share information with a social network about your activities on the Services) and in connection with tailoring advertisements, measuring and improving our Services and advertising effectiveness, and other enabling enhancements. We share aggregate information about our visitors with our advertisers, sponsors, and promotional partners, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on the Service(s) or page(s), or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information is not specific to any individual visitor. We obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal the precise location of a specific visitor. We also obtain other demographic information from third parties to improve our products and services, for marketing purposes or to display more relevant advertising. In those circumstances, we disclose User Information so that such service providers perform those services. These service providers are only permitted to use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to enable them to provide their services to us. Our Services use certain Google analytics and other services, and certain pages use the Google AMP Client ID API, each of which enable collection and sharing of your information (including Personal Data) with Google for further use.

Companies other than Vox Media, Inc., its parents, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries may process these transactions. We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations, order and contest fulfillment and/or contract services \u201coperational providers.\u201d They are third parties that perform services on our behalf. If you choose to use these optional services, our operational providers will request your Personal Data to fulfill your order or request. The voluntary submission of your Personal Data to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the operational provider\u2019s terms of use and privacy policies. To facilitate an order or request from you, we may share your Personal Data with the provider. The operational provider may also share your Personal Data and information about your purchases with us.

You can visit here, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the \u201copt-out\u201d procedures of NAI members. You can opt-out of the use of your behavioral data used by DAA members to serve you interest-based advertising on third-party sites here.\nIf you are accessing the Services through an application (i.e., mobile phone or tablet) you can download the AppChoices application from your device\u2019s application store (i.e., Google Play, Apple App Store, and Amazon Store). This DAA application allows participating companies to offer an opt-out of customized advertisements that are based on predictions about your interests generated from your application usage.

You will continue to receive generic ads while online or on your device.\nMobile\nWe may from time to time offer certain location or pinpoint based services, such as location assisted navigation instruction. If you elect to use such location-based services, we must periodically receive your location in order to provide such location-based services to you.

As part of the location-based services, we also collect and store certain information about the users who elect to use such location-based services, such as a device id. This information will be used to provide you the location-based services. We use third-party providers to help provide location-based services through mobile systems (unless you opt out of such location-based services with such providers) and we provide the information to such providers to enable them to provide their location-based services, provided that such providers use the information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\n13.\nChoice/Opt-Out From Communications\nWe offer you the opportunity to manage your communications from us.

We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.\n15.\nSecurity\nWe have implemented commercially reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures to help protect your Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure; unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your User Information, we cannot guarantee its security. You use the Services and provide us with information at your own initiative and risk. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us using the details in the Contact Us section below.\n16.\nLinks\nThe Services contain links to other websites that we do not control, and the Services contain videos, advertising and other content hosted and served by third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third-party.

Most of our Services, with the exception of certain child-directed services as described below, are intended for a general audience and are not intended for and should not be used by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 on our general audience services, and we do not target such services to children under the age of 16.\nSome of our Services are clearly identified as being marketed directly to children under the age of 16 (such as our Dodo Kids channel or other child-directed services). In connection with such child-directed services, we do not knowingly collect any Personal Data from users under the age of 16 without complying with applicable legal requirements and making appropriate disclosures. We are committed to compliance with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d), a U.S. federal law designed to protect children online. We may collect and store persistent identifiers (such as IP addresses) from children without parental consent for the purpose of supporting the internal operations of the Services or as otherwise permitted under COPPA.\nFor any of our Services, if a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us using the details in the Contact Us section below. We will delete such information from our files as soon as reasonably practicable.\n18.\nSensitive Personal Data\nWhen we conduct research or carry out surveys and you participate in our research or surveys, we may collect sensitive Personal Data about you, for example, information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation.

Otherwise, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Data as this term is defined under applicable data protection and privacy laws on or through the Services or otherwise to us.\nIf you send or disclose any sensitive Personal Data to us or the public through the Services, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive Personal Data, you must not submit such content to our Services, and you must contact us to make us aware immediately.\n19.\nImportant Information for California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nWe collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.

      "text": "In news that can best be described as both serious and farcical, the long tradition of home rule for the District of Columbia is suddenly under attack from President Donald Trump because one of his more infamous supporters got beaten up there.\nEarlier this year, Edward \u201cBig Balls\u201d Coristine became a global symbol of the arrogance and ignorance suffusing Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE initiative. The teenage programmer with a really stupid nickname gained extraordinary access to federal-agency data and worksites during his brief career at the commanding heights of the public sector. Unfortunately, Coristine became a crime victim earlier this week during what seems to have been an attempted carjacking in an upscale area of D.C.\nThis inspired a signature temper tantrum from Trump on Truth Social, complete with a photo of a bloodied Coristine at the crime scene awaiting treatment. After ranting for a while about the allegedly lenient treatment of minors who commit violent crimes, Trump issued a threat:\nIf D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore. Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime. If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\nWashington, D.C., has enjoyed limited home rule since 1973, when Congress finally let the city known as \u201cthe last colony\u201d elect its own mayor and municipal council and more or less govern itself (subject to the constant possibility of congressional disapproval). When Republicans have controlled Congress, they have often meddled in the affairs of this overwhelmingly Democratic and majority-non-white city, treating it as a laboratory for conservative policies ranging from private-school vouchers to restrictions on reproductive rights. As recently as earlier this year, Republican senator Mike Lee and Congressman Andy Ogles introduced legislation to repeal D.C. home rule. You have to figure a political party that enjoys posturing as \u201canti-Washington\u201d will perpetually flirt with this idea.\nTrump himself cannot imperially \u201cfederalize\u201d the city, and as long as the Senate filibuster exists, neither can the congressional GOP. As the Washington Post notes, however, Trump has certain emergency powers that he might abuse in this case as he has in so many others:\nTrump has the power to call up the D.C. National Guard and deploy it without local consent, for example. That sets the District apart from the states, where that power falls to the governor.\nThe Home Rule Act also gives the president the authority to temporarily take over the District\u2019s police department. Trump can order the mayor to provide the federal government with D.C. police services in \u201cspecial conditions of an emergency \u2026 as the President may deem necessary and appropriate.\u201d\nIndeed, in June 2020, during nationwide protests after the murder of George Floyd, Trump reportedly came very close to a takeover of the D.C. police force as a sort of performative demonstration of the kind of crackdown he wanted mayors and governors to carry out across the country. So it may be entirely in character for him to seize on a new pretext to become the D.C. police chief and de facto mayor.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s a really bad pretext. The crime rate is dropping steadily in D.C. (as it has been across the country despite all of Trump\u2019s \u201ccrime wave\u201d talk during the 2024 campaign). Violent crime in D.C. dropped 35 percent in 2024 and has dropped another 26 percent to date in 2025. So there\u2019s no real justification for the president taking the fateful step of destroying democracy in the nation\u2019s capital.\nThe darker possibility is that Trump is getting the same itch he got in 2020 to personally command police forces to demonstrate his strength and resolve. His administration is already mustering a huge national immigration crackdown featuring masked ICE agents backed by local police, federalized National Guard units, and the U.S. military. A federalized D.C. police force could supply an object lesson in what the 47th president wants to happen everywhere. And then, sure enough, democracy itself could come under siege.\nMore on Politics\n- Inventing Emergencies Is Trump\u2019s Superpower\n- All of Trump\u2019s Tacky and Trollish White House Renovations\n- Trump Moves Obama and Bush Portraits in Revenge Redecorating"

      "text": "15 states sue over Trump\u2019s move to fast-track oil and gas projects via his \u2018energy emergency\u2019 order\nA coalition of 15 states is suing over President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to fast-track energy-related projects, saying the administration is bypassing environmental protection laws and threatening endangered species, critical habitat and cultural resources.\nTrump issued an executive order declaring a \u201cnational energy emergency \u201d on the first day of his presidency. The order urges oil and gas expansion through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allows the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.\nThose kinds of steps are supposed to be reserved for actual emergencies, such as projects needed in the aftermath of disasters like hurricanes, flooding or major oil spills, the attorneys general wrote in the lawsuit filed in Washington state on Friday.\nBut now, Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown and the other plaintiffs said, agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Interior are bypassing required reviews under federal laws like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act.\n\u201cThe President of the United States has the authority to determine what is a national emergency, not state attorneys or the courts,\u201d White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers wrote in an email. \u201cPresident Trump recognizes that unleashing American energy is crucial to both our economic and national security.\u201d\nThe attorneys general said reliable and affordable electricity is of critical importance to the nation, but noted that U.S. energy production is already at an all-time high.\n\u201cThe Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,\u201d they wrote in the lawsuit.\n\u201cThe shortcuts inherent in rushing through emergency processes fundamentally undermine the rights of States,\u201d the attorneys general said, noting that the federal Clean Water Act grants states the right to protect water quality within their own borders.\nThey want a federal judge to declare the executive order unlawful and bar the agencies from pursuing emergency permitting for non-emergency projects.\nBrown and California Attorney General Rob Bonta are leading the lawsuit, and the attorneys general of Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin have signed on."

  "argos_summary": "President Trump has increasingly relied on emergency powers during his second term, utilizing them to expand presidential authority at the expense of Congress and local governance, particularly in Washington, D.C. His recent claims of a crime emergency in D.C. have been met with skepticism, as crime rates are reportedly falling. This strategy of declaring emergencies allows Trump to bypass established laws and regulations, raising concerns about the potential for authoritarianism and the undermining of democratic processes.",
