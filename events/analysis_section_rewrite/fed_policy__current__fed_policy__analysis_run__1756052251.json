      "feedback": "Concrete, world-class feedback in one compact paragraph with edit pointers:\n\nYour 0–3 week narrative is directionally sound (policy credibility, central-bank independence, and the Jackson Hole/Lagarde Powell backdrop) but it lacks explicit, testable near‑term catalysts, thresholds, and a clear causal/ transmission map. Strengthen by: (a) anchoring with concrete, near‑term catalysts and annunciations (Lagarde’s independence framing from U.S./Fox coverage; Powell/Jackson Hole signals; any fresh inflation/growth prints or ECB guidance) and tying each to a market reaction function (FX, rates, equities) with an explicit “if-then” payoff path; (b) stating key levels and invalidation points. At minimum, define watch-levels such as: currency pair and yield reaction bands around the ECB/Fed communications (for example, euro/dollar and 2‑year/10‑year gilt-like moves) and a clearly stated rejection/invalidation trigger (e.g., Lagarde explicitly signaling the ECB intends to reevaluate independence or a hawkish inflation surprise from the U.S. data prints that halts the “credibility regime”). In practice, attach to each driver a brief price-channel implication (Lagarde = euro support, Powell/Jackson Hole = yield/FX volatility, U.S. political risk = risk-premia). (c) Quantify the consumer-credit channel with numbers drawn from S7M6BJSRT to ground the macro link: personal-loan rates are typically in the 6.74%–36% APR range depending on credit and product (Wells Fargo 6.74% on prime relationships; Upstart 6.60–35.99%; TD Bank 8.99–23.99%), with longer terms (24–84 months) tending to higher total interest, and origination fees 1–8%; translate this into a plausible near-term consumer-spending impulse or restraint path to improve the causal chain. (d) Build a simple scenario tree (base case, upside, downside) with catalysts/triggers and explicit invalidation: base-case remains “high-for-longer” policy with modest risk-off/volatility unless data prints surprise; risk-off if a credible threat to independence or a hawkish ECB/Fed path materializes; risk-on if inflation surprises to the downside and political risk abates. (e) Tighten sourcing integration: after each assertion, append the precise source IDs (e.g., Lagarde independence claim: U6HXAJR4J; Jackson Hole/ Powell context: U6HXAJR4J; U.S. political risk and markets: YB758UDBU; personal-loan dynamics: S7M6BJSRT) and reconcile any potential tension between sources (e.g., Lagarde emphasizes independence while U.S. coverage notes debate—treat as sensitivity rather than contradiction, and spell out how markets price either outcome). (f) Shorten prose flow to meet the horizon-focused framing and clearly separate “what’s immediate” from “how markets respond,” ending with a crisp monitoring list for the next data/news cycle.",
