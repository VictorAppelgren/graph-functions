  "description": "Struggling outfielder has become the avatar for the Los Angeles Dodgers' inconsistency in recent months.",
  "content": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 It\u2019s no secret that Dave Roberts wants to see more from Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez, in many ways, has become the avatar for the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 inconsistency over the last few months, and with it, the direct recipient of some of Roberts\u2019 criticism. He\u2019s hardly the only issue with the team at the moment, as another loss to a below-.500 team on Tuesday night showed, a 9-7 defeat to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who have scored the fewest runs in the majors as their bullpen continues to leak.\n\nThe focus has found Hern\u00e1ndez nonetheless. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s defense has lagged to the point where it\u2019s cost the Dodgers wins. His offensive production is at the lowest point of his career, as he entered Tuesday with a .732 OPS.\n\nWith it, several of his manager\u2019s comments about the team have pointed directly at Hern\u00e1ndez. Roberts has lamented his team\u2019s propensity to wait to flip a switch on and play its best baseball, turning a nine-game division lead into a dogfight. Hern\u00e1ndez has waxed and waned in a way that\u2019s been difficult to pin down.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that I really admire, because he can balance the fun part of baseball but also have that edge,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd I think a little bit, we\u2019ve lost a little bit of that edge over the last couple months. So I think, for me, I want to see that edge, that fight, that fire, and I\u2019ll bet on any result. And so that\u2019s for me, it\u2019s like, I just want to see that.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Roberts emphasized when Hern\u00e1ndez sat on Sunday as part of what the manager called a \u201ctwo-day reset,\u201d with Monday\u2019s off day to recalibrate the expectations. Hern\u00e1ndez is an everyday player, Roberts reiterated Sunday. But the production has to match. So, he was effectively benched for the day, a blow that would\u2019ve seemed inconceivable as the team sought so clearly to bring him back this past offseason.\n\nRoberts said he\u2019s had \u201cnumerous conversations\u201d with the All-Star outfielder in hopes of establishing an equilibrium like the one he had in his first year in Los Angeles, when he was among the club\u2019s most consistent October performers and was so beloved that he was moved to tears when speaking at the team\u2019s World Series parade.\n\n\u201cTeo is a guy that we counted on a lot last year in the biggest of moments,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe\u2019re aligned. He knows his value for our ballclub. He knows my expectations of him individually. So we\u2019re in lockstep.\u201d\n\nHern\u00e1ndez understands the frustration. Because he\u2019s feeling it. Last year was supposed to be a launching-off point, the one that got him the long-term deal he\u2019d wanted for years in a place where he felt comfortable.\n\n\u201cI want to put a little extra,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cWhen you do that, you put more pressure on yourself. We had a big year last year. This year we\u2019ve got a lot of expectation not only for the team but for myself, personally. For me, not being the same as last year is a little frustrating. I don\u2019t want to be like that. I want to be better than last year. But it\u2019s baseball.\u201d\n\nConcerns about Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s focus go away if he\u2019s hitting. This is not a storyline if he is putting up the .840 OPS he put up a year ago, or the .933 OPS he had before landing on the injured list in May with a strained groin. That halted what was set to be a strong encore to last year\u2019s success. So did a bruise he suffered when he fouled a ball off his left foot more than a month after returning. The resulting struggles raised one of two questions: either Hern\u00e1ndez was still hurt (or trying to avoid reinjuring himself) or the injuries had disrupted whatever rhythm he\u2019d had to start the season.\n\nBoth Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s groin and his foot are \u201c100 percent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s more being on the field,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cFor me, being hurt is more frustrating than having a bad year. I\u2019d rather be on the field and having a bad year than not being on the field and just fighting back and forth.\u201d\n\nThat still has meant moments like Tuesday, when first-inning struggles from Clayton Kershaw were exacerbated when Tommy Pham blooped a ball in Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s direction. Hern\u00e1ndez broke on it and reached the necessary distance, but still couldn\u2019t come up with the slicing ball as two runs came home in a four-run frame. The ball had a .100 expected batting average, according to Statcast.\n\n\u201cHe gave a good effort, just didn\u2019t come up with it,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cSo for me, if I see a good jump getting off the ball, good effort, I\u2019ve got no problem with it. I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe response came an inning later. His swing is still not right, but he fouled off a pair of two-strike offerings from the Pirates\u2019 Carmen Mlodzinski to stay alive. When the right-hander tried going to a well that Hern\u00e1ndez has struggled with \u2014 breaking balls at the shins and below \u2014 Hern\u00e1ndez stayed with the two-strike curveball and served up a single into center field. An inning later, he fouled off two more two-strike pitches before lacing a 100.2 mph fastball from Bubba Chandler into right field to bring home a run.\n\nThe big swings will come. At-bats like these are what the Dodgers need right now, though it wasn\u2019t enough on Tuesday. There are several holes to plug right now for a team that can\u2019t get right and has now lost nine of its last 13 against teams with losing records. All while the stakes are as high as they\u2019ve been for the Dodgers all season.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we look at it winning record, losing record,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to win games.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, we didn\u2019t play well,\u201d Mookie Betts said. \u201cWe all know that. Don\u2019t have to necessarily have a team come-to-Jesus about it. We\u2019ve just got to find ways to win games.\u201d\n\nHern\u00e1ndez at least provided an encouraging sign at the plate.\n\n\u201cObviously, I\u2019m working on my swing, trying to get the consistency that I want with good contact, good at-bats and not overthinking too much,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cJust going there, having fun. Fight every at-bat, every pitch, and not chasing the results.\u201d",

      "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The light has flickered on and off for the Los Angeles Dodgers enough times this season to turn their manager sour.\nDave Roberts has warned against relying on flipping the switch, as his Dodgers have consistently played down to their competition, only to come to life when the circumstances call for it. The Dodgers exited San Diego last weekend with a division lead and swept the Wild Card-contending Cincinnati Reds \u2026 only to drop a series to an Arizona Diamondbacks team just trying to piece things together following a fire sale at the deadline.\nAdvertisement\nA 5-4 walk-off win on Sunday thanks to Will Smith\u2019s home run helped finish off a homestand on a winning note and avoid a sweep. It also left Los Angeles at 78-59 and with a two-game lead in the NL West. But it didn\u2019t paper over what has been a concerning trend.\nOver their last 31 games, the Dodgers are 11-4 against teams with winning records and 6-10 against teams below .500.\nThey haven\u2019t looked good while doing it, scoring just one run through the first 18 innings they played this weekend, all while facing a pair of starters in Zac Gallen and Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez who entered with a combined 5.36 ERA in 275 innings. They\u2019ve squandered winnable games that could\u2019ve extended their division lead and lightened the amount of work they\u2019ll have to accomplish in September.\nEven Sunday was difficult.\n\u201cEach night, it seems like there\u2019s something else that is not all put together in one particular game for a longer stretch,\u201d Roberts said.\nPINCH-HIT WALK-OFF HOMER? YES HE WILL. pic.twitter.com/Oo0Uz2kss3\n\u2014 Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) August 31, 2025\nThe Dodgers opened with an early 2-0 lead against Arizona starter Brandon Pfaadt and got another brilliant start from Yoshinobu Yamamoto. But closer Tanner Scott surrendered a home run to Corbin Carroll to tie the score in the top of the eighth. It was the ninth home run Scott has allowed this season, after he only gave up six combined over the last two years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s super frustrating,\u201d Scott said. \u201cJust got to go out there and fix it.\u201d\nA win helped make up for it, but the frustration remains. So Roberts vented on Sunday morning, speaking for close to 10 minutes on a group that hasn\u2019t kept its intensity and focus nearly long enough to separate itself from the competition.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just all upon us, to come in each day and, to be honest with you, to not get embarrassed,\u201d Roberts said.\nAdvertisement\nA team that spent this spring espousing the notion it could avoid the complacency that befalls many reigning World Series champions has perhaps fallen victim to it, Roberts acknowledged.\n\u201cI hate going backward and talking about last year,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re playing a long season, you\u2019re defending champions, people are coming after you, which we know and understand, it\u2019s just hard to keep that dialed in focus every single night. That\u2019s just reality. That\u2019s human nature.\u201d\nStill, they are up against the clock. Just 25 games remain for the Dodgers to hold their narrow division lead over the San Diego Padres.\n\u201cYou guys gotta understand, we\u2019re human beings,\u201d Miguel Rojas said. \u201cAnd sometimes you get tired, especially mentally. And you got a lot of things going on in your life, and your year, and it\u2019s not easy to be locked in every single time. But I feel like we made a commitment to be locked in for 25 more games, plus the 20 or whatever we need to play in the playoffs.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to play well, play good baseball, take care of it,\u201d Smith said.\nJust two weeks ago, Roberts pushed against the notion that the Dodgers had a switch of sorts they could flip on when they needed it, calling it \u201ca dangerous way to live.\u201d Then the Dodgers flipped it on and swept the Padres at home. It flipped back off from there to the point where Roberts and veterans were openly critical about the team\u2019s offensive approach. The group has continued to spit out inconsistent offensive results, as it has seemingly since the beginning of June.\n\u201cI do think that a flip can be switched,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel good for me saying it. \u2026 Whatever it is, we\u2019ve got to do it right now. We\u2019ve got to win today. We\u2019ve got to play better baseball. We\u2019ve got to play more focused baseball and then let the chips fall where they may. There\u2019s just more in there. There just is.\u201d\nTeoscar Hern\u00e1ndez spent Sunday afternoon on seed duty. Usually, his task of grabbing sunflower seeds to throw at Dodgers home-run hitters is a busy task; he\u2019s usually in the lineup, and the Dodgers entered Sunday having slugged the most home runs in the National League with 201.\nAdvertisement\nNot so much this weekend. The Dodgers did not hit a home run against an Arizona pitching staff that had allowed the 10th-most in the majors this season until the weekend\u2019s final at-bat. And in the series finale, Hern\u00e1ndez wasn\u2019t in the lineup.\nHern\u00e1ndez wasn\u2019t originally scheduled to sit on Sunday. Had he been swinging a better bat, he might have been in the lineup for the series finale as the group looked to spruce up its overall production.\n\u201cObviously, I\u2019m not doing the best hitting,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said this weekend.\n\u201cClearly, he hasn\u2019t handled right-handed pitching,\u201d Roberts said. Hern\u00e1ndez has a .689 OPS in 356 plate appearances against righties this season. His utility on the roster is to hit, and he\u2019s enduring the worst full offensive season of his career. He\u2019s hardly the lone culprit, but he\u2019s become a target of Roberts\u2019 criticism of late because of his importance to where the Dodgers need to be. Maybe a two-day \u201creset\u201d could help, Roberts said.\nWith it came a message that Roberts seemed to relay with his comments on Sunday.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an everyday guy, but I do think that where we\u2019re at, you\u2019ve got to perform, too, to warrant being out there every single day, regardless, right?\u201d Roberts said.\nThat extends to everybody. Even Michael Conforto, who has been extended a $17 million leash despite his season-long struggles and was batting fifth on Sunday despite entering the day sporting the fifth-worst OPS (.628) among hitters with as much playing time as he\u2019s received.\n\u201cYeah, it does,\u201d said Roberts, who over the course of the session laid out some of the contingencies. Tommy Edman got some work in center field on Sunday afternoon and is expected to spend some time in the outfield when he goes out on a rehab assignment this week. On those days Edman is in center, perhaps Andy Pages or Hern\u00e1ndez could kick over to left field. Hyeseong Kim had another start in left field for Oklahoma City on Sunday in what will be the final game of his rehab assignment; he can be a left-handed hitting left field option who could potentially take at-bats from Conforto.\nThe pending Dodgers free agent with the biggest chance to swing his financial fortunes over the next eight weeks has thrown all of seven innings in the big leagues this season. This is not the walk year that Michael Kopech wanted. That might be irrelevant if he puts together a strong stretch run through to the end of October. Such is life for a hard-throwing reliever, who has been shut down at different times this season due to forearm, shoulder and then knee ailments before the calendar has even flipped to September.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s been a long season,\u201d Kopech said. \u201cI\u2019ve had two stints of the 60-day (injured list). You never want to go on the IL in general, but definitely I don\u2019t want to miss this many games.\u201d\nKopech\u2019s right knee required surgery in July. His forearm didn\u2019t feel right through last October and the discomfort crawled up to his shoulder through spring training. A strong month could assuage whatever medical red flags come with such a history, especially when you throw as hard as Kopech does.\nHis minor league rehab stint with Oklahoma City raised another red flag. The velocity was fine. The strike-throwing was not. In seven appearances, he allowed five runs, walking nine batters. His command has always been scattershot, with enough stuff in short bursts to overcome it. Still, the general lack of feel for where anything is going is why the Dodgers plan to work Kopech in slowly when he\u2019s activated this week.\n\u201cEverything changes at this level,\u201d Kopech said. \u201cYou come up here and you get an atmosphere of the game, you get an atmosphere of the clubhouse, the mindset of competition of playing in the direction of a championship and things like that. Timing is different in that environment than it is in any other environment. So I feel pretty good with it all. I feel healthy, and so I think a lot of that will show up as it comes.\u201d\nThe Dodgers might wind up needing him more than they thought they would a few weeks ago. Brock Stewart required another cortisone injection to treat his injured shoulder. Stewart\u2019s season is not over \u2014 he has resumed throwing \u2014 but the Dodgers need trustworthy right-handed relief options with Stewart out and Kirby Yates struggling (including allowing a three-run home run on Saturday).\nAlex Vesia is progressing well from his strained right oblique and should go on a brief rehab assignment this week, and the left-hander said Sunday he\u2019s expecting to be active at some point during the team\u2019s next homestand.\n(Top photo of Will Smith celebrating his walk-off home run against Arizona on Sunday: Jayne Kamin-Oncea / Imagn Images)"

This, all while returning to the mound: his next start is Wednesday.\n(Photo: Joe Sargent / Getty Images)"

      "text": "DENVER \u2014 Shortly after Monday night\u2019s debacle, Mookie Betts was in his manager\u2019s office. The six-time Gold Glove right fielder turned shortstop had already showered and changed as media entered the visiting clubhouse at Coors Field, and the door remained open as Betts sat on the couch and talked with Los Angeles Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman and manager Dave Roberts.\nAdvertisement\nBetts\u2019 transition to shortstop has been an unquestioned individual defensive success, as the 32-year-old has more than handled his own at the game\u2019s premier position. The defense in Betts\u2019 old position \u2014 the one he stood at when the Dodgers recorded the final out of their World Series run in October \u2014 has fallen off.\nTeoscar Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s inability to record an out on a ball that (according to Statcast) had a 90 percent catch probability had sunk the Dodgers in a walk-off loss to a putrid Colorado Rockies team, once again drawing attention to his right-field play that has been among the worst in baseball.\nThe topic of Monday night\u2019s conversation, according to all parties involved, never touched upon right field. Rather, it was one of several check-ins Betts has had with Roberts \u2014 some of which have been visible to media \u2014 as he\u2019s dealt with his struggles throughout the worst offensive season of his career.\n\u201cMookie pops into my office all the time,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI hope too much wasn\u2019t made of that.\u201d\nBetts is not the only one; Freddie Freeman was spotted in Roberts\u2019 office before Tuesday night\u2019s contest for a brief conversation.\nBetts and Friedman each independently told The Athletic before Roberts\u2019 comments that the three were discussing the progress of Betts\u2019 swing as he\u2019s gone 16-for-48 (.333) over his last 12 games \u2014 and not about a possible switch at right field.\nSure enough, Betts did not replace Hern\u00e1ndez in right field Tuesday night, as both former All-Stars assumed the same positions they started the season in.\nTonight's #Dodgers lineup at Rockies: pic.twitter.com/KOeJmJSKgT\n\u2014 Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) August 19, 2025\nStill, the tumultuous 24 hours at least temporarily brought back calls for Betts to return to the outfield, as he did last August for the team\u2019s stretch run after starting that season as the team\u2019s shortstop. Roberts said right field has not come up \u201cat all\u201d in conversations with Betts this season.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a fair question,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201d\nRoberts pointed to the lack of options in the Dodgers\u2019 infield, which is without Tommy Edman, Hyeseong Kim, Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez and Max Muncy. The Dodgers are reluctant to put Miguel Rojas into an everyday role at age 36, especially when he was far from 100 percent last postseason. They\u2019ve already forced prospect Alex Freeland into what is essentially an everyday role to make up for their absences, and would exacerbate that by moving Betts to the outfield.\nThe absences of Edman, Hern\u00e1ndez and Kim also remove certain options from the outfield mix that could reduce Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s exposure to right field without moving Betts off of shortstop.\nRoberts said Edman will not return until his sprained right ankle can physically handle center field, which would move Andy Pages to right field and, in theory, put Hern\u00e1ndez in left field for certain matchups. That would, in theory, also boost the lineup offensively, with Michael Conforto still providing nothing at the plate and Alex Call going 4-for-23 to start his Dodgers career after being acquired at the deadline.\nThere\u2019s also the fact Betts might not even be the best defensive right fielder on the roster right now. Pages\u2019 arm ideally puts him in right. Betts\u2019 defensive metrics (as much as public metrics can be trusted) had not been as strong as his peak years in Boston even before he moved off the position, and he was essentially average at the position in the final month and a half of 2024 by Outs Above Average.\nThat\u2019s still better than Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s minus-9 Outs Above Average so far this season, but worse than Betts\u2019 2 Outs Above Average at a more important defensive position so far in 2025.\nRoberts still acknowledged this all becomes more of a conversation if the Dodgers can get closer to full strength, anyway, before retracting some of his pointed criticism of Hern\u00e1ndez from Monday night and doubling down on his belief Hern\u00e1ndez can improve his range.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think, just in totality, we can all do a better job,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAll of us. So I just refuse to pin it on one position, one person. \u2026 That\u2019s just not what I do. But I do believe \u2026 if there\u2019s ways to get better on the margins, I think that way to look at it is completely fair and completely honest.\n\u201cI do know that Teo feels more comfortable in right. I know the numbers don\u2019t speak to it this year. I\u2019m counting on him to improve play out there. I really am. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d\n(Photo of Mookie Betts: Luke Hales / Getty Images)"

  "argos_summary": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s slump has become emblematic of the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 recent inconsistency, prompting manager Dave Roberts to call for a reset and greater focus. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s defensive lapses and the lowest OPS of his career have drawn criticism, while injuries and mental fatigue are cited as possible causes. Roberts has emphasized the need for the team to maintain intensity and \u201cflip the switch\u201d to win, but the Dodgers have struggled against both winning and losing teams, leaving their division lead vulnerable. The situation underscores a broader question of whether the Dodgers can sustain performance as the season progresses.",
