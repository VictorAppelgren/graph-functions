  "description": "The Great British Sewing Bee contestant Dan was supported by fans after he was left in tears when his \"beautiful\" design was praised by the judges",
  "content": "A Great British Sewing Bee contestant broke down in tears after judges hailed his \"beautiful\" creation, which carried a poignant connection to his late mother. Judges Patrick Grant and Esme Young set the sewers the challenge of crafting garments from reused and recycled materials this week, with many contestants bringing along old clothing from relatives and friends. Durham-based stitcher Dan, who started his sewing adventure aged just 10, brought along several old matching Christmas t-shirts his family had worn in 2022. His plan was to transform them into a single halter-neck dress, paired with a faux-fur muff. Discussing the accessory, he revealed: \"This was a shawl that I made for my mum that she only wore once, unfortunately she passed away,\" reports Wales Online.\n\n\"So I thought it'd be really nice to have her touch.\" When his finished creation was unveiled, Dan's garment was described as \"beautiful\" and he even scooped Garment of the Week. \"I'm glad I did this, because I wanted my mum to be represented,\" he wept.\n\nHe subsequently remarked: \"This week has been insane, I can't believe all the good comments they said. \"It was really nice they got my vision and knew where I was going with it, especially this one in particular, it was really personal to me.\" Patrick also commended Dan's finished piece, declaring: \"It's absolutely stunning and such a beautiful story behind it. \"The perfect way to go from an unwanted pile of old pyjamas into this beautiful, beautiful outfit.\"\n\nFollowing his victory, Dan later said: \"I've just got to trust my instincts and go with it. I'm glad that I did it on this week, where it was something so personal.\" Viewers were moved by the story behind his design, with one commenting: \"Dan that dress was absolutely amazing mate. Thoroughly deserved garment of the week.\" Another posted: \"Really pleased for Dan,\" while another viewer expressed: \"Definitely want to give Dan a huge cuddle.\" \"Dan smashed it this week!\" a fourth fan praised, as another admirer wrote: \"Well done Dan, that looked really good.\" The Great British Sewing Bee airs Tuesdays at 9pm on BBC One and iPlayer.",
