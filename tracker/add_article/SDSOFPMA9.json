      "summary": "The European space industry is experiencing significant growth but faces challenges in commercializing valuable Earth observation data. At the Living Planet Symposium 2025, ESA leaders emphasized the need for collaboration between the public and private sectors to bridge gaps in data utilization. Despite successful missions like the Φsat-2 satellite, many startups struggle to sell their data due to a disconnect between space companies and potential commercial buyers. The future of the industry hinges on European companies leveraging satellite data for various sectors, as competition in the global space economy intensifies.",
