Despite being new to dividends, its low payout ratio (16.2%) and cash payout ratio (32.9%) suggest sustainability, as they are well covered by earnings and cash flows. However, large one-off items have impacted financial results, making long-term reliability uncertain at this stage.\n- Take a closer look at Avrupakent Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi Anonim Sirketi's potential here in our dividend report.\n- Insights from our recent valuation report point to the potential undervaluation of Avrupakent Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi Anonim Sirketi shares in the market.\nOsmanli Yatirim Menkul Degerler (IBSE:OSMEN)\nSimply Wall St Dividend Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\nOverview: Osmanli Yatirim Menkul Degerler A.S. operates in Turkey, offering asset management, custody services, investment consultancy, and online capital market trading platforms with a market cap of TRY4.14 billion.\nOperations: Osmanli Yatirim Menkul Degerler A.S. generates revenue primarily through its brokerage services, amounting to TRY7.76 billion.\nDividend Yield: 3.4%\nOsmanli Yatirim Menkul Degerler's dividend yield of 3.38% ranks it in the top 25% of Turkish dividend payers, surpassing the market average. The dividends are well-supported by earnings and cash flows, with payout ratios at 57.2% and 21.3%, respectively. However, its short dividend history of three years shows volatility and unreliability in payments, compounded by a recent decline in profit margins from 5% to 2.4%.\n- Unlock comprehensive insights into our analysis of Osmanli Yatirim Menkul Degerler stock in this dividend report.\n- The analysis detailed in our Osmanli Yatirim Menkul Degerler valuation report hints at an inflated share price compared to its estimated value.\nArab National Bank (SASE:1080)\nSimply Wall St Dividend Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nOverview: Arab National Bank offers a range of banking products and services across Saudi Arabia, the GCC, the Middle East, Europe, North America, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and internationally with a market cap of SAR44.76 billion.\nOperations: Arab National Bank's revenue is primarily derived from Corporate Banking (SAR6.95 billion), followed by Retail Banking (SAR1.61 billion), Treasury (SAR721.47 million), and Investment and Brokerage Services (SAR522.52 million).\nDividend Yield: 5.8%\nArab National Bank's dividend yield of 5.81% places it among the top 25% of Saudi Arabian dividend payers, supported by a sustainable payout ratio around 50%.
