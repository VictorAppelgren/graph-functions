Another one can\u2019t be created. It\u2019s always been looked at by modern basketball collectors as a holy grail.\u201d\n\nSaturday wasn\u2019t the only pricey purchase of a Bryant-related card.\n\nHigh-end collector Matt Allen shared that he had spent $4 million to purchase Bryant 1-of-1 signed Panini Flawless Logoman cards \u2014 a Bryant card from 2017-18 and one from 2015-16.",

I haven\u2019t seen that at all,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cHe\u2019s been the complete opposite. He\u2019s been detail-oriented, he\u2019s been up front and open and honest. He praises guys when they do well, he jumps on them when they\u2019re messing up right away."

      "text": "One-of-a-kind basketball card signed by Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant could net record-breaking $6M\nThis card is a slam dunk.\nA one-of-a-kind basketball card featuring photos, autographs and game-worn jersey patches from both Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant is expected to net a jaw-dropping $6 million at auction this month \u2014 making it the priciest hoops card ever sold.\nThe 2007 Upper Deck dual Logoman \u2014 signed in blue ink by the two court kings \u2014 showcases a patch from Bryant\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers jersey and one from Jordan\u2019s iconic 1997 championship run with the Chicago Bulls.\nBryant signed just 11 dual Logomans before he and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, were tragically killed in a 2020 helicopter crash \u2014 and it\u2019s the only one he ever co-signed with Jordan, whose signature appears on just eight dual Logomans total.\nIt\u2019s already drawing full-court attention.\nThe collectible is headlining Heritage Auctions\u2019 Summer Platinum Night Sports sale, with bidding already at $2.9 million \u2013 and is expected to soar past the current record, a Steph Curry-signed Logoman that sold for $5.9 million in July 2021, by the time the hammer drops on Aug. 23.\nThe interest is \u201castronomical,\u201d said Chris Ivy, Heritage\u2019s director of sports auctions. \u201cThis is unquestionably the best of [all Logomans] due to its status as the only one bearing this pair of autographs documenting a brotherhood of elite-tier legends.\u201d\nAlso up for grabs is a massive 8-by-8-foot slab of hard maple taken from the iconic United Center basketball court \u2013 home of Jordan\u2019s 1990s Bulls dynasty. The court tile is scrawled with his 32-inch-long signature in black Sharpie and includes the inscription: \u201cAir Jordan, 5x MVP, 6x Finals MVP, 10x Scoring Title, HOF 2009.\u201d\nThe court cut is currently bidding at $155,000, but is expected to run up to $500,000.\nBaseball royalty will also be featured at the auction.\nA game-worn, signed 1960 New York Yankees jersey belonging to Mickey Mantle is expected to hit $4 million, while a 1939-40 elementary school photo bearing his earliest known autograph \u2014 scribbled on the back, in pencil, by an 8-year-old Mantle \u2014 could fetch $80,000.\n\u201cMantle\u2019s rise from the humblest of beginnings in an Oklahoma mining town has always been an essential part of his lore, the embodiment of the American dream,\u201d Ivy told The Post. \u201cThis is a piece that drives that point home.\u201d\nRounding out the heavy hitters is a gold World Championship watch \u2014 a Verithin style from the Gruen Watch Company \u2014 worn by Babe Ruth after the Yankees\u2019 1923 title, which could clock in at a staggering $3 million.\nAnd a team-signed 1927 Yankees photo, featuring 45 players\u2019 signatures, could snag $200,000.\n\u201cThis is the team widely considered to be not just the greatest in Yankees franchise history, but in the full history of baseball itself,\u201d said Ivy."

      "text": "A signed sports collectible card featuring Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant sold for $12.932 million Saturday night, breaking the record for the most ever paid for a sports card.\nThe 2007-08 Upper Deck Exquisite Collection Dual Logoman Autographs Jordan & Bryant card, numbered 1-of-1, surpassed the 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card, which sold for $12.6 million in late August 2022. The Jordan/Bryant card was sold with Heritage Auctions; the buyer's identity was not revealed.\nThe Jordan/Bryant card is the second-most expensive sports collectible of all time behind Babe Ruth's 1932 World Series \"called shot\" jersey, which sold for $24.12 million almost a year ago to the day.\nChris Ivy, Heritage's director of sports auctions, said he remembers when Upper Deck first released Exquisite, charging $500 for one five-card pack/box for the 2003-04 release. That was the set responsible for a $5.2 million LeBron James rookie card, which previously held the record for most expensive basketball card until Saturday.\n\"[They were] kind of mocked, but it tapped into a demographic that wasn't interested in gimmicks: They just wanted the best of the best,\" Ivy said. \"They were adding patches and signatures, Logomen -- this was [one of] the first times logos from the jersey were used in this manner.\"\nIn the years since, Panini's National Treasures & Flawless lines, both of which now run $3,000-plus per box upon release, have become the standard-bearer for basketball.\n\"But Exquisite was first, Exquisite paved the way,\" Ivy said. \"It's the pinnacle as far as modern card collectors are concerned, and this is the only time there's been Jordan and Kobe autographed Logomans. Another one can't be created. It's always been looked at by modern basketball collectors as a holy grail.\"\nSuch rarity explains the price tag, despite the card only receiving a 6 from card grader Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA).\n\"A 1986 Fleer Jordan in a grade 6 sells for a couple thousand while a [grade] 10 sells for almost $200,000 currently,\" Ivy said. \"Grades matter as far as pricing goes for standard-issue cards, but this is a 1-of-1, so the grade is less important overall to how the card performed.\"\nIvy said the card's consignment had been in process since February. The previous owner had kept the card for more than a decade and turned down \"high seven-figure\" private offers in lieu of an open auction, where Heritage believed it would safely eclipse $5 million.\n\"The pre-auction estimate was $6 million-plus, so sometimes if a piece is unique like this, it's really beneficial to let it have its day,\" Ivy said. \"[Where] you can have new collectors come out of the woodwork or people willing to participate and pay more.\"\nIvy also noted that, in the wake of the ongoing Brett Lemieux fraudulent memorabilia scandal, the authenticity of Bryant and Jordan is \"ironclad\" with this card. Lemieux claimed to have flooded the market with fraudulent Kobe items following Bryant's death in 2020. The assistant chief of police in Westfield, Indiana, told ESPN on Friday that they have no updates on the case.\n\"[The scandal] makes items like this a little more desirable: Upper Deck has Jordan under contract; he's been with them for decades. Kobe was with Upper Deck until 2009,\" Ivy said. \"They worked with these athletes directly to have this item signed. It's guaranteed by them as well as PSA. That's why you see a premium for items that have verified provenance and authentication.\"\nIt has been quite a month for Bryant cards. High-end collector Matt Allen, who goes by Shyne on social media, shared that he privately spent $4 million on Bryant 1-of-1 signed Panini Flawless Logoman cards: one from 2017-18 for $1.7 million and one from 2015-16 for $2.3 million, which was the record paid for a Bryant card until Saturday night's sale.\nBryant's 47th birthday would have been Saturday."
