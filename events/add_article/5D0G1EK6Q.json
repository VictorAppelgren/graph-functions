      "summary": "PwC's latest holiday‑shopping survey indicates U.S. consumers will cut spending by about 5% compared with 2024, largely driven by Gen Z's sharper pullback. Gen Z is expected to spend roughly 23% less year‑over‑year, while millennials and Gen X remain flat and boomers increase spending by about 5%. The decline reflects heightened tariff concerns and a shift toward budget‑oriented, value‑focused shopping, with retailers struggling to keep pace with Gen Z's rapid trend adoption.",
