  "description": "Dick's Sporting Goods beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines, leading it to raise its full year profit and sales guidance.",
  "content": "Dick's Sporting Goods raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance after delivering fiscal second-quarter results that beat expectations.\n\nThe company is now expecting comparable sales to grow between 2% and 3.5%, up from a previous range of 1% and 3% and ahead of analyst estimates of 2.9%, according to StreetAccount.\n\nDick's said its earnings per share are now expected to be between $13.90 and $14.50, up from a previous range of $13.80 to $14.40. Analysts were expecting $14.39 per share, according to LSEG.\n\nHere's how the company performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $381 million, or $4.71 per share, compared with $362 million, or $4.37 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to its acquisition of Foot Locker and other costs, Dick's posted earnings per share of $4.38.\n\nSales rose to $3.65 billion, up about 5% from $3.47 billion a year earlier. During the quarter, comparable sales also grew 5%, well ahead of expectations of 3.2%, according to StreetAccount.\n\n\"Our performance shows how well our long-term strategies are working, the strength and resilience of our operating model and the impact of our team's consistent execution,\" CEO Lauren Hobart said in a news release. \"Our Q2 comps increased 5.0%, with growth in average ticket and transactions, and we drove second quarter gross margin expansion.\"\n\nWhile Dick's comparable sales guidance came in ahead of expectations, its full-year revenue outlook was slightly below estimates. The company said it's expecting revenue to be between $13.75 billion and $13.95 billion, below estimates of $14 billion, according to LSEG.\n\nDick's said its raised profit guidance includes the impact of tariffs that are currently in effect. However, its guidance doesn't include any potential impact from its acquisition of Foot Locker, such as costs or results from the planned takeover, which is expected to close next month.\n\nIn May, Dick's announced it would be acquiring its longtime rival for $2.4 billion, giving it a competitive edge in the wholesale sneaker market, most importantly for Nike products, along with a bigger global presence.\n\nHowever, the acquisition also comes with risks. Foot Locker's business has been in the midst of an ambitious turnaround under CEO Mary Dillon but the company is still struggling.\n\nIn the quarter ended Aug. 2, Foot Locker's sales fell 2.4% and it posted a loss of $38 million. The company faces a range of existential challenges, including its heavy mall footprint, its small online business and a core consumer that often has less discretionary income than the core Dick's consumer.\n\nOnce the businesses are combined, Foot Locker's struggles could ultimately weigh on Dick's overall results. On the other hand, the combined company will become the No. 1 seller of athletic footwear in the U.S., which will allow it to better compete against its next biggest rival, JD Sports.\n\nEarlier this week, Dick's said it had received all regulatory approvals associated with the transaction. It's unclear if it had to divest any stores to satisfy the FTC's requirements.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts at 10 a.m. ET, investors will be looking for more information on how the combined entities will operate and how Foot Locker will fit into the overall strategy.",

      "text": "Dick's Sporting Goods said Thursday it plans to acquire rival Foot Locker as it looks to expand its international presence, win over a new set of consumers and corner the Nike sneaker market.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Dick's will use a combination of cash on hand and new debt to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion. Foot Locker shareholders can receive either $24 in cash \u2013 a roughly 66% premium of Foot Locker's average share price over the last 60 days \u2013 or 0.1168 shares of Dick's stock.\nFoot Locker CEO Mary Dillon has been undertaking an ambitious turnaround at the footwear retailer, and while there have been signs of improvement, larger market conditions like tariffs and consumer softness have weighed on the company's stock, making Foot Locker a potential takeover target. As of Wednesday's close, Foot Locker shares were down 41% this year.\nIn a joint press release, Dillon said the acquisition is a \"testament\" to all of the work her and her team have done to improve the business.\n\"By joining forces with DICK'S, Foot Locker will be even better positioned to expand sneaker culture, elevate the omnichannel experience for our customers and brand partners, and enhance our position in the industry,\" said Dillon.\nThe CEO added she was \"confident this transaction represents the best path for our shareholders and other stakeholders.\"\nWhile the companies are longtime rivals \u2014 both competing to sell the same brands in their stores \u2014 Dick's is almost double the size of Foot Locker in terms of revenue. In their most recent fiscal years, Dick's reported $13.44 billion in revenue, while Foot Locker saw $7.99 billion.\nDick's said it expects to operate Foot Locker as a stand-alone business unit within its portfolio and maintain the company's brands \u2013 Foot Locker Kids, WSS, Champs and atmos.\nDick's CEO Lauren Hobart said on a conference call Thursday that the two businesses will be run as separate entities and the consumer \"may or may not know that Dick's and Foot Locker are one.\"\n\"The combination of them for the consumer is not the most important thing, it's making sure that there's two powerful brands that are meeting all consumer needs, wherever, whenever, however they want to shop,\" Hobart said.\nThe merger brings together two iconic names in sports retailing and will give Dick's a massive competitive edge in the wholesale sneaker market, most importantly for Nike products.\nCurrently, Nike's primary wholesale partners are Dick's, Foot Locker and JD Sports. If the merger is approved, the combined company would be able to corner the Nike market at a time when the sneaker giant is more reliant on wholesalers than in years past.\n\"Dick's Sporting Goods and Foot Locker are two of the most storied and respected brands in our industry and have been our valued partners for decades,\" said Nike CEO Elliott Hill in a statement. \"Each has their own loyal consumer following and deep understanding of the needs of athletes. I am confident that together, they will help elevate sport and continue to accelerate the growth of our industry.\"\nThe acquisition will also allow Dick's to enter the international markets for the first time, as Foot Locker operates 2,400 retail stores in 20 countries, and gives it access to the type of consumer who doesn't usually shop at its stores. The Dick's customer tends to be affluent, suburban and older, while the Foot Locker customer is urban, younger and more likely to be lower and middle income. That latter customer has long underpinned sneaker culture and is critical for Dick's to reach long-term growth and competitive advantage.\nWhile Hobart said the company is not looking toward international expansion at this time, the total addressable market that Dick's is operating in will grow from $140 billion to $300 billion due to Foot Locker's global reach.\nThe proposed combination raises considerable anti-competition concerns, but Wall Street expects President Donald Trump's Federal Trade Commission to be more favorable to mergers.\nHobart said during the call that the companies are \"not expecting any regulatory concerns\" with the FTC.\nFoot Locker shares soared more than 80% after the deal was announced Thursday. Shares of Dick's fell roughly 15% as investors worried about the impact the merger could have on financial results.\nWhile Dick's expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings in the first full fiscal year post-close, and to deliver between $100 million and $125 million in cost synergies, Foot Locker has been struggling for some time. It has a cumbersome store footprint, many of which are in malls, and it's more exposed to economic downturns because of the lower-income level of its customer.\nFoot Locker has assessed all of its stores and determined that some locations could close, Hobart said, but she does not expect a \"significant\" number of stores to shutter.\nIn a note on Thursday, TD Cowen called the deal a \"strategic mistake\" as it downgraded shares of Dick's to hold from buy. Analyst John Kernan said the transaction is \"likely to produce low returns\" and presents clear risks to synergies, integration and the structural foundation of Foot Locker's business. Kernan expects the return on capital to be low and said it raises balance sheet risks.\n\"There is little to no precedence of M&A at scale creating value for shareholders within Softlines Retail. In our view, there are countless examples of M&A destroying billions of dollars in value since we have covered the sector,\" said Kernan.\nDick's Executive Chairman Ed Stack said the company knew there would be some initial skepticism in response to the merger, but stressed that the two companies are \"highly confident\" and \"up for the job.\"\n\"We're pretty conservative. We don't have a lot of big egos here,\" he said. \"If we didn't see this clear line of sight to this, or we thought that this was going to impact what we're able to do with Dick's, we wouldn't be doing it.\"\nBoth companies preannounced fiscal first-quarter results after announcing the merger. Foot Locker reported comparable sales down 2.6% from the prior-year period, led by a slowdown internationally, and expects to see a net loss of $363 million for the period, compared with net income of $8 million in the year-ago period. That loss includes $276 million in charges related primarily to trademark and goodwill impairments.\nMeanwhile, Dick's said it saw comparable sales growth of 4.5% and earnings per share of $3.24.\n\"We are very pleased with our strong start to the year and our demonstrated sustained growth,\" said Hobart. \"The strength of our business puts us in a great position for our proposed acquisition of Foot Locker \u2014 a transformative step to accelerate our global reach and drive significant value for our athletes, teammates, partners and shareholders.\""

      "text": "During a recent event celebrating Foot Locker's 50th anniversary in New York City, it was hard to imagine that the legacy sneaker chain was appearing on bankruptcy watch lists as recently as March.\nGrammy-nominated rapper Coi Leray was there to celebrate the company with a special performance of her hit song \"Players\" as influencers, journalists and handpicked members of the company's revamped loyalty program sipped on lavender margaritas and champagne cocktails.\nEmployees \u2013 and not just those in the glare of the company's PR team \u2013 gushed about CEO Mary Dillon as Adidas staffers celebrated the company's new store design, which showcases individual brands instead of mixing them on nondescript shoe walls.\nFoot Locker turns 50 while on a bit of an upswing two years into Dillon's tenure as CEO. Last month, it released fiscal second-quarter results and full-year guidance that beat expectations, as comparable sales grew for the first time in six quarters.\nAs Foot Locker revamps its sprawling store footprint, and perhaps benefits from some good timing, it's making strides in winning back its critical brand partners like Nike and Adidas, the latter of which co-hosted the Monday night party and helped secure Leray's performance.\n\"Our last quarter was a really good indication that the hard work that we've been putting into the Lace Up plan is working, and that makes me feel really, really great, because I really see the next 50 years of growth for Foot Locker and our future,\" Dillon told CNBC in an interview, referencing the company's turnaround plan. \"I really think that there's layers of category growth that we can drive by just making sneakers that much more inclusive, that much more fun, that much more easy to access.\"\nBut as Foot Locker stares down the next 50 years, the company is still at a crossroads and must answer some fundamental questions: can it once again be the market leader in sneakers, and can it not just survive, but thrive, as brands rely less and less on wholesalers?\n\"With the combination of more direct to consumer from the brands, the deepening of specialists like [Dick's Sporting Goods], the incursion of JD Sports, Foot Locker still looks risky,\" said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst and managing director of GlobalData. \"In some ways, they're just a sort of distributor of everyone else's products.\"\nDick's has a big private-label business and sells other categories like sporting goods, while JD Sports has strong loyalty programs and a robust fashion business, he said.\n\"Whereas Foot Locker looks vulnerable because it just doesn't have all these other strings to its bows,\" said Saunders. \"The truth is that although they're getting better, there is still this question: Do we need this specialist sneaker retailer?\"\nFrom mall legend to has been\nFoot Locker can be traced back to the legendary retailer Frank Winfield Woolworth, whose namesake company branched into footwear in the 1960s and later opened the first Foot Locker in City of Industry, California, in September 1974.\nFrom the beginning, Foot Locker was a mall retailer. Over the next two decades, it opened thousands of stores in malls across the U.S. and abroad.\nBy the turn of the century, it was the world's largest retailer of athletic footwear and apparel, with a 20% market share in the U.S., according to a 2002 Forbes report. It was the primary place to buy Nike sneakers and was responsible for 26% to 28% of Nike's total domestic revenue. Nike accounted for more than half of Foot Locker's total sales at the time.\n\"It was a simpler retail world. I think in the years that they were initially really experiencing strong growth, it was as simple as being in the mall, having a large mall footprint and having the right brands and they had that footprint,\" said Janine Stichter, a retail analyst and managing director at BTIG, who has been covering the retail industry since 2008. \"They were the No. 1 partner of Nike. Nike, at the time, was strong and growing, and I think they were really viewed as like the destination in an environment that was a lot less competitive.\"\nWhen Foot Locker's chief commercial officer, Frank Bracken, joined the company in 2010, the retailer's relationship with Nike was poised to get even stronger. By the end of the decade, 75% of the products Foot Locker sold were from Nike.\n\"This was [pre-direct-to-consumer], Foot Locker was definitely 'most favored nations' with most of our brand partners at that time, Nike was about to go on a pretty epic run alongside Jordan, and so I actually joined at a really good time,\" Bracken said in an interview.\nBracken recalled how from 2012 to about 2018, Foot Locker's stock rose to record highs as revenue grew at a mid-to-high single-digit compound annual growth rate. But as the 2020s neared, the company got \"complacent\" and began taking its position as the market leader in sneakers \"for granted,\" said Bracken.\n\"[We] got some weak signals about where the industry was headed, from our partners and from competition, and then Covid, you know, paralyzed everybody momentarily and I think we lost some time, candidly, during Covid,\" he said. \"Competition used it as an opportunity to invest in technology and capability and the business, and maybe we probably stood a little bit too still at that point in time.\"\nAs consumers moved online and away from malls, Foot Locker did too little to update its e-commerce capabilities and its real estate footprint, said Bracken. At the same time, competitors were getting bigger and savvier, adjusting their real estate strategies as malls across America sputtered and died.\nIn North America, the company let its banners \u2014 Foot Locker, Footaction and Champs Sports \u2014 overlap too heavily with each other in terms of assortment, location and marketing, and brands \"started to take note of that,\" said Bracken.\nAt the end of 2021, Foot Locker was winding down its Footaction business and had acquired WSS \u2013 an off-mall athletic apparel retailer that caters to the Hispanic community \u2013 to help differentiate itself from competitors.\nBut by then, it was too late.\nNike, carrying out a new strategy to cut off wholesalers and sell directly to consumers through its own websites and stores, had started reducing the number of sneakers it was selling to Foot Locker, the company said on an earnings call in February 2022. It chose instead to reserve its best products for Foot Locker's primary competitors: Dick's and JD Sports.\nFor a company that relied almost exclusively on Nike, the change was devastating and posed an existential threat. By the end of fiscal 2022, comparable sales had fallen 7.2% in North America. The declines would only mount in the quarters to come.\nA new leader arrives\nWhen Dillon, the former CEO of Ulta Beauty, took the helm of Foot Locker in September 2022, Wall Street breathed a collective sigh of relief. Highly regarded among peers, Dillon was known for her ability to win over brands, and appeared to have the necessary chops to turn Foot Locker around.\n\"In a way, she soothed investors \u2026 they know that she can deliver and they know that she understands retail and the sector and she's got good operation control and all the rest of it,\" said Saunders from GlobalData. \"That's obviously starting to come through a little bit more now.\"\nIn her first major public event as CEO, Dillon hosted an investor day last March where she touted a revitalized relationship with Nike. She pledged the \"fruits of our renewed commitment to one another\" would begin to show up in results by the end of the year.\nShe outlined her Lace Up turnaround strategy, which focused on four key pillars: better marketing, a new real estate plan, a revamped loyalty program and an emphasis on online sales.\nBut as the year wore on, the macroeconomic picture worsened, which hit Foot Locker hard because about half of its customers are considered low income. The company went on to cut its guidance twice, suspend its dividend and delay a key financial target that it outlined at its investor day.\n\"As a CEO, it's hard to go out and make a commitment and have to change it, but because I believe so much in the plan and where we're heading, I felt confident that it was the right thing to do,\" said Dillon. \"Now I believe we've kind of worked past that.\"\nBeyond the macro situation, the company likely underestimated the challenges it was facing, and how much the Nike breakup would hurt its business, Saunders and Stichter said.\n\"You don't really know until you do it how impactful that's going to be and I think that they thought they'd be able to offset more of that loss more quickly,\" said Stichter.\nSigns of a turnaround\nWhile Foot Locker's fiscal 2023 turned out worse than it originally anticipated, the company is seeing some of its turnaround efforts start to take hold. While Nike is still its biggest partner, it's focusing more on other brands, such as upstarts like Hoka and On and legacy incumbents like Birkenstock and Ugg.\nOnline sales are growing. Foot Locker plans to relaunch its mobile app at the end of the year, and it recently unveiled its revamped loyalty program FLX, which allows customers to earn discounts, access to product launches and perks like free returns.\n\"We know that we only capture a fraction of this annual sneaker spend that our existing customers spend on sneakers,\" said Kim Waldmann, Foot Locker's chief customer officer. \"[FLX] isn't necessarily about getting you to buy 10 more sneakers per year, it's an opportunity for us to drive share of wallet consolidation by the fact that you're getting value back in shopping with us.\"\nWhen Waldmann started in the role last year, she learned from consumer research that customers loved having access to a wide variety of brands at Foot Locker's stores and enjoyed the product knowledge that its employees, known as \"Stripers,\" had.\n\"The thing that they wanted to see more from us is like we're just not top of mind. A lot of consumers just hadn't seen us in a while,\" said Waldmann. \"And I think that was really the opportunity to take what is an iconic brand and make it influential and top of mind again, and that's really the work that we've been doing.\"\nThe company is marketing more toward women and has partnered with stars such as Leray, who was part of Foot Locker's spring style and trend campaign.\nPerhaps most critically, Foot Locker is finally doing the work necessary to overhaul its aging store fleet, which is responsible for about 80% of its sales. Since Dillon took over, she's closed around 500 stores, opened about 200 new shops and remodeled or relocated another 200 or so doors. Earlier this year, Foot Locker unveiled its \"reimagined\" store concept and its plans to move away from its traditional format, which tends to be two walls of shoes with a middle section used for trying on sneakers.\nAs more and more brands move away from wholesalers in favor of their own stores and website, the strategy change was critical to Foot Locker's survival. Its business does not work if it doesn't have the support of its brand partners, which want to ensure that their assortments are showcased individually \u2013 not mixed together with competitors.\n\"When you talk to a company like On they're like, yeah, we're selective about who we sell to, we don't want to be just another shoe on the wall,\" said Stichter. \"They're really investing behind putting more signage and just investing in the displays \u2026 that's what makes the brands want to work with them.\"\nSince May, Foot Locker has brought the new design concept to at least 80 of its stores, which it says have better comparable sales and margins compared with the balance of the chain. The company is working to refresh two-thirds of its global Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker doors by the end of 2025, and said 40% of its North American footprint is now off-mall.\nThe new store approach couldn't come at a better time for Foot Locker. Over the last year, Nike has begun to walk back its direct selling strategy after acknowledging that it went too far in cutting out wholesalers.\n\"Nike is our largest partner and they're the largest in the industry so for us, it's also about, how do we make sure that we have a really terrific long-term growth relationship with Nike? And I'm proud about the fact that we're going back to growth [with Nike] starting in the fourth quarter of this year,\" said Dillon. \"Also \u2026 at the same time, Nike has been very public about the role of retailers and the importance of that for them as well so maybe it was good timing, right?\"\nThe battle between extinction and survival\nAs Foot Locker looks ahead to the next 50 years, its ability to survive is still up for debate. Nike is at a low point and is cozying back up to the wholesale partners, but when it rebounds, will it cut off those retailers once again?\nAbsent a robust private-label business, Foot Locker's success is also highly dependent on the performance of its brand partners, which leaves it with less control over its own destiny than other retailers that have recently made big comebacks, such as Abercrombie & Fitch.\nIf Nike has a major product launch, it can be a boon for Foot Locker's sales, but if innovation dries up, Foot Locker will suffer. It has found itself in a similar quandary facing other multi-brand retailers, such as Macy's, which has also struggled to find itself in a post-mall world.\nWhen asked if Foot Locker can survive another 50 years, GlobalData's Saunders said the company is the \"most at risk of extinction\" of its peers. Stichter disagreed.\n\"One thing we've learned is that consumers really do want a multi-brand experience. There are people who go to Nike.com or Adidas.com but people really like having that selection, having the service,\" said Stichter. \"So there is a reason for a concept like Foot Locker to exist. I think it all just depends on, can they execute well and be one of the preferred places for consumers who are looking for choice.\""

      "text": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling on the FTC and DOJ to consider blocking Dick's Sporting Goods' proposed acquisition of Foot Locker, writing in a letter to the agencies that the merger could cut jobs, raise prices and reduce competition.\nThe missive, sent Tuesday evening, asks the agencies to \"closely scrutinize\" the $2.4 billion merger and \"block the deal\" if they determine it violates antitrust laws. Warren, D-Mass., argues in the letter, which was seen by CNBC, that the tie-up could create a duopoly in sneakers and other athletic shoes between the combined companies and its next largest competitor, JD Sports.\n\"This is particularly concerning given that more than half of parents 'plan to sacrifice necessities, such as groceries,' because of rising prices for back-to-school shopping,\" Warren wrote, citing a July survey from Credit Karma. \"Higher prices on athletic footwear could lead to further economic hardship for parents.\"\nWarren said the risks of the merger are compounded by the rapidly consolidating athletic shoe store sector. Britain's JD Sports has set its eyes on the U.S. as its biggest growth market and, since 2018, has been on a buying spree, snapping up smaller competitors like Finish Line, Shoe Palace, DTLR and Hibbett.\nIf Dick's Sporting Goods' acquisition of Foot Locker is approved, two companies \u2013 JD Sports and the combined entity \u2013 would own 5,000 athletic shoe stores in the U.S., which could squeeze smaller businesses, Warren said.\n\"Dick's and Foot Locker currently compete with each other and with independent retailers to secure deals with suppliers. The new giant would have significantly increased power to extract favorable conditions with manufacturers,\" she wrote. \"This could mean that independent retailers are at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating with suppliers, which could give Dick's and Foot Locker an incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct to restrict suppliers from dealing with independent retailers.\"\nUnder President Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission took an aggressive approach to mergers and quashed a number of high-profile planned tie-ups, including Tapestry's proposed acquisition of Capri and Kroger's bid to acquire Albertson's. When President Donald Trump took office in January, many on Wall Street expected that his administration would make it easier for larger mergers to be approved.\nSo far, his administration has approved at least one deal previously blocked by Biden \u2013 Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel \u2013 but it's unclear how new leadership at the FTC and Department of Justice will view mergers in the retail industry, which can be felt more acutely by consumers.\nAmanda Lewis, who spent close to a decade scrutinizing mergers at the FTC and is now a partner at Cuneo Gilbert and LaDuca, previously told CNBC the merger is unlikely to raise many concerns because combined, Dick's and Foot Locker would represent around 15% of the sporting goods market.\n\"Usually below 30% doesn't raise too many agency red flags,\" said Lewis.\nLewis said she expects the merger to be approved and at most, Dick's could be required to divest some of its stores to competitors to preserve competition in local markets. The number of stores it would potentially need to divest could be lower and perhaps more palatable under Trump's FTC than Biden's, said Lewis.\nThe FTC declined comment. The DOJ didn't return a request for comment."

  "argos_summary": "Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods lifted its full\u2011year sales and earnings guidance after a Q2 beat, raising comparable sales to 2\u20113.5% and EPS to $13.90\u2011$14.50, while its revenue outlook remains slightly below analysts. The company is also in the final stages of a $2.4\u202fbillion acquisition of Foot Locker, which could create a duopoly in the U.S. sneaker market and attract antitrust scrutiny. Foot Locker\u2019s recent turnaround under CEO Mary Dillon has improved comparable sales, but the combined entity faces integration risks and potential regulatory hurdles. The deal is expected to expand Dick\u2019s global footprint and strengthen its position against competitors like JD Sports, though analysts warn of low return on capital and possible store closures.",
