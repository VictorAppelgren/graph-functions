      "summary": "Amazon, Coca‑Cola and Disney—three Dow 30 constituents—are highlighted as likely to outperform in 2025. Amazon’s recent Q2 sales and AWS growth have accelerated, boosting its earnings and making its inclusion in the Dow a positive sign, though the stock fell after analysts worried about AI lag. Coca‑Cola continues to deliver steady revenue growth and a long dividend‑paying streak, while Disney’s theme‑park and streaming businesses are rebounding, lowering its forward P/E. The Motley Fool notes these stocks’ strong fundamentals and suggests they could be attractive long‑term holdings, but also warns of short‑term volatility and stresses its disclosure policy.",
