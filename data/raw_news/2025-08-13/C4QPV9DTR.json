  "description": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent calls for major Fed rate cuts and pushes for a Congressional stock trading ban.",
  "content": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said interest rates are too restrictive and signaled the Trump administration supports an aggressive monetary easing cycle beginning as soon as September.\n\n\"We should be 150-175 basis points lower on the fed funds now,\" Bessent said during a Bloomberg interview on Wednesday, calling current rates overly tight.\n\nHe added that if recent labor data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics had been more accurate in earlier months, the Federal Reserve would have already cut rates in June or July.\n\nHe expressed hope that a 50 basis point rate cut will arrive in September and highlighted that Fed Chair Jerome Powell risks repeating outdated monetary strategies.\n\n\u201cThey tried to be more data-driven, but it\u2019s just very old-fashioned thinking,\u201d Bessent said.\n\n\u201cWe could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting, I\u2019m hopeful about the September meeting,\u201d he added.\n\nBessent indicated the administration has begun a formal process to pick Powell's successor, though he emphasized that President Donald Trump isn't aiming to fire him early. He revealed that Trump's team is vetting 10\u201311 private-sector candidates to potentially shake up Fed leadership next year.\n\nBessent flagged the White House's concerns about the recent cost overrun on the Fed's renovation project.\n\n\u201cThe president is concerned about the building and those massive cost overrun. There\u2019s no oversight in terms of the spending. The president and I are both concerned about the foundations of the Fed\u201d\n\nTrump-Putin Meeting: \u2018Sanctions Can Go Up \u2014 Or Be Loosened\u2019\n\nOn the upcoming Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, Bessent said the goal is \"to end the bloodshed, but not at any cost.\"\n\nAccording to Bessent, Trump is preparing to lay out clear leverage options to Putin, including sanctions that \"can go up, or they can also be loosened.\"\n\n\"The president is the best at creating leverage,\" Bessent said. \"He will make it clear to President Putin that all options are on the table.\"\n\nBessent leveled sharp criticism at European leaders, accusing them of being reluctant to implement the kind of aggressive secondary sanctions that could tighten Russia's access to international markets.\n\n\"I was at the G7 meeting in Canada with President Trump,\" Bessent recalled.\n\n\"The Europeans kept talking about Senator Graham's bill to do the secondary tariffs. I said, \u2018Is everyone at this table willing to put a 200 percent secondary tariff on China?' And you know what \u2014 everybody looked at their shoes.\"\n\n\"We need the Europeans to come in and help create more leverage,\" Bessent added.\n\nBessent said he is pushing for a Congressional ban on single-stock trading, citing \"eye-popping returns\" among lawmakers that erode public trust.\n\n\u201cSome of these eye-popping returns, whether it\u2019s Rep. Pelosi or Senator Wyden, every hedge fund would be jealous of them\u201d\n\n\"My hedge fund didn't have that many trades,\" he said, referencing a member of Congress with over 1,200 trades in a year.\n\nHe suggested a model similar to his former firm: members could invest in broadly held exchange-traded funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO but not individual stocks, and with longer holding periods.\n\n\"If any private citizen traded this way, the SEC would be knocking on their door,\" Bessent said. \"People shouldn't come to Washington to get rich.\"",

      "text": "- 81% of S&P 500 companies topped revenue expectations in Q2, the strongest beat in four years.\n- The term \"recession\" in earnings calls dropped by 87% from the first quarter 2025.\n- This simple system has nailed 1,000+ post-earnings winners. Get in before Q3 trades take off \u2192\nIf you're convinced that record-high stock prices signal irrational valuations or that the U.S. economy is heading straight for a downturn, the latest corporate quarterly results might make you reconsider.\n- VOO ETF is trading at record highs. Check live prices here.\nU.S. corporations are delivering one of the strongest top-line beats in years, outpacing even Wall Street's most optimistic projections and challenging the narrative that stock valuations are dangerously stretched.\nCorporate America Beat The Street In Q2 2025\nAccording to FactSet, 81% of S&P 500 companies have reported revenues above analysts' forecasts in the second quarter, the highest rate since the second quarter of 2021's 87% and far above the 5-year average of 70%.\nOn aggregate, companies are beating revenue expectations by 2.4%, a figure unmatched since the first quarter of 2023 and well above the 10-year average of 1.4%.\nThe year-over-year revenue growth rate stands at 6.3%, the strongest since the third quarter of 2022, when it reached 11%. Ten out of 11 sectors posted gains, led by Information Technology, Health Care, and Communication Services. Energy remains the sole laggard, reporting a decline.\nEarnings strength matched the revenue story. FactSet data shows 81% of S&P 500 companies exceeded earnings-per-share estimates, surpassing both the 5-year average of 78% and the 10-year average of 75%. This level hasn't been reached since the third quarter of 2023.\nThe forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 22.1, up from the 5-year average of 19.9 and the 10-year average of 18.5, mirroring valuations recorded at the end of June.\nIs This A Bubble?\nWhile forward-looking price-to-earnings ratios are above historical norms and both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 sit at record highs as of Aug. 12, underlying economic strength is holding the fort.\nMarket veteran Ed Yardeni said the U.S. economy has proven \"resilient\" despite the pandemic, supply-chain turmoil, inflation spikes, monetary tightening, and now tariffs.\nHe said high stock multiples can be justified if recession risks remain low.\n\u201cFurthermore, earnings would be the main driver of the bull market rather than even higher valuation multiples. That would be a most welcome development,\u201d he said in a note this week.\nYardeni envisions an AI-driven \"Roaring 2020s\" in which productivity growth fuels real GDP gains while keeping inflation subdued.\nIn that scenario, he projects the S&P 500 could reach 10,000 by 2030.\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO is already up 9% in 2025 and has surged more than 33% since its April tariff-driven low.\nRecession Talk Is Fading Fast\nDespite market chatter about tariffs and slowing growth, recession fears are notably absent from corporate boardrooms.\nAccording to FactSet data, only 16 S&P 500 earnings calls this quarter mentioned the word \"recession,\" compared with a 5-year average of 74 and a 10-year average of 61.\nThat's an 87% drop from the first quarter 2025, when the term appeared on 124 calls. Overall, just 4% of the 442 calls held between June 15 and Aug. 7 cited recession.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
