  "content": "Playing on the road in Houston, the Seattle Reign recovered from a one-goal deficit and earned a 1-1 draw with the Dash to pick up a standings point.\n\nForward Jordyn Huitema found the game-tying goal in the 65th minute, assisted by defender Sofia Huerta, who now owns the all-time NWSL assist record with 32.\n\nAfter the sweltering Houston heat forced a brief delay, the Reign and Dash were off to the races. Houston got a quick start with Messiah Bright nearly getting in on goal in the opening minutes of the match, but things quickly settled down as the match progressed and went into halftime scoreless.\n\nThe second half got off to a hot start, as a mistake by the Reign led to a Houston goal from the foot of Yazmeen Ryan.\n\nUp a goal at home, Houston was happy to take control of the tempo of the match.\n\nHowever, the Reign found an equalizer against the run of play in the 65th minute. Huerta served a ball into the box, over the heads of Houston\u2019s backline from the right side of the field. Huitema, who was making a run into the box, got on the inside of her mark and headed the ball confidently into the back of the net.\n\nThe home team continued to threaten for nearly the entirety of the second half, forcing the Reign to defend sharply to keep the march level. Claudia Dickey was called on to make a save in the 75th minute, as Ryan unleashed a shot from distance and forced Dickey to tip it over the bar. The Reign hunkered down through the final whistle, hanging onto the draw and bringing one point back to Seattle.\n\u2022 Edgar Leon scored for the visiting Seattle U men (0-2) in a 2-1 loss to North Carolina.\n\u2022 Jadyn Holdenried scored on an assist from Samiah Shell as the Washington women (2-0-2) remained unbeaten early in the season, playing to a 1-1 draw with host UC Irvine.\n\u2022 The Seattle U women (1-0-1) played to a 1-1 draw with Denver at the Rumble in the Rockies event in Missoula, Mont.\n\u2022 Emerson Hancock pitched one clean inning of relief, striking out one in the Tacoma Rainiers\u2019 6-3 loss to the visiting Oklahoma City Comets.\n\nBlake Hunt and Victor Labrada each drove in a run, and MilesMastrobuoni went 2 for 3 with a run scored for Tacoma (70-56).\n\u2022 Tai Peete had an RBI triple, but the host Everett AquaSox (56-64) fell to Spokane 5-1.",
