  "content": "13 Cars With Engines In The Back\n\nRear-engined car models have been rare across automotive history, but many of them are historic and iconic. It's important to understand the difference between mid- and rear-engine placement and how it affects a car. Rear-engined cars have their motors located behind the rear axle, at the very back of the car, while mid-engine cars place theirs just behind the driver and near the center of the car's weight distribution. The vehicles on this list are true rear-engine cars \u2014 or a van in one case. Placing the engine close to the rear axle offers several benefits. It puts more weight on the rear drive wheels, which improves traction for better acceleration. Additionally, without a driveshaft, power is transmitted directly and more efficiently to the rear wheels. There are braking advantages, too, since brake force doesn't shift mainly to the front tires as it does in a front-engine car. Finally, in some small, economy-minded rear-engine cars, this layout was chosen to maximize space in the passenger cabin. Rear-engine cars have some disadvantages, as well, especially in performance-oriented models. With so much of the weight in the back, they're prone to oversteer, which is a type of skid in which the rear end \"fishtails\" or slides wide. This can make these cars challenging for inexperienced drivers.\n\nOne of the world's most famous sports cars has been rear-engined from the start and remains so today. Building on the legacy of the legendary Porsche 356, the 911 debuted in 1965 with an air-cooled, flat-six \"Boxer\" engine mounted behind the rear axle. This 130-horsepower sports car could hit a top speed of 130 mph. Over the decades, the 911 evolved through targa-topped, \"Carrera,\" and turbocharged models. In 1994, Porsche switched to a 99x naming convention with the 993, but it's also still known as the 911. The 2025 Porsche 911 Carrera T sports a twin-turbocharged flat-six with 388 horsepower and a 0-60 mph time of 3.1 seconds. There's also a 572-horsepower 911 Turbo with a 2.3-second 0-60 time and a 911 GT3 with 502 horsepower and a 0-60 time as low as 2.8 seconds. In the past, the 911's rear-engine design was infamous for oversteering when drivers backed off the throttle in a corner, making them challenging cars to drive. Subsequent generations of the 911, like the all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 of the early 1990s, became easier to drive fast without having the tail end kick out unexpectedly.\n\nPerhaps the most famous rear-engine car of all time is the original Volkswagen Type 1 Beetle, which remained in serial production for almost six decades, from 1945 to 2003. Beetles were ubiquitous on almost every inhabited continent, and even reached an uninhabited one: In the 1960s, a passel of Beetles made their way to Antarctica. With more than 21 million Type 1 Beetles sold, even some folks who don't know much about cars can tell you that the first-generation Beetle featured an air-cooled engine in the rear. Several things made the Volkswagen's air-cooled engine so special. For one thing, it required less maintenance than larger, more complicated engines, and when maintenance was needed, it was easy to work on. It was a flat-opposed four-cylinder, making it very compact and freeing up space for the passenger cabin, while its air-cooling system made it cheap to build. It was never powerful, generating 25 horsepower in the first post-war VWs and 60 horsepower from the 1960s onward. Yet it was easy to give this engine a power boost with a few simple tweaks. With some basic maintenance tips and tricks, owning an old Beetle can be a rewarding experience even for first-time car collectors.\n\nThe Chevrolet Corvair was one of the most unusual cars to be produced by a mainstream American carmaker, and one of its quirks was its air-cooled, rear-mounted engine. Of course, the Corvair was also famous for controversy after it featured prominently in Ralph Nader's book, \"Unsafe at Any Speed.\" Yet the Corvair is arguably one of the best examples of cars that don't deserve their bad reputations. In many respects, the Corvair was a brilliant design right out of the gate with the 1960 model. Chevy introduced this compact car to compete with the increasingly popular Volkswagen Beetle, and it offered a number of advantages over its Teutonic competitor. It featured unibody construction, more interior space, an optional automatic transmission, and a six-cylinder engine \u2014 something the Beetle never had. In the 1960 Corvair, that engine generated 80 horsepower from 140 cubic inches, a decent amount for this little car that barely weighed over 2,300 pounds. Its $2,049 base price was substantially more than the Beetle's $1,565 sticker, but Corvair buyers got quite a bit more horsepower and three-across seating for the extra money. Later Corvair models like the Corsa and the Monza introduced more performance with up to 180 horsepower.\n\nThe Type 1 Beetle was a worldwide sensation for Volkswagen, but its small size ultimately limited its market. Enter the Type 2, also referred to as the Transporter, the Kombi, the Bus, or the Microbus. Introduced in 1950, it followed a similar architecture to its smaller sibling, complete with an air-cooled engine at the back. This configuration would last through the first three generations (called T1 through T3) of the Type 2, right up to 1992. The 1950 model was powered by a 1.1-liter engine producing just 24 horsepower, but power grew over the years, and the 1992 model featured a 2.1-liter powerplant generating up to 92 horsepower. The Type 2 became another iconic best-seller for Volkswagen, as well as a classic in its own right. A first-generation 23-window VW bus is rare, and its price today can easily reach six figures. But other models are also highly collectible: A 1965 21-window Deluxe Bus sold at a Barrett-Jackson Auction for an eye-popping $302,500. Not bad for a hippie van!\n\nThe Tucker 48, often called the Tucker Torpedo, beat the Corvair to the rear-engine game by a dozen years. The engine layout was only one of the Tucker's unique features; in fact, the history of the Tucker 48 is a tale of innovations that set it far ahead of its time. Yet the company's founder, Preston Tucker, became embroiled in controversy and fraud charges, and only 51 examples of his \"car of the future\" were built. After unsuccessfully trying to shoehorn a 589-cubic-inch flat-six engine into the 48's rear engine bay, Mr. Tucker settled for a water-cooled, opposed six-cylinder engine originally designed for helicopters. Yet this motor was hardly a slouch; its 166-horsepower rating was the most of any American car in 1948. With so much power and weight located so far to the rear of this long car, the 48 is prone to oversteer, although not severely so. The 48's cutting-edge \"Torsilastic\" suspension helped to keep the vehicle on an even keel. The Tucker 48's list of auto-industry firsts goes far beyond its helicopter engine. It sported a third, central headlight that swiveled in the direction of steering, along with disc brakes in an era when most other cars had drum brakes. It also offered safety features like a pop-out windshield and a padded dashboard, both of which protected passengers during crashes.\n\nThe \"Back to the Future\" movie franchise turned another troubled car, the DeLorean DMC-12, into one of the most beloved rear-engined cars of all time, although for some contrarians, it's also one of the classic cars they love to hate. The brainchild of John DeLorean, a legendary executive who had worked at Chrysler and General Motors, this futuristic-looking wondercar is known for its stainless steel body and gullwing doors. Yet not all of the car's fans (and haters) realize it's also a member of the rear-engine club. That rear-mounted engine, alas, was underpowered and arguably the biggest weakness of the DMC-12. It was a 2.5-liter V6 that sent an underwhelming 130 horsepower to the drive wheels via a five-speed manual transmission. On the other hand, the engine was a Peugeot-Renault-Volvo unit, which was appropriate for this international car: Although the DeLorean was an American car, its body was designed in Italy, its suspension was engineered by Lotus in the U.K., and it was built in Northern Ireland. Like Preston Tucker, John DeLorean wanted his car to be safe, and to that end, he equipped it with dashboard pads for knee and leg protection. Unfortunately, his company suffered a fate similar to Tucker's, collapsing under the weight of legal scandals. He faced drug charges, and although he was acquitted, his company's reputation suffered irreversible damage.\n\nToday's Fiat 500e is an EV, but the original Fiat 500 sported a 479cc, two-cylinder engine at the rear of its diminutive body in 1957. This layout was chosen to save space and maximize the interior volume of the cabin, making this exceptionally tiny car a practical runabout. The air-cooled motor was also mounted transversely to save even more space. The engine was not only small but simple and easy for owners to work on. Italians of the era were used to maintaining their motorized scooters, so the 500 fit right into their lifestyle. Even for its small size, the car was extra-light thanks to its unibody construction, making it fuel-efficient and nimble. The steering was unassisted, yet surprisingly light, perfect for a city car. The 1957 500's minuscule engine produced only 13 horsepower, although a later upgrade to a half-liter unit boosted that to 21 horsepower. By 1975, a 594cc unit made 18 horsepower but boosted torque from 22 to 27 lb-ft. Rear-hinged doors were replaced with front-hinged doors in 1965, and fabric sunroofs were available in all model years. The Fiat 500 made our list of the cutest cars ever made.\n\nThere are a number of hidden facts about Smart cars for buyers and drivers to be aware of, but one that might surprise a lot of people is this: The Smart ForTwo is a rear-engine little runabout. The product of a collaboration between Nicholas Hayek, the founder of the Swatch watch company, and Mercedes-Benz, the 1998 Smart ForTwo was born out of the realization that most cars on the road have only one or two people on board. To make this tiny two-seater, every space-saving innovation was used. This included a rear-mounted engine, which allowed the engineers to design a crumple zone into the front of the car. Safety was a major concern, given the Smart ForTwo's tiny size, and the car features a solid steel frame around the passenger compartment. In 1998, buyers had a choice of 599cc or 799cc three-cylinder engines. By 2016, the available engines included an 89-horsepower, 898cc, turbocharged three-cylinder or a 1.0-liter, 70-horsepower Mitsubishi three-cylinder. Power was adequate for this 106-inch, 2,200-pound car. In 2019, Mercedes announced that the Smart brand was withdrawing from the American market.\n\nSmart followed up on the success of the ForTwo by introducing the Smart Roadster, a 1,851-pound drop-top two-seater with bulging front fenders and a visible, basket-handle structural member arcing behind the seats. It was very eye-catching and reminded many observers of classic British roadsters like the Austin-Healey Sprite or the MG Midget. But unlike those cars, the Smart Roadster kept its engine in the back. Its transverse-mounted rear engine allowed the Roadster to have a wheelbase slightly longer than that of an MX-5 Miata, with plenty of room for the passenger compartment. With no transmission hump, the cockpit was even more spacious. With its low and sleek nose, however, there was very little luggage space in the front trunk. The engine was a turbocharged 698cc, Mercedes-built three-cylinder producing 80 horsepower and 81 lb-ft of torque. Even in this featherweight car, this was only good for a 10.7-second 0-60 run. However, like the British roadsters that inspired it, the Smart Roadster's strength lay in its handling: It could pull 0.91 g on the skidpad. Plus, there was the fun-in-the-sun factor after retracting its accordion-like, fully retracting roof.\n\nThis one may be a surprise to some, and technically it was a \"rear-motor\" car rather than a rear-engine car since it was driven by an electric motor, but for much of its history, the Model S was propelled by a single motor at its rear axle. After 2017, the Model S went all-wheel drive with a dual-motor configuration that placed one motor on each axle. Since its introduction in 2012, the Model S has been a game changer for the automotive industry. Tesla had previously built the Roadster, but that car, while exciting to look at and drive, had limited utility and appeal. The Model S sedan was the first EV with looks, practicality, range, and driving excitement to cross over and appeal to mainstream drivers. Motor Trend named it its 2013 Car of the Year, and Car and Driver named it to its 2016 Ten Best list. Car and Driver noted that in the 2016 model with the rear-motor, rear-wheel-drive layout, its AC induction motor generates 315 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Its EPA-rated city/highway fuel economy equivalent was 88 and 101 mpg, achieved with electricity rather than gasoline, of course.",

      "text": "10 Great European Cars That Never Reached US Shores\nAmerican buyers have an extensive choice of European cars. We get most of the good German models, from the BMW M3/M4 to the Volkswagen Golf R, and Land Rover sells all of its excellent SUVs in North America. But some great European cars are still missing. France is notorious for not bringing any vehicle into North America, even though today three French brands, Peugeot, Citroen, and DS, are under the Stellantis umbrella, the multinational corporation that also owns Dodge, Ram, and Chrysler.\nFrance could never crack the code of the North American market, with the last French vehicle sold in the U.S. and Canada being the Peugeot 405 in 1991. In other words, American buyers missed more than three decades of innovation and some great cars, including excellent enthusiast models. And it's not just France. Spanish companies like Seat and Cupra also don't sell vehicles in North America, and they're great brands. Even German brands don't offer every cool vehicle in North America, keeping them available only to European buyers.\nIn this article, we will show you those forbidden fruits you still can't get in the U.S. These cars are less than 25 years old, meaning you can't even import them, no matter how tempted you are!\nAlpine A110\nYou might know Alpine as the Formula 1 team previously known as Renault. It's the current high-performance brand of the French manufacturer, and although it underperforms in F1, it produces a road car that punches above its weight. The A110 is a featherlight mid-engine driving machine designed to attack any corner with agility and precision.\nThe A110 R version packs 300 hp from a measly 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. This sure won't ignite the soul of American V8 enthusiasts, but the A110 R doesn't need one because it weighs only 2,385 lbs. (1,082 kg). As a result, it reaches 62 mph (100 km/h) in 3.9 seconds while driving only the rear wheels. Top speed is 177 mph (285 km/h). Meanwhile, the slightly heavier A110 S needs 4.2 seconds to reach 62 mph, while the entry-level, 252-hp A110 does it in 4.5 seconds.\nBut the numbers don't tell the whole story. This is a car designed for small, twisty roads, with a big focus on balanced handling and ultimate response. It's a breath of fresh air in a segment filled with overpowered and heavy sports cars. Yes, it will lack the rumble of a V8 sports car, but turn the steering wheel and it will feel much livelier \u2014 like a race car for the road!\nThe only thing the Alpine A110 lacks to reach pure driving nirvana is a manual transmission. Instead, Alpine went with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. Not that we'll protest if it comes like this to the U.S., though we'd love to get a limited edition model like in Japan.\nRenault Megane R.S.\nIf you live in the U.S. and want the most aggressive front-wheel-drive hot-hatch, you can only really go with the Honda Civic Type R (which we liked in our review). However, until recently, European drivers could opt for the Renault Megane R.S. (for Renault Sport) \u2014 a true race-bred FWD hot-hatch. Unfortunately, Renault killed the Megane R.S. because of its electrification efforts, but this avant-garde hot-hatch remains a dream car for many enthusiasts living on the continent.\nThe last Megane R.S. to hit showrooms is the Ultime. Looking at the upgrades, it becomes clear that Renault Sport engineers went all in with this model. It has a 60-mm front and 45-mm wider rear fenders, side air vents, a rear diffuser, and even a Formula 1 blade on the front bumper. Under the sculpted front bonnet sits the same 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder from the Alpine A110 R, producing 300 hp. The power is channeled to the front wheels via a dual-clutch automatic and a Torsen limited-slip differential, though some markets get a 6-speed manual. Due to traction restrictions, the Megane R.S. hits 62 mph (100 km/h) in 5.7 seconds.\nHowever, the Megane R.S. has never been about off-the-line acceleration. It's a hot hatch designed to offer the full experience, with sharp cornering and stability under braking. Each generation attacked the Nurburgring Nordschleife and set a new FWD hot-hatch record (for the time), showing its racing pedigree. Sadly, even the first-gen model, produced from 2004 to 2006, can't be imported to the U.S. for another five years. Once possible, though, you might want to give the Megane R.S. a closer look.\nBMW M3 Touring\nA high-performance wagon M3 has been a car enthusiast's dream for quite a long time. After years of waiting, in 2022, BMW finally introduced the BMW M3 Touring \u2013 a practical wagon with performance that matches modern supercars. Like every new BMW, the M3 Touring also has a luxurious cabin with hi-tech features. However, not all BMW aficionados will be able to enjoy this vehicle, as the M3 Touring won't be available in North America. Hardly surprising, given that wagons have fallen out of favor here; still, the practicality-performance-luxury cocktail seems irresistible even for Americans.\nAll the specs of the BMW M3 Touring point to it being a great parent and enthusiast vehicle. The trunk, for example, measures 17.7 cubic feet (500 liters) in capacity up to the tonneau cover, despite the xDrive AWD system taking space in the back. Owners will also enjoy a low boot floor and a large opening, so putting large and heavy items in the back is much easier. Space for occupants is also plentiful in both the front and rear seats.\nPerformance is a non-issue as well. The M3 Touring borrows the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 from the regular M3, producing 510 hp and 479 lb-ft of torque. Aided by the M xDrive system with Active M differential and the quick-shifting eight-speed automatic, the engine propels this crazy wagon to 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 3.6 seconds. We found that the regular M3 Competition xDrive performed like a bonafide supercar killer, so we expect much of the same in the M3 Touring.\nCitroen DS3 Racing\nThe Citroen DS3 Racing is the definition of a pocket rocket. Measuring only 13 feet in length and weighing just 2,568 lbs (1,165 kg), it's smaller and lighter than most new vehicles sold in North America today. Still, it packs a potent 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, producing 207 hp and 202 lb-ft of torque. As a result, this front-wheel-drive hot hatch sprints to 60 mph in just 6.1 seconds and tops out at 146 mph.\nReviewers praised the driving experience as well. The DS3 Racing handles like the hot hatches of yore, with a playful chassis that allows sharp turn-in just by lifting the throttle. Add to that a slick-shifting six-speed manual, precise hydraulic steering, and a twisty French country road, and the smile on your face is almost guaranteed.\nThe DS3 Racing also looks the part. On the outside, it looks almost like a piece of jewelry, with a nicely sculpted body, sporty details, a recognizable orange/gray two-tone paint, and a checkered decal on the roof. The interior is similar, as it follows the two-tone scheme with a bright-colored orange dashboard. It might look tacky to some, but it does suit the character of the vehicle. Don't expect adults to fit in the cramped back seat, though.\nCitroen produced the DS3 Racing for only one year, from 2011 to 2012. Initially, the company planned to make 1,000 cars, but huge demand saw that number rise to 2,400. So, even when eligible for import, the DS3 Racing will be a rare sight on U.S. streets.\n[ Featured Image by M 93 via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY-SA 4.0 ]\nCupra Formentor VZ5\nSharp looks. Practical and spacious cabin. Four-wheel drive. Five cylinders, one turbocharger, and 390 hp. This Spanish crossover with German roots is no joke \u2014 it will rip the road underneath and put a smile on your face, all while your kids are screaming for joy in the back. It's the crossover every American would dream of \u2014 the Cupra Formentor.\nFor those who don't know much about the European car scene, Cupra is a performance sub-brand of Seat, the Spanish automaker that operates within the Volkswagen Group. The Formentor is easily Cupra's most attractive model at the moment, but it's the VZ5 version that we would like to arrive on U.S. shores. It packs the sonorous 2.5-liter turbocharged five-cylinder engine from the Audi RS3, which brings it to 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 4.2 seconds.\nThe Formentor also features a specially-developed seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox. No manual is offered, sadly. Still, the gearbox sends the power to a special four-wheel drive system with a Torque Splitter, which Cupra says provides torque vectoring at the rear axle for sharper turn-in and higher grip. Meanwhile, 375-mm Akebono brakes ensure you'll stop on time. Thus, overall, it should drive similarly to an Audi RS3, for better or worse.\nCupra will only make 7,000 examples of the Formentor VZ5, so even European buyers will have a hard time finding one. Fortunately, there is the toned-down Formentor VZ310, which shares the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with the Golf R, producing 310 hp. This model needs 4.9 seconds to reach 62 mph, which is still very respectable.\nDacia Duster\nThe Dacia Duster is by far the cheapest compact crossover/SUV in Europe. In Germany, it starts at \u20ac19,690 ($21,300) and is equipped with a 100-hp engine that can run on gasoline or natural gas. A mild-hybrid 130-hp version starts at \u20ac23,400 ($25,314), while a 4x4 model with the same powertrain will cost you \u20ac25,700 ($27,807). Those prices don't seem cheap to an American buyer but keep in mind that Europe has much bigger taxes on cars. If sold here, the Duster would comfortably undercut even the most AWD affordable trucks.\nThe price isn't the only attraction, though. For instance, the Duster has better off-road capabilities than any other crossover at that price, making it the darling among budget-minded overlanding enthusiasts in Europe. Notably, the latest 2024 iteration comes with an optional 4x4 Terrain Control drivetrain with a close-ratio transmission. The system has five driving modes: Auto, Snow, Mud/Sand, Off-Road, and ECO. Moreover, the ground clearance sits at 8.54 inches (217 mm), which is easily the highest for any compact crossover vehicle. The 31-degree approach, 36-degree departure angles, and downhill speed control are useful, too.\nDacia engineers also made sure the Duster was well-protected when facing rough terrain. The crossover/SUV has front and rear skid plates and shields around the car made of Starkle\u00ae \u2013 an unpainted material that doesn't show scratches. Overlanding accessories are available, too, like a \"Sleep Pack\" double bed and a new roof rack. In the U.S., you are only getting these things in an expensive off-road SUV \u2014 not in a cheap and chic compact crossover!\nCitroen C6\nGerman premium automakers always try to inject some sportiness into their high-end luxury sedans, but the French do it differently. Perhaps the best current example of that is the Citroen C6. This extravagant luxury car is the opposite of sporty, aiming to transport passengers in the most relaxed way possible.\nThe technology that makes that possible is the self-leveling hydropneumatic suspension, the same one used in Citroen's most popular car, the DS. It provides a buttery-smooth ride on any surface, making you feel like you hitched a ride on a cloud. The C6 is the last large luxurious Citroen with that suspension. Drive it today, and it will feel like a time capsule, bringing you back much further than the period when it was on sale (2006-2012).\nHowever, there is more to the C6 than the suspension. It's elegant body lines, fastback rear, and unique concave rear window will still turn heads. The interior is simple yet plush, with ample space in both seating rows. The engines were underpowered, even for the era, though the 2.7-liter V6 turbodiesel was at least economical.\nThe C6 is then an interesting proposition until it occurs to you that it is a Citroen. Reliability is a concern with these vehicles, so if you want to enjoy one, be prepared to have some cash aside to keep it running. That doesn't make it any less cool, though!\nDS9\nThe DS9 is the spiritual successor to the C6, as the DS brand itself was born as a premium Citroen with the DS3. Although more sedate on the outside than the C6, the DS9 is unmistakably French, with a stylized front and rear end and sculpted body panels. Inside, it exudes extravagance, with a stylish dashboard, good materials, and excellent attention to detail.\nBut the pi\u00e8ce de resistance of the DS9 again is the suspension. Gone is the complex hydropneumatic system from the C6, replaced by DS Active Scan Suspension. This new system scans the road ahead using cameras, so it can change the damping on the fly when it detects potholes or other road irregularities. Sounds a bit intricate, but reviewers say it works tremendously \u2014 the DS9 is again one of the most comfortable sedans on sale in Europe.\nThe DS9 incorporates other advanced features. Notably, 2024 models come with ChatGPT as standard in five European countries. The driver or passengers can talk to the generative AI using DS's speech recognition and use it as a travel companion. Furthermore, buyers can opt for DS PARK PILOT, an automated parking system, and DS NIGHT VISION, which would allow the driver to spot objects further in the dark.\nElectrification is the name of the game with the DS9, with the most powerful E-TENSE 4x4 360 plug-in hybrid model with 355 hp pushing this big sedan to 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 5.6 seconds.\nPeugeot 508 SW PSE\nImagine taking the powerful PHEV setup from the DS9 and putting it in a smaller, super-attractive wagon body. Peugeot has done just that with the 508 SW PSE. This might just be the most alluring wagon currently on sale. It has a very aggressive front end and bold rear end, connected by a chiseled side profile, all working in harmony.\nInside, the 508 SW PSE is equally attractive, with a futuristic dashboard design that is the total opposite of what the Germans offer. It also has lots of space in both seating rows and a useful 17.2 cubic foot (487-liter) trunk capacity (up to the tonneau cover).\nFor the powertrain, Peugeot went with a plug-in hybrid setup. It's not something you'd want to hear in a high-performance wagon, but still, with 355 hp on tap, it's the most powerful Peugeot to date. Crucially, it can bring the 508 SW PSE to 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 5.2 seconds and on to a limited 155 mph (250 km/h) top speed.\nPower goes to all four wheels, though the rear axle only gets it from an electric motor. Regardless, the 508 SW PSE offers stable and predictable cornering, adhering to the needs of family buyers. That said, reviewers say it isn't the most engaging car to drive and far from the heights the Germans reached. Still, with performance wagons being few and far between, the charming 508 SW PSE remains an attractive proposition.\nBMW M550d xDrive Touring\nWhat is a diesel doing on this list? Well, this is not your ordinary diesel \u2014 it's a 3.0-liter inline-6 unit with four turbochargers! As a result, it produces 400 hp, a mind-blowing figure for such a small unit. And the torque it produces is even more impressive \u2014 561 lb-ft! That would beat most full-size trucks, let alone regular cars. Oh, and all that torque is available at just 2,000 rpm, with 330 lb-ft of it being available to your right leg at 1,000 rpm!\nAs you can imagine, this over-engineered powertrain moves the large m550d xDrive Touring effortlessly. For instance, at 60 mph and in eighth gear, the odometer needle stays at 1,200 rpm. The performance numbers are also mighty impressive \u2014 the M550d takes only 4.4 seconds to reach 62 mph (100 km/h). Of course, thanks to all that torque, this functional wagon will happily accelerate anytime and in any gear. A true road-going locomotive.\nSure, the M550d xDrive Touring won't be as sporty as a V8-powered 5 Series, despite the standard rear-wheel steering. However, it doesn't need to be. There is something special about a vehicle that achieves high velocity effortlessly and without too much drama. It's perhaps the best highway machine currently in existence. It's also hugely practical and looks pretty rad.\nStill, with four turbochargers, the engine will be a nightmare to repair, and reliability is a concern. So, don't expect to see one on U.S. roads, even when this wagon can be finally imported here in 2043!\nHow did we choose these cars?\nMany European models are not available in the U.S., but not all of them are interesting. Most are small urban dwellers, which American buyers have never wanted in the first place. Instead, we focused on bringing you vehicles that could reinvigorate the North American market with style, performance, and features. Each of these models is special in its own way. Hope it helped you find a European car to dream of!"

      "text": "In 2013 the Tesla Model S Was a Shocking Car of the Year Winner\nProof positive that America can still make (great) things.\nThe 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year is one of the quickest American four-doors ever built. It drives like a sports car, eager and agile and instantly responsive. But it's also as smoothly effortless as a Rolls-Royce, can carry almost as much stuff as a Chevy Equinox, and is more efficient than a Toyota Prius. Oh, and it'll sashay up to the valet at a luxury hotel like a supermodel working a Paris catwalk. By any measure, the Tesla Model S is a truly remarkable automobile, perhaps the most accomplished all-new luxury car since the original Lexus LS 400. That's why it's our 2013 Car of the Year.\nWait. No mention of the astonishing inflection point the Model S represents\u2014that this is the first COTY winner in the 64-year history of the award not powered by an internal combustion engine? Sure, the Tesla's electric powertrain delivers the driving characteristics and packaging solutions that make the Model S stand out against many of its internal combustion engine peers. But it's only a part of the story. At its core, the Tesla Model S is simply a damned good car you happen to plug in to refuel.\nEngineering Excellence\nTesla claims it has 250 patents covering the Model S, and more pending. The body is light, thanks to its all-aluminum construction, yet strong and stiff. The front and rear suspension are also mostly aluminum. At the rear are extruded rear suspension links that provide the strength of forgings at much lower cost, while up front are hollow-cast front knuckles that weigh 25 percent less than a conventional knuckle of similar strength.\nThe electric motor sits between the rear wheels, contributing greatly to the 47/53-percent front/rear weight distribution. The motor is an AC-induction type, the basic principles of which were demonstrated in the 1880s by Nikola Tesla himself, and it doesn't need expensive rare earth metals.\nTesla offers three lithium-ion battery packs for the Model S\u201440-kW-hr, 60-kW-hr, and 85-kW-hr\u2014that are claimed to provide ranges of 140, 200, and 265 miles, respectively. The base 85-kW-hr powertrain delivers a stout 362 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque, while the performance version makes 416 hp and 443 lb-ft.The battery packs are assembled at Tesla's plant in Fremont, California, using Panasonic cells with nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathodes. Situated under the floor, the battery pack is a stressed member that further improves torsional rigidity, and helps lower the car's center of gravity to just 17.5 inches, about the same as a Ford GT's.\nAdvancement in Design\nRefreshingly, Tesla designer Franz von Holzhausen resisted the temptation to make the Model S look different for the sake of being different to call attention to the fact it has an electric motor. Former GM design boss Wayne Cherry, a consultant judge this year, summed up the exterior design theme of the Model S as \"somewhat safe and conservative,\" but noted the beautifully executed design-enhancing proportions, the excellent stance and gesture, and the harmony and grace of its lines. His only criticism? \"The front end is a missed opportunity to establish brand identity.\"\nThe Model S takes advantage of the packaging opportunities afforded by the compact EV powertrain. The cabin is roomy, though the raked roofline impinges on rear-seat headroom. With no engine up front, the \"hood\" covers a useful luggage space, and the rear hatch opens to a cavernous load area that gets even bigger when you fold the rear seats flat. Total load capacity is 63.4 cubic feet, not that far shy of the 63.7 cubic-feet in a Chevy Equinox, and despite its rakish looks, the Model S is the first hatchback in the world to offer third-row seating.\nA number of the interior design solutions need more polish. However, all judges were impressed with the Tesla's unique user interface, courtesy of the giant touch screen in the center of the car that controls everything from the air-conditioning to the nav system to the sound system to the car's steering, suspension, and brake regeneration settings. The system means the Model S interior is virtually button-free, and the car has been effectively future-proofed: More functionality is only a software update away.\nEfficiency\nWhatever what you use\u2014gasoline, electricity, hamsters in a wheel\u2014making a vehicle move requires the consumption of energy. The laws of physics are immutable. The question is, how efficiently can it be done?\nIn the case of the Tesla Model S, the answer is very. The best energy consumption figure we've returned is 118 mpg-e for a 212-mile run from the eastern fringe of the Los Angeles sprawl to Las Vegas, Nevada. For the 313 miles of road loops during the COTY evaluation, where the car was driven at normal speeds by all the judges with the air-conditioning running, it averaged 74.5 mpg-e.\nImpressive numbers, especially considering the 4766-pound Tesla Model S Signature Performance version will nail 60 mph in 4.0 seconds and the quarter in 12.4 seconds at 112.5 mph, with a top speed of 133 mph.\nSafety\nIn terms of active safety, the Tesla Model S is at the top of the class. With all the car's mass down low and between the wheels, the Model S is a very stable platform, and the electric motor's instant torque means the car is quick and responsive in traffic and during overtaking moves. The stability control and anti-lock braking systems are calibrated to the unique instant-on torque and regenerative braking characteristics of an EV.\nWhen a crash does happen, the usual complement of passive safety devices, including an array of airbags, kick into play. Beyond that, clever engineering such as the double octagon extrusions front and rear, and the immensely strong roof structure, is working to protect you. Tesla claims the Model S outperforms federal crash standards, having been impact-tested at 50 mph (the mandatory standard is 35 mph) and exceeding the roof crush requirement by a factor of 2.\nValue\nWith a base price of $58,570 (before a federal tax credit of $7500), the 40-kW-hr Model S is competitive with entry-level Mercedes-Benz E-Class, BMW 5 Series, and Audi A6. A loaded 85-kW-hr Signature Performance series, like the $106,900 (before tax credit) car Tesla founder Elon Musk drives, is priced right on BMW M5 and the Mercedes CLS63 AMG\u2014cars of similar performance, remember.\nTesla buyers likely don't need to watch their pennies, but the calculation's worth doing all the same: At an average of 74.5 mpg-e, the Model S costs about 6 cents a mile to run, based on California's 13 cents per kW-hr.\nPerformance of Intended Function\nThe Tesla Model S nails the formula established by the German brands that currently dominate the midsize luxury sedan sector. It's fast and great to drive. It's well-equipped and high-tech. It won't look out of place rolling up the drive of a leafy country club or at the curb of a hip hotel. It's a credible alternative to a Mercedes, BMW, or Audi for someone who lives in metroplexes such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Atlanta.\nWe've covered more than 1400 miles in cars equipped with the 85-kW-hr battery pack, and can confirm that version of the Model S will easily handle 200 miles of mixed city, suburban, and freeway driving without any hypermiling techniques. For the typical daily diet of commuting and short trips (the average American drives about 40 miles a day), the Model S is a compelling proposition.\nThe mere fact the Tesla Model S exists at all is a testament to innovation and entrepreneurship, the very qualities that once made the American automobile industry the largest, richest, and most powerful in the world. That the 11 judges unanimously voted the first vehicle designed from the wheels up by a fledgling automaker the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year should be cause for celebration. America can still make things. Great things.\nSupercharge It!: Long-Distance Driving In the Model S\nBy Kim Reynolds\nEven with its remarkable, 85-kW-hr battery, the Model S' EPA-certified 265-mile range is about 100 miles short of spanning California's two biggest cities. And if you can't manage that, how would you ever get to New York? To answer that, Tesla recently unveiled the first five of what it calls its Supercharger stations along routes connecting L.A. to Las Vegas and San Francisco, and S.F. to Reno. (A sixth is located at SpaceX's Hawthorne factory.)\nThese Superchargers are veritable electron fire hoses, delivering DC energy directly into the battery at rates up to 80 kW, bypassing the on-board 10-kW (or optional 20-kW) inverter(s), and gaining 150 to 160 miles in range in 30 minutes. As Tesla says, stops on long drives often take that long anyway, if you use the bathroom, stretch, and grab a snack.\nMoreover, charging will be partially sun-powered\u2014the stations' roofs are covered with Musk's Solar City photovoltaic cells, but don't worry, you can recharge at night\u2014and it's permanently free to Model S owners with the 85 kW-hr battery, and 60 kW-hr cars with supercharging capability. As Musk says, as long as you bring enough sandwiches and drinks, you could drive across the country without your wallet. Tesla predicts 100 stations nationwide by 2015.\nAt the stations' unveiling, Musk compared them in importance to SpaceX's docking with the International Space Station. That could turn out to be an underestimation.\nI can\u2019t remember a time when I wasn\u2019t fascinated by cars. My father was a mechanic, and some of my earliest memories are of handing him wrenches as he worked to turn a succession of down-at-heel secondhand cars into reliable family transportation. Later, when I was about 12, I\u2019d be allowed to back the Valiant station wagon out onto the street and drive it around to the front of the house to wash it. We had the cleanest Valiant in the world.\nI got my driver\u2019s license exactly three months after my 16th birthday in a Series II Land Rover, ex-Australian Army with no synchro on first or second and about a million miles on the clock. \u201cPass your test in that,\u201d said Dad, \u201cand you\u2019ll be able to drive anything.\u201d He was right. Nearly four decades later I\u2019ve driven everything from a Bugatti Veyron to a Volvo 18-wheeler, on roads and tracks all over the world. Very few people get the opportunity to parlay their passion into a career. I\u2019m one of those fortunate few.\nI started editing my local car club magazine, partly because no-one else would do it, and partly because I\u2019d sold my rally car to get the deposit for my first house, and wanted to stay involved in the sport. Then one day someone handed me a free local sports paper and said they might want car stuff in it. I rang the editor and to my surprise she said yes. There was no pay, but I did get press passes, which meant I got into the races for free. And meet real automotive journalists in the pressroom. And watch and learn.\nIt\u2019s been a helluva ride ever since. I\u2019ve written about everything from Formula 1 to Sprint Car racing; from new cars and trucks to wild street machines and multi-million dollar classics; from global industry trends to secondhand car dealers. I\u2019ve done automotive TV shows and radio shows, and helped create automotive websites, iMags and mobile apps. I\u2019ve been the editor-in-chief of leading automotive media brands in Australia, Great Britain, and the United States. And I\u2019ve enjoyed every minute of it. The longer I\u2019m in this business the more astonished I am these fiendishly complicated devices we call automobiles get made at all, and how accomplished they have become at doing what they\u2019re designed to do. I believe all new cars should be great, and I\u2019m disappointed when they\u2019re not. Over the years I\u2019ve come to realize cars are the result of a complex interaction of people, politics and process, which is why they\u2019re all different. And why they continue to fascinate me.Read More"

      "text": "12 Of The Cutest Cars Ever Made\nThe earliest cars were very utilitarian-looking. The first car ever invented, patented by Carl Benz in 1887, was little more than a bench, a wooden floorboard, three bicycle-style wheels, and a one-cylinder engine mounted on the back. Once the new \"horseless carriage\" technology matured, however, cars quickly became a canvas for dreams. They could display any aesthetic their designers imagined: voluptuous, streamlined, muscular, low-slung, or just plain practical. They could even be cute. But what makes a vehicle cute? After all, it's just a machine for getting from one place to another.\nCute implies personality, as if the car is alive. By comparison, most adjectives used to describe cars are exactly that: descriptive. But a small number of adjectives go beyond description to suggest something almost like a personal relationship between car and driver. \"Sexy\" would be one of those adjectives, and \"cute\" would be another, although it's unlikely both words would ever describe the same car. \"Sexy\" sounds like it would get you in trouble, whereas \"cute\" sounds like an adorable puppy or a favorite stuffed animal.\nAnd that's where we begin to see what traits make a car cute. A cute car is usually small, for one thing. This gives it scaled-down proportions and makes various elements like headlights seem larger by comparison. This taps into our mammalian caregiving response, since babies of many species (including our own) display features such as disproportionately large eyes and stubby limbs. It helps that many of the cutest cars even seem to have faces, as the list below shows. So while a knee-high exotic Italian supercar or an American muscle car with bulging flanks may set pulses racing, cute cars make us want to give them names and keep them forever.\n1938-2003 Volkswagen Beetle\nThe original Volkswagen Beetle runs the risk of being too familiar to stand out as cute, but there's no denying that its proportions almost perfectly exemplify cuteness. Heck, one of the cool and unique features of the Beetle was a flower vase that could be fitted to the dashboard \u2014 and how cute is that? It was so cute that there was even a movie starring a Beetle named Herbie called \"The Love Bug.\" In this 1968 film, a sentient Beetle wins hearts and races. The filmmakers were very aware of the Beetle's anthropomorphic features: big headlights that look very much like eyes flanking a hood bulge that looks like a nose, all underlined by a bumper that looks like a mouth.\nThe overall proportions of the Beetle are cute, too. Its small dimensions and rounded profile are nearly the Platonic ideal for a small car design. In the U.S. in particular, this diminutive vehicle stood out against a sea of giant Detroit cars. Perhaps its appearance helps explain why it remained in production for 65 years, selling in the tens of millions. Its popularity with hippies in the 1960s gave it even more of an aura of peace-love-and-happiness, making it seem as friendly as it is cute.\n1954-1962 Nash Metropolitan\nLike the Beetle, the Nash Metropolitan also bucked the trend of automotive gigantism. It almost resembled a cartoon version of a 1950s American car with its tiny dimensions, slab-sided styling, covered wheel openings, and diminutive tailfins. In fact, the Metropolitan inspired the car driven by Bob Parr, the secret identity of Mr. Incredible, in the Pixar animated movie \"The Incredibles,\" albeit with a modern hatchback roofline. Bob crammed his gigantic superhero frame into the tiny car for maximum comedic effect. A real-life strongman would probably have had similar trouble getting into a Metropolitan, given that it was America's first subcompact car at only 149.5 inches in length. By comparison, a 1954 Buick Roadmaster was over 216 inches long.\nThe Metropolitan was even shorter than the Beetle by almost a foot. The reason for its small size lay under its adorably stubby body panels since it was built using components from the British manufacturer Austin, known for manufaturing diminutive roadsters and the original Mini. Austin supplied the car's four-cylinder engines, too. Nash applied the Metropolitan's distinctively American bodywork, which came in both coupe and convertible forms. The car was available in the two-tone color schemes that were popular at the time, making it look even more like a cute, miniaturized version of classic Detroit iron.\n1958-1961 Austin-Healey Sprite\nIf you know your British roadsters, then you absolutely knew this car would make this list. The Austin-Healey \"Bugeye\" Sprite could easily rank as the cutest car in history because of its insanely adorable face. Also nicknamed the \"Frogeye\" in its native British Isles, even if the Sprite wasn't the cutest car of all time, it was certainly one of the happiest-looking cars ever made. Every generation of the Sprite was cute, particularly the Sprite Mark I, built between 1958 and early 1961. Its headlights stuck up prominently from a hood that sloped down to a smile-shaped grille. This, combined with its tiny size and oversized wheel arches, made it look almost like a child's pedal car.\nUnlike a kiddie car, though, the Sprite had a choice of inline four-cylinder engines powering the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. With either 42 or 52 horsepower, the 0-60 run took 20 long seconds. Handling took precedence over speed; its innovative monocoque body boosted the little roadster's rigidity, lacking even a trunk in order to maximize chassis stiffness. Any luggage that couldn't be strapped to a rack on the rear had to stay at home. The Sprite was so spartan that it even lacked exterior door handles. Yet it offered cuteness and charm in spades.\n1955-1962 BMW Isetta\nThe Isetta saved BMW from bankruptcy during the post-war scarcity of its time. As such, this bubble car has something of a dark side beneath its tiny and cute exterior, like a starlet with a tragic past. Yet the microcar went on to become an icon. BMW needed a high-volume model to combat declining sales and the expense of building its luxury models, so it licensed the design for the Isetta from Iso Rivolta, an Italian manufacturer of cars and refrigerators. (Because of course those two things go together, right?) The name Isetta is a diminutive for Iso, so even the car's name is friendly and cute.\nAt first glance, you might notice the door handle on the front of the car; the whole front opens like, well, a refrigerator. The driver just has to step around the steering wheel and drop into the car's bench seat. A passenger could join the driver, although in these cramped quarters, it was best if they quite liked each other. A canvas roof provided an emergency exit if the door got stuck in a front-end collision. In the model's first year, the engine boasted all of one cylinder that generated precisely 12 horsepower. A larger engine in 1956 bumped that to 13. But that was good for speeds of up to 53 mph, and a rack on the back could carry luggage, so the Isetta sold over 160,000 units in eight years.\n1957+ Fiat 500\nMany of the cars on this list had one or two generations that stood out as particularly adorable, but the iconic Fiat 500 has displayed its feisty Italian cuteness from day one. From the original 500 that debuted in 1957 to the electric Fiat 500e that came back to America for the 2024 model year, this iconic little car has served generations of drivers as the ultimate urban runabout. Through all the decades, one common thread has united every model of the Cinquecento (that's 500 in Italian): this little car is darn cute.\nMuch of this cuteness comes from its minuscule proportions. Almost any car this small might make you go awww. But from one model year to the next, the 500's designers have always given it an expressive and outsized personality. The first generation looked almost like a rolling bowler hat. In more recent years, the 500 has adopted an aggressive stance, with fender flares and a hatchback profile that make it look almost like it's leaning forward, like a small dog ready to rumble. Recent 500 convertible models have roofs that fold back over the tiny tailgate like a hoodie. All told, the seven-decade history of the 500 is a history of cuteness.\n1964-1966 Honda S600\nThe Honda S600 was more than just a tiny roadster that can still make onlookers squeal with delight; it marked a turning point for the Honda Motor Company as it transitioned from a motorcycle maker into what would become one of the world's great car manufacturers. Technically, it wasn't Honda's first production model; that was its predecessor, the S500, of which only 1,300 were built. But the S600 was the company's first volume passenger car model. It was absolutely minuscule at only 130 inches in length and 55 inches in width \u2014 24 inches shorter and 13 inches narrower than a 2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata.\nYet, despite its size, its proportions are nearly perfect. It features sporty lines and a slight arch to the rear quarter panels that give it a spirited posture. In photos, only the outsized headlights and windshield tip you off to the car's small size. In person, of course, it's almost astonishingly small, even in comparison to modern roadsters. Honda's designers did an excellent job on their first try, creating a scaled-down but very attractive car, which most people would agree is also very cute. With independent suspensions front and rear, an all-aluminum engine generating almost 100 horsepower per liter, and a 9,500-rpm redline, this little car could scoot around pretty well, too. Today, it's considered one of the best-looking Honda models of all time.\n1978-1987 Subaru Brat\nThe Subaru BRAT's full name \u2014 the Bi-drive Recreational All-terrain Transporter \u2013 is absurdly large for this tiny and oh-so-cute pickup. Subaru adapted its Leone station wagon into a mini-truck in response to the growing popularity of compact pickups in the 1970s. The BRAT debuted in 1978 and sold worldwide until 1994, but in the U.S., it was discontinued after 1987. As if the BRAT wasn't cute enough with its jaunty little body, in the States, it was sold with a pair of rear-facing jump seats in the bed, back-to-back with the cab, giving it somewhat of a dune buggy aesthetic.\nThese rear seats helped the BRAT evade tariffs on imported pickups by posing as a passenger car, but the beachy cachet they gave the BRAT was a happy accident. Standard four-wheel drive made it even more of a favorite among outdoorsy types, including President Ronald Reagan. The BRAT sold 100,000 units in the U.S. during its decade-long run, but eventually, declining sales caused Subaru to discontinue its little pickup truck. The value of a BRAT today might surprise you, with good-condition examples selling for far more than they were worth when new.\n1984-1989 Toyota MR2 (First Generation)\nEven the Toyota MR2's nickname \u2014 the Mister Two \u2014 is crazy cute. Every generation of the Mister Two is arguably cute, but the first generation pegged the cuteness meter. There's some confusion about what the MR2 abbreviation means, with some sources claiming it stands for \"midship runabout 2-seater,\" while Motor Trend says it means \"MidshipRear-drive 2-seater.\" The truth has probably been lost to legend, but one thing is definite: the MR2 was a fun car to drive.\nThe first generation of the MR2 was also completely cute. Its wedge-shaped form factor could be seen on other cars of the 1970s and 1980s like the Triumph TR7 and the Pontiac Fiero, but the Mister Two arguably pulled it off best. There's just something right about its proportions and its nicely integrated body elements, such as the bumpers. Nothing stands out as jarring or tacked-on. Some MR2s had a saucy little wedge-shaped spoiler that mirrored the overall shape of the body. Available t-tops turned it into a great ride for a beach day. With great handling and fun-in-the-sun potential, the Mister Two was more than just cute.\n1989-2015 MX-5 Mazda Miata (First Through Third Generations)\nThe first three generations of the Mazda MX-5 Miata presented an aw-shucks grin to the world, like a baby-faced star who never seems to grow old. By the time its fourth generation arrived in 2016, it had adopted a more angular and aggressive styling language; the star had grown up and matured. But those first three generations between 1989 and 2015 \u2014 oh, were they ever so cute. The first generation had retractable headlights, but the combination of the parking lights and the mouth-shaped air intake in the front bumper gave the Miata the look of a crinkly-eyed smile, or a newborn kitten whose eyes hadn't fully opened yet. The second generation in 1999 and the third generation in 2006 featured regular headlights, giving the little roadster more of an open-eyed smile, but it was still as cute as a button.\nBeing available in colors like bright red or sunburst yellow just upped the adorable factor. No matter how many Miatas one saw on the road, it was always something special. Amid a sea of sensible sedans and the ever-growing number of imposing SUVs, the Miata was like a ray of sunshine rolling down the road. The fact that the Miata is an excellent driver's car and one of the best Mazda models of all time is best appreciated from behind the wheel, but everyone can enjoy the reflected glow of the joy it radiates.\n1991 Nissan Figaro\nThe Nissan Figaro's retro mid-century looks could give the Austin-Healey Sprite a run for the title of the cutest car in history, with its appeal only heightened by the fact that it was produced for only one year. It was also a Japanese domestic market (JDM) model, so it may be less familiar to readers in North America. Even in Japan, it's one of the rarest JDM cars of all time, limited to just 20,000 units. It was one of the first retro-styled cars, with its rounded lines, plentiful use of chrome, and colors like Pale Aqua all recalling the Jet Age cars of the 1960s. Yet somehow, it managed to be cuter than anything from that era \u2014 or its own time, for that matter.\nPart of this is attributable to those cartoonishly rounded lines, and part of it results from the \"face\" created by its huge headlights and grille. Its friendly visage almost gives the folding white hardtop roof the look of a hat. It's just that charming. Its white leather interior featured specially designed instruments for extra panache. The Figaro exuded cuteness both inside and out.\n2004-2007 Scion xB (First Generation)\nAsk a child to draw a car, and there's a good chance the result will look like the first-generation Scion xB. It was nearly the Platonic ideal of a two-box car design, featuring almost nothing but right angles on its exterior. And yet, somehow, it worked. What's more, the first-gen's protruding and very tall front bumper made the xB look like it was leading with its chin. Scion was Toyota's youth brand, or at least that was Toyota's plan, but the xB almost looked like an oh-so-serious older man harrumphing as he went about his business. It was arguably the most memorable model from Scion's 14-year existence.\nThe xB was a hit with tuners, who got a kick out of turning the frumpy little block-shaped car into all kinds of unlikely and imaginative forms. Even today, a search for \"Scion xB tuner\" will turn up hundreds of sites ready to make the xB into its owner's personal canvas. Scion sold 61,000 of them in the first generation's best year, 2006. But then came a redesign for 2008, with the severe right angles rounded off, giving the new xB a more conventional 21st-century look. The new model also gained size and quite a bit of weight. The tossable driving dynamics of the subcompact first-generation model disappeared, along with the charm, and sales plummeted to a third of what they had been. It was a rare marketing miscue by Toyota.\n2009-2014 Nissan Cube\nThe Nissan Cube demonstrates that there's an uncanny valley between cute and strange, with its rounded side windows and asymmetrical rear windshield and door. Yet, ultimately, its earnest adorableness wins you over like that last puppy to get adopted. When it hit the U.S. market in 2009, it had already been a cult classic in Japan for years. The Cube resonates with Japanese design motifs, which tend to avoid symmetry, favoring a look that reflects the way things grow in nature. It polarized observers in the U.S., with some loving it and others feeling it was one of the strangest cars made in the 2000s.\nThe style elements that make the Cube cute are its rounded lines, including the side windows, the headlights that look almost like spectacles, and rear sheet metal that curves outward into the bumper, giving the Cube a pert little protruding butt. Nissan itself described the Cube as looking like a \"bulldog in sunglasses.\" And then there was that show-stopping rear door; there was nothing else like it on the automotive market. It wasn't just a style feature, though: the side-hinged door swung wide open to give easy access to the Cube's surprisingly large interior. In the Cube's case, cute followed function."

      "text": "Front Vs. Mid Vs. Rear Engines Explained: How Placement Affects A Car\nOne of the very first elements any automotive designer must consider is where to locate the engine. Whether it's a typical internal-combustion powerplant or electric motors, engines require a lot of space, they're heavy, and different types have different needs. For instance, if your engine is in the middle of the car, how do you supply it with fresh air? If your engine is rear-mounted, how do you keep a radiator cool? What about weight distribution? Engines can be massive chunks of metal, easily weighing multiple hundreds of pounds on their own. This can drastically affect a car's balance and weight bias.\nQuestions like these often dictate a huge number of decisions during some of the earliest parts of a car's design phase. Because the engine has a very specific set of requirements, where it's placed often influences the shape and purpose of the entire vehicle. Most cars typically follow a \"template\" for each configuration \u2013 front-engine vehicles are by far the most common and easiest to construct. Mid-engine cars are usually sports-oriented and more specialized in their roles. And rear-engine cars are similarly rare and more niche.\nOf course, there are exceptions to each of these rules. The first-generation Toyota Previa, for example, is the only mass-produced mid-engine minivan. And while rear-engine vehicles are uncommon in general, the Volkswagen Beetle \u2013 the longest-lived name in automotive history \u2013 is rear-engine. So, outside of weight distribution and balance, what other factors determine an engine's placement? Let's look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of each.\nFront-engine: the configuration of the masses\nFront-engine layouts remain the perennial option for a wide variety of reasons, chief among them being simplicity. Engines require three elements to create combustion: fuel, air, and spark. Air is most readily available at the front of the vehicle, so manufacturers don't have to design around airflow with front-engines. If the engine requires more air, a bigger front grille will do. Similarly, this means the vehicle's engine and cooling system can live in the same bay without issues. The only real downside is that on rear-drive and AWD vehicles, you have a long driveshaft running through the passenger compartment, eating up some cabin space.\nTypically, manufacturers also favor this configuration because of the forward-biased weight distribution. This has to do with understeer versus oversteer. In basic terms, understeer means that a car turns less than what your steering input asks of it, oversteer is the opposite. Oversteer leads to a car feeling snappy and unpredictable, with out-of-control spins being harder to correct. A more understeery car, on the other hand, is regarded as the \"safer\" alternative, with many passenger cars tuned from the factory to favor understeering.\nFor instance, let's say you panic-brake and veer hard, but your car keeps going in a straight line for a fraction of a second. It's far easier to recover control in such a situation than if you similarly jerk the wheel and your car's rear end breaks traction, causing a spin. Likewise, overcorrections are easier to catch, especially in front-wheel drive cars where \"fishtailing\" is far less likely. Almost all larger vehicles are front-engine to provide better cargo room, especially pickup trucks. In fact, there's exactly one mass-produced pickup which isn't: the classic Volkswagen Transporter.\nMid-engine: a sportier alternative\nThere are two ways to execute a mid-engine car: front-mid and rear-mid. The true definition of a vehicle which is mid-engine is that the engine block does not sit over an axle. Therefore, a car like a modern Porsche 911 is considered mid-engine, whereas older 911s, which have the engine sat behind the rear wheels, are rear-engine. Alternatively, any vehicle with a front-mid engine configuration has the engine behind the front axle, but ahead of the vehicle's centerline. It has nothing to do with where the driver sits (the Toyota Previa's engine is below the driver but ahead of the centerline, so it is front-mid engine).\nMany well-known front-engine vehicles are actually front-mid engine, such as most Corvettes (excluding first and eighth-gen models), the original Willys MB Jeep, Nissan GT-R R35, and Dodge Viper. The main advantages with a mid-engine design lay in a car's weight distribution. A mid-engine car benefits from excellent balanced traction between front and rear wheels. However, the nature of a mid-engine layout requires either a very long chassis or a two-seat design because of space limitations. Hence why the majority of mid-engine cars are two-seaters or 2+2s.\nThis layout, especially in rear-mid engine cars, also faces cooling issues due to the lack of airflow. That's why many such cars feature prominent vents along the sides and specialized cooling systems, such as the Ferrari Testarossa and McLaren F1. Mid-engine cars also benefit from a sleeker front-end design, unencumbered by a tall engine sat over the front axle. Balance being the primary concern with sports-oriented cars, this leads to some creative solutions to create the optimal distribution. For instance, some front-mid cars, like a C5 Corvette, feature a rear-mounted transmission to help with weight distribution.\nRear-engine: a quirky layout of its time\nMuch like front-engine cars, rear-engine designs feature more compact bodies and spacious interiors. It also affords exceptional rear-end traction because of the weight distribution, perfect for dirt and snow. Because of this, even the classic Volkswagen retains a prominent presence in rallying, being a popular option in SCORE with Class 11 and Class 5 Unlimited both dedicated to the platform. Similarly, two rear-engine AWD Porsche 959s dominated the 1986 Paris-Dakar Rally, taking a 1-2 almost five hours ahead of third place.\nSimilar to mid-engine, rear-engine cars also suffer from cooling and intake problems. Rear-engine cars also tend to be more unforgiving if they lose control, because the rear end likes to pendulum. Often, this bias also creates more of a learning-curve for driving a rear-engine car at speed, with the lighter front-end sometimes feeling \"floaty\" because of a lack of weight. Because the transmission is mounted rearward, there still must be a mechanical connection, such as a shaft, running through the passenger cabin for the shifter linkage. However, it remains far less complex than older AWD systems for similar levels of grip in poor weather.\nOnce popular for their traction, crumple zones, and simplicity, these issues were largely overcome by advancing automotive technology. As such, rear-engine layouts have long-since fell out of mainstream favor. Very few rear-engine cars are produced today, with only specialized, niche holdovers such as the Smart Fortwo serving as contemporary examples."

      "text": "5 Cars That Don't Deserve Their Bad Reputations\nCars, trucks, and SUVs inspire strong opinions. The Chevrolet Corvette and Ford Mustang are among models with the loyal fan bases, and the very similar Jeep CJ5 and CJ7 have inspired cars that are basically Jeep clones. Not every vehicle has been as big a hit as these, though.\nThe Edsel was an over-engineered disaster that lost Ford a quarter of a billion dollars, and the Renault Dauphine was rickety, uncomfortable, and slow. But for every unqualified catastrophe like the Edsel and Dauphine, there are a few cars that were unfairly labeled as disappointments. Some were anomalies of their era that just needed the industry to catch up to them, others were the subjects of questionable testing practices, and at least one was a victim of unethical journalism. Here are five cars we think aren't worthy of the hate they got.\n[Featured image by Greg Gjerdingen via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC-BY SA 2.0]\nThe Suzuki Samurai got a bum rap from Consumer Reports\nThe Suzuki Jimny had been in production for nearly two decades when it came to the U.S. in 1986 as the Samurai. The petite sport-ute earned a following among people looking for a more fuel-efficient alternative to the Jeep CJ7 and the Wrangler, which replaced the CJ7 the next year. But much of the enthusiasm for the Samurai was squashed in 1988, the year it got a nearly $2,000 price increase to $8,495.\nThat's only the equivalent of about $23,000 today, which would make it one of the cheapest cars available. But that same year, Consumer Reports published an article claiming that the Samurai had a tendency to \"easily roll over in turns.\" Suzuki contested the testing methods used by Consumer Reports' owner Consumers Union, and filed a corresponding lawsuit in 1996. By then, the Samurai had been pulled from the U.S. market, and the parties later settled out of court.\nThe Samurai has since developed a reputation as a capable off-roader. Eduardo Canales and Gonzalo Bravo drove one to a record altitude of 21,942 feet on the Ojos del Salado volcano in their native Chile in 2007. They brought back a sign placed by the drivers of the previous record holder that read \"Jeep parking only \u2014 all others don't make it up here, anyway.\" The Samurai has become a favorite for customizers, too, so much so that it can be hard to find one in original condition.\n60 Minutes wrecked the Audi 5000's reputation\nThe Audi 5000 hit American roads in the early '80s and earned rave reviews. Car and Driver praised its gentle manners at high speeds, naming it one of the 10 best cars of 1984. But in 1986, an episode of \"60 Minutes\" claimed the 5000 was prone to \"sudden acceleration,\" where the car would take off while the driver was seemingly had a foot on the brake. It turned out that a combination of driver error and less-than-ideal pedal placement was to blame, and the problem nearly disappeared when Audi installed a shift lock linked to the brake pedal.\nIt was later revealed that the \"60 Minutes\" broadcast involved a car that had air injected into the transmission to cause the crash, but billions of dollars worth of lawsuits were filed against Audi in the aftermath. One class-action suit representing more than a quarter of a million Audi owners sought damages for lost resale value because of the sudden acceleration controversy, but the brand slowly recovered from this public relations nightmare.\nThe stink has lingered on the 5000, though, and you can often find one on the secondhand market for less than $10,000. That's a flat-out bargain for a car as beautiful, capable, and luxurious as this one.\nThe Chevy Corvair wasn't really unsafe at any speed\nThe Chevrolet Corvair is another good car whose reputation was wrecked by bad journalism. In this case, the culprit was consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who spent the first chapter of his 1965 book \"Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile\" discussing an issue with the 1960-1963 Corvair's rear suspension. The car's rear-axle half-shaft design and weight bias from the engine being mounted in back could cause aggressive drivers to lose control, but 1971 tests conducted by the Department of Transportation found that the Corvair's handling was comparable to similar cars' from that period.\nGeneral Motors' initial response was to have Nader tailed, which only served to publicize the controversy \u2014 and his book. But while the \"Unsafe at Any Speed\" debacle did plenty of damage to the Corvair's reputation, the car was a remarkably innovative effort by GM. The engines in the Corvair Monza Spyder and Oldsmobile Jetfire underwent simultaneous development, and were the first two turbocharged production cars made in America.\nGM eventually acknowledged the problems with the Corvair's suspension and redesigned it for the second generation that arrived at dealerships around the time \"Unsafe at Any Speed\" hit bookstores. Chevy kept it in production through 1969, likely in part to spite Nader and his allies, and it's become a highly regarded classic. Several clubs full of fans of the model exist today, and well-preserved first-gen Corvairs routinely fetch more than $25,000.\nThe Ford Pinto's flammability was exaggerated\nThe Ford Pinto arrived at dealerships in 1970 after a somewhat rushed development that led to a legitimate major issue involving rear-end crashes. The Pinto's gas tank was mounted behind the rear axle, one of many design flaws that increased the potential of fuel spilling on the Pinto, the car behind it, and the roadway. Stray cigarette embers or sparks from the collision could ignite the fuel, and the Pinto crumpled in a way that sometimes made escape via its doors impossible. Multiple well-publicized claims were made that as many as 900 people died in Pinto crashes that resulted in fires, but a National Highway Transportation Safety Agency report chronicled a far lower toll: 26 deaths and 107 injuries.\nWith its European styling and underpinnings, the Pinto was far more than a representation of Ford's worst engineering efforts. The fuel-efficient subcompact became an instant sensation as the oil crisis was hitting America. Ford sold well over a million Pintos in the model's first three years, although reports of fires cut sales by more than half between 1974 and 1975. For the 1977 model year, the federal government mandated that all cars be able to sustain a 30-mph collision without spilling fuel, and Pintos were redesigned with a stronger fuel filler neck and a shield for the tank. Ultimately, the fires burned up any hope of Ford's new subcompact becoming a true classic, and the Escort replaced the Pinto in 1981.\nThe Pontiac Aztek was quirky and underappreciated\nThe Pontiac brand enjoyed a run of more than 80 years, from 1926 until GM dumped the Pontiac label as a flop during a government-mandated bankruptcy restructuring. One of Pontiac's later production vehicles was the Aztek, a misshapen SUV that may have simply been ahead of its time. In 2017, Time named it one of the 50 worst cars of all time, with the caution that beneath a \"deformed\" skin lay \"a useful, competent crossover.\"\nPart of the initial revulsion for the Aztek was that customers in the early 2000s were mostly interested in full-sized SUVs or economical sedans, and the Aztek landed squarely in between those two extremes. A design-by-committee approach was meant to incorporate elements of the Chevy Blazer and Camaro with the upright stance of a minivan, and resulted in an ugly form. Despite that, design elements like plastic body armor and a front end that resembles the face of a \"Star Wars\" character have become the standard on modern crossovers. The Aztek also had a customizable digital dashboard and head-up display long before those features were commonplace.\nThe much-maligned Aztek got a boost when \"Breaking Bad\" creator Vince Gilligan assigned one to schoolteacher-turned methamphetamine kingpin Walter White (Bryan Cranston), and Edmunds ranked it among the 10 most popular vehicles for millennials during the show's last few seasons.\n[Featured image by IFCAR via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled |Public Domain]"

      "text": "8 Hidden Smart Car Features You Should Know As A Buyer Or Driver\nThe Smart Fortwo is at this point an internet hall-of-famer, in the same infamous league as stuff like the Toyota Prius and the Chrysler PT Cruiser, and it's there for the same reason: Everyone loves to make fun of it. It's small, it doesn't have all that much power, and it's not the most refined automobile in the world. An easy target, right? Not so fast.\nSetting aside the jokes, which admittedly can be funny sometimes, the Smart Fortwo was a total revolution. When it launched in the late 90s, it was the perfect response to metropolitan areas all over the world getting increasingly crowded. It's absolutely tiny and can fit just about anywhere, and what's more, it can go farther on a tank of gas than you might think.\nIt was also a revolution in small car safety. The car featured a steel Tridion safety cell that wraps around the cabin, and the rest of the body panels were plastic for easy and cheap replacement. There's so much more to the Smart car than just that, however. Believe it or not, it hides some pretty neat features.\nTransmission tricks\nThe first and second generation Smart Fortwo both came with a very similar transmission: a six-speed semi-automatic, also known as a robotized manual. While we can cut the second generation car a little slack, as it also introduced an improved five-speed semi-automatic, the six-speed transmission became known the world over for being super jerky and not very nice to use, and it has been mercilessly mocked, even by owners. But for as flawed as it was, it had a few tricks.\nFirstly, giving it more gas when the time comes to change gear was not the right thing to do. Driving a semi-automatic car is slightly different than a conventional automatic. You have to be understanding and give the gearbox some space by backing off the throttle just before the gear change is about to occur. Because the engine is right behind you, you'll be able to hear it, as well as see it on the tachometer.\nAnother trick is when you, say, parallel park on a hill. The Smart car doesn't necessarily have a park gear, at least not the first-generation and the European spec second-generation models. To avoid accidental rolling down hills even if it's in neutral and the parking brake is on, leaving it in reverse and pulling the parking brake can actually prevent you from rolling down more effectively. With the key being placed right below the shifter, this all sounds very familiar. Of course, there's also the more well-known trick: Pressing the button on the shifter switches from automatic to manual shifting mode, and vice versa, instantly.\nThe engines are pretty robust\nYou're probably thinking this sounds insane. A really tiny three-cylinder engine and engineering from Mercedes in the 2000s? Believe it or not, the Smart Fortwo's powertrains can take a beating. However, it's worth noting that the second generation car's MHD (micro hybrid drive) mild hybrid is best avoided, unless you want to spend some dough on the auxiliary belt more frequently than you should.\nThe rest of the powertrain lineup is solid, however. The first generation's three-cylinder gas units and the two-cylinder diesels will run basically forever if well-maintained. The second generation scores extra brownie points in the reliability department, as its three-cylinder gasoline engines come directly from Mitsubishi, makers of the super underrated Montero.\nSure, this is a vehicle engineered by Mercedes-Benz in the 2000s, so there are a few minor asterisks we will get to. But, purely focusing on the engine options, as long as the maintenance has been kept in check, the Smart car shouldn't really give you any major issues.\nThe gauge pods are very easy to swap\nAmong the most notable and recognizable features of the Smart Fortwo are the gauge pods, mounted right in the center of the dashboard. These lean into the Mercedes and Swatch partnership that birthed the Smart car itself, and they consist of a clock and a tachometer. Some Smart cars didn't come with these from the factory, but most of them did.\nGenerally speaking, the tachometer goes on the left, and the clock goes on the right. If you have a RHD Smart, the order is obviously reversed. These pods can be tilted at any horizontal angle you want for better visibility, but there's also a way to swap their positions.\nThe plastic base that holds the two gauge pods on the dash is very easily removable, and that makes it easy to choose which one of the gauge pods you want to bring closer to you. Helpful if, say, you spend most of your time driving in automatic mode and you don't really need to see the tachometer all that frequently.\nThe battery is in the passenger footwell\nIf you're looking to buy a Smart car, or you just bought one, you've likely asked yourself at least once: where's the battery? Almost the entire rear of the car is occupied by the engine, and there's no real hood to speak of on the first generation and second generation models. The front panel also doesn't open.\nActually, the battery is located in the passenger footwell. Once you pull away the carpeting, there's a plastic cover on the floor, which is also the reason why the footwell on the passenger side is not quite as spacious. Once you remove the plastic, you can access the battery, and this is also where you can connect jumper cables. No separate jump points here, even though it's technically a Mercedes.\nSpeaking of, if the time comes to replace the battery in your Smart car, the gasoline powered second-gen Fortwo (451) takes group size 47. If you have the MHD, make sure you're looking at an AGM battery, as it goes the best with the stop-start system. Also, be sure to choose the right brand of car battery.\nHidden compartments above the hood\nOnce again, if you haven't had experience with the Smart car previously, some things might bother you. Since there's no real hood in the front and it would be awkward to top up washer fluid in the back, where does it actually go?\nThis only applies to the first-generation 450 Fortwo, but it's still a great idea. On the front, nestled inside the Tridion safety cell, there are two vents that seem to be there for style purposes only. However, if you insert the ignition key into the plastic cap and twist it, you can remove the plastic vent cover revealing the cap to the washer fluid reservoir. Once you're done, re-install the plastic cover and screw it back in using the ignition key.\nThe more common 451 Fortwo actually has an opening panel in the front, though it has a backward hinge. There are two latches in either corner of the front \"grille\" that you have to undo, and then you can top up the fluid there. In the third-generation Fortwo, there was simply a hood \u2014 not quite as interesting, but definitely something we're all more used to. Speaking of washer fluid, there is actually a way to make your own at home.\nThe ECU in the first-gen car is a ticking timebomb\nIt's time to address the elephant in the room. Mercedes-Benz vehicles from the early-mid 2000s are known for their electrical gremlins, and sadly, the Smart car was unable to escape that curse. Even though it has way less electronics and fewer complicated components than, for example, a W220 S-Class, the ECU is definitely a ticking timebomb.\nSigns of ECU failure and overdue replacement include... stalling. You'll be on the move at a decent speed, and all of a sudden the engine cuts out and the gear indicator on the dash displays the all-conquering evil of the Smart Fortwo: the three lines. This is one of the most documented issues about the Smart Fortwo \u2014 one I myself have experienced \u2014 and it was still a concern even on the 451 cars. Thankfully, the third-generation cars seem to have ironed it out.\nWeird car connoisseur Robert Dunn of the Aging Wheels YouTube channel was also blessed with ECU failure on his first gen Smart car, and after attempting to fix it, the ECU revealed that the odometer had been tampered with. If the ECU ends up going in your Smart car, don't bother, just replace it. Get ready to budget a fair bit of cash, also.\nThird gens are the most refined\nWe haven't really given any love to the third-generation Smart car, which was sold very briefly in North America. Despite all the right intentions, North America simply had fallen out of love with the tiny car. In fact, Americans were never really in love with it to begin with, as evident in the constant mocking of the NYPD's own Fortwo patrol car.\nIn our review of the third-generation Fortwo, we thought the tiny car had a lot going for it. For starters, humble Renault underpinnings made it far simpler and cheaper for maintenance and repairs. It was also the most refined of the three generations, being surprisingly competent at highway cruising. What's more, it offered the most powerful engines in the model's history, again adding further to its highway capability.\nWhile this next one is not very important, it can mean for a lot of buyers. The third generation Smart is also the most \"conventional\" of the three, meaning you don't have to re-train everything you know about driving a car to get used to it. There's an actual hood in the front, and the ignition tumbler is in the normal place, by the steering column. There's no learning curve to the transmission either, as due to the endless complaints, Smart switched from a semi-automatic transmission to a much faster dual-clutch unit in the third gens. For the first time, there was also a proper three-pedal manual.\nUsed Smart Cars won't cost you a lot of money\nSo, how much will this tiny curiosity actually cost you to buy? Well, there's all manner of Smart cars on the used market, and prices go from less than $10,000 to around $15,000. As mentioned previously, it's a good idea to stay away from the MHD mild hybrid, as they have some pretty notable reliability issues.\nAlso, tempting though they may be, you should also avoid the EQ electric model. While they cost the same sort of money, they're getting on a little and the batteries have certainly started to degrade. Not that the range was very good to begin with. Stick with the gasoline and diesel powered models.\nStick to the Passion trim level, as that one includes luxuries like alloy wheels, cruise control, fully body colored panels and, if you're lucky, heated seats. 451 Smart cars (second gens) huddle around $8,000, and that's how much you should be paying. Just make sure there's a full service history and look out for any odd behaviors. The 451 wins hands down in terms of reliability and strikes the perfect balance of modern, but also Smart car levels of quirky. Anything in the neighborhood of $10,000 should get you a solid example."

      "text": "3 Maintenance Tips And Tricks For Classic VW Beetles\nThe Volkswagen Beetle dates back to World War II, when Adolf Hitler wanted a \"people's car\" and enlisted Ferdinand Porsche to design the Type I that was first imported to the United States in 1949. VW went on to sell more than 23 million units worldwide (via Volkswagen). The Type I Beetle was initially a primitive, underpowered rattletrap, but throughout its lifespan grew more powerful and gained features like fuel injection and an automatic transmission. It stayed in production until the late 1970s, and the model was revived as the New Beetle in 1998 with modern upgrades like air bags and a turbocharged engine.\nThe New Beetle had a two-decade run before VW dumped it from its lineup in 2019. Classic Type I Beetles are mechanically simple and remarkably easy to maintain, and there is substantial aftermarket parts support, along with a huge supply of Beetles in salvage yards around the world.\nClassic Beetle engines also weigh less than 300 pounds, which makes an engine swap doable without an engine hoist. A well-maintained classic Beetle can give you years of fun, reliable cruising (although you won't be the fastest car on any road). Here are a few tips for maintaining a Type I Beetle that can help you get the most out of this timeless classic.\nRegular oil changes and tuneups are critical\nRegular oil changes are important on any vehicle, although some modern vehicles can go as long as 15,000 miles between changes. The recommended interval for changing the oil on a Type I Beetle is 3,000 miles, which was once the standard for most car engines. You should check the oil level with each gas tank fill-up, as Beetle engines can be prone to oil leaks, and running any engine without sufficient oil in the crankcase is inviting disaster. Air-cooled engines like the Beetle's vibrate more than water-cooled engines, which can throw timing and valve clearances off or damage ignition points. The recommended tuneup interval for classic Beetles is 10,000-12,000 miles, but if performance becomes even more sluggish than normal or fuel mileage drops off suddenly, do a tuneup regardless of how long it's been since your last one.\nAny VW Beetle tuneup should start with a compression test, as this can reveal issues with improperly adjusted or malfunctioning valves or damaged engine components. Compression ratios for Beetle engines range from 6.0:1 to 7.5:1 and the target PSI is calculated by multiplying the compression ratio by the atmospheric pressure. A tuneup should also include replacement of the distributor cap and rotor and ignition points. Spark plugs and wires don't necessarily need to be changed at every tuneup, but pulling the plugs is a good way to get an idea of what is happening inside the cylinders of your engine.\nLearn how to adjust valves\nImproperly adjusted valves will make your engine perform poorly and burn more fuel than necessary. The process for adjusting the valves on a Type I VW Beetle is fairly simple and can be done with a 13mm wrench, flat blade screwdriver, and a 0.006 inch feeler gauge. You'll also need a 30mm socket and handle to rotate the crankshaft, and it's a good idea to change the valve cover gaskets while you have the covers off. The engine must be completely cooled off when adjusting valves, and this is a good time to change engine oil and distributor components as well.\nThe valve covers are held down by a metal clamp that can be slid forward to release the cover. Remove the distributor cap so you can see where the rotor is pointing, and turn the engine by hand until the rotor tip is lined up with the mark on the distributor. The valves for cylinder no. 1 should now be closed. Slide the feeler gauge between the valve stem and adjusting screw; there should be slight resistance but you should be able to slide the gauge back and forth.\nIf the valve needs adjustment, loosen the locknut and turn the screw in the appropriate direction before re-tightening the nut. Rotate the engine until the distributor has moved 90 degrees to set valve clearance for cylinder no. 2, and repeat for nos. 3 and 4.\nEngine timing is important and easy to adjust\nCorrect engine timing is also critical to efficient engine operation. You can adjust the timing on a classic VW Beetle with a simple 12 volt test light (a timing light is not necessary). Before adjusting the timing, it's important to make sure that engine compression is adequate and consistent across all four cylinders and valves are adjusted properly. Warm the engine up, and pop the clips holding the distributor cap on and remove the cap. Rotate the engine by hand until the rotor tip is aligned with the mark on the distributor and the top dead center mark is lined up with the seam between the halves of the engine block.\nLoosen the distributor hold down bolt a few turns so you can turn the distributor. Ground the tip of the test light and connect the clip to the negative terminal on the ignition coil. Rotate the distributor counterclockwise until the test light comes on, and move it back and forth slightly to make sure you've found the sweet spot. Tighten the clamp bolt down, replace the cap, and you're ready to go!"

      "text": "Why 23-Window VW Buses Are So Rare, And What One Is Worth Today\nThe Volkswagen bus is iconic. Ever since its release in 1950, the funky-looking, well-rounded minibus has built a legacy that lasts to this day. Many of us associate that classic chassis with cross-country road trips, counterculture, and free-spirited adventure. Perhaps the Scooby-Doo crew's Mystery Machine had something to do with its flower-power appeal.\nYet, as recognizable as the VW bus may be, there are several editions in its 75-year history that most people don't know about. Of those obscure models, the 23-window Volkswagen Bus is one of the rarest and most unique.\nProduced in limited numbers from 1951 to 1967, the first-generation \"Deluxe Microbus with Samba package\" model was specifically designed for sightseeing. The windows were oriented in two rows of four on each side, with one large skylight on top, two curved windows on the back, and two twin panes for the windshield. The driver's and passenger's sides also had sliding windows, bringing the total number of windows to 23.\nWith all that glass, it's easy to see why the 23-window VW microbus was coveted by \"nomadic hippies\" of the 60s and 70s. The near-360-degree visibility offered by the windows and the ample seating for up to nine passengers made it highly attractive for road trips. It was certainly an icon in the making, which is one reason why today's collectors will pay a premium for well-preserved models.\n[Featured image by Voogd075 via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY-SA 3.0]\nHow a budget-friendly bus became an expensive rarity\nThe first-generation 23-window VW microbus (called the T1) was marketed as \"budget-friendly,\" with its 1950 debut sporting a price tag of $2,200. Adjusted for inflation, that's about $26,695 today. But the model has become so rare that one well-maintained 1951 specimen recently sold for over $300,000, and a 1961 model fetched over $290,000 in 2017.\nThe reasons for the high price are the same reasons why it's so rare. Although it was a popular road-tripper bus during its production run, the 23-window VW bus wasn't as mass-produced as other VW models of the time. In fact, only about 100,000 VW Sambas were made from 1951 to 1967. After that, the 23-window T1 model was discontinued, and subsequent models had fewer and fewer windows.\nWhile 100,000 may seem like a lot, it only made up 5 to 10 percent of the Volkswagen vans and buses produced during the time period. For example, Volkswagen produced 48,481 Panelvans in 1964 alone, 36,090 of which were registered in the United States. That's nearly half the number of the 23-window T1 microbuses ever produced. Thus, this microbus was somewhat of a rarity even in its time.\nAnd so, with a limited number and over half a century since its final production year, the 23-window T1 Samba bus has become a highly sought-after collector's car. We can assume many specimens met their end in a scrap yard, while only a fraction of the 100,000 made have been preserved.\nWhen you combine the rarity of the model with its iconic cultural appeal, the high price doesn't come as a surprise.\nNot every 23-window VW bus costs 6 figures\nThe rarity of a classic car is only one factor that affects its resale price. After all, a classic car can have both limited numbers and a poor reputation at the same time, such as the Cadillac Cimarron. To determine a car's value, expert collectors use a variety of tools and considerations, including historical sales data, condition, mileage, and market trends.\nFor the original 23-window VW Samba bus, the best-preserved models make headlines when they fetch six-figure sales prices. But there are some bona fide originals available for significantly less. For example, at the writing of this article, a 1959 23-window Samba Microbus Deluxe is listed for sale on CarAndClassic for \u00a377,500. That's a little less than $95,000 in US dollars and a third of the price of the aforementioned 1951 model's sale.\nOf course, a classic vehicle's condition is the best indication of its sale price. Some estimates place the value of a 23-window T1 Samba in \"Good\" condition at $60,600, while a model in \"Fair\" condition can cost as low as $39,000. That's good news for those willing to put in the work to restore a culturally iconic bus. After seven decades, the T1 VW Transporter is still considered the best generation."

      "text": "Here's What Made Volkswagen's Air-Cooled Engine So Special\nThe Volkswagen Beetle (also called the VW Type-1) is one of the most recognizable vehicles of all time. In the United States, it was the de-facto symbol of counterculture hippies of the 1960s and 1970s and was a symbolic big slap in the face to the mile-long luxury barges and inefficient muscle cars from the era, according to Volkswagen. In post-World War II Europe, it was inexpensive and efficient transportation. For South and Central American customers, the original Beetle became a cultural icon, until its final production at the factory in Puebla, Mexico in 2003.\nThe Type-2 VW Microbus or Transporter was another from the greatest hits catalogue that exploded in popularity in the United States and markets abroad. Both the Type-1 and Type 2 were well-built vehicles that are still sought after today and fondly remembered by essentially everyone that ever owned one. At the heart of either car is an air-cooled boxer engine that has soldiered on for decades.\nVW's long history of air cooled engines\nEngines like the Chevy Small Block, Ford 5.0, Chrysler HEMI, and Toyota 2JZ are known for power, torque, and how quickly they can propel a hunk of steel down the drag strip or around the corners of a track. The Volkswagen air-cooled engine is remembered amongst people who have owned one as reliable, easy to maintain, and as numerous as grains of sand on the beach. VW made literally tens of millions of the engine, including over 21 million in just the Beetle (via Autoweek).\nIt's difficult to nail down specific aspects of the engine's early history as sources tend to disagree on years. But the engine can be traced back to very early Volkswagen models designed with help from Ferdinand Porsche and built in the late-1930s to early 1940s in Nazi Germany. Official sources from Volkswagen are reluctant to acknowledge use of the engine or even the existence of the Beetle prior to the end of World War II.\nStill cool for decades\nIn its mid-1960s configuration, the air-cooled VW engine was a 1.2-liter boxer four cylinder that put out around 40 horsepower, according to Autoweek. But it was made in a few other displacements over the years. For the American buyers who weren't familiar with similar engines from Porsche, the air-cooled engine was a bit of an oddball. For starters, it was placed in the rear of the car and given its nature, had no radiator to speak of. The car, in this case the Beetle, was designed in such a way that air flowed over the engine and kept it relatively cool when driving.\nDespite the engine's ubiquity, air-cooled VWs are a still a hot commodity in 2023's world of water-cooled cars and new-fangled electric vehicles. The original Beetle was first offered for sale in the United States in 1949 and officially ended sales in 1977. But VW fans never got the memo, as the market is still very much alive today. Auction sites from all over the internet and car shows across the country are still packed to the brim with air-cooled VWs. When it comes to sheer longevity, the little VW has that in spades."

The flash of these old beauties can bring a moment of color to anyone's day, but as any armchair psychologist will tell you, there is a thin line between love and hate.\nFor every dozen beloved classics is an old clunker hated for its looks, speed, reliability, and historical associations. Such cars make people of a certain age grateful to drive bland econoboxes that may dull the soul but at least get them from A to B safely, reliably, and comfortably. Here are 10 classic cars that people love to hate.\nVolkswagen Beetle\nLove it or hate it, the Volkswagen Beetle is one of the most important cars in motoring history. The rather endearing little hatchback began life not in flower power California but in WWII Germany.\nIt was the early 1930s and Adolph Hitler commissioned Ferdinand Porsche to design a modest, reliable car for the masses. The engineer's response was a rear-engine, air-cooled hatchback with a low price tag, dependable performance, and a frugal engine.\nAfter the Second World War, Major Ivan Hirsh of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers brought Volkswagen back to life, and the first vehicle to run off the rebuilt production line was the Volkswagen Beetle Type I.\nIn 2003, \"Top Gear\"'s James May announced the end of the classic Beetle. May said he was \"chuffed to bits\" about this news and described the car as \"rubbish,\" explaining the hatchback's dubious history. The show built on this tongue-in-cheek displeasure in Season 10, episode 4, the \"Botswana Special\". The three presenters had to cross Botswana in classic vehicles of their choice, and if any of them failed beyond simple repairs, they would have to complete the journey in a Beetle, which they considered a disgrace.\nChevrolet Vega\nThe publicity is more evocative today than it was 50 years ago. It's the early 1970s and two Chevvies \u2014 a khaki coupe and a handsome burnt orange fastback \u2014 are set against the rugged Big Sur coast. These aren't full-fat muscle cars and that's part of the appeal. They are modest and accessible subcompacts with chromed good looks, far removed from the bulbous wind-sculpted non-entities of the modern industry. The performance of a 50-year-old economy car will almost always fall short, but it didn't disappoint motoring journalists of the day.\nAfter a test drive from Denver to Phoenix, journalist John Bond described the Chevrolet Vega as the best handling economy car he'd ever driven, adding, \"'The most impressive part of the trip was the phenomenal cornering power of the three Vegas. None of the other cars (VW Beetle, Toyota Corona, Ford Maverick) could begin to keep up on the switchbacks of the long descent out of Flagstaff.'\"\nBond wasn't alone. All writers on the trip agreed that the Vega felt \"well put together\" and \"fun to drive.\" Motor Trend even named it the car of 1971.\nDespite this, the Vega became one of Chevy's biggest flops. There was widespread rust, engine backfires, jammed throttles, temperature issues, and a rear axle with a habit of detaching. Within a year of release, at the end of 1972, up to 95% of Vega models had critical safety flaws.\nDecades later, Car and Driver named the Chevrolet Vega one of the most embarrassing award winners in automotive history.\nCadillac Cimarron\nThe Cadillac Cimarron is one of the most hated Cadillacs \u2014 especially the pre-facelift 1985 model. The luxury firm attempted to produce a subcompact in response to the 1979 energy crisis, which hiked oil prices until the mid-1980s. To achieve this, Cadillac used not the customary V8, V6, or straight six engines, but an inline-four with a pathetic 86-88 horsepower, depending on whether you had the 1.8 or 2.0-liter model. Designers complemented this tepid block with boxy styling, a cheap interior, and minimal trunk space compared to other Cadillacs.\nCadillac touted its creation as \"a new kind of Cadillac for a new kind of Cadillac owner,\" but this new consumer never arrived in meaningful numbers. Cadillac fanciers wanted the real thing \u2014 a full-fat American motor with a big engine, luxury trim, and velvet suspension. Any attempts to undercut this package and the Cadillac demo \u2014 golfers in their 50s \u2014 would migrate to the automaker's European rivals, namely Mercedes and BMW.\nThe Cimarron sold only a third of its predicted volume, and Cadillac's market share dropped through the remainder of the 20th century. Today, the Cimarron is considered one of the worst cars ever made.\nTriumph Stag\nProduced from 1970 to 1977, the Triumph Stag represented everything good and bad about the British car industry of the day. It was gorgeous and distinctive, but shoddily made and exasperatingly unreliable. The V8 convertible boasted Italian styling to compete with the best of BMW, Mercedes, and other European luxury carmakers. But Giovanni Michelotti's design and the punchy engine notes were not enough to carry this flawed offering.\nUnder the hood was a 3.0-liter cast iron block producing 145 horsepower. A modest number, you may think, but that wasn't what made this one of the worst engines ever put in a production vehicle. The real issue was its persistent overheating problem, which warped the aluminum cylinder heads and quickly rendered the Stag an ornament rather than a motor car.\nAside from a Mk II upgrade in 1973, British Leyland did little to improve its ailing flagship grand tourer \u2014 the conglomerate was already an institutional mess and headed for collapse, which it did in 1986 after over a decade of strikes and mismanagement.\nCheap second-hand Stags are best avoided today unless you have money to spend (or waste.) However, models with extensive service histories and engine mods do exist, finally capable of achieving the style and pleasure the car failed to deliver in the 1970s.\nDeLorean DMC-12\n\"Back to the Future\" may have made the DeLorean DMC-12 a pop culture icon, but in the early 1980s many considered one of the coolest cars with gullwing doors an overpriced novelty.\nThe 1985 science fiction film featured a DeLorean capable of time travel once it hit 88 mph. Iconic shots of the stainless steel sports car burning through time and space provided DeLorean with some of the best free publicity in cinematic history. Dut the decade-defining smash hit could not improve the DMC-12's second-rate engineering, something the cast and crew soon found out.\n\"As cool as it looks on film, it's by no means a performance car,\" said co-writer Bob Gale in an interview with Esquire, \"It broke down a lot, and little things on the car would break during a scene, and we'd have to wait for the FX guys to repair it.\"\nIn reality, hitting 88 mph in a DeLorean sounds like going pedal to the metal in a budget compact; the thin torque and flat notes make for an entirely underwhelming experience. With a paltry 130 horsepower charging a 2,718-pound body, what more could you reasonably expect?\nCitro\u00ebn 2CV\nThe Citroen 2CV is often compared with the Volkswagen Beetle. Unassuming and simply made, both are distinctive symbols of post-war Europe intended to bring freedom to the masses across the cities, towns, and villages of their respective countries and beyond. The 2CV was especially humble, as designer Pierre-Jules Boulanger sought to attract French farmers away from the predominant horses and carts of the era.\nLike the Beetle, the 2CV was also a counterculture icon beloved of shaggy-haired, bell-bottomed hippies. However, some aren't caught up in all the romantic modesty. Nick Rufford of the Times referred to the 2CV's \"paper-thin metal\" and \"fug of noxious fumes from its flat twin-cylinder air-cooled engine.\"\nMotoring journalist Jeremy Clarkson has made a point of hating the Citroen 2CV. \"This car is the harbinger of everything that's gone wrong in the world,\" Clarkson explained to James May in Season 4, Episode 4 of \"The Grand Tour,\" \"... it's awful.\"\nClarkson's typically bombastic style aside, his opinion speaks to the car's dubious electrics, crunching gear changes, and incredibly weak powertrain. The 2CV may be an icon of Gallic quirk, but it's also something of a lawnmower.\nAMC Pacer\nA two-door hatchback, the distinctively styled AMC Pacer entered the U.S. market in 1975 and left it just four years later on December 3, 1979. AMC described its car as \"futuristic,\" \"bold\" and \"unique,\" but widespread derision of the Pacer's wide body and large wraparound windows soon popularized \"the fish bowl\" as a leading nickname.\nThe problems were beyond the aesthetic, too. The Pacer weighed 3,000 pounds, 1,000 pounds heavier than both the Ford Pinto and the Chevrolet Chevette. A straight-six engine powered this hefty bulk, producing anywhere from 88 to 120 hp, depending on the year. A V8 model pushed the output as high as 130 hp, but no model could push beyond 103 mph or a meager 20 mpg \u2014 the Pacer was fat, slow, and thirsty.\nTime has not been kind to the Pacer. A small consolation came in 1992 when a pastel blue 1976 Pacer with a fire-spitting livery appeared in \"Wayne's World,\" but that loving nod was perhaps not quite an image booster.\nEdsel Ranger\nImposing and charismatic, the Edsel Ranger would turn many heads today with its classic '50s charm. However, historians remember the mid-century sedan as Ford's biggest flop.\nThe Ford Motor Company established Edsel as a premium brand in 1957. Confidence in Edsel was so high that Ford developed it in secret to create maximum buzz on launch day. Market research was therefore very limited and the pulse of consumer preferences almost entirely missed.\nThe launch did not go as planned. Many criticized the brand's appearance, comparing the vertical grill to a horse collar. But customers nonetheless came and Edsels sold, and that's when the real problems started.\nWhen Ford finally surveyed customers, it found that Edsels had poor welding, leaky trunks, and faulty power steering. The Teletouch shifter was difficult to service, too.\nBy 1960, after 116,000 models sold, Ford announced the Edsel's discontinuation, smashing second-hand market value and affirming the brand's failure. In total, the debacle cost Ford up to $250 million \u2014 around 2.5 billion in 2024 prices.\nA classic though the Edsel range may be today, the brand's story is best remembered as one of corporate complacency.\nChevrolet Corvair\nIn 1960, General Motors unveiled the Chevrolet Corvair, impressing the industry with its rear mounted aluminum engine, independent suspension, unibody construction, and enviable styling. The reception was so positive that Time put the Corvair on its cover and Motor Trend named it Car of the Year for 1960.\nSales were decent and peaked at 235,000 in 1965. The Corvair may have continued upwards if it wasn't for Ralph Nader's \"Unsafe at Any Speed,\" a broadside against the U.S. car industry's safety record. An activist and future presidential candidate, Nader took aim at the Corvair in the first chapter, arguing that the sedan's rear mounted engine was too heavy for the swing axles and prone to serious instability. He also noted that the Corvair's heat exchangers, which pumped warm air into the interior, was prone to rust and perforation, channelling toxic fumes into the cabin.\nGM had already superseded Nader's axel complaint regarding the 1960-63 model, but the optics proved too powerful. Corvair sales plummeted until 1969, when GM discontinued the model.\nHistorians may point to the Corvair's innovation, but the Chevy sedan will never escape the stain of \"Unsafe at Any Speed.\"\nYugo GV\nMost of these classics have at least something going for them. Maybe they are pretty, comfortable, sharp in a corner, or at least innovative in some way. Alas, none of this \u2014 or anything else positive \u2014 can be said of this slow, cheap, and abysmally made Serbian hatchback. Many feel the Yugo GV is the worst car ever sold in America.\nMaster pitch artist Malcolm Bricklin began importing the GV \u2014 meaning Good Value \u2014 in 1985 for a price of just $3,990, making it the cheapest car yet sold in the United States. Bricklin expected to sell 50,000 but sold 163,000, earning $20 million for himself.\nBricklin got rich, but what did the American people get? Well, they got 0-60 in 14 seconds and a spine rattling top speed of 86 mph. They also got no air conditioning, ugly materials, dirty emissions, wayward reliability, and dangerously poor crash tests.\nCar and Driver's technical director Csaba Csere famously wrote,\"It's obvious to me that the Yugo GV is inferior to every other car sold in America.\"\nThis was clearly not sustainable. In 1992, Yugo America went bankrupt as Yugoslavia plunged into civil war; the United Nations sanctioned the automaker, and NATO bombed its Zastavia factory in 1999.\n[ Featured Image by Mr.choppers via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY-SA 3.0 ]"

      "text": "Supercar Brands You've Probably Never Heard Of\nIn the world of supercars, the market never stands still. Every year, a new wave of startups announce their debut cars, aiming to leave their mark and become the next big success story of the auto market. And there have been plenty of success stories: Just twenty-five years ago, both Koenigsegg and Pagani were plucky startup companies that virtually no one had heard of. Now, they're heavyweights in the industry with loyal fans and overflowing order books.\nBut, for every company like Koenigsegg or Pagani, there are plenty of smaller automakers that remain in obscurity. This is for a variety of reasons, whether they're new and finding their feet or deliberately limit their production to create a sense of rarity. Sometimes they simply can't find any interested buyers. But, whatever their reason for slipping under most enthusiasts' radars, these supercar companies have remained hidden gems that few people have even heard of.\nScuderia Cameron Glickenhaus\nAmerican performance car manufacturer Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus was founded in 2004 by James Glickenhaus, a former film director who made much of his fortune working for his father's finance firm. Glickenhaus has always been a petrolhead, being the man behind one-off creations such as the Ferrari P4/5 Pininfarina. But, with SCG, he aimed to create his own range of high-performance vehicles. The company currently makes five cars, three of which are supercars.\nThe SCG003 is what the brand calls its, \"race car for the road,\" essentially being a road-legal track day toy with a 700 horsepower BMW V8 engine. The SCG007 is the brand's track-only hypercar, which raced at the 2022 Le Mans 24 Hours and earned a commendable third place overall. SCG plans to make a limited run of road-legal SCG007s, but there's no word on when that will happen. Finally, there's the SCG004, a three-seater supercar with 650 horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission. The car was confirmed as being ready for delivery in June 2022.\nMazzanti\nHailing from Tuscany, Italy, Mazzanti Automobili produces just one car, the Evantra, first released in \"Millecavalli\" form (that's 1,000 horsepower to non-Italian speakers), then in 2021, in \"Pura\" form. The Evantra Pura still makes 751 horsepower though, so it's no slouch. Considering the car is hand-built in Tuscany, Italy, in strictly limited numbers, most people would expect the car to come with an equally exotic powerplant. But this piece of exclusive Italian metal has a very American heart: a good ol' Chevy 6.2L LS V8.\nThe car only weighs 2,820 lbs, so it's good for a top speed of 223 mph and a 0-62 mph time of just 2.9 seconds. Mazzanti is reportedly limiting Evantra Pura production to just five units per year, so buyers can rest assured that they will have one of the rarest supercars on the market. Many supercar startups fold within their first few years of coming to market, but Mazzanti has been around for 20 years now, having seemingly found its niche: combining exclusive Italian design with mainstream American power.\nPuritalia\nAnother Italian brand that's slipped under the radar of most enthusiasts is Puritalia, whose debut is the Berlinetta. It's a 965-horsepower hybrid super-GT, which will be limited to a maximum production run of 150 units. The car debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in 2019, and the reaction to the car's design was generally very positive. However, Puritalia has so far remained tight-lipped about the number of customers on its pre-order list.\nOver the last 10 years, hybrids have evolved to become mainstream, with most major manufacturers now offering at least one hybrid model in their lineup. Even traditionally conservative brands like Ferrari now offer plug-in hybrid supercars, with the SF90 Stradale pairing a high-revving V8 with three electric motors. As a fledgling startup, Puritalia has a lot to prove, but it seems like there's plenty of demand in the market for driver-centric hybrid supercars. So, if the brand can deliver a car that's as good to drive as it looks, Puritalia is a name to watch out for in the future.\nOrca\nOrca Engineering was a short-lived supercar startup from Switzerland that only produced one car, the C113. The car was revealed in production form at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show, and originally, a run of 99 units was planned. It's not clear exactly how many C113s ended up being produced, but it was clearly a lot less than the company expected, as they went bankrupt just a few years after the car launched.\nThe C113 boasted some highly impressive performance figures for its era, with Orca claiming that the car could sprint from 0-60 mph in less than three seconds, and topped out at 224 mph, according to Ultimate Car Page. Extensive use of carbon fiber kept the car's weight down to just 1,873 lbs, and its construction was modular, which it was claimed would make maintenance significantly easier than on a standard supercar. Unfortunately, few buyers were interested in this unique-looking creation. The company's founder, Ralph Beck, went on to unveil another supercar in 2008, called the Beck LM800.\nArash\nNamed after the company's founder, Arash Farboud, Arash Motor Company is a small British manufacturer based in Suffolk, UK. The company was originally founded in 1999 as Farboud Ltd but became known as Arash in 2006. According to its website, Arash currently makes the AF8 and AF10 supercars, with three new models in development. The AF8 is the entry-level supercar, with a 550 horsepower 7.0L V8 engine that can reportedly push the car to a top speed of over 200 mph. The AF10 is considered Arash's flagship model, with a 900-horsepower gasoline engine and four electric motors making 1,180 horsepower, for a total output of 2,080 horsepower.\nEach of the five motors has its own gearbox, but despite this complicated setup, the car's claimed performance figures are relatively standard for a modern supercar. 0-60 mph reportedly arrives in under three seconds, and the car's top speed is simply \"more than 201 mph.\" That begs the question of whether Arash couldn't have achieved the same levels of performance with a simpler setup. While Arash's founder confirmed that a very small number of production AF8s have been sold, the AF10 has been labeled \"vaporware\" by Road & Track, as there is no proof that a production version has ever existed.\nPicasso\nIn sharp contrast to the far-out claims of Arash, Swiss supercar startup Picasso has stuck firmly to tried-and-tested components for its first car, the 660 LMS. The production-ready version of the car was unveiled at the Top Marques Monaco show in June 2022, and it's built to excel on the track and the road. It features a mid-mounted turbocharged V6 engine that produces 651 horsepower and 531 lb-ft of torque, plenty of power considering the car weighs just 2,160 lbs.\nRather than designing everything in-house, Picasso partnered with a number of established engineering firms to develop many of the car's mechanical components. Italian engine specialists Autotecnica Motori supplies the car's 3.0L aluminum motor, Sadev supplies the six-speed transmission, and Pirelli developed bespoke tires specifically for the car. Production hasn't started yet, but with such an impressive list of technical partners and a number of customers reportedly already on the order books, Picasso seems to be in a very strong position to bring the 660 LMS to a wider market soon.\nFalcon\nAmerican engineer and designer Jeff Lemke launched Falcon Motorsports in 2009, and production of the brand's only model, the F7, began in 2013. Quite fittingly, only seven examples of the car have been built, although this reportedly wasn't a deliberate choice but rather, it was that very few people actually wanted to buy one. The car features an LS V8 sourced from a Chevrolet Corvette Z06, but thanks to some upgrades from Lingenfelter, it makes 620 horsepower and 585 lb-ft of torque.\nFor an undisclosed additional fee, buyers were able to add a twin-turbo package that upped the total horsepower output to 1,100 horsepower. Motor1 reports that the base-spec car retailed for around $250,000 when new, but when one of the seven examples came up for sale in 2021, it only reached a maximum bid of $122,000. It seems there simply isn't much demand for this ultra-rare all-American supercar, even at less than half its original retail price.\nRadford\nA modern resurrection of a classic British brand, Radford only officially relaunched in the summer of 2021, but it's already shown off its first production car at the 2022 Goodwood Festival of Speed. The Type 62/2 is based on a Lotus Exige S but features entirely bespoke bodywork, a number of chassis upgrades, and a completely unique interior. Plus, in top-spec form, it comes with a 600-horsepower supercharged V6 in the engine bay.\nThe company is co-owned by 2009 F1 champion Jensen Button, who reportedly provided much of the funding to help get the project off the ground. The Type 62/2 is limited to just 62 units, which will be split between the top-spec John Player Special, the middle-tier Gold Leaf, and the base-spec Standard trims. The car's retro-modern design takes inspiration from the Ford GT40, which the original incarnation of Radford helped to design in the Sixties. It's not easy to get a reboot like this right, but Jensen Button's Radford revival seems to have done the original company justice.\nGinetta\nLow-volume British automaker Ginetta has been making cup racing cars for several decades now, but in 2019, they showed off something a little different. The Akula debuted at the Geneva Motor Show as a 200 mph Ferrari rival, with a starting price of \u00a3340,000 ($414,000). Production of the car has been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but in a statement sent to British magazine Autocar in June 2022, the company promised that the Akula was still coming soon.\nIt's fair to say that the Akula isn't the prettiest of supercars, but that's because its distinctive styling was optimized purely for aerodynamics rather than looks. The car's chassis and body panels are made entirely from carbon fiber, and Autocar reports that its engine was designed in-house, shaped by Ginetta's decades of racing experience. It makes roughly 600 horsepower and 520 lb-ft of torque, yet the car only weighs 2,535 lbs. Hopefully, the Akula will make it onto the roads and into the hands of customers soon.\nBaltasar\nMost electric vehicle startups flooding the market at the moment are developing high-margin SUVs or luxury vehicles, but Spanish newcomer Baltasar is not like the rest. In 2021, the brand unveiled the Revolt, an all-electric track day toy that's also fully road legal. It has two electric motors that drive the rear wheels, making a combined 500 horsepower. That figure might seem quite modest, but considering the whole car weighs just 1,697 lbs \u2014 including batteries \u2014 it's enough to propel it to face-melting levels of performance.\nFrom a standstill, the Revolt can reach 62 mph in just 2.5 seconds, although there's no word yet on what the car's top speed is. Its battery can reportedly hold enough charge for 40 minutes of flat-out track time or up to 373 miles of range at road-legal speeds. Design-wise, it boasts hints of the Renault Spider in its exterior styling. There are a few quirks: the car's charging port is located on the passenger's side of the dashboard, rather than on the outside of the car like usual. There's also no padding at all on the carbon-fiber seats, which will presumably make driving down uneven public roads a rather uncomfortable experience.\nLotec\nIn 1990, an unnamed businessman from the UAE contacted German racing car manufacturer Lotec and asked for the fastest car in the world. With the promise of a blank check, Lotec began developing the car in 1991, and by 1995, the C1000 was finished. It featured a 5.6L Mercedes twin-turbocharged V8 engine that made over 1,000 horsepower. According to Motor1, Lotec claimed the car had a 0-62 mph time of just 3.2 seconds, and a top speed of 268 mph. The C1000 was strictly a one-off, but at a development cost of $3.4 million, it's not like many other buyers could have afforded one anyway.\nCreating the C1000 gave Lotec owner Kurt Lotterschmid the supercar bug, and shortly after development finished, he set about building a follow-up. By 2001, the brand's next car, the Sirius, was unveiled. It was planned that five units a year would be created, each car selling for $462,000. The Sirius featured a mid-mounted Mercedes V12 making 850 horsepower, with many of the car's internals derived from Lotec's racing parts bin. It was a similar recipe to the Pagani Zonda, which launched just a few years prior, and shared the same engine. However, unlike Pagani, Lotec couldn't drum up much interest in its ultra-expensive supercar, and only one example of the Sirius ended up being built.\nWiesmann\nGerman automaker Wiesmann's cars all follow a simple formula: a light curb weight, a distinctive dual-headlight design, and a powerful BMW engine under the hood. The brand's first car, the MF3 Roadster, rolled off the production line in 1993. Production of the MF line of cars continued until 2014, when a series of financial issues hit the company. Wiesmann was forced to shut its doors and declare bankruptcy, but was bought out by a group of investors shortly after.\nIn 2022, the company unveiled two brand new supercars, codenamed \"Project Thunderball\" and \"Project Gecko.\" While Project Gecko is essentially a continuation of the MF production cars, with a BMW V8 under the hood and a similar design, Project Thunderball is something a little different. It no longer features a signature Bavarian powerplant, instead making the switch to electrification. Wiesmann is one of the first low-volume supercar makers to create a fully-electric vehicle, so Project Thunderball will definitely be one to watch when more details are revealed.\nB Engineering\nBugatti has a storied past, but one of its most interesting forgotten chapters has to do with the events that unfolded after the company went bankrupt in the mid-1990s. There were a lot of leftover Bugatti EB110 chassis and engines lying around the factory, so a plan was hatched to make a continuation supercar with them. A new company, B Engineering, was formed by a group of ex-Bugatti engineers, and a new supercar called the Edonis was designed.\nAlthough the Edonis retained the EB110's carbon fiber chassis and V12 engine, most of the other components were completely re-engineered. B Engineering planned to sell 21 examples of the car for \u20ac760,000 each (close to $1 million at the time), but they never reached that goal. Only a few examples were ever created, and the project ran out of money in 2006. Autoweek reported in 2018 that a revival might be on the cards, as an American engineering outfit announced a partnership with B Engineering to complete the rest of the run. That said, since the initial announcement, there has been no further news.\nRezvani\nRezvani is perhaps best known for its outrageous bulletproof super-SUV, the Tank, but it also makes a supercar called the Beast. Various incarnations of the Beast have been unveiled over the past five years, but the latest is a 1,000-horsepower, carbon fiber-clad machine that's only been shown off in a shadowy teaser image so far. The previous iteration, pictured, was called the Beast Alpha X Blackbird. It was based on the Lotus Elise and featured a 700 horsepower engine, with a curb weight of just 2,150 lbs.\nThere's no word yet on whether the latest Beast will also be based on the Elise, but a full reveal is slated for sometime in summer 2022. Despite its high-performance engine and carbon fiber bodywork, the Beast is very reasonably priced in supercar terms. The cheapest version starts at just $95,000, with even the top-spec Alpha X Blackbird coming in at $225,000. That's about the same price as a new Ferrari Roma, but with the Blackbird, buyers get an extra 100 horsepower and a much rarer car.\nBolwell\nIt might be unheard of outside of Australia, but the Bolwell brand holds a special place in Aussie performance car history. Founder Graeme Bolwell cut his teeth working at Lotus, and retained close ties to the British company after he'd left. The first Bolwell car was called the Nagari, and it featured a Ford 302 V8 mounted onto a lightweight chassis, with composite body panels used to keep weight to a minimum. It was, in a sense, much like a Lotus, albeit with a distinctly Aussie twist.\nIn 2019, Bolwell announced plans to pay tribute to the original Nagari by launching a new generation of the car, the Nagari 500. It's powered by an LS3 V8 making 500 horsepower, but New Atlas reports that Bolwell is quite happy to increase that figure significantly should a buyer want to. Instead of composite, the new car uses carbon fiber to keep weight to a minimum. In June 2020, Bolwell confirmed that development was in the testing phase, but since then, the project seems to have gone quiet.\nGillet\nOn the other side of the world from Bolwell, Belgium's only carmaker \u2014 Gillet \u2014 has been quietly churning out supercars for 30 years. The brand's signature model is the Vertigo, and despite its obscurity, it has a serious racing pedigree. An early incarnation of the car won the G2 class of the FIA GT World Championship for three consecutive years between 2006 and 2008. Then, more recently in 2018, a Vertigo driven by the daughter of F1 legend Jacky Ickx achieved a sub-11 minute time at Pikes Peak.\nAs well as manufacturing its own supercars, Gilet also supplies rolling chassis for low-volume coach-built cars. The ultra-limited Zagato Maserati Mostro is based on the chassis of a Gillet Vertigo 5 Sprint (pictured), and the Alfa Romeo Zagato TZ3 is also built on a Vertigo chassis. All very impressive for a company that, despite being around for three decades now, most enthusiasts will have never heard of."

      "text": "Everything Classic Car Fans Should Know About The Tucker 48\nMany times in the post-war era, a visionary carmaker has come along with plans to offer a car so unique and innovative that no legacy automaker could offer anything like it. The DeLorean Motor Company comes to mind as one of these projects that ended in disaster but left us with a phenomenal machine. Tesla could have easily become just another story but managed to beat the odds. But before both of those brands rolled into our collective consciousness, there was the Tucker Corporation and its cutting-edge Tucker 48 sedan.\nThe brainchild of Michigander Preston Tucker, the Tucker 48 was to become the car of the future, offering features nobody had thought of with the style, class, and quality everyone wanted. It was an upstart company looking to get in on the frenzied redevelopment boom of the years immediately following WWII, an era deprived of new car models while the nation's industries were occupied with turning out equipment to send \"over there.\" Coming out of the war, the United States was in the best position globally to unleash its industry on a waiting consumer class with an abundance of pent-up demand.\nSadly, longevity would not come to the Tucker Corporation as the project ended in failure. What it did leave us with is a fascinating story and 51 captivating sedans. The Tucker 48 embodies the spirit of hope of the post-war era, and if you are a classic car fan, here is everything you should know about it.\nPreston Tucker\nFor a child growing up in Michigan in the early 20th century, working in the automobile industry probably seemed only natural. Preston Thomas Tucker, born in 1903 in Capac, Michigan, began working in the Cadillac offices of General Motors at just 13 years old. As he entered his 20s, Tucker bounced around a few jobs until he discovered his natural talent for sales, excelling at moving Studebakers and Chryslers and raising his profile enough to become a zone manager for Pierce-Arrow.\nTucker's sales experience led him to develop an entrepreneurial spirit, establishing a few businesses before building a car company. With a partner who had been instrumental in the early success of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Tucker persuaded Henry Ford to sponsor a racing team with 10 advanced design cars to race in 1935. Ford's initial capital expenditure of $25,000 soon turned into $117,000, only to have just four cars qualify and none of them finish the race. The experience soured Ford so much that he swore off racing sponsorship for good.\nTucker had a machine shop behind his home in Michigan and he used it to contribute to the war effort in the early '40s. But as the war appeared to be nearing an end, he set his sights on building a new automobile, establishing the Tucker Corporation in July 1946 despite having little experience managing an auto manufacturer or being an industrialist. Furthermore, Tucker was not a wealthy individual, meaning any new business venture would require someone else's money. Preston Tucker was ambitious if nothing else.\n[Featured image by The Tucker Automobile Club of America via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY-SA 2.5]\nTucker development before WWII\nWhile recovering from an appendectomy, Tucker envisioned an armored vehicle he could build for the military. After securing a deal for its manufacture, he offered it to the Dutch military, but that fell through on account of Germany invading the Netherlands. With conflict in Europe rapidly expanding, he turned to the United States Army and delivered it for evaluation.\nDubbed the Tucker Tiger Tank, it was in reality an armored car with some novel features. It was a narrow vehicle running on large tires with a passenger compartment that was both bulletproof and air-conditioned. Power came from a Packard engine, and it was armed with a cannon in a unique electric-powered turret. Thanks to its V12 engine, the 10,750-pound vehicle was extraordinarily quick, with a top speed claimed to be up to 100 mph.\nUltimately, the Army passed on the Tiger. Some officials claimed it was too fast and believed no military vehicle should exceed 35 mph. However, the turret was something the Army was looking for. He received a development contract but ultimately failed to close a deal on production. His design subsequently appeared on military vehicles, so Tucker tried to assert his patent rights, but failed going up against the United States government.\nIntroducing the Tucker automobile\nFrom the start, the Tucker was meant to be something different from conventional offerings. The exterior styling was largely conventional and followed the latest trends, although the Cyclops headlight made it stand apart. It was everywhere else that it departed from the norm.\nThe Tucker sedan was built atop a perimeter frame with a rear engine setup allowing for a low and flat floorboard. The engine was originally built for use in helicopters. Tucker was under pressure to find an engine that would work, discovering that Air Cooled Engines built flat-6 Franklin helicopter engines that were nearly perfect for the car. However, they were air-cooled and that would never work for a proper road car. Tucker engineers managed to re-engineer the Franklins with water cooling, giving birth to the Tucker flat-6, a 5.4-liter engine fed by a single carburetor making 166 horsepower.\nIts suspension was also innovative and novel. The independent suspension, an unheard-of feature in its time, utilized control arms for all four wheels attached to the frame using Torsilastic rubber torque tubes, meaning there were no metal springs and relatively few parts. It was also planned to have disc brakes, but those were dropped in favor of traditional drums, likely due to high cost.\nPriority on safety\nMany safety features were to be standard on every Tucker, something few automakers concerned themselves with. The Cyclops headlight turned with the front wheels to illuminate into turns. The shatterproof glass windshield was made to pop out in case of impact and the dashboard was padded. Inside was a \"safety chamber\" that the driver and passenger could dive into during a collision, although its efficacy remains questionable. The perimeter frame also integrated a built-in roll bar to offer superior occupant protection in a sort of cage structure.\nAll controls were in close reach to the driver, and the steering column was meant to be a collapsible design for which Preston Tucker had a patent, but surplus columns from the 1941 Lincoln ended up being used on the 51 cars built. The doors extended into the roof to offer ample room for entry, and the front doors included glove boxes to keep the dash free from obstructions.\nThe drivetrain of the car is bolted onto the frame using just six bolts. Tucker's vision for service was to have loaner engines on hand that could be swapped out in 30 minutes to keep customers from having to leave their car at the dealer while waiting for repairs. Preston Tucker had originally developed a two-point seat belt and wanted to offer it on his car, but they were nixed for marketing purposes. The prevailing attitude was that the inclusion of seat belts would indicate the inherent danger of the car and turn away buyers.\n[Featured image by sicnag via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY 2.0]\nPrototype engine\nTucker initially wanted an original engine design. With some novel parameters, he came up with one and built three prototypes, but they turned out to be unworkable for several reasons.\nThe engine was innovative in theory but a failure in practice. Tucker had surplus pistons from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress in the factory and designed the engine to accommodate them. These huge pistons gave it a 5-inch bore and stroke, resulting in a displacement of a whopping 589 cubic inches. An ingenious hydraulic valve system used a clever oil distributor to send pressurized oil to a piston actuating each valve. It was driven by the crank and sent oil to each valve in time, requiring no camshaft and no head gaskets. Tucker wanted an engine that couldn't be burned up, where if, for example, something cracked the oil pan causing oil loss, the lack of pressure would kill the engine before any damage occurred. However, it also made starting difficult, requiring 24 volts to build enough pressure to get it started, making it generally unusable in an era of 6-volt automobiles.\nThere was no transmission. The engine had a torque converter attached to both sides, connected directly to the wheels, allowing you to ease onto the accelerator while it built torque to full speed. This also was clever, but made reverse impossible without spinning the engine backward. It was also lightweight and mounted low, but these advantages were dwarfed by the major disadvantages, leading to a somewhat frantic search for a replacement.\nThe Tuckermatic\nTucker also came up with an automatic transmission that was \u2014 like his original engine design \u2014 different from everything else on the market. The dual torque converter direct drive proved unworkable, but even on the new Tuckermatic transmission, there were still two torque converters \u2014 technically known as fluid coupling.\nGearing for the Tuckermatic used a planetary gear design with options only for forward or reverse. One converter sat between the engine and transmission allowing the engine to idle when stopped just like traditional automatics. The second converter was located at the rear of the unit and turned into a variable-speed transmission by slipping at low speeds, fully engaging only at cruising speeds. It made the power delivery feel very loose and vague up until 30 mph, when it hooked up more directly and got better as speed increased. It would have made city driving a bit unpleasant.\nTo get production rolling, transmission from the front-wheel-drive Cord was used. In the Cord, the transmission sat in front of the engine spinning the front wheels, and became a perfect solution for the Tucker, where it did the same thing to the rear wheels. This was also an electro-pneumatic preselector-style unit. Drivers moved a small selector on the steering column to the next desired gear and when the clutch was depressed, it automatically shifted to the selected gear. Neither transmission was very robust, and only one Tuckermatic installed in a car exists.\nFinancing a dream\nThat financing the manufacturing of automobiles requires huge sums of cash is no surprise to anyone, even in the '40s. Tucker had done well for himself but he was no wealthy industrialist like Howard Hughes or Henry J. Kaiser, so he needed to raise a lot of money to get his car built. To overcome this major problem, Tucker devised a couple of novel methods of raising capital that would seem mostly commonplace today but ruffled feathers back then and led to his eventual downfall.\nTucker was the only bidder on a decommissioned wartime plant used by Dodge and administered by the War Assets Administration (WAA) in 1946. He was to pay $1 million for the first two years' rent and $2.4 million annually thereafter. After failing to meet the deadline and an extension of the deadline, the WAA handed him an ultimatum to make the payment by July 1, 1947, but also that he must provide a $15 million escrow to continue the lease through renewal. With such an incredible burden suddenly forced upon him, he had to act fast and with cleverness.\nTucker accessory pre-sales\nOpting against a bank loan that would prevent him from having full control of the company, Tucker started raising funds by pre-selling dealership licenses. This raised suspicion with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but the practice violated no rules, although Tucker was required to add language stating the financial risk of a purchase. The next round of financing came from a traditional stock offering with the approval of the SEC. The stock raised $15 million, but that was $5 million short of what Tucker needed to get production started and pay for the factory. Having few options to raise additional funds, Tucker came up with an inventive plan that, while commonplace today, brought negative attention and spurious accusations, leading to the downfall of the Tucker Corporation.\nAccessory sales were to be a part of the business from the start. Knowing buyers will want options included in their new cars, Tucker began offering accessory pre-sales. Customers could order a package of options for a new Tucker such as the one that included a radio, seat covers, and luggage for $200. These buyers would also receive priority in delivery of the new cars when they became available. This brought the attention of the Justice Department, which investigated him for mail fraud for the practice of selling products that did not yet exist. Today, you might recognize this as a Kickstarter campaign.\nIndictments\nScandal erupted as Preston Tucker and seven associates were indicted on charges of mail fraud and SEC regulations violations. This poured onto the flurry of sensational news reporting surrounding the project, raising suspicions and spreading rumors about Tucker's motives. Issues with prototypes and the altering of plans for the cars had already contributed to the public perception, and an impending trial exacerbated it.\nA months-long trial commenced towards the end of 1949. Many seemingly salacious details came out in court, poring over expenditures and the operations of the fledgling manufacturer. The government tried to prove that Tucker never intended to sell any cars, while the defense argued that anything perceived as untoward was merely the trials and failures of starting a business. In January of 1950, 12 jurors deliberated for nearly 29 hours before delivering a verdict of \"not guilty.\"\nWhile Tucker and the other defendants were elated over the verdict, the company was done. The Tucker Corporation had entered bankruptcy during the drawn-out legal episode. Tucker often blamed others for his demise \u2014 he once wrote an open letter to auto industry heads accusing them of sabotaging his efforts \u2014 but the truth is that starting a car company is hard and very expensive. No evidence exists of direct sabotage by auto executives, although it's entirely possible they exerted some undue influence on government officials. Ultimately, historians have concluded, per Hemmings, that the $26 million raised was about $74 million short of what was needed to succeed. Tucker was simply undercapitalized.\nTucker: The Man and His Dream\nAmong the people who lost money buying stock in the Tucker Corporation was Carmine Coppola, father of the future Academy Award-winning \"The Godfather\" director Francis Ford Coppola. This must have left a lasting impression on the young Coppola, as he later turned the story of Preston Tucker's bid to change the auto industry into a feature film starring Jeff Bridges called \"Tucker: The Man and His Dream.\" Furthermore, while this film came out in 1988, Coppola had wanted to make a film based on Tucker with Marlon Brando in the lead role as early as 1974.\nCoppola cast Jeff Bridges as Tucker and brought in George Lucas as executive producer. Coppola uses Bridges' performance to showcase just how flamboyant, affable, and optimistic Preston Tucker was, and how these qualities contributed to his ability to sell people on an idea, especially one he fully believed in, such as his car. While the film is based on real events, it is clear that Coppola has taken a stance on them as it leans heavily into the ideas that industry forces and the media conspired with the government against Tucker to see his demise, rather than the company simply being woefully underfunded.\nDespite some discrepancies in the storytelling, \"Tucker\" is a great film that maintains a mostly true retelling of the Tucker automobile and its creator. The film spawned three Oscar nominations and a Golden Globe win, but only grossed $19 million on a budget of $23 million.\nModern collectibles\nThe story of Preston Tucker and his car is a captivating tale, and the cars he built remain interesting time capsules of American ingenuity. Partially because of the story, and partially because the cars were so innovative, an original Tucker 48 seems to draw more interest than just about any other failed automotive startup. The cars are attractively styled and they were genuinely innovative for their day, and with 47 of the 51 built remaining today, you could either say we are fortunate they were built or that it is sad so few exist.\nNo matter how you feel about a Tucker, they have become extraordinarily valuable today. Many of them are housed in museums, including The Cammack Tucker Collection at the AACA Museum and even the Toyota Automobile Museum in Japan. Others are in private hands, although they do not come up for sale often. A 1948 Tucker was sold on January 13, 2024 by Mecum Auctions with a winning bid of $1.8 million, but the record bid for a Tucker happened in 2012. A Tucker sold for $2.6 million at a Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale.\nThe legacy of the Tucker automobile will keep interest in the existing cars high for years to come. While only a lucky few will have the opportunity to experience one first-hand, the twin grandsons of Preston Tucker run the YouTube channel Preston Tucker's Speed Shop, producing videos sharing a wealth of information about the cars. It is worth checking out."

      "text": "2025 Porsche 911 Carrera T Is A 388 Horsepower Manual-Only Treat For Purists\nPorsche is once again catering to manual transmission enthusiasts and is ready to serve them on the 911's legacy platter. The latest from the German carmaker is the 2025 Porsche 911 Carrera T, which is only available in a six-speed manual gearbox configuration, offering the familiar 388 hp 3.0-liter twin-turbo boxer engine from the mainline Carrera \u2014 that's a tad more than the 371 hp offered by the 2023 model we reviewed and the 379 hp available in the 2024 model year.\nNotably, Porsche has drawn technical inspiration from the Type 992.1 Carrera's manual seven-speed kit (which we detail in our Carrera T first-drive experience), and applied the same transmission ratio to its latest rides. To send home the message that the 911 Carrera T is truly special \u2014 and it better be, after a wallet hit worth $134,000 at the minimum \u2014 Porsche has kitted the shift stick with a special walnut ball handle.\nOf course, the many things that make a manual transmission worth learning are just one side of owning a signature Porsche \u2014 having that enthusiast sensation of precision control with the added benefit of an open-air driving experience is the ultimate icing on the cake. To that end, Porsche will hawk the 911 Carrera T in both Cabriolet and Coupe formats.\nThe Sport Chrono kit is the new standard, and comes armed with a dial integrated into the steering wheel, offering direct switching facility for a quartet of ride modes. Porsche will also bless buyers with a Sport Exhaust system, four-way power-adjustable heated seats, Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), and Porsche Torque Vectoring for next-level cornering experience, as the standard goodies.\nEnough to stand out, without dropping the legacy looks\nThe 911 Carrera T in its Coupe form boasts a peak speed of 183 mph, and can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.3 seconds. For the Cabriolet, those figures stand only a hair slower at 182 mph and 4.5 seconds. Pre-orders for both models are now live, and Porsche will commence deliveries next summer.\n\"The 911 Carrera T was conceived as a purist car and represents a reference to the 911 T sold from 1968 to 1973,\" says the company. For the 911 Carrera T, Porsche has lowered the suspension platform, enhanced the braking performance by using larger discs, updated six-piston fixed calipers, and revised the aerodynamic profile, as well. Coming to the aesthetics, there's plenty of bold and subtle tweaks to make the new Carrera T stand out.\nPorsche has draped the wheels, branding decals, and mirror covers in a fresh Vanadium Grey Metallic paint job. There are special stickers to sell the manual transmission charm on the side windows, and a two-tone paint job for the 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels.\nThere's also a special design package on the table that puts Gentian Blue accents on the wheels and doors, among other elements. The sober color options such as white and black are here to stay, but for those willing to take the plunge, Porsche will offer the 911 Carrera T in bold choices such as Cartagena Yellow Metallic and Shade Green Metallic. Notably, buyers get a no-cost optional upgrade to rear seats for the Coupe trim, even though it comes in a two-seater format as a standard choice."

      "text": "10 BMWs That Everyone Forgot Existed\nBMW can trace its roots all the way back to 1916, when it was founded as an aircraft engine manufacturer aiding the German war effort. It produced its first automobile in 1929, and in the decades since then, the brand has been responsible for some of the world's most globally-recognized car models. It has grown to be the seventh-largest carmaker in the world by revenue, and its cars are sold in every major market. But, for every BMW that has carved itself into the global automotive consciousness, there are plenty more models from the German brand that have been simply forgotten about.\nOften, these forgotten cars are low-volume specials or one-offs, but in a few cases, cars that were commercially very popular back in their day have fallen into obscurity over time. Plus, the company's back catalog also includes plenty of overlooked concepts that never made it to production, but deserve their place in the brand's history all the same. With the Bavarians now focused on transitioning their lineup to EVs, it seems likely that a fresh wave of models is destined to end up consigned to the archives. So, it's a good time to take a look at 10 BMWs that most people will have already forgotten ever existed.\nBMW Nazca M12\nThe only true production supercar that BMW has ever made is the M1, but it has come close to building a successor a number of times. In 1991, the company showed off one of those potential successors at the Geneva Motor Show, called the Nazca M12. The car was the debut creation of Fabrizio Giugiaro, son of the founder of Italdesign, Giorgetto Giugiaro. The car was powered by a 5.0L V12 engine, the same one also featured in the production 750i and 850i at the time. It's thought to have produced around 300 horsepower and was mid-mounted for better weight distribution.\nThe public reaction to the prototype was very positive, and BMW followed it up with two further prototypes, according to BMW Group Classic. Those prototypes were the Nazca C2 (unveiled in 1992), and the C2 Spider (unveiled in 1993). Despite praise for all three cars, BMW never put the Nazca into series production. It did, however, allow Italdesign to build a second version of the M12 for one particularly influential buyer, the Sultan of Brunei. As with many of the Sultan's cars, the details are hazy, but it's thought that he bought at least one M12 for his personal collection, perhaps several. According to Top Gear, a Sultan-owned M12 was listed for sale in 2011 with a price on request only, but it's not known whether the car was ever sold.\nBMW 3200 CS\nThe 3200 CS was the successor to the popular BMW 503, and it was developed during a period of great change for the company. As BMW Group Classic notes, the styling tropes of the '50s were rapidly being seen as outdated by the time the 3200 CS debuted in 1960, and so an entirely new design was needed for BMW's cars to stay relevant. The 3200 CS did not disappoint, with Bertone-designed coachwork that impressed critics and the public alike. It also remains the only production BMW to have been partially built at Bertone. The bodies were created at the Italian factory and then transported by rail to Munich for final construction.\nThe car was one of the first to feature the CS initials, which stands for Clubsport and which later developed into a sub-line of lightweight, performance-focused sports cars in its own right. It was also one of the first with the Hofmeister Kink, a design feature that has now become synonymous with BMW's cars. According to Secret Classics, it's thought that just 50 examples of the car remain on the road today, out of an initial production run of roughly 600 units.\nBMW Z1\nBMW's Z4 roadster is today a staple in their lineup, with the latest generation being developed in conjunction with the fifth-generation Toyota Supra. But, the entire existence of the Z line of cars was down to chance, as the first iteration, the Z1, was only ever intended to be a design study. A very positive public reaction to the Z1 concept convinced BMW to make a limited run of Z1 production cars, to test if there would be a market for a sporty German roadster. Auto Express reports that the car was very different to the brand's other offerings at the time, being both characterful and quirky, a far cry from the serious, technically-minded cars on offer elsewhere in the brand's lineup.\nThe car was a sales hit, and all 8,000 Z1s were quickly snapped up. Apart from its unusual styling, one of the most famous features of the Z1 is its sliding doors, which slide downwards into the lower sill. It remains a unique feature to this day, with BMW never having produced another system like it since. The car is a fun, offbeat novelty, but its lack of performance prowess compared to other high-end BMWs from the era, like the E30 M3 and E28 M5, has meant that the Z1 has largely slipped into obscurity. However, the car does have a niche fan base, and Auto Express reports that the vast majority of the car's original production run are still on the road today.\nBMW 700\nLaunched in 1959, the BMW 700 succeeded the 600, which had been nicknamed the \"Big Isetta\" thanks to its visual similarities with the famous microcar. In comparison to the bulbous, pod-like proportions of the 600, the 700 was a much more refined affair, with pared-back styling and a traditional three-box design. From the car's shape, it might look like the engine sits at the front of the car, but it was in fact at the rear. Instead, a spacious \"frunk\" was built into the front end, which gave it an impressive amount of luggage capacity for its size.\nThe Sport version of the 700 was the most desirable, with 40 horsepower on tap from its 697cc two-cylinder engine. For its time, it was decently quick, and BMW Group Classic reports that the car won several high-profile national races in Germany, including the Hillclimb Championship in 1960. In total, 182,211 examples of the car were built across five years, but only a few remain on the road today.\nBMW Z3 M Coupe\nThe Z line of cars have been developed from their inception as roadsters, but during the Z3's production run, a limited number of coupes were also sold. The car was developed from the Z3 M Roadster, and it's sometimes simply referred to as the M Coupe. The fact that the Z3 was designed first and foremost as a roadster is the reason for the Coupe's unusual styling, and thanks to its oddly-shaped rear end, it picked up the nickname, the \"clown shoe.\" According to BMWBlog, the car was developed in secret by BMW engineers, and when it was first presented to the company's executives, they were not impressed. However, after driving the car, they agreed to sign off on a limited production run.\nThe car made up to 325 horsepower from a six-cylinder engine that had been borrowed from the E36 M3 Evolution, and had a top speed of 155 mph. BMWBlog reports that it was regarded as one of the best driver's cars of its era, even if its high asking price and divisive looks limited its appeal. In total, it's thought that only 2,858 M Coupes were ever built, out of a total of 297,088 units of the Z3 overall.\nBMW E1\nBMW bid farewell to the i3 in the US in 2021 thanks to slow sales, and the car is set to be axed altogether in 2022. The car was famously BMW's first production EV and one of their only city cars in living memory. However, it wasn't their first EV, as that title belongs to the prototype E1, which was essentially an i3 prototype built two decades before the production vehicle went on sale. The car debuted in 1992 and had a claimed 155 miles of range, which is almost identical to the modern i3's range. However, it only had 45 horsepower, meaning 0-50 mph took 18.0 seconds, according to Autocar.\nFor its era, it was remarkably forward-thinking in its construction as well as its powertrain, with a lightweight aluminum chassis and plastic body panels. The interior was also very minimalist, with buttons and switches removed wherever possible, a design philosophy that's now been made famous by EV giant Tesla. Autocar reports that the car was developed in response to a Californian government mandate that at least 2% of cars sold in the state had to be zero-emissions by 1998. But, as that initiative was scrapped, BMW saw no reason to continue developing the E1, and so it was shelved until the renewed interest in electric cars in the late '00s led to the development of the production i3.\nBMW Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coupe\nSince buying Rolls-Royce from VW in 1998, BMW has not developed any ultra-high-end luxury cars under its main brand. However, it gave fans a glimpse of what a Bentley-rivaling BMW might look like in 2013, with the Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coupe. The car was only built as a one-off, designed to impress the guests at the Villa D'Este Concours event on the shores of Lake Como, Italy. It's a V12-powered, luxurious grand tourer, and as its name suggests, the design of the car was handled by the famed Italian design house, Pininfarina.\nApart from being one of the most visually striking BMWs of recent years, the car also made use of a number of exclusive materials to set it apart from other concept vehicles. The interior wood inserts, for example, were made from fossilized material that had been extracted from an ancient New Zealand swamp. The wood was certified as being 48,000 years old through carbon dating. The leather in the car was hand-selected by craftsmen at a single Italian factory, and according to BMW's press release, it was key to giving the car \"a warm, exclusive ambiance.\" Despite receiving a positive reception at the Concours event, BMW never considered putting the car into production, most likely because it might have cannibalized sales from Rolls-Royce.\nBMW 2002 Touring\nThe BMW 2002 Turbo is widely regarded as one of the best BMWs ever made, its success in racing helping to immortalize it as one of the most desirable sporty sedans of its era. But, the 2002 model was also available in two other variants, one being the Baur-engineered convertible and the other being the obscure 2002 Touring. Introduced in 1971, the Touring was developed as a way to broaden the appeal of the 2002 model, which had been on the road for five years already by that point. According to BMW Group Classic, the front half of the car is identical to a 2002 sedan, and it's only behind the B-pillars that the engineering (and of course the styling) differs.\nThe car sits somewhere between a wagon and a hatchback, offering more space in the rear than the sedan variant but without compromising on handling. The engine options were, according to BMW Group Classic, identical to the sedan, and a \"rally pack\" could be optioned, which added sports seats, wider tires, and alloy wheels. The niche appeal of the Touring combined with its more expensive price tag meant that it never saw as much commercial success as the 2002 sedan did, with only 30,000 units being made. Few remain on the roads today, and those that do are generally worth less than the equivalent sedan or convertible variants are.\nBMW X5 LM\nThe super-SUV is now very much a fully-fledged segment of the car market, with cars like the Lamborghini Urus and Bentley Bentayga both being best-sellers for their respective brands. But, back in 2001, BMW was experimenting with a super-SUV of their own, way before most companies had even considered such a thing. The X5 LM was powered by the V12 engine that was used in the McLaren F1, which according to BMW made \"over 700 horsepower.\" The car was developed as an engineering test bed to see just how fast an SUV could be, and it helped pave the way for the X5 M, the first M-badged production SUV.\nIt's worth noting that a 2022 BMW X5 M makes 600 horsepower, still over 100 horsepower short of what this skunkworks creation was producing over twenty years ago. The car used an all-wheel-drive system to put power to the asphalt, and a six-speed manual transmission was fitted. According to BMW M Magazine, the car held the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife SUV lap record for 19 years, from 2001 to 2020, setting a lap record of seven minutes and 49 seconds.\nBMW Z18\nBMW has made its fair share of unusual cars over the years, but arguably one of its strangest is the Z18 concept. The car is essentially a Z roadster in full off-road guise, designed for buyers who wanted an all-terrain car that doubled as a convertible. It's more bare-bones than most other BMWs from the era, and part of the reason for that is because the company made sure to waterproof every aspect of it, claiming it could drive through flat stretches of water without issue. The car was the brainchild of the company's Technik division, a small team of designers who were separated from the main company to work on innovative projects like this one.\nThe Z18 is actually the first 4x4 BMW ever made, predating the X5 by about four years, according to Top Gear. The concept's V8 engine was used in the production X5, so although it might not look like it at first glance, some of the underlying components used in the Z18 did actually make production. Unfortunately, the overall design of the car was deemed unsuitable for a production run. The idea of a convertible SUV has been developed by the likes of Nissan and Land Rover for their Murano CrossCabriolet and Evoque Convertible respectively, but never with much commercial success. So, it seems like BMW made the right call by leaving the Z18 as a concept only, consigned to the archives and now forgotten about by most BMW fans."
