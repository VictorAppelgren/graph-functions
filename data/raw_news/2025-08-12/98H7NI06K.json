  "description": "The current worst job in America is 'Washington, DC, tourism official,' thanks to President Trump calling the city 'a nightmare of murder and crime.'",
  "content": "The current worst job in America is \u201cWashington, DC, tourism official,\u201d thanks to President Donald Trump\u2019s recent decision to call the city \u201ca nightmare of murder and crime\u201d while sending National Guard troops in to eradicate \u201cthe tents, squalor, filth, and Crime.\u201d\n\nThose are direct quotes from the White House fact sheet on Trump\u2019s memorandum ordering the mobilization of the District of Columbia National Guard \u201cto address the epidemic of crime in our Nation\u2019s capital.\u201d\n\nThat epidemic does not exist, of course, but the words of the president tend to carry more weight than police data showing violent crime at a decades-long low.\n\nHow will DC tourism survive Trump calling the city a filthy hellhole?\n\nSo, who\u2019s going to want to pack up the kids and spend a fun weekend in a place the president of the United States says \u201cis under siege from out-of-control violent crime\u201d?\n\nDon\u2019t worry, DC tourism officials, I\u2019m here to help. Where some see a Trump-induced tourism disaster, I see a Trump-induced tourism disasterpportunity.\n\nHere\u2019s your new pitch to tourists:\n\nHave you ever wanted to walk through a historic city filled with armed soldiers who look bored? Are you a World War II buff fascinated with how the Reichstag fire allowed the Nazi Party to consolidate control in Germany? Do you like seeing guns, guns and more guns?!?\n\nThen DC is the family-friendly destination for your next vacation!\n\nDon\u2019t listen to \u201cfake news\u201d reports that make a federal takeover of the DC police force sound scary. The various soldiers just add a new layer to DC\u2019s long-standing status as an educational destination rich in American history.\n\nIt\u2019s something we\u2019re calling \u201cThe District of Columbia\u2019s Live Re-creation of the Authoritarian Experience!\u201d And you\u2019ll want to visit soon, because the event has a limited run time \u2013 we hope.\n\nTake in the sights, all while enjoying America's swift descent into tyranny!\n\nVisitors can stroll the National Mall and other famous DC sites under the watchful eyes of uniformed soldiers, FBI agents and other federal authorities, all while appreciating America\u2019s slow erosion of civil rights, the government\u2019s rampant use of propaganda. and the opportunistic silencing of political critics.\n\nParents will cherish the moments when they can turn to their children and exclaim: \u201cCareful what you say, kids! They might arrest Mom and Dad and send us to an El Salvadoran prison if they think we sound like enemies of the state!\u201d\n\nWait, this city doesn't look like a lawless wasteland?\n\nOh, the memories you\u2019ll create as you witness a city that isn\u2019t actually covered in filth and wonder if the current administration is using the nation\u2019s capital as a testing ground for an authoritarian takeover of other major American cities.\n\nAnd since the soldiers having their lives upended so they can stand around in a city that has seen a 26% reduction in violent crime won\u2019t be all that busy, you and the kids can ask them questions like \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d and \u201cDid you know you have the right to refuse an illegal order?\u201d and \u201cWhy did you arrest that labradoodle, he was just peeing?\u201d\n\nLearning about authoritarianism has never been this fun!\n\nThe Live Re-creation of the Authoritarian Experience will also feature an array of informational sidewalk booths throughout the city, aimed at helping visitors understand everything from why their skin color makes them look deportable to how they can better pay homage to President Donald Trump. (MAGA merchandise will be sold at every booth, and a minimum $100 purchase is mandatory for each family!)\n\nSo clear some dates on your calendar and book a trip to beautiful Washington, DC. You know our motto: \u201cNothing says American freedom like an armed federal takeover based on a transparent lie!\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Bluesky at @rexhuppke.bsky.social and on Facebook at facebook.com/RexIsAJerk",

      "text": "Trump sends 800 National Guard troops to crack down on DC crime. Here's what they'll do.\nPresident Donald Trump deployed 800 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump deployed 800 National Guard troops to the streets of Washington, DC, a rare flex of his presidential authority over the military while a court mulls the legality of his prior order sending troops to Los Angeles.\nSpeaking at the White House on Aug. 11, Trump said he had mobilized District of Columbia National Guard troops to respond to what he has claimed are rampant crime rates in the nation's capital. He also seized control of the Washington's local Metropolitan Police Force.\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming weeks,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at the news conference. \"They will be strong. They will be tough.\"\nThe deployment of hundreds of soldiers onto Washington's streets takes Trump's unprecedented use of the military \u2013 which he has already ordered to crack down on protests and help deportations \u2013 in a new direction.\nWhat will the National Guard troops do?\nThe mission of 800 DC guard members will resemble how troops are helping immigration agents swarm the southern border, the Army said.\n\"Between 100 and 200 troops\" will support law enforcement \"at any given time,\" according to a statement.\nAccording to the Army, which is responsible for deploying the District of Columbia National Guard, the troops will be tasked with administrative and logistical duties and supporting law enforcement with their \"physical presence.\"\nWhen will the National Guard deploy to Washington DC?\nNational Guardsmen tapped for the mission will be notified on Aug. 11 and will begin \"trickling in within the next week,\" said Maj. Montrell Russell, an Army spokesperson.\nIn the coming weeks, at least 500 troops will join the 1,200 National Guard personnel already assigned to carry out administrative duties at immigration enforcement offices in more than a dozen red states \u2013 including DNA swabbing and fingerprinting arrestees, USA TODAY previously reported.\nThe Trump administration has already mobilized thousands of National Guard troops as part of its sweeping plans to deport undocumented immigrants and close down the U.S.-Mexico border. Plans sent to the Pentagon by the Department of Homeland Security requested 20,000 troops to help immigration agents search for undocumented immigrants and migrant children and respond to protests at detention facilities.\nTrump said more National Guard troops from other states could also be assigned to the streets of Washington. His mobilization order also authorized Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \"work with state governors\" to use their National Guard troops \"if necessary,\" Will Scharf, a White House aide, said at the news conference.\nIs the deployment legal?\nThe DC National Guard is unique, meaning Trump's use of it skirts restrictions on the military carrying out law enforcement duties.\nIt operates under the president's control and is mobilized by the Army. It is also not subject to the same bans on carrying out law enforcement functions as state National Guard personnel are when a president deploys them as federal forces.\nTo deploy National Guard personnel from any of the 50 states to help Washington's police, Trump would need approval from that state's governor.\nTrump administration heads to court over National Guard use\nThe Trump administration is facing legal challenges over his deployment of California National Guard personnel earlier this summer to suppress protests in the Los Angeles area over widespread deportations.\nGavin Newsom, the state's Democratic governor, sued over the deployment, saying it violated the law surrounding when guardsmen can and can't carry out law enforcement-related duties. That case returns to federal court for a trial starting on Aug. 11 \u2013 a judge previously ruled in the Trump administration's favor.\nHas the National Guard been deployed to D.C. before?\nIt's not the first time Trump has deployed National Guard personnel to Washington's streets.\nIn his first term, Trump deployed National Guard troops to suppress protests over racism and police brutality that exploded in the summer of 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. Trump brought in troops from the District of Columbia and other states under the permission of 11 governors \u2013 an unprecedented mobilization.\nDC National Guard troops were at the scene on June 1, 2020, when Park Police sprayed tear gas at a group of peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square next to the White House."

      "text": "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Restores Law and Order in the District of Columbia\nSECURING THE SAFETY AND PEACEFUL FUNCTIONING OF OUR NATION\u2019S CAPITAL: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to restore law and order in the District of Columbia.\n- The Memorandum directs the Secretary of Defense to mobilize the District of Columbia National Guard to address the epidemic of crime in our Nation\u2019s capital.\n- The District of Columbia National Guard will remain mobilized until law and order is restored.\n- The Memorandum directs the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with State Governors and authorize the orders of any additional National Guard units as needed.\nRESTORING LAW AND ORDER: Washington, D.C. is under siege from out-of-control violent crime, and Federal intervention is now necessary to secure the safety and peaceful functioning of our Nation, the Federal government, and our city.\n- Washington, D.C. is a Federal city because it is the seat of our Nation\u2019s government. Violent crime that prevents Federal workers from safely performing their duties and prevents Americans from safely accessing their elected officials is a threat not just to the city, but to the Nation.\n- The local D.C. government has lost control of public safety in the city.\n- In May, two embassy staffers were murdered.\n- In June, a Congressional intern was fatally shot just a short distance from the White House.\n- Just days ago, a Trump Administration staffer was mercilessly beaten by a violent mob.\n- Washington, D.C. has a violent crime rate that is higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world.\n- Washington, DC\u2019s 2024 murder rate (27.54 per 100K) is higher than Bogota (15.1), Mexico City (10.6), Islamabad (9.2), Lima (7.6), and even major capitals like Paris (1.64), London (1.1), and Madrid (0.96).\n- President Trump has a Constitutional obligation to restore order so that citizens, tourists, and staff can live peacefully in the Nation\u2019s capital. Our Nation\u2019s capital should be the envy of the world, not a disgrace.\nMAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN: President Trump campaigned on the promise to make America safe again and restore Washington, D.C. to glory.\n- On President Trump\u2019s first return to Washington since leaving office in 2021, he lamented \u201cthe filth and the decay\u201d that marred the Nation\u2019s capital in his absence.\n- President Trump later promised that his Administration would \u201ctake over the horribly run capital of our nation, Washington, D.C., and clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city so that it is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world.\u201d\n- In March, President Trump created a task force to make D.C. safe and beautiful, surging law enforcement to restore order and enhance the city\u2019s infrastructure.\n- The Administration is committed to reducing violent crime rates, improving public safety, and ensuring Washington, D.C. serves as a model of prosperity and security for the nation.\n- President Trump: \u201cJust like I took care of the Border, where you had ZERO Illegals coming across last month, from millions the year before, I will take care of our cherished Capital, and we will make it, truly, GREAT AGAIN! Before the tents, squalor, filth, and Crime, it was the most beautiful Capital in the World. It will soon be that again.\u201d"

      "text": "Violent Crime in D.C. Hits 30 Year Low\nWASHINGTON - Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years, according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and announced by United States Attorney Matthew M. Graves. A breakdown of the data is available here.\nIn addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%; robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\n\u201cThe strategy this Office began to employ shortly after I came into this role has been to work with our law enforcement partners to focus on the drivers of violence - those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Graves. \u201cIt takes time to develop these investigations and prosecutions, but this is the fruit of that labor - a reduction in the violent crime - that D.C. is now seeing.\u201d\nA central component of this strategy has been targeting those crews who have preyed upon certain neighborhoods in our community, often operating drug trafficking networks in these neighborhoods. These proactive investigations and prosecutions have yielded immediate reductions in violence that have had lasting impact. For instance, an MPD analysis of crime trends in the area around MLK Mellon before and after a crew operating a drug market in that area was arrested revealed that there was a 66% reduction in violent crime in the area when comparing the six months prior to the arrests to the six months after the arrests. Even two years after these arrests, there was a 56% reduction in the number of homicides that occurred after the arrests when compared to the two years before.\nAnother key component of this proactive approach was implementing in April 2022, Project Safe Neighborhood - a daily review by the Office and our law enforcement partners of every firearms arrest in the District to determine, using objective criteria about the person arrested and the firearm recovered, whether the case should be charged in U.S. District Court or D.C. Superior Court. Since April 2022, the Office has accepted for prosecution in U.S. District Court more than 150 gun offenders under this initiative.\nFinally, the Office has continued to do all that it can to hold accountable those who commit violent crimes with firearms and those who illegally possess firearms. And the Office has committed to provide on a quarterly basis data related to these efforts - data that can be found here. This data reflects that in the first half of 2024, the Office was able to charge at the time of arrest more than 90% of arrests for violent crimes committed with guns and nearly 70% of gun possession arrests. The Office continues to investigate many of these arrests even if it does not charge on the day of arrest. Also in the first half of 2024, the Office obtained convictions in approximately 75% of these gun-related cases.\nThese numbers related to firearms offenses are critical and stand in stark contrast to the overall day-of-arrest charging rate for every arrest in the District of Columbia, which is a significantly less informative metric. The vast majority of arrests in the District of Columbia are for misdemeanor offenses that are often non-violent in nature. For such offenses, the Office has had a longstanding practice of giving great weight to victims\u2019 wishes about whether they want charges brought. For a variety of reasons, a substantial number of victims do not want criminal charges brought for these relatively minor offenses.\nIn Fiscal Year 2019, the Office expanded into a new section the number of prosecutors devoted to reviewing arrests and examining body-worn camera (BWC) footage - Fiscal Year 2018 was the first Fiscal Year where BWC had been fully deployed for the entire year - to determine whether the BWC footage reflected issues that would later require the Office to dismiss a prosecution or if there were otherwise fatal flaws with the case. This section is called the Early Case Assessment Section (ECAS). The combination of BWC footage and ECAS\u2019s early detection of arrests that, if charged, would later need to be dismissed led to relatively modest decreases in cases charged at the time of arrest in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.\nThe overall day-of-arrest charging rate dropped dramatically in Fiscal Years 2020, 2021, and 2022, as the global pandemic brought the criminal justice system to a halt and the D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences lost its accreditation in 2021.\nOur Office, along with our local partners, worked to overcome these challenges and the overall day-of-arrest charging rate in Fiscal Year 2024 of 57% is virtually identical to the 54% day-of-arrest charging rate that the Office reported in Fiscal Year 2019 after forming ECAS. More significantly, though, the Office dismissed far fewer of the cases it charged in Fiscal Year 2024 than it did in Fiscal Year 2018, so more arrests resulted in a prosecutorial outcome in Fiscal Year 2024 than in Fiscal Year 2018. For felonies, in particular, the percentage of cases with a prosecutorial outcome rose from 66% in Fiscal Year 2018 to 85% in Fiscal Year 2024.\nThere is value in addressing the issues, such as the lack of drug testing, that were preventing our Office from charging, at the time-of-arrest, non-violent misdemeanor offenses. While charging more non-violent offenses can benefit the community and offenders are often sentenced to periods of probation with services that hopefully aid in rehabilitation, these cases typically do not identify and remove violent offenders from the community. As is universally recognized, targeting the relatively limited number of individuals responsible for driving gun violence is the most impactful thing that prosecutors can do to contribute to the kinds of sharp declines in violent crime the District saw in 2024. To that end, multiple proactive investigations are already underway that should further reduce violent crime in 2025.\n##\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube\nOr at https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc"

Tell us. | Opinion\nTrump's drastic moves in DC, including sending in the National Guard, follow the assault on an ex-DOGE staffer. But official numbers say the capital is safer. How do you feel about crime in your town?\nWashington, DC, is awash in \"crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" our nation's president told us Monday, Aug. 11.\nTo save it, President Donald Trump said he is taking over the city's police department, sending in 800 National Guard troops and removing homeless people. The extreme executive actions came a week after a 19-year-old former staffer of the Department of Government Efficiency was assaulted in Washington during an attempted carjacking, after which Trump threatened to federalize the city.\nThe thing is, despite the high-profile assault, violent crime in the nation's capital is the lowest in more than 30 years.\nTrump is not alone in his disconnect. In nearly three decades of polls, most of us continued to say crime was increasing in the United States. But it hasn't.\nViolent crime has dropped by nearly half since 1993, while property crime has fallen even more, according to the FBI.\nAre you concerned about crime where you live?\nWhile we are safer overall, that's not to say there aren't outliers \u2013 cities or neighborhoods where crime is worse. The situation can be very localized. It can also be very personal, sometimes tragically so for victims. That's why we're turning to you, our readers. We're asking you to answer this poll about your perceptions and experiences regarding crime. What is your understanding of safety in your community and the country?\nFill out our form below or send us an email to forum@usatoday.com with the subject line \"Forum Crime.\" We'll pick a collection of responses to share in a follow-up post.\nTo help you respond, here are some questions you can answer:\n- Do you agree with Trump's actions in Washington, DC, that he says will reduce crime, including taking over the police force, bringing in the National Guard and forcing out homeless people?\n- If you agree, why do you think they will work?\n- If you disagree, why do you think they will not?\n- Do you feel safe in your hometown? Why or why not?\n- Do you think crime has gone down or gone up where you live? Why or why not?\nJoel Burgess is a Voices editor for the USA TODAY Network."

Troops ended up fighting boredom\n- Share via\nThey were deployed by the Trump administration to combat \u201cviolent, insurrectionist mobs\u201d in and around Los Angeles, but in recent days the only thing many U.S. Marines and California National Guard troops seemed to be fighting was tedium.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much to do,\u201d one Marine said as he stood guard outside the towering Wilshire Federal Building in Westwood this week.\nThe blazing protests that first met federal immigration raids in downtown Los Angeles were nowhere to be seen along Wilshire Boulevard or Veteran Avenue, so many troops passed the time chatting and joking over energy drinks. The Marine, who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to reporters, said his duties consisted mostly of approving access for federal workers and visitors to the Veterans Affairs office.\nMore than five weeks after Trump mobilized an extraordinary show of military force against the will of California Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, few National Guard troops and Marines have remained in public view, most retreating to local military bases in Orange County.\nAs an indication of the military\u2019s dwindling role in immigration enforcement operations, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Tuesday ordered the release of 2,000 National Guard troops. Now, Bass, Newsom and others are demanding the complete removal of remaining troops \u2014 or about 2,000 California National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines.\nThe Pentagon on Tuesday announced that 2,000 National Guard troops will be sent home after an unprecedented deployment in the Los Angeles area.\n\u201cThousands of members are still federalized in Los Angeles for no reason and unable to carry out their critical duties across the state,\u201d Newsom said on X, accusing Trump of using California National Guard troops as \u201cpolitical pawns.\u201d\n\u201cEnd this theater and send everyone home,\u201d the governor said.\nBass said the troops\u2019 primary mission in L.A. was to guard federal buildings that \u201cfrankly didn\u2019t need to be guarded.\u201d\n\u201cThey had to leave their families, they had to leave their education, they had to leave their work,\u201d Bass said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cWe have had no problems for weeks, so why were they here?\u201d\nSteve Woolford, a resource counselor for GI Rights Hotline, a nonprofit group that provides free, confidential information to service members, said calls from troops had gone down dramatically over the last month.\n\u201cThe most recent people I talked to sounded like they\u2019re sitting around bored without much to do,\u201d Woolford said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re happy with that: They aren\u2019t asking to do more. At the same time, I don\u2019t think people see a real purpose in what they\u2019re doing at all.\u201d\nThe majority of National Guard troops have been stationed at the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos, according to military officials and governor\u2019s office officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nOver the last few weeks, a massive tent city has risen at the Orange County base \u2014 about 25 miles southeast of downtown L.A. The tents, some of which stretch up to 50 yards long, provide living quarters, cafeteria space and other facilities. On a recent morning, National Guard troops \u2014 some dressed in full combat fatigues, others in T-shirts and shorts \u2014 could be seen exercising, milling about and playing a game of touch football.\nA separate group of Marines and National Guard troops have remained at the Westwood federal building for an entire month. The federal building has been outfitted with sleeping and eating arrangements for troops, according to a Marine who spoke with The Times.\nTo be sure, some California National Guard troops embarked on tense missions with federal immigration agents on sweeps at farms, warehouses and public streets.\nOn July 7, Guard troops accompanied federal agents as they descended on MacArthur Park on horses and in armored vehicles in a heavily militarized show of force. It\u2019s still unclear whether any arrests were made that day, but crowds quickly formed around the federal agents and military troops, screaming for them to \u201cget the f\u2014 out!\u201d\nA few days later, Guard troops wearing riot face shields and clutching long, wooden batons faced off with hundreds of protesters in Ventura County as immigration agents arrested about 200 suspected undocumented immigrants at Glass House Farms, a large, licensed cannabis greenhouse in Camarillo.\nProtesters blocked the roads in and out of one of the farms, and at one point federal agents drove their vehicles through the fields.\nBut most of the deployed Guard troops and Marines do not appear to have been engaged in raids or even the federal building security in recent weeks.\nAn estimated 90% of the National Guard troops stationed in the L.A. area over the last few days have not been deployed on daily missions, according to a source within Newsom\u2019s office who has knowledge of the military operation.\n\u201cFor the most part ... they\u2019re sitting around,\u201d the source said.\nThe source, who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were unauthorized to speak publicly on the deployment, said an estimated 3% of the 4,000 troops \u2014 about 120 soldiers \u2014 were taking part in daily missions, mostly consisting of security at federal buildings.\nAn additional couple hundred were standing by for \u201cquick response force\u201d missions \u2014 ready to mobilize within a few hours for an immigration raid or a crowd control operation. But even if all those troops were used each day, the source said, that still left about 88% of the 4,000 troops \u2014 or about three-quarters of the remaining 2,000 \u2014 underutilized.\nThe Pentagon and Task Force 51, the military\u2019s designation for Los Angeles area troops, declined to answer questions about how many Guard troops and Marines were engaged in protecting federal buildings or accompanying immigration agents on daily missions. Nor did they comment on the claim from Newsom\u2019s office that most troops were \u201csitting around.\u201d\nGuard soldiers and Marines were \u201cprimarily protecting fixed-site federal facilities and protecting federal law enforcement personnel while they conduct immigration enforcement activities, such as warrant services,\u201d read a task force statement.\nFederal officials have also declined to provide precise details on the cost of the deployment. Hegseth previously said that the mobilization of troops would cost $134 million, but it\u2019s unclear whether that estimate is accurate.\nJennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a military research group, said there is little evidence that the military presence is necessary.\n\u201cThe need for military forces in Los Angeles is low while the need for National Guard forces elsewhere in the state is rising,\u201d Kavanagh said. \u201cThat they\u2019re still deployed after so much time, when there doesn\u2019t seem to be a need, suggests that this really is about setting precedent of having military forces involved in immigration enforcement and deployed in U.S. cities.\u201d\nUndocumented parents are preparing for the worst in response to the L.A. immigration raids. Bracing for potential deportation, they\u2019re making emergency care plans for their kids.\nKori Schake, senior fellow and director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, agreed: \u201cThey have a real job to be training for \u2014 fighting and winning the nation\u2019s wars \u2014 which this performative policing is a distraction from.\u201d\nThe first convoys of Guard troops rumbled into L.A. on June 8, shortly after the Trump administration announced it would send 2,000 Guard members to the city to quell unrest as protesters graffitied buildings downtown, set Waymo driverless cars ablaze and clashed with ICE agents as they tried to conduct immigration raids.\nAs California leaders protested, and called the deployment unnecessary, the Trump administration doubled down. On June 10, 700 Marines from the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center about 150 miles west in Twentynine Palms arrived in L.A. A week later, the task force ballooned to 4,800 personnel when Hegseth added 2,000 more Guard troops.\nNewsom condemned Trump for diverting members of the California National Guard as they geared up for wildfire season, noting that the unit assigned to combating wildfires was at just 40% of its regular staffing levels due to the deployment. The governor\u2019s office also complained that about 150 California Guard soldiers were being pulled from the state\u2019s Counterdrug Task Force, which focuses on interrupting drug trade at the U.S.-Mexico border and throughout California.\nThe Trump administration eventually approved a request to release 150 Guard members for state wildfire suppression.\nThe Guard has been deployed to Los Angeles before, but never against the will of the L.A. mayor and California governor.\nIn 1992, President George H.W. Bush mobilized the National Guard to L.A. after multiple days of riots following a jury\u2019s acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Black motorist Rodney King. About 6,000 troops were ultimately sent in, requested by California\u2019s then-Gov. Pete Wilson and Mayor Tom Bradley, to guard trouble spots and gain control of neighborhoods after rioters attacked stores, torched buildings and, in some extreme cases, beat and killed residents. The Times dubbed it \u201cthe worst civil unrest in Los Angeles history.\u201d\nNearly 30 years later, Guard troops were called in again during the 2020 protests following the murder of George Floyd. After downtown buildings were vandalized and graffitied and police cars were set aflame, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti asked Newsom to send in 1,000 National Guard troops to restore order and assist local law enforcement.\nBut last month, the federal government sent in the troops without local politicians\u2019 support, setting in motion an intense legal showdown.\nA day after National Guard troops hit the ground in L.A., Newsom and Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to end the \u201cillegal and unnecessary takeover\u201d of a California National Guard unit. They argued that the unwarranted commandeering of National Guard troops, without the consent or input of the governor, violated the U.S. Constitution and exceeded the president\u2019s Title 10 authority.\nAfter a federal judge in Los Angeles barred \u2018roving patrols\u2019 by immigration agents in seven California counties, the Trump administration asked the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to resume operations that lawyers for the state have argued are unconstitutional.\nA U.S. district judge in San Francisco sided with the state, ruling June 12 that Trump broke the law when he deployed thousands of California National Guard troops to L.A. against the state\u2019s will. The judge issued a temporary restraining order that would have returned control of the National Guard to California. But the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals paused that court order, allowing the troops to remain in L.A. while the case played out in federal court.\nKavanagh said she was disturbed to see Guard troops accompanying federal agents on immigration raids. Even if they had orders not to participate in law enforcement activities, confrontations could escalate quickly.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many chances for things to spiral out of control,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile we haven\u2019t seen any unintentional escalation yet, that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t.\u201d\nWhen troops were first deployed to L.A., advocates for service members warned of low morale. The GI Rights Hotline received a flurry of calls voicing concern about immigration enforcement, Woolford said.\nSome military personnel told the hotline that they did not want to support ICE or play any role in deporting people because they considered immigrants part of the community or had immigrants in their family, Woolford said. Others said they did not want to point guns at citizens. A few worried that the country was on the verge of turning into something like martial law, and said that they didn\u2019t want to be on the side of being armed occupiers of their own country.\nMany were shocked that the deployment orders were for 60 days.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019re really going to keep us here that long, are they?\u201d Woolford said he was asked.\nBut as the military brought in more contractors and set up giant tents with cots, Woolford said, callers to the hotline seemed more resigned to the idea that they would remain in L.A. a long time.\nAsked about the pressures facing troops on their mission to Los Angeles, one Marine outside the Wilshire Federal Building summed it up this way:\n\u201cThat\u2019s just orders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do what we\u2019re told \u2014 it\u2019s the system.\u201d\nTimes staff writer Jeanette Marantos contributed to this report."

      "text": "The President\u2019s Police State\nTrump is delivering the authoritarian government his party once warned about.\nListen to more stories on the Noa app.\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\nFor years, prominent voices on the right argued that Democrats were enacting a police state. They labeled everything\u2014a report on homegrown extremism, IRS investigations into nonprofits\u2014a sign of impending authoritarianism. Measures taken by state governments to combat the spread of COVID? Tyranny. An FBI search of Mar-a-Lago? The weaponization of law enforcement.\nNow that a president is actually sending federal troops and officers out into the streets of the nation\u2019s cities, however, the right is in lockstep behind him. This morning, Donald Trump announced that he was declaring a crime emergency, temporarily seizing control of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department and deploying the D.C. National Guard to the nation\u2019s capital.\n\u201cThis is liberation day in D.C.,\u201d Trump said. Nothing says liberation like deploying hundreds of uniformed soldiers against the wishes of the local elected government. District residents have made clear that they would prefer greater autonomy, including congressional representation, and they have three times voted overwhelmingly against Trump. His response is not just to flex power but to treat the District of Columbia as the president\u2019s personal fiefdom.\nTrump\u2019s move is based on out-of-date statistics. It places two officials without municipal policing experience in positions of power over federalization and the MPD, and seems unlikely to significantly affect crime rates. What the White House hopes it might achieve, Politico reports, is \u201ca quick, visually friendly PR win.\u201d Trump needs that after more than a month of trying and failing to change the subject from his onetime friend Jeffrey Epstein.\nBut what this PR stunt could also do is create precedent for Trump to send armed forces out into American streets whenever he declares a spurious state of emergency. Some of Trump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t seem to mind that fact: \u201cTrump has the opportunity to do a Bukele-style crackdown on DC crime,\u201d Christopher Rufo, the influential conservative personality, posted on X, referring to Nayib Bukele, the Trump ally who is president of El Salvador. \u201cQuestion is whether he has the will, and whether the public the stomach. Big test: Can he reduce crime faster than the Left advances a counternarrative about \u2018authoritarianism\u2019? If yes, he wins. Speed matters.\u201d\nRufo seems to view everything in terms of a political battle to be won via narratives; the term authoritarianism appears to mean nothing to him, and maybe it never meant anything to others on the right who assailed Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Democratic governors. It does have a real meaning, though, and Bukele is its poster boy. Despite the constitution having banned it, he ran for a second term in office; his party then changed the constitution to allow \u201cindefinite\u201d reelection. Lawmakers in his party also brazenly removed supreme-court justices, and his government has forced journalists into exile and locked up tens of thousands of people without due process. This is apparently the America that Chris Rufo wants.\nTo justify the crackdown, Trump has cited an alleged carjacking attempt that police records say injured the former DOGE employee Edward \u201cBig Balls\u201d Coristine. But MPD has already arrested two Maryland 15-year-olds for unarmed carjacking. That\u2019s good news. Carjacking is a serious crime and should be punished. But Trump has used the incident to claim that violent crime is skyrocketing in Washington. This is, put simply, nonsense. During a press conference today, Trump cited murder statistics from 2023, and said that carjackings had \u201cmore than tripled\u201d over the past five years. He didn\u2019t use more recent numbers because they show that these crimes are down significantly in Washington. Murder dropped 32 percent from 2023 to 2024, robberies 39 percent, and armed carjackings 53 percent. This is in line with a broad national reduction in crime. MPD\u2019s preliminary data indicate that violent crime is down another 26 percent so far this year compared with the same timeframe in 2024, though as the crime-statistics analyst Jeff Asher writes, this drop is probably overstated.\nTrump\u2019s descriptions of Washington as a lawless hellscape bear little resemblance to what most residents experience. Not only is D.C. not \"one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World,\u201d as Trump claims, but his prescription seems unlikely to help. He said he is appointing Attorney General Pam Bondi and Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, to help lead the federalization effort and MPD, but neither has any experience with municipal policing. They have not said what they will do differently. If the administration deploys its forces to high-profile areas such as the National Mall, they won\u2019t have much impact on violent crime, because that\u2019s not where it happens; if they go to less central areas with higher crime rates, they won\u2019t get the PR boost they seek, because tourists and news cameras aren\u2019t there.\nThroughout his two presidencies, Trump has treated the military as a prop for making statements about which issues he cares about\u2014and which he doesn\u2019t. He deployed the D.C. National Guard during protests after the murder of George Floyd in summer 2020. Earlier this summer, he federalized the California National Guard and sent Marines to Los Angeles to assist with immigration enforcement, but they were sent home when it became clear that they had nothing to do there. Yet according to testimony before the January 6 panel, Trump did not deploy the D.C. National Guard when an armed mob was sacking the U.S. Capitol in 2021 to try to help Trump hold on to power.\nGood policing is important because citizens deserve the right to live in safety. Recent drops in crime in Washington are good news because the district\u2019s residents should be able to feel safe. But Trump\u2019s militarization of the city, his seizure of local police, and his lies about crime in Washington do the opposite: They are a way to make people feel unsafe, and either quiet residents\u2019 dissent or make them support new presidential power grabs. Many of Trump\u2019s defenders are angry when he\u2019s called an authoritarian, but not when he acts as one.\nRelated:\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\nToday\u2019s News\n-\nAn explosion at a U.S. Steel plant in Clairton, Pennsylvania, killed at least one person and injured at least 10.

The District of Columbia\u2019s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime.\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on reaction to President Trump\u2019s DC police takeover plan.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi will assume responsibility for Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department, Trump said, as he also railed against potholes and graffiti in the city and called them \u201cembarrassing.\u201d The president did not provide a timeline for the control of the police department, but he\u2019s limited to 30 days under statute unless he gets approval from Congress.\nAs Trump spoke, demonstrators gathered outside the White House to protest his moves. And local officials rejected the Republican president\u2019s depiction of the district as crime-ridden and called his actions illegal.\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said. \u201cThere is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia.\u201d\nSchwalb, a Democrat, said violent crime in the district reached historic 30-year lows last year and is down an additional 26% this year.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she would follow the law regarding the \u201cso-called emergency\u201d even as she indicated that Trump\u2019s actions were a reason why the District of Columbia should be a state with legal protections from such actions.\n\u201cWhile this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\u201d Bowser said.\nCombating crime\nThe president dismissed the idea Washington needed to enlarge its 3,500-officer police force, even as he seeks to have more armed personnel going through the city with the goal of reducing crime.\n\u201cWhat you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them,\u201d he said.\nTrump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in an executive order to declare a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d so his administration could take over the city\u2019s police force. He signed a directive for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard.\nWhile Trump has portrayed himself as a friend to law enforcement and enjoyed the political backing from many of their groups, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, including people convicted of assaulting police officers.\nAbout 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation\u2019s capital as part of Trump\u2019s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.\nMore than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Marshals Service are contributing officers.\nThe person was not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately have a comment Monday morning.\nThe National Guard\nBowser, a Democrat, has previously questioned the effectiveness of using the National Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. Superior Court, some of which have been open for years.\nBowser cannot activate the National Guard herself, but she can submit a request to the Pentagon.\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\u201d she said Sunday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d acknowledging it is \u201cthe president\u2019s call about how to deploy the Guard.\u201d\nBowser noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023. She stressed during a Monday news conference that she believed Trump\u2019s views of the city were shaped by the \u201cchallenging times\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic, when he faced protests and crime spiked as the country began to recover from the outbreak.\nFocusing on homelessness\nTrump has emphasized the removal of Washington\u2019s homeless population, though it was unclear where the thousands of people would go, and he did not give details at his news conference Monday.\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d Trump wrote Sunday in a social media post. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong.\u201d\nJesse Rabinowitz, a advocate for homeless people, called Trump\u2019s plan \u201cfascist\u201d and a \u201cwaste\u201d of resources. He said the move wasn\u2019t about safety.\n\u201cIt is about power, and it is about fascism and authoritarianism,\u201d said Rabinowitz, the campaign and communication director for the National Homelessness Law Center. \u201cIf Donald Trump wanted to keep D.C. safe, he would fund housing and support. Instead, the Republicans just gutted health care, and they\u2019re passing through a budget that will make homelessness worse. They do not care about helping people.\u201d\nCrime statistics\nPolice statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Overall, violent crime is down 26% compared with this time a year ago.\nThe president has criticized the district as full of \u201ctents, squalor, filth, and Crime,\u201d and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as the Department of Government Efficiency. Police arrested two 15-year-olds in the attempted carjacking and said they were looking for others.\n\u201cThis has to be the best run place in the country, not the worst run place in the country,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\nHe called Bowser \u201ca good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.\u201d\nTrump has repeatedly suggested the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities. Doing so would require a repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 in Congress, a step Trump said lawyers are examining.\nBowser acknowledged the law allows the president to take more control over the city\u2019s police, but only if certain conditions are met.\n\u201cNone of those conditions exist in our city right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not experiencing a spike in crime. In fact, we\u2019re watching our crime numbers go down.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Ashraf Khalil, Alanna Durkin Richer, Nathan Ellgren, Darlene Superville and Michelle L.

The meeting will be held in Alaska.\n- President Trump mistakenly stated he was meeting with Vladimir Putin in Russia, when the meeting is scheduled for Alaska.\n- Trump's responses to questions about deploying the National Guard to other cities were rambling and incoherent, raising concerns about his mental acuity.\n- Trump's actions seem reminiscent of Biden's past gaffes. Will the media apply similar scrutiny?\nDuring President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he\u2019s sending the National Guard to Washington, DC, to fight a crime wave that isn\u2019t real, it became clear he has caught Sleepy Joe Biden\u2019s much-ballyhooed cognitive decline.\nI\u2019m not sure how it happened. I imagine the liberals figured out a way to make a concerning lack of mental acuity contagious.\nBut whatever the cause, hearing the president ramble incoherently during a nationally televised news conference on Monday, Aug. 11, left no doubt: The man\u2019s brain has turned to oatmeal.\nTrump thinks he's meeting Putin in Russia. It will actually happen in Alaska.\nFor starters, on two occasions Trump told reporters he will be meeting in days with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia. The meeting will be held in Alaska, which, unless Trump has given away one of America\u2019s states to Putin, is very much not in Russia.\nA mistake like that from President Biden would have prompted Republicans to launch a congressional investigation into his competency and CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper to pen a book on the presidential competency scandal of a generation. Two mistakes like that from Biden would have effectively spun the U.S. news media into a months-long cyclone of speculation and hysteria.\nRemember how important mental decline was when Biden was president\nSo I\u2019m sure all Americans who have displayed deep concern about the importance of world-leader lucidity will meet the moment with an appropriate number of gasps, pearl clutches and calls for an immediate mental-fitness exam.\nBecause the \u201cI\u2019m going to Russia!\u201d confusion was just a part of Trump\u2019s troubling Aug. 11 performance.\nTrump's word salad answers are getting more concerning\nAsked a specific question about whether other cities like Chicago and Los Angeles might expect similar action involving the use of the National Guard to combat crime, Trump said, in part, this:\n\u201cBut when I look at Chicago and I look at LA, if we didn\u2019t go to LA three months ago, LA would be burning like the part that didn\u2019t burn. If you would\u2019ve allowed the water to come down, which I told them about in my first term, I said, 'You\u2019re going to have problems, let it come down'. We actually sent in our military to have the water come down into LA. They still didn\u2019t want it to come down after the fires. But that was it, we have it coming down. But hopefully LA is watching. That mayor also, the city is burning, they lost like 25,000 homes. I went there the day after the fire, you were there, and I saw people standing in front of a burned-down home. Their homes were incinerated, they weren\u2019t like, even the steel, literally it was all warped, literally disintegrated because of the winds and the flames like a blow torch. They were standing on this beautiful day, maybe a couple of days after, we gave it a little time because of what they had suffered. Almost 25,000 homes. And you see what\u2019s happening now, they didn\u2019t give their permits. I went to a town hall meeting I said we\u2019re going to get you the federal permit, which are much harder.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the sort of thing you hear before having to make a difficult decision about grandpa\u2019s future. That it came from a sitting president waging domestic war against a crime emergency in a city that currently does not have a crime emergency seems, at best, troubling.\nTime for the 'Biden is incompetent' folks to perk up\nI wish a reporter had asked Trump what \u201cLA would be burning like the part that didn\u2019t burn\u201d means. I wish a reporter had asked the president if the DC crime wave he kept referring to was in the room with them as they spoke.\nBut there was no pushback.\nThe Fox News folks and the right-wing radio squawkers and the Republicans who called the former president a dithering old fool need to start worrying about the competency of the current president.\nYou know, the one who\u2019s going to Alaska and thinks he\u2019s going to Russia. The one who answers a question about sending the National Guard to U.S. cities by babbling about water, fires and federal building permits. The one who has clearly gone, as critics of Biden\u2019s mental acuity would call it, \u201cfull Sleepy Joe.\u201d\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Bluesky at @rexhuppke.bsky.social and on Facebook at facebook.com/RexIsAJerk"

  "argos_summary": "President Donald Trump has declared a crime emergency in Washington, D.C., mobilizing 800 National Guard troops and taking control of the city's police department, despite local officials asserting that violent crime is at a 30-year low. This move has been criticized as unnecessary and politically motivated, with tourism officials expressing concern over the impact of Trump's rhetoric on the city's image. The deployment of troops is seen as a controversial tactic that raises questions about federal overreach and the portrayal of D.C. as a crime-ridden area, which contradicts current crime statistics.",
