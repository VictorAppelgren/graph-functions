The \u2192 route saw a 49.2 percentage point increase in blank sailings (defined as a cargo ship voyage being canceled, partially or entirely) year-over-year, with similar spikes on Lianyungang \u2192 (+27.0pp) and Kaohsiung \u2192 (+22.7pp)\n\u2022 Diversification Trends: and have gained modest import share, reflecting ongoing efforts by U.S. businesses to diversify sourcing amid tariff uncertainty\n\u2022 Legal Challenges and Policy Uncertainty: With the Trump Administration in its final term, the future of these tariffs remains unclear.

  "summary": "The project44 Tariff Report reveals that the U.S. trade environment is undergoing a recalibration following the implementation of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and measures from key global partners. The report also revealed that exports to and abroad have decreased by 7.6% and 1% year-to-date, indicating a shift in demand and potential geopolitical tension. Ocean carriers are responding with aggressive capacity management, with a 49.2 percentage point increase in blank sailings on the \u2192 route seeing a decrease in empty sailings year-over-year. The future of these tariffs is uncertain as legal challenges are moving through the courts and 2029 could mark their sunset. Despite this, project44 expects tariff rates to stabilize once trade agreements are extended, but risks of renewed volatility remain a possibility if conditions change.",
