      "feedback": "This draft can reach world-class clarity with a tighter, source-driven 0–3 week framework, a crisp causal chain, and explicit monitors. Edit plan: (1) Ground horizon in a three‑part, testable frame: immediate drivers (tariff deadlines and announcements), near-term catalysts (Powell Jackson Hole signal, EU/China progress, Nvidia/AI demand anecdotes), and the market’s reaction function (risk-on vs risk-off, duration and rate-cut pricing). Explicitly state thresholds and invalidations: e.g., if July 9 tariffs are softened or delayed, or if Powell signals NO near-term cut, expect a shift toward risk-off/term premium re-pricing; if a clear tariff framework or extended deadline emerges, expect continuation of the recent rally or a fresh leg lower depending on inflation signals. (2) Strengthen the causal chain with quantified links: tariffs surged to >10% across inputs in three months; tariff-free share fell below 65%—clear inflation risk and weaker external balance signals (0J41Q7KTX); the trade deficit hit a record near $692 billion through June, with the export ratio ~37% (0J41Q7KTX). Tie these to the Fed path: Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks sharpen the odds of a September rate cut in the market (87% from CME in WC68LCU9R; yields at 4.26% on 10‑year) and explain why equities, especially small caps/homebuilders/travel, led a rally on “lower-rate” expectations (WC68LCU9R). (3) Replace broad statements with a three-scenario structure: base (tariffs stay largely in place, gradual easing bias as labor market softens; S&P around all-time highs, 10Y ~4.25–4.35%), bull (deadlines push concessions; equities rally, yields drift lower, AI demand reinforces capex), bear (escalation or miscommunication re tariffs/geo-risk triggers risk-off into rates). Include explicit price-paths where possible: e.g., S&P around 6,468–6,520 as near-term target if the rally persists; 30‑year auction sensitivity around current spreads (<19 bps) as a risk barometer (4CJPTXOL0). (4) Tighten numbers and attribution: quote Tariffs quadrupling to >10% and the 65% tariff-free share from 0J41; include the 182%+ “export share” dynamics implied in the US-China tariff chatter from 0J41 and 9; note Nvidia/AI demand and its protective effect on tech bias from AP/Nvidia pieces (9, 7), and Netflix’s Asia growth/automation angle as a separate growth support (4CJPTXOL0). (5) Reconcile conflicts succinctly: some reports attribute price increases to seasonal factors vs tariff pass-through; flag this as a data-ambiguous area to monitor (0J41Q7KTX; 4CJPTXOL0). (6) Strengthen the “what to monitor next” section: tariff developments (deadline outcomes and any softening), Jackson Hole communications (timing and language), 30‑year auction outcomes, oil price reactions to Middle East/NIR tensions (AP/Will Kennedy, 4CJPTXOL0), and AI-capex cues from Nvidia/Netflix coverage (9, 4CJPTXOL0). (7) Clean citations and coverage: anchor every assertion to IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL and avoid loosening into generic statements; ensure coverage of at least 0J41Q7KTX, WC68LCU9R, 4CJPTXOL0, 78BX9FDFE, 9, and pertinent AP pieces (8, 5, 11) to reflect jobs, Jackson Hole, and energy risk signals. (8) Language and format: convert long sentences into a concise causal chain with bullet-like sequencing, but keep a single compact paragraph as requested, with parenthetical source IDs after each factual claim. This will yield a tighter, investment-relevant narrative: immediate drivers, near-term catalysts, reaction function, key levels/invalidations, and a precise watch list, all rigorously sourced. Citations to anchor: (0J41Q7KTX; WC68LCU9R; 4CJPTXOL0; 78BX9FDFE; 9; 8).",
