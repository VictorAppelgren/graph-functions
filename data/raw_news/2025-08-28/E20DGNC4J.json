  "description": "Sales of Tesla cars have continued to decline across Europe, falling 40% in July, as Chinese rival BYD saw a surge in registrations in the region last month.",
  "content": "Sales of Tesla (TSLA) cars have continued to decline across Europe, falling 40% in July, as Chinese rival BYD (1211.HK) saw a surge in registrations in the region last month.\n\nNew registrations for Tesla vehicles fell to 8,837 units in July, across the European Union, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) bloc and the UK, down from 14,769 for the same month last year. That's according to the latest data from European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), published on Thursday, which showed Tesla's market share had fallen to 0.8% in July from 1.4% last year.\n\nFrom January to July, there were 119,013 new Tesla registrations across the region, which was down 33.6% compared to the same period last year.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"July was a terrible month for Tesla for European vehicle registrations. Its brand has been tarnished by Elon Musk\u2019s political involvement and outspokenness, as well as growing competition \u2013 put simply, driver appetite for a new Tesla is poor.\"\n\nBy comparison, sales of BYD cars jumped 225% year-on-year in July to 13,503 units across Europe, with the carmaker gaining a 1.2% market share last month.\n\nOver January to July, there were 84,416 new BYD registrations in the region, marking a surge of 290% compared to the same period last year.\n\n\"The fact BYD\u2019s growth has motored at full speed shows where European drivers are looking,\" said Coatsworth. \"They are putting their faith in China\u2019s electric vehicle challenger brand, with affordability a key factor behind the choice of manufacturer. BYD\u2019s vehicles are winning plenty of awards, suggesting that drivers are happy behind the wheel and the message is spreading far and wide.\"\n\n\u201cTesla has already said its future will include more affordable vehicles, and it needs to travel down that road as fast as it can,\" he added.\n\nRead more: Taylor Wimpey to be kicked out of FTSE 100 and Metlen added to blue-chip index\n\nMore broadly, ACEA's data showed that sales of battery electric cars rose 33.6% year-on-year across Europe last month, while plug-in hybrid registrations were up 52.3% and hybrid electric sales increased 11.1%.\n\nTesla sales have continued to fall this year amid backlash against Musk. That's despite the billionaire's exit from his advisory role to the Trump administration, heading up the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), at the end of May.\n\nA public feud between Musk and president Donald Trump following his departure from Washington weighed further on Tesla shares, which are down more than 13% year-to-date.",

      "text": "Republicans fearful about potential consequences of a prolonged feud between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are urging the pair to call a truce.\nAt a minimum, the explosion of animosity between the two powerful men could complicate the path forward for Republicans\u2019 massive tax and border spending legislation that has been promoted by Trump but criticised by Musk.\nUS vice president JD Vance said Musk was making a \u201chuge mistake\u201d going after Mr Trump.\nIn an interview released on Friday after the very public blow up between the world\u2019s richest man and arguably the world\u2019s most powerful, also tried to downplay Mr Musk\u2019s blistering attacks as those of an \u201cemotional guy\u201d who became frustrated.\n\u201cI hope that eventually Elon comes back into the fold. Maybe that\u2019s not possible now because he\u2019s gone so nuclear,\u201d Vance said.\nVance\u2019s comments come as other Republicans in recent days have urged the two men, who months ago were close allies spending significant time together, to patch up their differences.\n\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t distract us from getting the job done that we need to,\u201d said representative Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington state. \u201cI think that it will boil over and they\u2019ll mend fences.\u201d\nAs of Friday afternoon, Musk was holding his fire, posting about his various companies on social media rather than attacking the president.\nTrump departed the White House for his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, without stopping to talk to reporters who shouted questions about his battle with Musk.\n\u201cI hope that both of them come back together because when the two of them are working together, we\u2019ll get a lot more done for America than when they\u2019re at cross purposes,\u201d senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, told Fox News host Sean Hannity.\nRepublicans \u2018unshaken\u2019 by Trump feud\nSenator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, sounded almost pained on social media as Trump and Musk volleyed insults at each other, sharing a photo composite of the two men and writing, \u201cBut \u2026 I really like both of them.\u201d\n\u201cWho else really wants @elonmusk and @realDonaldTrump to reconcile?\u201d Lee posted, later adding: \u201cRepost if you agree that the world is a better place with the Trump-Musk bromance fully intact.\u201d\nSo far, the feud between the president and the Tesla chief is probably best described as a moving target, with plenty of opportunities for escalation or detente.\nOne person familiar with the president\u2019s thinking said Musk wants to speak with Trump, but that the president does not want to do it \u2013 or at least do it on Friday.\nIn a series of conversations with television news presenters on Friday morning, Trump showed no interest in burying the hatchet."

      "text": "Elon Musk is not leaving the nation's capital quietly.\nThe Tesla CEO appeared in the Oval Office with President Trump Friday on his last day as a special government employee, after confirming his exit from Washington, D.C., in a post on X Wednesday night.\n\u201cThis is not the end of DOGE,\" Musk said while comparing his work with the Department of Government Efficiency to Buddhism, calling it \"a way of life.\" Musk offered at least his fourth different promise about what DOGE will save and noted that he will continue to provide advice to Trump.\nWhat Musk declined to do Friday was repeat his recent critiques of aspects of Trump's agenda.\nMusk stood by silently as Trump said his \"big, beautiful bill\" would \"cut deficits\" \u2014 a claim that nearly every outside observer and Mr. Musk himself have said is false.\nThe bill \"increases the budget deficit ... and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" he said.\nWhite House adviser Stephen Miller said this week on X that the bill would in fact reduce the deficit and that DOGE cuts would have to be formalized in subsequent legislation.\nThe world's richest man is making his views on a variety of subjects well known in Washington as he returns his attention to his many businesses, including Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX (SPAX.PVT).\nHe told Bloomberg last week that he is going to do less political spending in the future, saying \"I think I've done enough,\" and acknowledged to Ars Technica that \"I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics.\"\nHis ongoing feud with OpenAI's Sam Altman even became part of the Washington conversation after the Wall Street Journal reported that Musk pushed back against a deal announced last week that has OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and other tech giants building an AI data center in Abu Dhabi.\nThe Wall Street Journal and the New York Times reported that Musk tried to include his AI company, xAI, in the deal, but that didn't happen.\nMusk also made it clear this week that he is returning to the office so he can focus on his businesses, including Tesla, SpaceX, and X.\n\"Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,\" he said Tuesday on X, adding that he \"must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.\"\nTesla itself is gearing up for crucial robotaxi trials in Austin, starting at the end of July.\nMusk and Tesla have bet the future of the company on self-driving and the ability for its cars to perform robotaxi services. Tesla's dedicated robotaxi \u2014 the Cybercab \u2014 is slated for a 2026 launch as well. And Tesla's long-awaited, more affordable EVs are expected to be revealed in the first half of the year.\nMusk's return to work has been teased since April, when he said his time in D.C. would be dropping.\n\"Starting early next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk told investors on Tesla's Q1 earnings call. But reports showed Musk was still spending time in D.C. in April.\nLast week, during two separate interviews with Bloomberg and CNBC, Musk reiterated his rededication to his companies. He also said he sees himself in the Tesla CEO chair for at least the next five years.\nMusk and his DOGE allies rode into Washington months ago with giant promises to cut \"at least\" $2 trillion from the government's annual budget, an effort that has shown little results even after causing chaos among the federal workforce and seeing Musk recently take a step back.\nA tracker of real-time government spending from the Brookings Institution shows that overall government spending in calendar year 2025 is actually slightly up from 2024 spending levels, even as the effects of DOGE can clearly be seen on smaller agencies like the US Agency for International Development (USAID).\nIn an interview this week with the Washington Post, Musk lamented the criticism and opposition his cost-cutting project engendered, saying, \"DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything.\"\nMusk previously appeared to signal his opposition to the bill when he posted last week \u2014 as the bill was being debated \u2014 that \"the profligacy of government means that only radical improvements in productivity can save our country.\"\nThis week's CBS interview has seen him be much more specific.\n\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both,\" he joked, adding, \"My personal opinion.\"\nBut in a post on X Wednesday night, Musk struck a note of optimism: DOGE's mission, he said, \"will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\"\nAt one point on Friday, Musk sidestepped a question about what had been the biggest roadblock to his efforts, saying it's \"not any one person\" and suggesting DOGE would be an effort that would end up being successful.\nMusk was also asked Friday about a New York Times report that Musk allegedly abused both illicit and pharmaceutical drugs \"far more intensely than previously known\" while on the campaign trail for Trump.\nHe refused to answer a question about it. \"That New York Times? Let's move on,\" he said, after criticizing the New York Times' Pulitzer award on its Trump and Russia reporting, one that Trump has called the \"Russia hoax.\"\nMusk was also asked about what appeared to have a black eye near his right temple.\n\"I was horsing around with little X [Musk's son], and I said, 'Go ahead and punch me in the face,' and he did,\" Musk explained."
