      "importance": 3,
      "rationale": "SMB cloud spend is a sector‑specific macro driver with a medium‑term horizon (forecasted over the next two years). It influences cloud‑service and technology equities and can indirectly affect broader market sentiment, but it does not have the immediacy or cross‑asset transmission of core macro indicators. Therefore it aligns best with a medium‑importance level."
