  "title": "Labour needs to jump on the AI gravy train, not derail it",
  "description": "We can\u2019t hope to be world leaders in tech without getting real on pay \u2014 and that means paying top talent the big bucks",
  "content": "Ask AI how much tech folks get paid and the answer is: \u201cTech salaries in London and the UK vary significantly based on experience, role and specialisation. Entry-level positions may start around \u00a345,000, while experienced professionals can earn upwards of \u00a3120,000.\u201d Then comes this: \u201cThe tech industry is experiencing fluctuations due to factors like AI, which is impacting job demands and potentially leading to shifts in salary expectations.\u201d Finally, we get to: \u201cEmerging technologies are hot: roles requiring skills in areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud computing are seeing higher-than-average pay increases.\u201d Hot is one way of describing a tech industry in which a CEO has been hired on a salary of $94 million (\u00a369.5 million), or 1,300 times more than the company\u2019s average employee wage. The board of Lattice, a US chipmaker in Oregon, approved the payout to tech executive Ford Tamer to lure him from investment firm Francisco Partners. The company stresses that nearly all of his pay is tied to stock performance. Shares in Lattice rose 12 per cent on the day he was appointed. \u201cBy that metric, perhaps, Lattice shareholders have already gotten their money\u2019s worth,\u201d the local newspaper, The Oregonian, noted. Tech is matching, even surpassing, football for signing-on fees The point is that Lattice is little-known \u2014 it\u2019s not one of the giants. To hire someone like Tamer, 62, who has held down senior positions in Silicon Valley and elsewhere and has a PhD in engineering from MIT, shows the lengths firms must go to in order to attract top talent. Whatever the AI says with understatement, tech is matching, even surpassing, football for signing-on fees. There, it is not only the mightiest clubs that are having to find ever larger sums \u2014 the lesser teams are also feeling the trickle-down effect. They are still in the same market. Tamer\u2019s mega-bucks may be eye-popping to some but not to others. OpenAI chief Sam Altman has accused rival Meta of offering $100 million bonuses to AI engineers to jump ship, forcing his corporation to reassure staff it was \u201cseeking creative ways to recognise and reward top talent\u201d. It\u2019s not clear what that means exactly, since OpenAI is known for paying near the top of the market already. Expect details of even juicier packages to emerge. The war has prompted some seasoned observers to shake their heads at the craziness of it all. Kyle Langworthy, an AI recruitment specialist at Riviera Partners, described it as having \u201cjust become manically more hyper-intense\u201d. Certain companies, he said, \u201care willing to do anything or whatever it takes to bring that talent into the organisation\u201d.\n\nLast month, OpenAI gave its staff a week off to rest and recharge, only to see Meta exploit the unexpected company-wide break and use it to contact OpenAI staffers and pressure them into moving across. All of which is good news for digi hubs outside the Valley, with London at the forefront. As the US pool is drained, attention is turning elsewhere. How the UK\u2019s High Pay Centre, which campaigns for fairer pay, is going to deal with that remains to be seen. This week it published a report revealing the bosses of Britain\u2019s largest listed companies have taken home record high pay packets for the third successive year. Its analysis found the average FTSE 100 chief executive is now paid 122 times the salary of the average full-time UK worker, which begs the question \u2014 have they seen Tamer\u2019s 1,300 times? The median wage of a FTSE 100 chief climbed to \u00a34.58 million in the past year, up from \u00a34.29 million. The study revealed that FTSE 100 companies spent more than \u00a31 billion rewarding 217 executives. Heading the list were the current and former bosses of Melrose, the UK engineering company. Peter Dilnot and Simon Peckham between them collected \u00a359 million in the past 12 months. That was calculated largely on long-term incentive payments. Next were Andy Bird, current chief executive of education publisher Pearson and his predecessor Omar Abbosh, who together earned almost \u00a319 million. They relegated the FTSE 100\u2019s highest-paid boss for the last two years, Pascal Soriot of pharma giant Astra Zeneca, into third spot, with a still tidy \u00a314.7 million. The gender gap remains as strong as ever \u2014 the High Pay Centre survey discloses the median chief executive for the nine FTSE 100 companies run by a woman over the 12 months was \u00a33.27 million, versus \u00a34.64 million for those headed by a man. A view of the financial district of the City of London (Yui Mok/PA) (PA Archive) The think tank is calling for low and middle earners to receive a greater share of the pot. It is also seeking reforms to regulations governing the pay-setting process followed by corporates, including full implementation of Labour\u2019s employment rights bill. The proposed legislation requires that employers inform workers of their trade union rights, gives workers greater power to elect directors to company boards and introduces increased transparency regarding the reporting of pay. \u201cThe Government now needs to make sure these measures are implemented in full and supplemented by a real voice for elected worker directors in company boardrooms,\u201d said Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre. His plea and the report will be warmly received by many in Labour and add to pressure on Angela Rayner, who is driving the employment rights legislation, to push it through as soon as possible. That will only stoke tensions with business and the City, still reeling from Rachel Reeves\u2019s hike in employers\u2019 national insurance and contemplating further tax-raising in her next Budget, due in the autumn. It will fuel the feeling, too, that Labour sees the wealthy as fair game, and as the best route towards closing the yawning \u00a350 billion gap in the public finances. See also: The taxwoman cometh... with her sights set on London But it does so at a price. Evidence persists of some non-doms, targeted by Reeves, and members of the domestic rich, choosing to leave for more accommodating tax regimes, removing their spending and investment power. More are bound to follow if Labour continues down this path. At the same time, the Government claims to be pursuing \u201cfurther and faster\u201d economic growth, with AI and tech vital components in that charge. There is a real danger of London getting left behind as the result of political ideology There is a real danger of London getting left behind as the result of political ideology. US vice-president JD Vance, this summer\u2019s highest-profile UK holidaymaker, has criticised Europe for adopting a regulatory approach, stating that \u201cexcessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry\u201d. He said: \u201cWe need international regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology rather than strangle it, and we need our European friends, in particular, to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation.\u201d In America, it is all systems go and that means recruiting the brightest and best and paying whatever it takes. How long before our finest brains join the gravy train? We\u2019re keen to be world leaders in the development of AI and tech but that means getting real. Our unworldliness could prove to be our undoing. It is no good saying we want AI and tech if we are not prepared to pay for them.",

      "text": "Who is Sam Altman, as the CEO of OpenAI denies rape allegations made by sister?\nThe CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, is being sued by his sister, Annie Altman, who claims he sexually assaulted her for almost 10 years.\nThe abuse allegedly began when she was three and Mr Altman was 12, according to the lawsuit, which was submitted on January 6 to a US District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri.\nAccording to the claim, the abuse occurred \u201cseveral times per week\u201d starting with oral sex and progressing to penetration. Abuse left Ms Altman with \u201csevere emotional distress, mental anguish, and depression\u201d, which she says still affects her today.\nThe lawsuit further stated that the last alleged abuse occurred when she was still a minor and Mr Altman was an adult.\nA jury trial and damages of more than $75,000 (\u00a360,100) are being requested in the claim.\nTogether with his mother and two brothers, Mr Altman refuted the accusations in a joint statement on X, stating that \u201call of these claims are utterly untrue\u201d.\n\u201cCaring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult. This situation causes immense pain to our entire family.\u201d\nIn 2023, Mr Altman was abruptly ousted from the firm\u2019s board, as they citied a failure to be \u201ccandid in his communications\u201d, but was shortly reinstated as CEO due to pressure from investors and employees.\nMr Altman led OpenAI through a period of immense growth. Thanks to its hugely popular ChatGPT chatbot, which hit 100 million regular users within weeks of its launch, the San Francisco start-up was at the centre of an AI boom. Microsoft injected $10bn in funding into the company, and it was reportedly valued at $90bn.\nThe success saw Mr Altman become one of the most recognisable faces in tech, shooting to stardom alongside the likes of celebrity entrepreneurs Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg.\nSo who is the young tech entrepreneur and what are the other controversies that have affected his career?\nA childhood tech prodigy and a young LGBT pioneer\nAs a young Jewish boy growing up in St Louis, Missouri, it didn't take long for Mr Altman's technical prowess to become apparent.\nBy nursery school, he understood the system behind area codes, and had learned to program and disassemble a Macintosh at eight, according to the New Yorker.\nHaving a Mac computer also helped Mr Altman come to terms with his sexuality. \u201cGrowing up gay in the Midwest in the two-thousands was not the most awesome thing,\u201d he the New Yorker. \u201cAnd finding AOL chat rooms was transformative. Secrets are bad when you\u2019re 11 or 12.\u201d\nHe came out to his parents at 16. After a Christian group boycotted an assembly about sexuality at his school, Mr Altman announced that he was gay to all the pupils, and asked whether they wanted it to be a repressive or welcoming place.\n\u201cWhat Sam did changed the school,\u201d Mr Altman\u2019s college counsellor told the New Yorker. \u201cIt felt like someone had opened up a great big box full of all kinds of kids and let them out into the world.\u201d\nThe Stanford dropout to tech entrepreneur pipeline\nMr Altman went on to enrol at Stanford University. He spent two years studying computer science, before following the well-trodden tech entrepreneur path of dropping out of college to work full-time.\nHe founded Loopt with two of his classmates, a mobile app that told your friends where you were. One of Mr Altman\u2019s co-founders at Loopt, Nick Sivo, was also his boyfriend \u2013 the two dated for nine years.\nThe first summer after Mr Altman dropped out of college, he worked so tirelessly that he got scurvy. Loopt was part of the first group of eight companies at start-up accelerator Y Combinator. Each start-up got $6,000 per founder \u2013 Loopt was in the same batch as Reddit.\nAs CEO, Mr Altman raised more than $30m in venture capital for Loopt. However, the app failed to gain traction with enough users.\n\u201cWe had the optimistic view that location would be all-important,\u201d Mr Altman told the New Yorker.\nMr Altman and his co-founders sold Loopt in 2012 for $43m.\nShortly after selling Loopt, Mr Altman and Sivo split up. \u201cI thought I was going to marry him \u2013 very in love with him,\u201d Mr Altman admitted.\nTaking over at the helm of start-up investor Y Combinator\nAfter Loopt, Mr Altman founded a venture fund called Hydrazine Capital, and raised $21m. He invested 75 per cent of that money into YC companies, the parent company of Y Combinator.\nIn 2014, at the age of 28, Mr Altman was chosen by Y Combinator founder Paul Graham to succeed him as president of the company. In a 2014 blog post, Mr Altman said that the total valuation of Y Combinator companies had surpassed $65bn, including Airbnb, Dropbox, Zenefits, and Stripe.\nIn 2015, Mr Altman was featured on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for venture capital at age 29.\nBut it seems that Mr Altman has some history when it comes to shock departures from company boards. By 2019, Mr Altman had been relegated to chairman at YC. The following year, he said he would be leaving the board and continuing as an adviser \u2013 a role which he never formally assumed. As of early 2020, he was no longer affiliated with YC.\nFormer Bloomberg journalist Eric Newcomer wrote: \u201cAltman went from president, to chairman, to being an adviser, to having no affiliation with Y Combinator without much detailed reporting from the press. YC successfully swept, what seems to be a real schism, under the rug.\u201d\nThe role of a lifetime: OpenAI and ChatGPT\nAfter stepping away from YC, Mr Altman took on what would become the role of a lifetime, when he joined OpenAI as CEO.\nShortly after joining, at a StrictlyVC event in 2019, Mr Altman was asked how OpenAI planned to make a profit, and he said the \"honest answer is we have no idea\". But by the summer of 2019, he had helped raise $1bn from Microsoft.\nAfter Mr Altman took over as CEO, and after the investment from Microsoft, the company started focusing on developing natural language processing. Under Altman's leadership, OpenAI released popular generative AI tools to the public, including DALL-E and ChatGPT.\n\"Ctrl, Altman, Delete\": a role at Microsoft before returning to OpenAI\nIn a move that sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley, Mr Altman was abruptly sacked as OpenAI CEO in 2023 after a statement by the board saying that it \u201cno longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI\".\n\"We are grateful for Sam's many contributions to the founding and growth of OpenAI,\" a statement from OpenAI's board said. \"At the same time, we believe new leadership is necessary as we move forward.\"\nAlmost as abruptly as he had been fired, Mr Altman was then back at OpenAI\u2019s offices in talks about his potential rehiring. But those talks appeared to have fallen through.\nMr Nadella said that Mr Altman would instead be hired at Microsoft. The company appointed Altman and OpenAI\u2019s former president and co-founder, Greg Brockman, who had recently resigned, to lead a new advanced AI team at the company.\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely excited to share the news that Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, together with colleagues, will be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team. We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources needed for their success,\u201d Mr Nadella wrote on X at the time.\nHowever, the company was faced with a growing revolt among staff angry at Mr Altman\u2019s ousting. A letter from employees to the board said that the directors had \u201cundermined our mission and company\u201d by the way they let go of Altman and Brockman. According to reports, 747 employees out of 770 had called for the board to quit as of Monday evening.\nSo, after five days of chaotic boardroom drama, Mr Altman confirmed he had been reinstated as CEO of Open AI, under the supervision of a new board. Mr Brockman returned alongside him.\nElon Musk sues OpenAI\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its co-founders Mr Altman and Mr Brockman in March 2024, claiming they had breached their fiduciary responsibility and contract.\nMr Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI when it started out as a nonprofit in 2015 and currently leads a rival AI business called xAI.\nMr Musk has publicly chastised OpenAI for supposedly straying from its initial goal since leaving the board in 2018. Mr Musk is initiating legal action to prevent OpenAI from becoming a for-profit business.\nHe re-filed the complaint in federal court after withdrawing the initial one in a state court in San Francisco in June.\nIn a blog post, OpenAI retaliated against Mr Musk, asserting that in 2017, Musk \u201cnot only wanted, but actually created, a for-profit\u201d to operate as the business's suggested new structure.\nSexual abuse allegations of childhood abuse\nIn a lawsuit filed on January 6, Annie Altman claims her elder brother sexually assaulted her for nine years in the 1990s and 2000s, according to the Saint Louis Post Dispatch.\nThe lawsuit echoes assertions Ms Altman made in 2021 on social media, but this is the first time she has taken him to court.\nAccording to the Altman family, the lawsuit's allegations are untrue.\nThey wrote on X that they are worried for Ms Altman's wellbeing because she has struggled with mental health issues for a number of years. According to the Altmans, they have made numerous attempts to assist her, including providing her with financial support for a number of years."

      "text": "There is not yet a date for this year\u2019s Autumn Budget. But by convention it is normally a Wednesday, so October 29 and November 5 both look like good bets. For presentational reasons the Chancellor might want to give Bonfire Night a wide berth. The inevitability of Guy Fawkes-themed headlines about taxes \u201cgoing up like a rocket\u201d or a \u201cbonfire of broken promises\u201d will surely make nervous Treasury spin-doctors urge another day.\nWhatever the final choice, there are three months still to go and the summer holiday season is well under way. But Rachel Reeves is certain to be spending much of her time on the sun lounger inking in the broad outline of what is likely to prove a very difficult Budget presentation to MPs and voters.\nThe Chancellor also told the CBI conference last year that, having unleashed \u00a370 billion of extra public spending and \u00a340 billion of tax hikes in the 2024 Budget, she would \u201cnot come back with more borrowing or more taxes\u201d.\nBut, after a year of disappointing economic growth and bruising U-turns on welfare cuts, there is scarcely an economist in the City who does not believe she will be coming back for a second bite of the fiscal cherry.\nMost suggest a further round of tax hikes of at least \u00a315 billion and perhaps as much as \u00a330 billion a year will be needed to keep within her fiscal rules and still leave a modicum of safety margin in case something nasty comes along. As it almost always does.\nReeves will no doubt argue that the Government\u2019s new pledge to raise defence spending to three per cent of GDP in the next Parliament, and the geopolitical turmoil unleashed by Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, mean the goalposts have moved. What she may not mention is that Labour revolts on disability benefit and Winter Fuel Payment cuts are also very much in the frame for the deteriorating outlook for the public finances.\nSo her conundrum is this: how can she possibly load yet more taxes on heavily burdened families and businesses without further depressing the growth prospects for the British economy?\nIndividual taxpayers will be asked to bear the brunt \u2014 Londoners most of all\nOne thing we can probably be sure of. She is unlikely to go back to the business sector for more revenue, given the devastating economic and political fallout from the \u00a325 billion-a-year increase in employer National Insurance contributions that came into force in April.\nNo, this time it will be individual taxpayers who will be asked to bear the brunt, and Londoners are likely to feel it the worst.\nAn easy hit \u2014 and one the Chancellor could argue is technically not a tax rise at all \u2014 is extending the freeze on income tax thresholds rather than raising them in line with inflation.\nThese are a hangover from the days when Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt occupied Downing Street and were looking for clever ways to balance the books.\nThe freezes are scheduled to end in April 2028 but given the huge sums involved \u2014 they will have increased the annual tax take by nearly \u00a340 billion a year by the end of the decade \u2014 it seems odds-on the horizon will be extended.\nA pay rise in line with inflation will drag thousands of London middle earners into a tax band that was supposed to be paid only by bankers\nThis is a revenue-raising measure that is particularly focused on the capital. The threshold for the 40 per cent higher rate tax \u2013 originally designed with only the highest earners in mind \u2014 has stood at a relatively modest \u00a350,270 since 2021. But in London the median full-time salary already stands at \u00a347,455. That means a pay rise merely in line with inflation will drag thousands of London middle earners \u2014 teachers, nurses and PAs \u2014 into a tax band that was supposed to be paid only by company directors and City bankers.\nNevertheless, it feels nailed on. As Professor Joe Nellis, economic adviser at accountancy firm MHA, puts it: \u201cI would be shocked if she didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nAccording to the Institute of Fiscal Studies, prolonging the freeze for a further two years could raise an extra \u00a310 billion a year by 2030. For Reeves that is certainly useful money, although not enough to be fully comfortable.\nSo where will the extra money come from? There has been much noise on Labour backbenches about a wealth tax, a hare set running by party grandee Lord Kinnock. But most academic studies show this is a complex and highly ineffective mechanism since many of those targeted by it can simply relocate elsewhere. The Government would also be unlikely to double down on the UK\u2019s damaged image among the global elite following the scrapping of the non-dom regime.\nNonetheless, the rumours have not been definitively killed off by Downing Street. Some observers suggest the public are being softened up for some form of \u201cwealth tax lite\u201d. This could include reducing or scrapping the \u00a3500,000 inheritance tax-free allowance for passing on the family home to \u201cdirect descendants.\u201d\nIt would be astonishing, too, if the Treasury number crunchers are not eyeing up the low-hanging fruit of pension tax relief, a giveaway now worth an astronomical \u00a370 billion in gross terms.\nAreas that Reeves might consider fair game include salary sacrifice, when staff forgo part of their pay packet in return for the same amount going into a workplace pension. It is a useful perk, particularly for employees caught in the \u201csix-figure tax trap\u201d which inflicts a punitive 60 per cent marginal tax rate on those earning just over \u00a3100,000.\nAll will be revealed in about 90 days, when Reeves faces the unenviable task of looking the country in the eye, confessing that the current level of taxation is not enough and say, in the words of Oliver Twist: \u201cI want some more.\u201d"

      "text": "He waved his hand in the direction of an empty car park next to the office on Al Maryah Island where we were meeting.\nIt was, explained, His Excellency Hareb Almheiri, executive director at the Abu Dhabi Investment Office, the site chosen for the emirate\u2019s first Mayfair-style private members club. When the deal is agreed it is likely to be a British backed investment for a British brand, who knows, perhaps Soho House itself, though Hareb was not telling.\nAbu Dhabi, along with its fellow UAE emirate Dubai, wants a slice of the British millionaire exodus action. Its rulers understand that the wealthy families pouring out of London, have certain lifestyle requirements the fast growing Gulf city-state cannot currently offer. Private members\u2019 clubs are one. Top British public schools of the sort admired by the global elite the world over are another. To that end Harrow is scheduled to open two schools, one in Abu Dhabi and one in Dubai, in 2026.\nThis is the flipside of the well publicised \u201cgold rush\u201d of record numbers of millionaires away from London, now no longer seen as a friendly, welcoming haven for the high spending super-rich in the way that it is undoubtedly was a decade ago.\nThe reality is that London has been slowly falling out of favour for more than a decade\nLondon\u2019s loss is of course other cities\u2019 gain, hence the huge efforts being made in Europe, the Middle East and Asia to pull them into their orbits through lures such as golden visa schemes as well as those trappings of W1 life coming soon to Abu Dhabi.\nThe reality is that London has been slowly falling out of favour for more than a decade. Arguably the rot started to set in as long ago as 2013 when the Chancellor George Osborne slapped a 15% stamp duty rate on more expensive London homes being bought through a company, a device often used by wealthy overseas buyers keen to keep their identity under wraps. Although politically popular the move was seen as a distinctly unfriendly move from a country that had benefitted hugely from foreign investment since the \u201cBig Bang\u201d deregulation of the City\u2019s financial market opened the floodgates in the Eighties.\nBrexit and the \u201cfive Prime Ministers\u201d years of political chaos that followed the referendum made more many more question their faith in the essential stability of the UK that is one of its biggest attractions.\nBut the final straw for many came with the abolition of the non-dom regime that for centuries had allowed wealthy UK residents to shield their foreign assets and income from British taxation. The axe for non-dom status had first been announced by then Chancellor Jeremy Hunt in the 2024 Budget after his boss Rishi Sunak suffered some awkward headlines over his wife Akshata Murty\u2019s tax arrangements.\nBut Labour doubled down with further restrictions after the July election, bringing, for example, the worldwide assets of anyone resident in the UK for 10 years or more within the scope of inheritance tax.\nForeign born wealthy residents of London who had long considered themselves adoptive Londoners no longer felt welcome\nThe move enraged many of the foreign born wealthy residents of London who had long considered themselves adoptive Londoners, but now no longer felt welcome. Other headline Labour policies, such as the introduction of VAT on private schools, added to the sense of grievance.\nThe result has been an outflow of millionaires from London on a scale that would have once been unthinkable. Last year the millionaire trickle that began in 2016, the year of the EU Referendum, became a torrent with 10,800 departures of \u201chigh net worth individuals\u201d with at least $1 million in liquid investable assets, according to figures from residence and citizenship advisers Henley & Partners.\nPhilippe Amarante, head of the firm\u2019s Dubai office, said he had seen an unprecedented 54% spike in the number of Britons looking at investment or \u201cmigration options\u201d to the emirate over the past year.\nHe said clients complained of the \u201cnegative business sentiments and high taxes. Some just don\u2019t want to be associated with the UK anymore, some even want to revoke their British citizenship, I\u2019ve never seen that before. I\u2019m shocked by that. I\u2019m German but I lived in London for seven years and I\u2019m a big fan of England.\u201d\nEven some of London\u2019s longest standing foreign born residents are reconsidering their futures. Miami-born entrepreneur and investor David Giampaolo came to London in 1987 - the year after Big Bang - when he set up the The Barbican Health and Fitness Centre. He now heads the Pi Capital investor club, and has been described as \u201cLondon\u2019s most networked man.\u201d\nI\u2019d leave because of crime, lack of an entrepreneurial environment, an extreme woke agenda\nEntrepreneur and investor David Giampaolo\nBut after 38 years in London he said has never been more disillusioned with the outlook for UK, particularly as his two daughters had already left the country because of the bleak prospects.\nHe told the Standard: \u201cI am a dual US and British citizen and pay taxes in both countries. I would never leave the UK for taxes, however I would leave for other reasons, like crime, lack of wealth creation opportunities, lack of an entrepreneurial environment, an extreme woke agenda, lack of career opportunities for my children, lack of good infrastructure, an incoherent immigration policy with illegal immigration out of control.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI love this country, my children were born and educated here, and I care deeply about its place in the world, and that is why I am not afraid to speak up.\u201d\nPaul Finch, new home director at high end estate agency Beauchamp Estates spoke of a similar example of an Indian born but UK educated London mansion owner with deep roots in the UK now looking to ship out.\nFinch said: \u201cHe told me \u2018I\u2019ve had enough, non-dom status being scrapped, well that was it so far as I\u2019m concerned.\u2019\u201d\nFor veteran London estate agent Trevor Abrahmsohn the Government made an \u201cidiotic\u201d error when it abolished the non-dom regime outright. He said: \u201dWhat a clever person would have done is say \u201cyou want to live in the UK then you have to pay a fixed levy.\u2019 And the cost of staying here is not \u00a330,000 a year, it\u2019s \u00a3150,000, or it\u2019s \u00a3200,000. And people would pay that. Then we would have got to keep all the VAT they pay over here, all the employment they create.\u201d\nThe fundamental appeal that attracted so many of the world\u2019s wealthiest to London in the first place remains largely intact\nIf there is hope for London it is that the fundamental appeal that attracted so many of the world\u2019s wealthiest in the first place remains largely intact. Paul Finch said he would expect some of those quitting the capital in the current wave of departures to be back \u201cwith their tails between their legs\u201d because the places they exiled themselves to \u201care not all they are cracked up to be.\u201d\nThere are also some indications the penny has begun to drop for the Government too with Chancellor Rachel Reeves revealing in Davos she will water down the non-dom reforms through an amendment to the Finance Bill. But it may be too little too late to restore the global reputation of the battered UK brand. The scene is moving on and the fear is that Britain will inevitably be the poorer for it."

  "argos_summary": "Tech salaries in the UK range from about \u00a345,000 for entry\u2011level roles to over \u00a3120,000 for experienced specialists, but the sector is also seeing extreme executive pay, such as a $94\u202fmillion CEO payout at Lattice, sparking debate over pay inequality. The article links this to a broader trend of high\u2011pay tech talent being lured globally, prompting the UK High Pay Centre to report record FTSE\u202f100 CEO compensation and call for reforms. Meanwhile, the government faces pressure to balance tax hikes, non\u2011dom status changes and investment in AI and tech to keep London competitive, while many wealthy residents are leaving the city. The piece also highlights the intense competition between AI firms like OpenAI and Meta, and the political debate over regulation and fiscal policy.",
