      "text": "I demoed the new AirPods Pro 2 hearing test \u2014 and here's how it went\nIn case you missed it, the AirPods Pro 2, alongside a new hearing protection perk (a noise reduction feature that's great for concert goers), now supports a new hearing test experience.\nMashable was on the ground for the \"Glowtime\" Apple Event in Cupertino, so I had a chance to demo the new hearing test feature on the AirPods Pro 2.\nHearing Test on AirPods Pro 2: How does it work?\nLaunching the hearing test was super easy. All I had to do was, of course, pop in the AirPods Pro 2 into my ears. Next, on an iPhone, I had to tap on \"[Name] AirPods Pro 2\" in the Settings app followed by the \"Take a Hearing Test\" option.\nI provided some details such as my age and whether I had a cold or an infection. The preliminary questions also inquired about whether I was in a loud environment like a loud concert or a construction site within the last 24 hours.\nI hit \"Next,\" and suddenly, I felt the active noise cancellation (ANC) feature kick in. The hearing test requires a quiet room, but even so, the ANC helps to cancel out any white noise that may affect the test.\nAfter going through a few more prompts, the test (based on pure-tone audiometry) launched and asked me to tap on the screen if I heard a tone. After about two minutes of tapping, I got my results \u2014 and it's not looking good for me.\nMy hearing test results: Moderate hearing loss\nAs it turns out, according to the AirPods Pro 2 hearing test, I have \"moderate hearing loss.\"\nTo be clear, these were not my real results. It's just a demo that showcases what users will see when they go through with this hearing test from start to finish.\nIn the demo, which, again, are not my real results, I got the following:\nLeft Ear - 41 dB HL (decibels hearing level)\nRight Ear - 44 dB HL\nIn other words, if I received these results in real life, it would mean that I need sounds to be 41 decibels louder for my left ear and 44 decibels louder for my right ear compared to normal hearing levels in order to detect them.\nAccording to a chart from the American Speech-Language Hearing Association, here is a table that classifies hearing loss:\n\"Users [can share their] results with their healthcare providers for more informed conversations,\" Apple said in a press release.\nI can't wait to tell my fianc\u00e9 that I have \"moderate hearing loss\"; He doesn't need to know that this was just a demo. I can now get away with using \"selective hearing\" on him \u2014 and get away with it, too.\nIt's worth noting that the AirPods Pro 2 also doubles as over-the-counter (OTC), clinical-grade hearing aids. Since I apparently have \"moderate hearing loss,\" I'm going to need 'em.\nBoth the hearing test and hearing aids feature are expected to roll out in the fall to over 100 countries, including the United States. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 start at $249 via the official Apple Store, but as of this writing, you can snag 'em for just $199 via Amazon.\nUPDATE: Sep. 10, 2024, 4:51 p.m. EDT This article was updated to specify that this demo did not generate real results.\nKimberly Gedeon, at Mashable since 2023, is a tech explorer who enjoys doing deep dives into the most popular gadgets, from the latest iPhones to the most immersive VR headsets.

That's a 30% saving on the list price.\nThe release of newer iPads has meant that the faithful 10th Gen iPad has been discontinued. While you can still find models at some retailers, it is no longer listed on the Apple website.\nNewer is sometimes good, but the iPad (10th Gen) holds a special place in my heart. It may now be \"outdated,\" but this is still my favorite iPad. And we're in luck, because Amazon still has some in stock, and better yet, it's on sale right now.\nAs of Aug. 12, you can find the iPad (10th Gen) reduced to $349 from $499, saving you $150 on the list price. All colors except yellow have sold out, so don't hang around too long. It's also specific to just the WiFi-only, 256GB option.\nThe Apple iPad (10th Gen) boasts a sleek, modern design, perfect for work or entertainment on the go. It has a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display and the A14 Bionic chip that delivers super powerful performance for multitasking, whether you're browsing, gaming, or working.\nI've been using this model for over a year, and the battery life still never fails to impress. If you're someone on the go a lot, this is the model for you.\nAnd the cameras are impressive, too. The 12MP Ultra Wide front camera is ideal for video calls and keeps you centered, so you always look your best. The back camera is also 12MP and can shoot in 4K video.\nGet this iPad deal from Amazon before it sells out.\nLois Mackenzie is a freelance reporter at Mashable.

      "text": "The 9 best earbuds to buy in 2025, selected by Mashable audio experts\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nIf you're in the market for a new pair of earbuds, we have good news: You have a lot of options. The bad news? You have a lot of options, and your decision can get overwhelming fast. Wasn't life easier when iPhones came with a free pair of earbuds?\nWhile you can still find wired earbuds that plug in and go (you'll even find a pair on this list), the market is flooded with wireless options. Now, you'll find models with advanced noise cancellation to block out the sounds of busy coffee shops and commutes. Plus, a good pair should have a quality microphone so you can take calls on the go. And the good news is, you have a lot of options for quality earbuds.\nPrices on earbuds range anywhere from $10 to $1,000, especially if you're going for professional-grade studio earphones. And if you care about noise cancellation, you can easily spend $300 \u2014 that's the price of peace and quiet. And these days, you can get hyperspecialized models like sleep earbuds.\nOur top picks for earbuds are the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and Panasonic Technics AZ100s, which provide outstanding sound quality \u2014 but keep in mind, both of these models cost $299. While we stand by the value of everything on this list, we know that spending $300 on a pair of headphones is a lot to stomach.\nMajor shopping events like Black Friday and Prime Day, are usually the best time to buy these gadgets; however, good deals pop up year-round, and we're particularly good at tracking them.\nReady to start shopping now? Here are our top earbud picks of 2025.\nEach pair of earbuds selected for this guide was hands-on tested by a Mashable staffer or contributor. Along with earbuds tested specifically for this article, we also combed through our existing reviews to pick the best of the best earbuds for 2025. In addition to the bang for your buck, when testing earbuds, we consider criteria such as:\nFor the Anker Soundcore P20i and Sony WF-1000XM5, we tested their battery life by letting the earbuds run interrupted with music at 50% volume until they died. For the remaining earbuds, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds and Apple AirPods Pro, we referred to the battery tests conducted when we first reviewed them.\nWe tested out these earbuds with a variety of songs, from live performances to bass-heavy electronic music, R&B, rock, and folksy guitar songs. We evaluated how they sounded out of the box, along with any EQ presets or custom controls. Realistically, you'll make calls when using your earbuds, which is why we put each of these earbuds through a call test, making sure the person on the other end of the phone could hear us clearly and consistently.\nThough this category can be subjective, we made sure each of our selections at least had several different ear tip sizes and were comfortable to wear for stretches of three hours or more.\nEspecially for pricier earbuds, we took into consideration what they offered beyond a solid listening experience. In Sony's case, that was an incredibly customizable and user-friendly experience with the equalizer. For the Soundcore earbuds, that was the \"find device\" capability (considering the buds' price range) and general app compatibility. Basically, any feature that made the earbuds stand out and also performed consistently well earned points in this category.\nPanasonic Technics EAH-AZ100 wireless earbuds\nBest earbuds for sound\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Creates rich, textured sound\n- Well-balanced audio\n- Connects to three Bluetooth devices at once\n- Exceptional active noise cancellation\n- Good for small ears\n- Uncomfortable for all-day wear\n- Expensive price point\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Panasonic Technics EAH-AZ100 earbuds.\nWho it's for\nPanasonic's Technics EAH-AZ100 wireless earbuds are made for audiophiles. If you want to hear every note in perfect crisp detailed sound, these headphones make music better thanks to their magnetic fluid drivers. Whether you want a fully customizable experience by adjusting your bass and treble, or you just want to pop in your buds and experience delicious spatial audio without the fuss, the Technics offer users both.\nWhy we picked this\nPanasonic blew us away with its Technics EAH-AZ100 earbuds. If you've ever thought that earbuds can't deliver the same potent sound quality as over-ear headphones, then let the AZ100s prove you wrong. The buds come with four different ear tips that range from extra small to large, delivering a snug and secure fit suitable for even those with small or narrow ears who struggle to find earbuds that fit. That being said, they aren't the most comfortable headphones we've ever tested (nothing beats the Bose QuietComfort Ultras), as they get uncomfortable after a couple of hours of wear.\nHowever, what you're really after here is the incredible sound quality of the Technics. Music just sounds better on the AZ100 earbuds. The earbuds deliver music as close to the source as possible. While listening to James Brown's \"The Boss,\" the song sounded rich and textured, with layers of horn and deep bass bursting through. Plus, it picks up on the most subtle details, like in \"Angel Of My Dreams\" by Jade, the soft shuttering of cameras flashing on the backing track rang through in crisp detail.\nPlus, these headphones have impressive active noise cancellation. While testing them on a trip to New York, they blocked out the clatter of the subway and ruckus of noisy streets. With such excellent ANC, nothing distracts from the superior audio quality. The three-way multipoint connection is another huge advantage of these headphones. I could seamlessly switch between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Pro without having to open the app.\nNot to mention, these earbuds have killer battery life. They last for 10 hours with an additional 28 hours available with the charging case.\nDetails\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds\nBest noise-cancelling earbuds\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Unbeatable noise cancellation\n- Comfortable and secure fit\n- Long battery life\n- Easy connectivity\n- Can be difficult to remove from charging case\nOur review\nCheck out our full review of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds.\nWho it's for\nFor those who value noise cancellation above all else, the $299 Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds are worth the investment, offering the best ANC experience we've had with a pair of earbuds. With spatial audio, these earbuds deliver immersive sound that envelopes you in your music.\nWhy we picked this\nOver-ear headphones are the typical pick for those who want the best noise cancellation, but in recent years, high-end earbuds have started to prove themselves worthy competitors. Bose is already known for offering some of the best ANC, so it's no shock that the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds are some of the best the brand has to offer.\nMashable contributor Timothy Beck Werth said that these earbuds offer the best ANC of any he's tested, a lineup that includes products from Apple, Beats, and Jabra. In fact, he writes, \"Bose's noise cancellation is so good that I often use these earbuds when I'm not even listening to music.\" Customizable stability bands help create a tight but comfortable seal that helps unwanted sound stay out (and sets these earbuds apart from other ANC buds on the market).\nThough we appreciate the QuietComfort Ultra's noise-cancellation first and foremost, we also enjoyed Bose's foray into spatial audio with the Immersive Audio feature that can be toggled on and adjusted via the companion app. It's good, not great, and definitely not the top reason to get these earbuds, but still a pretty nice feature \u2014 and certainly welcome at this price point.\nSpeaking of the price point, we were shocked that at $299, these earbuds don't offer functional multipoint pairing. While you can technically connect more than one device at a time, you do have to manually change your device with the app, instead of switching back and forth simply by changing your audio output, like you can with the Sony WF-1000XM5 or AirPods Pro. While we do think Bose needs to update this feature ASAP, the ANC, combined with the comfort for long-term wear and sound quality, still earned these earbuds a spot on our list.\nDetails\nAnker Soundcore P20i earbuds\nBest budget earbuds\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Good sound quality\n- Has find device feature\n- Long battery life\n- No noise cancellation\n- No multi-point connection\nWho it's for\nIf you don't want to be too precious about your earbuds (there's nothing wrong with being accident-prone) the Anker Soundcore P20i earbuds will be the kindest to your wallet, while still delivering an all-around decent listening experience. If ANC is essential for you though, you'll want to pass on these buds.\nWhy we picked this\nWe'll be honest: We weren't expecting much from a pair of earbuds that cost less than $40. However, we were shocked to find that these earbuds not only had an impressive array of features, but in some cases also had better features than earbuds that cost hundreds of dollars more.\nFirst, let's start with the sound. Admittedly, we weren't too blown away by how they sounded at first. However, once we played around with the equalizer presets on the companion app, we found the Treble Boost produced the kind of well-rounded sound we expect from pricier earbuds. The app also allowed you to set up to three touch controls on each earbud, which actually worked decently well once we played around with them (the touch controls have just the right level of sensitivity). However, the most exciting feature in the app was the \"find device\" tab. Unlike Apple AirPods, which only play a sound from the case when you're trying to find your earbuds, the Soundcore earbuds each play a loud tone when you activate this feature, making it easier to locate a single bud.\nThe P20i buds also best AirPods in battery life. Per charge, we were able to get about nine-and-a-half to 10 hours of battery life. The case overall holds 30 hours of charge total. Admittedly, these earbuds don't have ANC, so that helps, but we were still impressed. (For comparison, the most recent AirPods Pro and standard AirPods without ANC offer six hours per charge).\nObviously, a budget pair of earbuds will have some more noticeable drawbacks. For the P20i, that would be the lack of multipoint pairing. Not only can you not pair more than one device at a time, but we also found that we often had to manually unpair the earbuds from one device before pairing with another. The lack of pairing capability also meant that to use the companion app, you have to be connected to your phone.\nDetails\nApple AirPods Pro (USB-C)\nBest for Apple users\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Great sound\n- Solid noise cancellation\n- Long battery life\n- Easy connection to iOS and Mac devices\n- Only one size of ear tips\n- Works best on iOS\n- More expensive than the AirPods 4 with noise cancellation\nOur review\nCheck out our full review of the USB-C AirPods Pro.\nWho it's for\nApple device owners will appreciate how easily these earbuds pair with multiple devices and their impressive active noise cancellation.\nWhy we picked this\nThe AirPods Pro are incredibly popular for several reasons. They produce a sound that's rich and well-balanced, they have excellent noise cancellation (that falls just behind the Bose QC Ultras), and they work seamlessly within the Apple ecosystem.\nWhat exactly does that mean? Whereas earbuds like the aforementioned Ultras might struggle to pair, and then swap between, an iPhone and an iPad quickly, the AirPods Pro were built to do exactly that. And as you'd expect from an Apple product, they do have some nice features built around convenience. In addition to great ANC and sound, Apple hones your listening experience with three modes: Conversational Awareness, which automatically lowers the volume of your music when you're talking to someone and raises it when you're done; Adaptive Audio, which functions as an ultra-smart transparency mode; and Personalized Volume, which automatically adjusts the volume based on your environment.\nOutside of those listening modes, you also get lossless audio support with the Apple Vision Pro (in case you happen to own the $3,500 headset). With the new USB-C port, you can also charge the case by connecting it to any iPhone 15 device, though we don't consider that the most useful feature out there. If you're not a fan of touch controls, you're also likely to appreciate that the touch commands only require you to press the stem of the earbuds. Our biggest gripe with these earbuds? Even though they sound great, they don't offer customizable EQ like Bose and Sony.\nDetails\nAnker Soundcore Sleep A20 earbuds\nBest sleep earbuds\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Allows you to stream sleep sounds from app or your own audio\n- Tracks sleep data\n- Earbuds and case have great battery life\n- Affordably priced\n- Smaller case takes up less nightstand real estate\n- Touch controls don't get activated while you're sleeping\n- Comes with six different earbud tips, with three for noise blocking and three for breathability\n- Can't perform certain actions on app without both earbuds in\n- Sleep sound library is limited\n- App design could be more streamlined\n- Earbud tips have slightly tacky texture\nWho it's for\nIf you want sleep earbuds that give you the flexibility of streaming audio or simply acting as fancier earplugs, the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20 will get the job done at an affordable price. They're not without some quirks, but on the whole, they offer the best feature-to-price-point ratio.\nWhy we picked this\nIt was hard to pinpoint any stark differences in performance between these and a premium sleep earbuds model, which, considering their $150 price difference, is pretty impressive on Soundcore's part.\nThe Soundcore buds promised more battery life per charge, which I didn't really notice as both buds easily hit the eight-hour range. However, I did notice that the case held 80 hours of charge, meaning I didn't have to charge it for a week, while I had to recharge the other sleep earbuds models after two nights of using them. The Soundcore buds also connected with my device with noticeably less lag than other models.\nSo, where did they show their lower price point? Maybe this is more personal preference, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sleep sound library on the Soundcore app. A lot of the sounds felt too busy and too loud, even at lower volumes. One night, when I was testing out a feature that switches the audio from Bluetooth streaming to white noise when the earbuds detect you've fallen asleep, the sound of the white noise literally woke me up because of how loud it was. Admittedly, this was because of the volume I set it at, but only because the volume sounded fine (low even!) on the podcast I was streaming, and I didn't exactly expect the white noise from the Soundcore app to be significantly louder.\nWhen playing around with the controls later in the daylight hours, I found the highest volume literally hurt my ears \u2014 thankfully, setting it that high is avoidable, but it did feel like these headphones could've used a better safeguard in terms of volume. After all, it's not like you can quickly adjust the volume when you're unconscious. In terms of the automatic switching feature, I found that it usually jumped the gun. Sometimes, I'd just settle down to close my eyes, and the earbuds would switch over (an issue I didn't experience with more premium models).\nIn terms of flaws, those were the only major ones I noticed. The buds stayed in my ears and felt comfortable to use while lying on my side. The Soundcore ear tips are silicone and feel slightly tacky \u2014 it didn't bother me, but my partner couldn't stand the feeling, so if you deal with any sensory sensitivity, it's something to be aware of. My audio streamed reliably (if, again, a little on the loud side), and the touch controls worked perfectly when I used them, but never accidentally triggered at night while I slept. In general, I didn't find myself using the touch controls to adjust the volume or switch between modes all that much, but they still felt like a nice addition.\nThe Soundcore earbuds also offer sleep data, which can be stored on the earbuds for up to a week (with a sync required to get the info in your app). I've never used any sort of sleep-tracking device before, but from the few times I've used sleep-tracking apps on my phone, these earbuds offered more accurate and detailed data on how I slept, from how long to how many times I tossed and turned.\nDetails\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds\nBest mid-budget pick\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Amazing sound quality\n- Solid noise cancellation\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Affordable\n- App UX could use some improvement\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Bose QuietComfort earbuds.\nWho it\u2019s for\nIf you want good-quality sound but don\u2019t want to spend over $200, the Bose QuietComfort is an affordable answer to the brand\u2019s line-up. They\u2019re focused on a great fit, as they not only come with multiple ear tips but multiple bands that can be changed out on the earbuds for a better fit on the crest of your ear.\nThe accompanying app lets you adjust audio levels, but you won\u2019t need to, as these earbuds make all your music sound better. They\u2019re reliable, have a long battery life, and are sure to please the pickiest of audiophiles.\nWhy we picked this\nI\u2019ve sung the praises of the QuietComfort Ultra, but Bose\u2019s latest earbuds, the entry-level QuietComfort, are also fantastic, especially with their under-$200 price tag. Even after adjusting the ear tips and bands, I didn\u2019t find the fit on these quite as secure as the Ultras. However, my colleague Bethany Allard, who also tested the QuietComfort earbuds, said they were the best earbuds that have ever fit her.\nThe QuietComfort\u2019s sound quality is just phenomenal. With these earbuds, listening to Ethel Cain\u2019s A House in Nebraska immersed me in the orchestrations. When Brick House by The Commodores came on, the earbuds elevated the snappy drum beats so that I may have been listening live.\nThe noise cancellation on the QuietComfort earbuds isn\u2019t as sophisticated as the Ultras; I found they had more sound leakage and that classic ANC buzz when I was in noisy environments. However, the ANC on these is still great, especially in quiet spaces.\nOne tiny beef I have with the Bose QuietComfort earbuds is that they require a different app than the standard Bose one. This is annoying if you\u2019re an existing Bose user and need to download another app; plus, this earbud app just isn\u2019t as good as Bose\u2019s flagship app.\nAll in all, these are a solid pair of headphones that, for $179, are an unbeatable value.\nDetails\nSony WF-1000XM5\nBest Sony earbuds\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Includes multiple ear tips sizes for snug fit\n- Amazing audio quality\n- Good noise cancellation\n- Handy touch controls\n- Occasional connectivity issues\n- Sony app could be better\nWho it's for\nPeople who enjoy great active noise cancellation and even better sound quality will appreciate the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds \u2014 the full package. If you're a Sony loyalist, maybe already a fan of the WH-1000XM5, these earbuds provide impressive performance.\nWhy we picked this\nEven if you're not a full-blown audiophile, we're betting you'd be impressed by just how good these earbuds sound. Though they're great when you plug and play, the highly customizable equalizer allows these earbuds to really shine. If you're not quite sure what you enjoy when it comes to EQ, no problem.\nThe companion app has a \"find your equalizer\" feature that lets you play a song and select between six EQ settings to find the one that sounds best to your ears. Once you do, you get more options to select, with that choice marking the \"custom\" EQ you like best. To make sure you're satisfied, the app then lets you easily compare the new and original settings side by side. That's just one of several sound features built into the app that allow you to customize your experience, far surpassing every other pair of earbuds on this list.\nWear-wise, the ear tips on these buds forego the usual silicone for a foamier alternative that's more reminiscent of the material you might expect from earplugs. We found this material to wear comfortably and snugly, staying in place in your ear better than AirPods typically do. On a further design note, these are also a great option for folks who don't like the stemmed look made popular by AirPods.\nFinally, the ANC. You're paying high-end prices for these earbuds, and they do deliver on high-end ANC. If noise cancellation is your biggest concern, you might want to go for the Bose earbuds instead, but these still do an excellent job (plus, their multipoint pairing actually works, unlike Bose's). We will say that with ANC on, we did tend to get closer to seven hours of listening time before running out of juice, instead of the eight Sony claims.\nThese used to be our best earbuds for sound, however, the Panasonic Technics edge them out as they offer clearer, more distinct sound. Plus, the Technics have two extra hours of battery life on the WF-1000XM5s.\nDetails\nBeats Fit Pro\nBest for working out\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Responsive touch controls\n- Multiple ear tips included\n- Easy connectivity on iOS\n- Secure fit\n- Active noise cancellation a little weak\nOur review\nCheck out our full review of the Beats Fit Pro.\nWho it's for\nBeats Fit Pro earbuds check the boxes for most athletes. These small buds fit comfortably in ears, and three different sizes of ear tips create a comfortable, secure fit. With active noise cancellation, the buds block out noise so you can focus on your workout. However, there is still some noise leakage, which isn't a bad thing if you need to remain aware of your surroundings for safety.\nIf you like touch controls, the Fit Pro have a clickable button that makes it easy to take calls or play/pause music. Despite being built into the iOS system, Beats buds work for iPhone and Android users alike with easy connectivity.\nWhy we picked this\nYou can't beat the quick connectivity of the Beats Fit Pro. As an iOS user, I just had to open the case for the Beats Fit Pro to connect nearly instantly. Earbuds can be a tough fit for me, so I appreciated the multiple-sized ear tips that created the most secure fit.\nIt took me a second to get comfortable with the Beats Fit Pro, but the wing-tipped design kept them secure in my ear as I moved through my workouts. They can still fall out, particularly if you're bending over, but they're much more secure than typical earbuds. While I was initially very impressed with these earbuds' secure fit, I discovered that newer earbuds like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds stay in place even better.\nWhat I initially really loved about the design was the touch controls. While most headphones don't have actual buttons to use for touch controls, these do, making it a breeze to take calls. However, that makes it a little too easy to end calls \u2014 I accidentally ended a call or two while using these earbuds.\nThe sound quality on the Beats Fit Pro is excellent. The active noise cancellation dimmed the busy world around me so I could tune into my podcast while I was working out. I did find that the ANC got a little buzzy around loud noises as it worked harder to block them out, and ultimately, I found it a little distracting. With an IPX4 rating, they're water-resistant, making me confident that my sweat or a sudden rainstorm wouldn't cause any damage.\nDetails\nMarshall Mode\nBest wired earbuds\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Clear sound output\n- No need for charging\n- Quality built-in mic\n- No replacement wires\nWho it's for\nWhether you're looking to save some cash, prefer the better signal that wired headphones can offer, or simply hate charging earbuds, these Marshall Mode earbuds are sure to satisfy.\nWhy we picked this\nWe know it's 2025 and everyone has Bluetooth everything, but some people genuinely prefer wired headphones. For those people, we recommend the Marshall Mode headphones.\nAs you would expect from wired headphones, these earbuds aren't too terribly expensive at $59.99 (though you can often find them on sale in the $39 to $49 range. Despite their affordability, they produce clean, well-rounded audio comparable to earbuds in the $100-plus price range. The wire itself is lightweight but durable and not at all tangle-prone, making these earbuds plenty comfortable to wear for long stretches of time. We do wish it was detachable, and therefore replaceable, but that's not a dealbreaker, especially at this price point.\nThe mic works well for calls, and it's separate from the remote button that allows you to answer and hang up calls, as well as play and pause your music. There isn't too much more to say about these earbuds beyond this: They do what you expect them to do.\nDetails\nTypes of earbuds\nThere are two types of earbuds: wireless and wired. While those descriptors are self-explanatory, let's get into the specifics of both.\nWireless\nWireless earbuds connect to devices via Bluetooth for cordless usage. These earbuds range from $20 budget models to high-end models with active noise cancellation. While they don't require a wire to connect to a device, some wireless earbuds still have a wire that might go around the back of the neck to connect the buds.\nWhile earbuds traditionally don't provide the passive noise cancellation of over-the-ear headphones, wireless models often feature ANC, which electronically blocks out background noise. With wireless headphones, you need to consider the battery life. Most models should have an eight-hour or more battery life before they need to be recharged.\nWired\nWired earbuds are the original model: two buds connected by a wire to your audio source. While they once felt high tech, they're pretty basic now. Wired earbuds with active noise cancellation are basically non-existent, and you won't find any on our list.\nThe biggest positive to wired headphones is that they don't need to be charged. They're a great backup option to keep in your bag in case your usual wireless headphones or earbuds run out of charge.\nNew additions to this guide\nAfter extensive testing, Mashable Lead Shopping Reporter Bethany Allard rounded up the best sleep earbuds. You can read her full guide, but as of May 2025, we've added the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20 to this guide, which Allard says are the best sleep earbuds for most people.\nWhat are the best wireless Bluetooth earbuds?\nIf you're just looking for a pair of everyday wireless earbuds, all but one of the models in this guide will check that box. (We also included the Marshall Mode wired earbuds as an option for folks who don't want to worry about battery.) If you're looking for the highest quality wireless earbuds, you can't go wrong with the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and Panasonic Technics EAH-AZ100 earbuds, our most recent recommendation in 2025. Both of these wireless earbuds feature elite noise-cancellation, stellar sound, long battery life, and a comfortable fit for extended wear.\nStill, this guide includes several other earbuds we stand behind. Apple users may prefer the AirPods Pro, while shoppers on a budget may prefer buds from Marshall or Anker Soundcore. If you need help picking the perfect pair, read on.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThough most earbuds are now wireless, this ultimately comes down to preference. If you have a tighter budget or don't want to worry about the battery running low all the time, wired earbuds are a great option. With that said, it is significantly harder to find wired earbuds with active noise cancellation (we're working on tracking down and testing a few pairs like this). So, if ANC is a priority for you, you'll be better off with a pair of wireless earbuds.\nTo help you decide, we put a range of wired and wireless earbuds to the test to determine which are worth your money. Whether you're simply looking for earbuds to get you through the work day, a pair to take with you on a flight, or a pair that you can live in 24/7, we have a set of buds for you. And if nothing on this list stands out too much, you can always expand your search to headphones as well.\nAs long as they're Bluetooth-compatible, these earbuds should connect to any smartphone, tablet, or laptop regardless of operating system. All of the earbuds on this list work equally well across iOS and Android systems with one exception \u2014 Apple AirPods.\nOur favorite AirPods, the Apple AirPods Pro are great and will connect to an Android device, but you won't get the same ease of connectivity or full array of features. However, other earbuds like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds and the Panasonic Technics AZ100 feature Android apps so you can experience their full range of features on an Android device.\nBethany Allard is a Los Angeles-based shopping reporter at Mashable covering beauty tech, dating, sex and relationships, and headphones.

      "text": "When it comes to AirPods, Apple is clearly in no rush to disturb the status quo.\nIt took three years for Apple to evolve its AirPods line and release the AirPods Pro in 2019, a more premium pair of wireless earbuds with improved sound and features like active noise cancelation, but also a higher price tag.\nAnd here we are another three years later with an upgrade simply called the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). The new AirPods Pro look very similar to the older model and have the same $250 price, but come with a number of small improvements, including more powerful active noise cancelation, a new feature called Adaptive Transparency, and better battery life.\nI tested the new AirPods Pro for about a week and I can tell you that these earbuds are great, though they might not be worth the upgrade if you already own the original AirPods Pro.\nNot really that different\nLet's get one thing out of the way: No one will notice that you're wearing the second-generation AirPods Pro. They look the same as the old AirPods Pro, with a short stem, an elliptical white head adorned with black speaker grilles, and a silicone ear tip.\nThere's an additional, extra-small silicone tip included in the box now, but otherwise, the design is the same, down to the way these tips are clipped onto the buds.\nEven the white charging case appears unchanged, unless you look really closely and notice the lanyard loop on the side and the three speaker holes on the bottom next to the Lightning port (yes, the new AirPods Pro still use the Lightning charging cable).\nFor more details about the look, feel, and setup, you can check out our review of the original AirPods Pro. That's how similar these two models are.\nThe good news about that design consistency? They're still really comfortable. The silicone tip they came with fit me alright, but I also tried the largest one and the fit was even more snug. They never fell out, even during intense workouts. I was able to wear them for hours without noticing they were in my ears.\nI even put them to the ultimate test: I played some relaxing music and took a nap while wearing them, and they caused me no discomfort. I guess that's one reason why Apple hasn't changed much in the design \u2014 it was pretty good the first time around.\nAs for the touch commands, they're good but not perfect. Pressing the stem to play/pause and skip to the next track works well. Pressing and holding the stem to activate the transparency mode and noise cancelation, however, is a bit hit or miss. When someone's talking to you and you want to hear them by enabling transparency mode, there's a one-second wait to activate the feature which feels a bit too long. Also, adjusting the volume by sliding your finger up or down the stem takes some getting used to \u2014 and it never really worked perfectly for me.\nSmall improvements, some more noticeable than others\nHere's a quick laundry list of what's new in the AirPods Pro (2nd generation):\nActive noise cancelation has been improved and now blocks \"twice as much noise,\" according to Apple\nAdaptive Transparency is a new feature that allows you to hear sounds around you while still reducing unwanted noise\nBattery life is now 6 hours (vs. 4.5 hours on the previous generation model); With active noise cancelation on, the charging case delivers a total of 30 hours of listening time\nImproved sound thanks to the new, low-distortion audio driver and custom amplifier\nBluetooth 5.3 support (vs. Bluetooth 5.0 on the previous generation model)\nApple's new H2 chip\nThe battery life for the new AirPods Pro was indeed as advertised as I managed to squeeze roughly 7 hours out of one charge. Though note that, to achieve this result, I combined audio playback with intermittent use of noise cancelation and adaptive transparency modes. If you're carrying your case with you, rest assured that battery life will never be an issue. But even without the case, these earbuds will have plenty of juice for very long commutes.\nThe new AirPods Pro have Bluetooth 5.3 support, which is a big upgrade compared to the Bluetooth 5.0 on the original AirPods Pro, bringing improved sound quality and energy efficiency. There was speculation that the new AirPods Pro would support lossless audio quality, but Apple never mentioned it. (We've asked Apple about it and will update this article when we hear back.)\nBluetooth 5.3 doesn't support lossless audio on its own, but Qualcomm does have a chip which offers lossless audio over this standard, so it's possible that Apple plans to introduce the feature at a later date. It's hard to say whether it would be noticeable as the sound is really good (more on that later), but it is a bummer given that lossless is one of Apple Music's key features.\nAs for the new Adaptive Transparency feature, well, it works a little differently than on other headphones I've used. Instead of letting sounds from the outside world in and turning down the volume, the new AirPods Pro leave the volume at the same level. This is good if you want to listen to music while being aware of your surroundings, but it's not ideal when you just need to hear what the person next to you is saying. The \"adaptive\" part of Adaptive Transparency didn't really do much for me. Perhaps the feature really kicks in during very specific situations, such as an ambulance siren blaring nearby, but I didn't notice it.\nFinally, a replacement for over-ear headphones?\nThe improved sound and active noise cancelation are the most important new features of the AirPods Pro. This is where Apple has really delivered.\nThe first time I turned on active noise cancelation while walking down a busy street, I was in awe. The sounds around me disappeared almost completely, which I didn't expect from a pair of wireless earbuds. I turned the music off and some of the street noise came through the silence, but the roaring cars were reduced to a manageable hiss, and everything but the loudest of yells was toned down enough to be barely noticeable.\nIn some aspects, the active noise cancelation was even better than on my daily drivers: B&W's excellent PX7 over-ear headphones. For example, the new AirPods Pro were better at canceling the noise of people talking (again, this may not be ideal for people who want to drown out background noise but still be available when someone talks to them). These are the first pair of earbuds I'd actually consider taking on an airplane (instead of my much larger and clunkier over-ear headphones).\nBut is the sound good enough?\nI'm happy to report that it is. I've put the new AirPods Pro through a very diverse palette of genres, mostly on Apple Music's highest quality settings. They handled Ryan Adams' acoustic performance in Carnegie Hall just as well as they did All Them Witches' dirty hard rock sounds on their self-titled album, The Knife's electronic masterpiece Silent Shout, and the math metal grinder of Meshuggah's Immutable.\nI've always gotten plenty of bass from the new AirPods Pro without it being over the top, as well as crisp vocals, and even some sense of the sound stage on live performances. Modern headphones are sometimes tuned for a couple of popular genres and fall apart when given something radically different, but the new AirPods Pro did an equally good job with complex jazz performances and very heavy guitar tunes.\nThere are minor issues that I fixed by tweaking the settings. For example, while listening to Interpol's Fables, I realized the sound was muddled and the back vocals near the end of the song were way louder than they should have been. I fixed that by turning off Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio in the settings. It's a known issue with Apple's implementation of spatialized audio \u2014 it just doesn't work for every song.\nThe details, both pleasing and annoying\nThe new AirPods Pro have a number of tiny improvements which likely won't make you spend the cash for an upgrade (especially if you have the last generation AirPods Pro), but they do add up. For example, the MagSafe Charging Case is now sweat- and water-resistant. It has a loop for easier carrying and it can be charged with the Apple Watch's wireless charger.\nAlso, the earbuds now have sensors for in-ear detection, which mostly worked well, but occasionally I'd only get one earbud to work, with the other stubbornly \"detecting\" that it's not in my ear.\nThis did not happen often, but it's these little issues, as well as the occasional random disconnection from the music source, that make me yearn for the days of cabled headphones. Fortunately, I didn't encounter these problems with the second-generation AirPods Pro very often.\nFirst-time buy? Yes. Upgrade? Maybe.\nThe AirPods Pro (2nd generation) are a great pair of wireless earbuds. They sound wonderful and have almost uncanny active noise cancelation. Apple also upgraded them in myriad little ways, though you probably won't notice some of them. For a first-time buyer who can afford the $250 price tag, they're a no-brainer.\nIf you're thinking about upgrading from the first-generation AirPods Pro, however, the choice is not so easy. The new AirPods Pro look about the same on the outside and the improvements, while numerous, are mostly minor. You won't regret buying them, but they're not an essential upgrade."

RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards.

If, despite this request, you do send us any unsolicited ideas or materials, we make no assurances that such ideas or materials will be treated as confidential or proprietary. 14. Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law.
