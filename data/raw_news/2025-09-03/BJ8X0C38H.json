  "title": "Pharma, Opendoor, Tesla: Trending Stocks",
  "description": "Tesla (TSLA) stock is at a crossroads: while Elon Musk highlights the potential growth boost from robotics, pressure mounts amid continued sales slump in Europe and the end of some key US subsidies. Opendoor (OPEN) shares are now up more than 750% in three months, as viral social media posts drive new excitement around the real estate platform. Pharma firms Cytokinetics (CYTK), Ionis (IONS) and United Therapeutics (UTHR) all soar more than 30%.",
  "content": "Welcome back. Well, here are the tickets you need to watch this morning. First up, pharmaceutical stocks are on a tear. Just look at this board.\n\nCytokinetics ticker CYTK closed up around 40% is up around 40%.\n\nIonis Pharmaceuticals, IONS, surged nearly 35% and United Therapeutics is up about 33% there as you can see.\n\nNow, all three are now stable in the pre-market, but keep an eye on them when the bell rings.\n\nThese moves are being driven by investor enthusiasm over recent clinical developments in trials for these three companies.\n\nAnd while the details of each company's strategy for respective new therapies are still unfolding.\n\nNow, if you step back and take a look at this group of pharma stocks this morning, well, the coordinated strength across multiple biotech names is a clear standout.\n\nWe'll keep watching this space also as a as global trade negotiations continue to influence stocks in the pharma sector.\n\nOkay, next up is Open Door, which is making the buzz again. The open ticker has grown more and more popular with retail investors, and it's climbing another 2 and a half%, another 5.8%, sorry, in the pre-market following a strong close last night.\n\nOpen door closed up more than 14% last night. Shares are continuing to rally this morning, building on renewed interest from retail investors, following a couple of viral social media posts that got many people excited.\n\nAnd this has been a pattern for a few months now.\n\nThe chart below, chart we just saw, showed that shares of the real estate platform are up more than 750%, that's right, 700, there it is, 750% in the past three months.\n\nBut many many analysts continue to be skeptical that the fundamentals justify such a rally.\n\nAgain, today, the latest moves in this stock echo earlier meme stock behavior that helped spark earlier spikes.\n\nAnd finally, let's talk about another big name, Tesla. It remains in focus as it's facing some of its biggest challenges yet.\n\nWhile its sales are plummeting in Europe and other parts of the world, Tesla grapples with the end of some key government subsidies supporting electric vehicle sales in the US.\n\nShares are steady in the pre-market, up a little bit there as you can see, over 1 and a half% and are trading around the $335 mark after a couple of choppy trading sessions for the EV maker, which has been struggling in recent months.\n\nAs competition from Chinese and European electric vehicles grows, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been stressing that the future of the company is in robots, aka Optimus, artificial intelligence and autonomous cars.\n\nBut Elon Musk has acknowledged that the current headwinds could lead to a few rough quarters for the company.",
