  "title": "The 10 most exciting Premier League transfers for the 2025-26 season",
  "description": "These are the most exciting new arrivals in the Premier League going into the new season",
  "content": "On Friday evening, it all begins again.\n\nThe Premier League gets underway on Friday when defending champions Liverpool face Bournemouth \u2014 but even the title holders look very different this season.\n\nMany clubs have reshaped their squads over the summer, bringing in new players who will change how they play.\n\nSo, who are the arrivals you should be most excited to see? Who should you be keeping an eye on?\n\nThe Athletic\u2019s expert writers have pulled together a list of the 10 most exciting summer transfers. Let us take you through some potential new Premier League stars\u2026\n\nThe striker who has, for years, been lauded as one of Europe\u2019s brightest prospects finally comes to English shores.\n\nArsenal looked to be his destination when the summer started, then Newcastle United made a major push \u2014 but ultimately, it is the red of Manchester United that Sesko will wear in the Premier League.\n\nUnited have tracked Sesko since he was 16 at Slovenian club Domzale, before attempting to sign him three more times when he was at Red Bull Salzburg and RB Leipzig. Seeing if the wait was worth it will be fascinating.\n\nThat his debut should come against Arsenal, the team who held serious talks for him in June, adds a layer of fun. Fans who travel to Old Trafford each week in search of something to get excited about will hope Sesko can deliver.\n\nThe 22-year-old is tall, fast, and carries a cannon of a shot \u2014 qualities that can get fans out of their seats. The mood at United is building once again.\n\nThe gem of German football could find space in a telephone box.\n\nHe will duck and weave his way through opposition back lines and add creativity to a Liverpool side already packed with talent. The only question that remains is exactly how quickly he\u2019ll get up to speed.\n\nWirtz, who appears battle-hardened from his time at Bayer Leverkusen, knows all eyes will be on him this season as his \u00a3116million ($157m) move could break the British record if add-ons are achieved, but the 22-year-old has insisted he is not feeling any pressure.\n\nLiverpool believe they have one of the best attacking midfielders in the world and expect him to develop into an even greater talent in the years ahead.\n\nIt is hard to think of a more exciting signing throughout the Premier League. Mikel Arteta\u2019s side has been screaming out for a striker, and now they have the most prolific forward in Europe over the last two seasons, as his record proves.\n\nHis 97 goals in 102 games in all competitions for Sporting CP across the 2023-24 and 2024-25 campaigns are unmatched. It will be fascinating to see how the 27-year-old adapts to England\u2019s top flight, having previously scored 39 goals in two full Championship seasons for Coventry City.\n\nOver the last couple of seasons, Arsenal have been closer to winning their first Premier League title since 2003-04, and there is every chance Gyokeres\u2019 goals can finally get them over the line.\n\nSeemingly destined for Liverpool last year until he turned them down, Zubimendi\u2019s desire to work with Arteta was a big factor in this summer\u2019s move.\n\nHe may not score many goals or register plenty of assists but the all-round excellence he showed at Real Sociedad will likely make the 26-year-old a key cog as Arsenal push for domestic and European glory.\n\nPremier League fans have become accustomed to the very best young Brazilian talents heading to Barcelona or Real Madrid, but Chelsea have bucked the trend with Estevao.\n\nThe 18-year-old, regarded by many in Brazil as being the brightest prospect the country has produced since Neymar, is keen to prove himself in England. He served notice of his ability by scoring a sensational goal against Chelsea at the Club World Cup in his final match for Palmeiras.\n\nHe will need time to adjust to his new surroundings and, in particular, to adapt his skinny frame to the physical intensity of Premier League football. Chelsea will not rush him, but expect enough flashes of dazzling skill and speed on the pitch this season to justify the anticipation.\n\nBe prepared for fun and entertainment from Liverpool\u2019s new right-sided utility man.\n\nFrimpong is full of tricks and silky skills and will be part of a new-look attacking unit, even if he starts at right-back for Arne Slot\u2019s side.\n\nLiverpool have stressed that the 24-year-old is not a direct replacement for Trent Alexander-Arnold, and that he is instead part of a group of players who can fill in.\n\nWhen Mohamed Salah is at the Africa Cup of Nations, Frimpong is expected to be his deputy. Look out for electric pace down the right wing \u2014 and some wild celebrations if he scores. Frimpong is creative, explosive, and a regular goal threat.\n\nThe former France Under-21 international striker has enjoyed a rapid rise. In less than three years, Barry went from playing for Sochaux\u2019s B side, in the fifth tier of French football, to La Liga. During his sole season at Villarreal, he scored 11 goals to help them qualify for the Champions League before making a move to Everton for an initial \u00a327.5m.\n\nAt 6ft 5in (196cm), Barry possesses the height to dominate in the air. He won nearly two-thirds of the aerial duels he contested in the penalty area last season \u2014 of players who competed for 30 or more in Europe\u2019s biggest leagues, only Atletico Madrid striker Alexander Sorloth and Everton\u2019s central defender James Tarkowski can better that rate. He also has the pace to be a threat in transition, even if he remains a work in progress.\n\n\u201cWe said he is not going to be ready immediately,\u201d Everton manager David Moyes said. \u201cHe has a lot of attributes very similar to Beto \u2014 maybe, in some ways, too similar. But we needed another striker\u2026 he got some goals in La Liga. In a few years, we are hoping to build him up to be a really good player.\u201d\n\nSunderland broke their transfer record to sign Diarra this summer, sending an initial \u00a327.3m Strasbourg\u2019s way for a midfielder who, despite only turning 21 in January, captained Liam Rosenior\u2019s side to seventh in Ligue 1 last season. Diarra was a key part of a team that pushed hard for an unlikely Champions League qualification spot, eventually falling three points short.\n\nSunderland needed a midfielder capable of doing the lot this season, and the pre-season signs have been promising. Diarra scored from 20 yards in Saturday\u2019s 1-0 friendly win in Augsburg and was unlucky not to nab an assist, with his perfect slide-rule pass to Eliezer Mayenda taking two midfielders out of the game and splitting the centre-backs.\n\nPossession might come to be a privilege for Sunderland this season, but Diarra will be key in their survival bid. Across pre-season, he has been everywhere, whether that means holding position to break up play or driving forward on the counter with strength. His youthful energy should dovetail with the experience of 32-year-old Granit Xhaka.\n\nFor a relatively imposing 6ft 3in forward, there\u2019s a softness to Hugo Ekitike\u2019s feet. It\u2019s why his skills will take opponents by surprise in the early days.\n\nHaving already shown his quality in front of goal with a stunning strike in the Community Shield, Ekitike is going to be a handful this season.\n\nHe links up play, is prepared to drop deep if needed, and is a nuisance out of possession with his clever movement. If he can form a strong relationship with Wirtz, they will light up the Premier League.\n\nDoes the old warning about not signing players on the back of a good World Cup extend to an excellent Club World Cup? No matter, Wolves fans are excited about seeing one of the stars of the inaugural tournament this summer in black and gold next season.\n\nThe club\u2019s pursuit of the Colombia international pre-dates his stellar showing for Fluminense in the United States. They have admired him for a while and believe he is the kind of talented \u2018baller\u2019 who will get fans out of their seats and perhaps mitigate the loss of Matheus Cunha.",

      "text": "Amid the swirl of delirium and chaos following Everton\u2019s 2-2 draw against Liverpool in February, one player embarked on an individual lap of honour.\nBeto scored the opening goal of the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park and an upturn in form under the returning David Moyes imbued the striker with fresh confidence.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cTo tell you the truth,\u201d says Beto, \u201cI had thought the derby was just (another) game. But within the club, people like Seamus (Coleman) and Tony, the kit man, were saying, \u2018You guys need to beat them\u2019.\n\u201cPlaying in that game, I fully understood this. I was like, \u2018Wow, this is really good\u2019; the tackles, they go strong, we go strong, they give it to me and I give it to them. I love this \u2014 the battle. Now the derby is in my blood. I don\u2019t want to lose any game, but that game \u2014 I really don\u2019t want to lose it.\u201d\nUndefeated in 16 of their final 19 top-flight matches under Moyes last season, Everton owed much to Beto, the 6ft 4in (193cm) forward who had toiled during his first 16 months at the club.\nSigned under Sean Dyche for an initial fee of \u00a321.5million ($28.5m) in August 2023, Beto scored three Premier League goals in his first season, and he had only one to his name in his second when Moyes took over in January.\nThe 27-year-old says he was on the brink of a move to Italy \u2014 only for an injury to Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the win at Brighton on January 25 to force Everton to keep him. From there, Beto scored crucial goals against Leicester City, Liverpool, Crystal Palace and Manchester United as Everton soared to safety. The striker, who Moyes describes as \u201crough and raucous\u201d, transformed himself into a cult hero.\nSpeaking to The Athletic in a hotel lobby during Everton\u2019s pre-season tour in New York City, Beto reflects, in absorbing detail, on a life and career that has taken him from playing in car parks on the outskirts of Lisbon, via a job at fast-food chain KFC, to a striker in the most competitive league in world football.\nBeto grew up in the coastal municipality of Cascais, around half an hour\u2019s drive from the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. He describes growing up in a \u201cproject\u201d neighbourhood \u2014 essentially a form of social housing. \u201cI liked it a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much; we didn\u2019t have parks or football pitches, but we played two-vs-two, or three-vs-three games in car parks.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHe wanted to play locally for a club team as a child, but the costs to register stretched the family\u2019s budget. \u201cFor Mum (Filomena), we didn\u2019t have so much money to spend on extra activities. For Mum, football was just a side activity. She preferred school, school, school.\u201d\nBeto, a Guinea-Bissau international, played football at break time and realised, despite his lack of practice, that his level was higher than many of his peers. His mum relented at the age of nine and he started to play at the weekends.\nAt home, access to the internet and satellite television was rare, meaning he watched very little football. \u201cOne day, we were choosing the number of the jersey on my shirt and I didn\u2019t have any role model in football to refer to.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a striker, you need to wear the No 9 like Samuel Eto\u2019o\u2019. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know (who) Eto\u2019o (is), but, OK, I can be No 9\u2019.\u201d\nThat summer, in 2009, Barcelona played the Champions League final against Man United, and Eto\u2019o scored.\n\u201cMy friend\u2019s family lived on the ground floor of my building and had television access. I was by the window outside watching the game. I saw the goal and Eto\u2019o\u2019s celebration and thought, \u2018This is the guy they all told me about\u2019. So I said, \u2018OK, let me follow this guy\u2019. He became my idol.\u201d\nLater, when he bought a mobile phone, he watched video compilations of Eto\u2019o\u2019s goals. He later became inspired by players such as Didier Drogba, Romelu Lukaku and Christian Benteke. He saw in their stories, as Black players who overcame challenging upbringings, a little of himself.\n\u201cIt makes you think, \u2018Maybe, just maybe, I can do it, too\u2019. You never know.\u201d\nBeto\u2019s beginnings in football were not conventional. He spent only one year in an elite academy before being released by Benfica at the age of 14. He then spent two years barely playing before making his start in senior football in the Portuguese amateur leagues.\n\u201cWhen I was at Benfica, I didn\u2019t think about being a professional. I was afraid. I could feel and always knew I was not at their level. So when they released me, I said, \u2018It\u2019s OK with me. I\u2019m not as good as I thought I was\u2019. It was a reality check.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI spent two years in no man\u2019s land. I was doing stupid stuff \u2014 I wasn\u2019t playing, I wasn\u2019t studying\u2026 I was thinking I don\u2019t care about the world. My mum took me out from football because I wasn\u2019t behaving well in school.\n\u201cI have one thing in my mind from Benfica. I asked one guy, \u2018Do you think you\u2019re going to be professional?\u2019. He said, \u2018Yes, of course\u2019. I was like, \u2018F*****g hell, this guy is not afraid\u2019. He said: \u2018If I\u2019m not professional here, I will be professional in another place\u2019. I wasn\u2019t thinking like that. I was afraid to say it.\u201d\nAs Beto\u2019s potential career teetered, he threw himself into earning money. He worked at KFC. \u201cIt was good. I always wanted to earn my own money. Until I was 15 or 16, I acted spoiled. I tried to have what my friends in school had and I didn\u2019t have the awareness that my mum couldn\u2019t afford things.\n\u201cMy friend would say his dad paid for his driving licence, and I would go home and ask my mum for a driving licence. Now, with time, I see the things that my mum personally went through for me and my sisters.\n\u201cThe first job I did was working in the woodland cutting the weeds. I did one month of work, they paid me \u20ac300. Every day, I was happy to go to work because I knew I would have my reward. I gave my mum some of it to help her pay the bills. She wanted me to go through college, but I told her I can\u2019t go. It was too boring. I just didn\u2019t have interest at all. I would go there and want to sleep. I said, \u2018No, this is not for me\u2019. One thing was sure; if I was not going to college, I would not be allowed to sit at home. I needed to put money in the house.\u201d\nPlaying amateur football, he would work in the day and train at night, before playing games on a Sunday \u2014 his one day off.\n\u201cEvery form of work is good to humble yourself,\u201d he says, recalling the shifts at KFC. Beto played at amateur and lower-league levels for Uniao Tires and Olimpico Montijo before breaking into the top flight with Portimonense. He earned a move to Udinese in Serie A and then Everton.\n\u201cMum gave me discipline. She and my sister educated me, so I never went to the wrong side. I remember when I told her I want to make it as a professional. For me to have even been thinking about the Premier League is just like\u2026 You are kidding! I knew the minimum salary for a professional footballer in Portugal was \u20ac1,250. No one in our family earned a thousand. I just thought if I became professional, I can help pay the bills.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cEven in Italy, I never thought that I would go to England. But then Everton came! Everton of Lukaku! My mind was saying Lukaku played there, Eto\u2019o played there. So if I could play in Everton, it would be a dream. I think I\u2019m blessed.\u201d\nBeto is thoughtful about his unusual football education. \u201cIt helps me in some ways, but in some aspects of my game, I miss those basics that you learn when you are in an academy.\n\u201cIt is the simplest things; passing one touch, receiving the ball, holding the ball. You learn these in professional academies because you do repetition, whereas at the smallest clubs like mine, we just go there, train, and it\u2019s less specific.\u201d\nMoyes tells The Athletic that \u201cthe modern-day centre-half wants to be no-contact, but Beto wants to do things differently \u2014 he is running in behind, he\u2019s a powerful, big boy, he\u2019s got bits about him which you wouldn\u2019t enjoy playing against\u201d. He adds, \u201cA lot of managers would say they\u2019re always worried about Beto. His unpredictability for us\u2026 is certainly the same for the defenders as well.\u201d\nIn Italy, Beto learned from other leading strikers. \u201cThe first time I saw aura was Zlatan Ibrahimovic. We drew 1-1, I scored and he scored. When I played against Lukaku, he recognised me. He said, \u2018You are playing better, keep going\u2019. I was very happy. I said, \u2018Wow, I made it. These small things are really good for me\u2019.\u201d\nBeto admits to finding his start to life at Everton challenging. \u201cEverything was too physical,\u201d he says. \u201cThe intensity killed me. I wasn\u2019t playing well. I started losing confidence. Without confidence, I can\u2019t do nothing. It was a tough season, but it was good to train my mind because it was stressful.\n\u201cI was going home and looking at my videos from Italy and saying, \u2018But I can play football, why is it not working?\u2019. You question yourself a lot and this is the worst part. It was a blessing, too, because I learned from that.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMoyes says Beto\u2019s determination stands out: \u201cEvery day we are saying, \u2018Come on, will you come off the training ground?\u2019. He really is trying to improve in everything he does.\u201d\nBeto says, \u201cI care about training. It brings me fire. If training goes not so well, I want to do extra \u2014 just to feed myself a little.\u201d\nIn his first season, Beto struggled with the criticism he received on social media. \u201cIt was not easy. I used to (pay attention). If I or Everton posted a picture, I would go to the comments and they might say Beto was not good today. This is not good to read because you can be strong, but you\u2019re going to create something in your subconscious by taking all the comments in. If you care about the criticism, whether it is good or bad, it can make you shake. The ego is a difficult thing to balance.\u201d\nLast summer, ahead of the new season, he worked overtime to prepare his body for the rigours of a full Premier League season. \u201cIf I get my fitness right for the Premier League, I think I can smash everyone. This was my mindset. I trained so hard in the off-season. The beginning of the season wasn\u2019t the way I wanted. By the end, all the work that I put in paid off.\u201d\nThe challenge now, as Everton seek to strengthen their forward line, is to do it all over again.\n\u201cI have a goal target, but that is personal. Nobody knows it \u2014 even the manager. I want to be a better player and goalscorer than I was last season.\u201d\n(Top photo: Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"

      "text": "\u201cFlorian Wirtz has a problem,\u201d read a story in 11Freunde, the German football magazine. \u201cHe has already scored the goal of his life.\u201d\nIt was December 2019. Wirtz was 16 and still months away from making his Bundesliga debut. Playing for Koln Under-17s against Wuppertaler SV, he received a pass from kick-off, took a touch, and lofted a shot over the opposition goalkeeper from inside the centre-circle.\nIt took 5.05 seconds and, long before the \u20ac136.3million (\u00a3116m; $157m) deal which is due to take him to Liverpool as potentially the most expensive player in Premier League history, it was a goal that made him a star.\n\u201cEveryone was talking about that goal,\u201d says Martin Heck, who coached Wirtz and Koln Under-17s to the German national title just a few months before, \u201cand he just started to get bigger and bigger. I think it was then that he recognised that football is not only about playing games and training. That was the point when his career became more public.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHe was the Jahrhunderttalent: the once-in-a-century talent.\nWirtz was raised in Pulheim, a Rheinland town of 50,000, 20km from Koln. Home had no video games and rarely a television. As a young boy, Wirtz would often go to friends\u2019 houses to watch football.\nIn the summer, the whole family \u2014 Florian, his mother and father, his sister Juliane and an assortment of their eight half-brothers and half-sisters \u2014 would pile into a van and head for camping holidays. And there was always football.\nWirtz and Juliane \u2014 today a professional footballer for Werder Bremen in the Frauen-Bundesliga \u2014 were just 18 months apart in age and would play against each other in cages around the campsite or join games with other children.\nIt was the same at home, where footballs would be scattered around the Wirtz living room, where Juliane and Florian were always playing, one-on-one on the carpet, with cupboards and a table for goals. When Juliane made her debut for Germany\u2019s under-15s, he was in the stands. In early 2025, when they both suffered injuries, they did part of their rehabilitation together in Leverkusen.\nBut back to the living room, where wine glasses got broken and where, at mealtime, even when he was carrying his plate to the table, Florian still had a ball under his feet.\n\u201cWhat sets him apart,\u201d Gerardo Seoane, his future Bayer Leverkusen coach, said at a press conference in 2021, \u201cis that he is very, very clear-headed in the final third. He has nerves of steel and keeps a picture of what\u2019s happening, giving him the quality to make the right decision.\u201d\nBy Wirtz\u2019s own telling, those qualities can be traced back to the family\u2019s (presumably) well-worn carpet.\n\u201cAre you the modern home office version of the street footballer?\u201d he was asked by a journalist from Suddeutsche Zeitung shortly before the 2024 European Championship. \u201cAre you the living room footballer?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, \u201cI learnt a lot.\u201d\nAt six, he joined SV Grun-Weiss Brauweiler, his local club.\nHis father was a coach and the long-time head of youth. Today, Hans Wirtz is Brauweiler\u2019s president and Florian\u2019s representative. But he is never described as a pushy parent or one who forced the game upon his son or daughter.\n\u201cAs a kid, it was all about having fun while playing. For both of us, it was just cool to go to soccer games with our father on the weekends,\u201d Florian told 11Freunde in 2022.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe certainly wasn\u2019t overly ambitious and he didn\u2019t just push us to football after school. But he still taught us a lot.\u201d\nKarin, Florian\u2019s mother, is also part of his management team. A former handball player and coach, she discovered one of Germany\u2019s biggest handball stars, Julian Koster, when he was a child. Today, she and Hans exist between football stadiums. Whenever Juliane or Florian are playing matches, they are almost always in the stands supporting, alongside other members of their family.\n\u201cI think his parents were and still are the key to his success,\u201d Martin Heck, his under-17 coach, says. \u201cAway from the pitch, Flo was shy and his life didn\u2019t move too quickly. His parents tried to protect him from some things that are not good for young players.\n\u201cI remember once there was an article in Sports Bild in Germany, where they showed a potential national team for 2028, and there was his name. I said to him, \u2018Hey, did you see? You\u2019re a national team player in 2028!\u2019 And he didn\u2019t even know the publication \u2014 and it\u2019s one of the biggest in Germany.\n\u201cHe had no mobile phone at that time, either. A big part of the success is the protection his family have given him. I always appreciated how they were determined not to just take the fast train to professional football, but to go the healthy way.\u201d\nThe route took him to nearby Koln, joining their academy in 2011. Heck remembers the first time he saw him play. Wirtz stood out, but not in a way that was typical.\n\u201cFlo would become my player in the under-17 team,\u201d says Heck, \u201cbut I knew him before because my best friend was his coach for three years when he was between the ages of 10 and 13. He was that outstandingly good that you had to pay attention. So, I knew him five or six years before he came to me.\n\u201cWhen he was 15, he already played like a professional in the Bundesliga. It was not only his skills and his technique, but the game he played in his mind. He played football like it was chess and he did things you normally don\u2019t see in youth players. He would think about what comes in the second or third phase, after passing the ball. It was amazing.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBut when anyone asks me, \u2018What\u2019s special about Florian Wirtz?\u2019, I say that he has the greatest ambition I\u2019ve ever seen in football from a player, young or old. His will to win. You could see that when he was 10 years old, when he was with me at 16 years old and nowadays, too. He can\u2019t stand losing and that\u2019s something he has had from the very beginning.\u201d\nFrom a coaching perspective, there were challenges, though. \u201cThe biggest mistake you can make is trying to change a player like him. The main thing I told him was that the game has two directions, and you have to play against the ball as well. But you don\u2019t change his movements, you don\u2019t change his style of shooting or passing. It\u2019s more about how you can put him into the team in a way that everybody gets better.\u201d\nMemories from that time focus on Wirtz\u2019s competitive spirit \u2014 the training sessions he would want extended if his team was not winning \u2014 or just his fierce love for being on the pitch. And no story captures that better than a return from injury he made in his mid-teens. After being sidelined during a long winter break, a comeback game was circled, but with conditions.\n\u201cIt was clear that he would only play 50 minutes and I told him weeks before: \u2018Flo, your first game back will be in Bochum, but you will only play 50 minutes\u2019. He says, \u2018OK, coach, I\u2019m fine with it. I just want to be back playing.\u2019\n\u201cBut I knew what would happen once he got back on the pitch. So, the Monday before the game, I talked to him and said: \u2018Flo, remember \u2014 50 minutes!\u2019 \u2018Yes, no problem, no problem.\u2019 Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I said the same thing.\n\u201cSo, the game starts and after half-time, everyone knew that Flo would be substituted. But when I called his name, it was like he hated me. He was swearing on the pitch. He was kicking the grass. He was waving his hands. He didn\u2019t talk to me for five days!\n\u201cI was just laughing because we won the game. His team-mates were laughing, too, because they knew that it would happen. But this is Florian Wirtz the footballer. I\u2019m convinced that this is the thing that\u2019s special compared to other players.\u201d\nAway from the pitch, the same person is quiet and reserved. He is fiercely protective of his private life, but he is courteous to supporters and popular among his team-mates at Leverkusen and with the German national team. He remains unaffected, too.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just the same funny, friendly person that I met when he was 12,\u201d Heck says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be special. He doesn\u2019t like publicity as other players do. He\u2019s a very family-oriented guy. But he has one of those personalities that I want to see more of in professional football. He\u2019s just a good person.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHis rise has not always been easy. In 2020, just a few weeks after the famous goal from halfway, he kicked a wasps\u2019 nest.\nIn 2001, Koln, Leverkusen and Borussia Monchengladbach had made an informal agreement not to sign each other\u2019s youth players. But two decades later, after nine years in Koln, Wirtz and his family were dissatisfied with his pathway. The first team was stuck towards the bottom of the Bundesliga and had employed three head coaches in three years.\nA decision was made: Wirtz moved to Leverkusen for \u20ac200,000. The reaction was not positive. When he returned to Koln\u2019s RheinEnergieStadion for the first time as a professional, he was booed. The issue is still contentious today, but the move was vindicated.\nLeverkusen were a wealthier club with better facilities and a coach, in Peter Bosz, who trusted young players and believed in attacking football. Within three months, Wirtz had made his first-team debut, becoming their youngest player in a Bundesliga game when he started against Werder Bremen in May 2020. Less than three weeks later, he became the youngest goalscorer in Bundesliga history.\nFrom the moment he began training with the Leverkusen first team, he was adapting to senior football and developing a first touch which, today, makes him one of the most watchable players in the world.\n\u201cThat was the first thing I noticed with the pros back then,\u201d he told SZ in 2024, \u201cis that if I didn\u2019t take the ball quickly enough to one side when receiving it, an opponent would take it away. The experienced players in Leverkusen \u2014 particularly Kerem Demirbay \u2014 gave me the tip that I really needed to be gone with the first touch. That was something I really tried to improve in training.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a trait that any player who has faced him will recognise. Jackson Irvine, St. Pauli\u2019s captain, faced Wirtz in the Bundesliga last season and remembers it well. \u201cHe\u2019s so good at finding space between the lines and his end product is just fantastic,\u201d Irvine tells The Athletic, \u201cbut he\u2019s got this action where he shifts and shoots almost in motion.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe just takes a touch across a defender, whether it\u2019s a nutmeg or whatever, and he just seems to be able to just drift across you, even when you think you\u2019ve got him going in the other direction.\u201d\nWhen he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in March 2022 \u2014 coincidentally against Koln \u2014 it was natural to worry about a player whose game was predicated on sharp movements.\nNobody could have known just how successful his comeback would be. Ten months later, he returned to take his place in a side then coached by Xabi Alonso. He would become the playmaking force behind Leverkusen\u2019s unbeaten Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double in 2023-24.\nHe registered 22 goal involvements in each of Alonso\u2019s two full seasons and won the German Footballer of the Year award in 2024, which describes his impact yet still understates it. Wirtz has grown from German football\u2019s great talent into one of its singular forces.\nAnd he\u2019s still improving. A Premier League scout, granted anonymity to protect relationships, notes the emotional growth in his game.\n\u201cWhen players used to kick him and foul him,\u201d the scout tells The Athletic, \u201che could handle it, but it would break his focus. He\u2019d sometimes target that player with his ability, like he was trying to make a point. But he doesn\u2019t do that as much anymore. You can\u2019t knock him out of his rhythm as easily. He doesn\u2019t lose his calm.\u201d\nNo doubt some of that treatment is waiting in the Premier League. Wirtz will arrive with his enormous price tag and technical elegance and face the usual refrains about whether a slender player with elfin features has the heart for English football.\nBut do not be fooled.\n(Top photo: Florian Wirtz in 2020; by Wolfgang Rattay/AFP via Getty Images)"

      "text": "It was not difficult for Florian Wirtz to picture making Liverpool\u2019s training ground his home.\nIn November, the day after Liverpool humbled Bayer Leverkusen \u2014 then on a run of just two defeats in the previous 68 games across all competitions \u2014 in a Champions League game at Anfield, Wirtz stepped out onto the practice pitches at Kirkby and was blown away by what he saw.\nAdvertisement\nXabi Alonso, the Leverkusen manager and former Liverpool midfielder, had politely requested to use the base for warm-down purposes the morning after his team\u2019s 4-0 thrashing.\nLiverpool offered their under-23 pitch, with Leverkusen\u2019s players taking part in a light training session and debrief of the previous evening\u2019s chastening loss. For Wirtz, the gem of German football it was a clear insight into the future.\nWirtz made no secret of being impressed by the facilities and it left Liverpool in a strong position to secure his services if they ever came to firm up their interest.\nThe Athletic has spoken to multiple sources, who asked to remain anonymous to protect their positions, to piece together the story of a deal which \u2014 at \u00a3100million (\u20ac117.2m; $135.5m) plus \u00a316m of add-ons \u2014 has smashed Liverpool\u2019s transfer record and could also become the biggest British deal of all time if those extras are realised.\nBack in November, Wirtz was fresh from winning the Bundesliga and German Cup double, and still focused on Leverkusen and their adventure back in the Champions League. Most of the noise around his future centred on whether he would join rivals Bayern Munich, the club long touted as the playmaker\u2019s most likely next destination.\nYet the speed with which Liverpool moved to convince Wirtz to join, despite strong interest from other clubs including Manchester City, made the real difference.\nLiverpool first sought permission from Leverkusen to speak to Wirtz in March. Sporting director Richard Hughes led the process and outlined the ambitious plans for the future to Wirtz and members of his inner circle.\nWhen the German international made up his mind, he did so believing that he would be joining a squad who are well equipped to challenge for the Premier League and Champions League in years to come.\nAdvertisement\nWirtz told Leverkusen he was leaving in early May and that he was eager to try a new league; shortly after, Bayern knew that he would not be joining them as he favoured a move to Anfield. Real Madrid were also aware of his preference and therefore decided against stepping up their interest with Alonso, who succeeded Carlo Ancelotti at the Bernabeu at the end of the season, focused on strengthening other areas despite his long relationship with Wirtz, a player he greatly admired.\nFor Liverpool, the allure of Wirtz was obvious. A supremely talented player who is not even at the peak of his career \u2014 he is still only 22 \u2014 he is also versatile. Head coach Arne Slot has discussed using Wirtz as the No 10, but he can also do a job out wide or as a striker, although these would not be his preferred positions.\nHughes\u2019 task was to get the right deal for Liverpool and within the boundaries set by owners Fenway Sports Group, which has regularly been criticised by a section of Liverpool\u2019s support for not flexing its muscles in transfers.\nThat is not entirely fair \u2014 Liverpool submitted a \u00a3110m bid for Brighton\u2019s Moises Caicedo in the summer of 2023, only for the Ecuadorian to choose Chelsea instead, which Anfield executives often cite as proof of the club\u2019s readiness to pay top dollar for the right player. That also applies to the fees paid previously for goalkeeper Alisson Becker (\u00a366.8m) and centre-half Virgil van Dijk (\u00a375m), which were world records for players in their positions at the time. But there was also an insistence from the Anfield hierarchy that FSG\u2019s self-sustaining business model should not be shredded on a whim \u2014 the player had to be worth the money, and Wirtz was deemed exactly that.\nHughes held complex but friendly talks with Leverkusen\u2019s managing director of sport Simon Rolfes. Those discussions were not quick, hardly unexpected given the size of the sums involved, but they were also amicable.\nAdvertisement\nAs the bulk of the deal \u2014 specifically the guaranteed \u00a3100m \u2014 was agreed early, the negotiations centred primarily on agreeing the add-ons and how much extra would be paid if Wirtz helps Liverpool win the Premier League or Champions League again, and even if he wins the Ballon d\u2019Or.\nThe Athletic reported on June 6 that Liverpool had submitted an improved offer of \u00a3113m for Wirtz, following a \u00a3109m offer the previous week.\nAlthough Liverpool were hoping for a quick resolution, they were also patient. There was no need for the deal to be rushed, given most players do not report back to Kirkby until July 7 and Liverpool\u2019s confidence that Wirtz was only interested in joining them.\nOne thing was clear for Hughes: Liverpool had no intention of reaching the \u20ac150m valuation Leverkusen had initially placed on Wirtz.\nBy agreeing on the eventual package of \u00a3116m, Hughes and Rolfes were able to shake hands and both feel proud of the outcome.\nLanding a plug-in-and-play talent like Wirtz, who will significantly strengthen the attacking department and help shape the future, is another boost for Liverpool after a successful title-winning season. For Leverkusen, they can point to the highest-ever transfer fee received by a German club should the add-ons be activated.\nThe size of this deal could also break the British transfer record Chelsea paid Brighton for Moises Caicedo two years ago but only if Wirtz is successful enough at Anfield to trigger all the clauses.\nLiverpool would be more than happy to pay them, given that would mean their successful start to life under Slot would have continued.\nDespite the record-breaking figures attached to the deal, Wirtz still fits within the club\u2019s existing wage structure and will earn around \u00a310.2m a year with performance-related extras potentially taking it up to \u00a312.8m. Like other deals Liverpool have put together over the years, he will also have the potential to earn more depending on the time he stays at the club.\nAdvertisement\nThroughout his career, Wirtz and his family have always put the sporting project above simply choosing the best financial package and this attitude was clear again during negotiations with Liverpool.\nWirtz was determined for his new club to be the right footballing fit. He had this approach when joining Leverkusen in 2020: having grown weary of FC Koln\u2019s habit of regularly changing manager and playing a passive style of football, the prospect of continuing his development under the attack-minded Peter Bosz, then Leverkusen\u2019s manager, and at a club with good facilities and strong ambitions was appealing.\nSlot, too, had a clear plan for Wirtz, who provided 34 goals and 35 assists across his last two seasons and also reflected favourably when the club\u2019s data team assessed his history.\nThe Dutchman told him exactly where he would fit in and that was a bigger pull than any financial incentive, especially as the headache of how he would have fitted into the Bayern Munich line-up alongside Jamal Musiala \u2014 an issue also widely discussed at international level with Germany \u2014 had no obvious cure. Wirtz was keen to be at the centre of his new team, and that will be the case at Anfield.\nWhen the agreement was struck, Wirtz was still on holiday after a gruelling season with Leverkusen and then the additional games for Germany in the Nations League semi-final and third-place tie.\nThat the deal was done early into the summer is of significant help to Liverpool\u2019s planning around pre-season and also for Wirtz, who has more time to settle into the club before Liverpool\u2019s season begins with the Community Shield against Crystal Palace at Wembley on the weekend of August 9-10.\nWirtz visited the north west of England weeks ago to look at possible living arrangements and was encouraged by the move of his friend, Jeremie Frimpong, who has also moved to Merseyside from Leverkusen in this window.\nHaving a friendly face who has shared multiple experiences, both on and off the pitch, alongside him should make the settling-in process a little easier.\nLiverpool\u2019s player care team will assist and the time already spent at the club\u2019s training complex helped convince Wirtz, who has signed a five-year contract, that this would be the perfect next step in his career.\nAdvertisement\nWirtz, one of the most coveted playmakers in Europe, is recognised as an addition who can strengthen the team further, not an easy task given the standards set last season. Slot said at the back end of last term that the toughest test this summer would be to find players who are better than those already at the club, yet Liverpool seem to have done that.\nThere was no guarantee they would get their man, so other options that came under consideration included Lyon\u2019s Rayan Cherki. Slot even broke off from his summer holiday to travel to the south of France to meet Cherki at the end of May. Ultimately, however, the midfielder joined Manchester City.\nLiverpool have been quiet in the last three transfer windows, instead preferring to work with the players already available rather than seek alternatives. Combine that with a money-spinning season following the return to the Champions League, the income generated by winning the Premier League (which The Athletic recently calculated was worth around \u00a3181m) and a record-breaking performance in the commercial department where revenue has soared, and it is no surprise to see Liverpool getting their house in order early this summer.\nThere is still room for further additions, with a \u00a340m deal agreed to sign left-back Milos Kerkez and possible openings elsewhere if other players are moved on.\nWhatever happens next, though, the record-breaking deal for Wirtz will be the stand-out deal of the summer and one that could help invigorate the frontline for years to come.\nAdditional reporting: David Ornstein"

      "text": "The first-team gym at RB Leipzig\u2019s Cottaweg training facility is upstairs, fronted by floor-to-ceiling windows.\nIt sits opposite the youth team gym, which is designed in the same way, and is meant to be aspirational. It allows the younger players to look across, to see the stars and glimpse their future.\nAdvertisement\nOver the past two years, those academy prospects will have seen Benjamin Sesko working away, packing his fascinating dimensions with as much power as possible and preparing for this moment: the completion of his \u20ac85million move to Manchester United.\nTalk to anyone who has encountered Sesko on his path through the game and themes repeat. He is relentless. He is driven. He is deeply ambitious. Off the pitch, those who know him describe a normal person with few airs and graces. It\u2019s not particularly Slovenian to swagger, and Sesko does not carry himself like a star.\nBut he is one. And has been for some time. Sesko is a national icon in a country where sporting celebrity is something new. Alongside Luka Doncic, the five-time NBA All-Star, and Tadej Pogacar, who recently won his fourth Tour de France, he is the third member of an athletic super class.\nBut the move to Manchester United will make him a global, as well as national property, and Miran Zore, a reporter and editor for Nogomania, one of Slovenia\u2019s largest football websites, describes the impact of that transfer.\n\u201cFor a small country like ours, this is huge news,\u201d Zore tells The Athletic.\n\u201cWe only have one Premier League player, Jaka Bijol of Leeds United (who joined from Udinese this summer), so this will have an enormous impact. Our biggest star in world football is our goalkeeper, Jan Oblak, but other than we don\u2019t have any \u2014 apart from Sesko.\u201d\n\u201cAnd with him having a big role at such a big club, it will change things here a lot. The Premier League is very different to Leipzig. But he has already had an impact. Even now.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not used to big stars in Slovenia, we are not particularly fanatical. We are not a country where football shirts are sold in great quantities. It\u2019s not like in the UK, where people buy a new one every season. Here, you buy a jersey and then you stick with it. But with Sesko, everything is changing. I see a lot of people now with his name on their jerseys. At national team matches, of course, but also on the beach. And this is totally new here.\u201d\nNew, but building for some time. Sesko became a senior international the day after his 18th birthday and, at 22, has already made 41 appearances for his country.\nHe\u2019s come a long way already, even before this next giant step up into the game\u2019s stratosphere.\nSesko comes from Radece, a small valley town of a few thousand people, an hour\u2019s drive from Ljubljana. It sits in the cradle of the Sava Hills, by a river of the same name that runs for 944 kilometres south east, through Croatia, forming its border with Bosnia and Herzegovina and all the way into Serbia.\nIt\u2019s no footballing heartland, but it\u2019s idyllic and beautiful, and Sesko joined the local club, NK Radece, when he was four years old.\nHis father, Ales, played for Radece as a goalkeeper and their first team play on a pitch surrounded by a running track, beyond which there\u2019s a tennis court, a skate ramp, and seating for a few dozen spectators.\nAdvertisement\nToday, Sesko\u2019s picture sits at the foot of their website, with his progress through the game charted alongside. That graphic will soon need to be resized to accommodate Manchester United\u2019s famous crest. If Radece make a big deal of him, then it\u2019s because he\u2019s been a gigantic success and a source of great pride. Handball is the most popular sport in a region which traditionally does not produce footballers and yet, by the time his career finishes, Sesko will likely be the most famous player in his country\u2019s history.\nSesko has been nationally known since he was 14. \u201cSensation!\u201d ran the headline in Ekipa, one of the country\u2019s largest sports dailies, atop a December 2017 article that was reporting on the scoring feats of a forward playing for the u15 side of second-division Krsko.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sure that you\u2019ve not heard of Benjamin Sesko yet,\u201d it read, \u201cand that\u2019s not a surprise because he\u2019s 14. However, his talents cannot be overlooked. Sesko, who will celebrate his fifteenth birthday in May, has scored an astonishing 45 goals in just 15 matches in the first half of this season.\u201d\nBy the end of the year, it was 59 goals in 23 matches. Sesko scored nine hat-tricks and averaged a goal every 27 minutes.\nMirsad Mujakic coached Krsko\u2019s u15 side during that league season.\n\u201cBeni came to us when he was 13,\u201d he tells The Athletic.\n\u201cWe scouted him and invited him to our academy. When he arrived, he was extremely tall already and also very thin, but he had great athletic abilities.\n\u201cHe looked more like a basketball player than a football player but it was clear from the very first training session how strong he was and how he could score different goals from all types of positions.\n\u201cHe was very laidback, but on the field he was completely changed. More concentrated, more focused. I remember his first game for us against NS Mura in the under-15 league, when we won 4-1 and he scored a hat-trick. He was absolutely excellent.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhile Sesko\u2019s early size made him stand out and his goals quickly put him on the national media\u2019s radar, the traits that Mujakic remembers are the ones that have really spurred his progress.\n\u201cHis biggest strengths then were his natural athleticism, but also his technical mastery \u2014 his first touch and the speed of his first movement that gave him such an advantage over his opponent. In those days, his biggest weakness was his heading. That\u2019s what we devoted the most time to when we practised. But he always learnt new technical skills very quickly and that allowed him to develop and improve fast.\n\u201cBut he is also an exceptional person. He likes to socialise with everyone \u2014 after every match in the Slovenian national team, he stays until the end and gives autographs to all the children.\n\u201cAnd his potential is unlimited, because he is such a dedicated worker. He will do everything and more to succeed \u2014 and that\u2019s why I think he will quickly show why he is among the best strikers in the world. Anyone who doubts his quality will change their mind after a few games.\u201d\nSesko\u2019s path through Slovenian football was serene, but he would never make a senior domestic appearance. He left Krsko in 2018, when he was 15, before spending a season with NK Domzale, for whose youth team he scored 21 goals in 23 appearances, attracting interest across Europe.\nManchester United were among those clubs and had an offer of \u00a31m rejected in the summer of 2019. Ultimately, Red Bull Salzburg won the race to sign him, bringing him inside the Red Bull network for the first time, before loaning him to FC Liefering, their development club in the Austrian 2. Liga.\nIn 2019, Bo Svensson was also new. The Dane would later coach Mainz and Union Berlin in the Bundesliga, but his first head coaching role in senior football was with Liefering. As talented as Sesko was, he tells The Athletic, handling him at that stage of his career required some finesse.\n\u201cBenji arrived as a 16-year-old,\u201d Svensson says, \u201cand with two other players who they (Salzburg) had also picked up at 16. So, it was new for me to train such young guys and to play them against seniors. And especially because there were a lot of eyes on those guys from senior people at the club.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nSesko was not immediately successful. He barely played during his first six months and scored just one 2. Liga goal all season. There were mishaps. In his third appearance, he came on as an 85th-minute substitute against SV Horn and was sent off for violent conduct 60 seconds later.\n\u201cThere had always been a lot of attention on Benji and a lot of expectation on his shoulders and someone so young is not capable of coping with that,\u201d Svensson recalls. \u201cPlaying against adults was a completely different style for him. It was tactically different for him, too, and there was a lot to learn.\n\u201cBut I think the biggest challenge was the emotional side. Physically, he had always been beyond anybody else at his age. He had always jumped higher and run faster. Then he came to a stage where he was playing against 30-year-old men and he wasn\u2019t taller and wasn\u2019t stronger than them, and had to find different solutions.\n\u201cHe had to understand that everything wasn\u2019t always going as smoothly as it had before, and with all the expectation on him, not always playing in the beginning was something he had to adapt to. And he was putting enormous amounts of pressure on himself. He would want to train all the time and wanted to turn over every stone in an attempt to get better. Sometimes we had to stop him.\n\u201cBut you have to take pressure away from a young kid like and that\u2019s what I would tell him. We had a lot of talks. There was no doubt about his talent. That was obvious. But it was about time.\n\u201cHe was different to a lot of the young players I\u2019ve coached. Because of that ambition and determination to get better. He was just completely passionate about his football. Some players within that squad even struggled with him because he was so determined to get to the top and, in his position, you need to have ego to succeed.\u201d\nThe contrast between years one and two at Liefering was dramatic. One 2. Liga goal in 2019-20 became 21 in 29 appearances in a second season during which he also debuted for Salzburg, the parent club in the Austrian Bundesliga.\nBy 17, he had outgrown second-tier senior football, but Svensson does not remember any dramatic difference between those two years, more a natural evolution.\n\u201cIt was just normal development. It was important for him to have that hard time playing against adults and to realise that there are other good players,\u201d he says \u201cIt\u2019s also good for a player to understand that he has to do more, that he has to learn more and that it\u2019s not just enough to be doing what he has always done.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe trained a lot individually. But it wasn\u2019t like anything big happened. At some point, it just clicked and from there was never any doubt that he was going to break through.\n\u201cThere would be times when we had run-ins, because he was very ambitious and would think about himself and not always the team. But he was young and that was development, too. And I liked Benji a lot. It was a pleasure working with him because he was so special and had such love for the game. He\u2019s the biggest talent I\u2019ve coached.\u201d\nSesko\u2019s first full season back with Salzburg was, inconveniently, the one immediately following Erling Haaland\u2019s departure to Borussia Dortmund. Physical, quick, long-limbed but with excellent coordination and technique, the Slovenian has been destined to be compared to Haaland ever since. It\u2019s not something he encourages; he\u2019s his own player.\nIn any case, Sesko grew up idolising Zlatan Ibrahimovic and his is the most profound influence.\nBut a Premier League scout, who was granted anonymity to protect relationships, says that one of the traits all three players \u2014 Ibrahimovic, Haaland and Sesko \u2014 share, lies in their physical dexterity.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not like Haaland in terms of how he actually plays his position. But watch the way he receives the ball. Or watch how he receives it. He\u2019s so tall and is so agile that even if team-mates are inaccurate with their delivery, he\u2019s still able to do something with it,\u201d they say.\n\u201cThat includes his work in the penalty box, because there are times when he scores goals that only players with those physical properties could have scored. There\u2019s a technical element to that, but look at some of the photos of him off the ground. He takes the ball with his feet at what would be head-height for most players.\u201d\nStaff at Salzburg talk of Sesko fondly. One story concerns his first interview with Sky Austria, the national league\u2019s main rights holder. At the time, the club leased Audi A7s to players as part of a sponsor\u2019s agreement and, on the day the interview was scheduled, producers were waiting on set for the car to pull into view.\nAdvertisement\nIt never did. Instead, Sesko \u2014 all 6ft 5in of him \u2014 arrived, mantis-like, by e-scooter.\nThat story still makes people at the club laugh now, and Sesko is recalled as a humble, friendly person, initially shy, with the occasional idiosyncrasy. But the most vivid memories are preserved in the images described by the Premier League scout. These are commonplace now. There are pictures everywhere of Sesko killing the ball on his in-step, metres off the ground.\nBut at Salzburg, before anyone was watching, Sesko was already performing feats that were outrageous to most people, but which he made look startlingly easy. A first touch, a shot struck with unholy power, or just how quickly could he accelerate to top speed. In September 2022, a video appeared online showing a 14-year-old Sesko kicking a lodged basketball free from the rim with his foot.\n@nxgn.football Nope. Benjamin Sesko is not human \ud83e\udd2f This video is from when he was 14 years old! \ud83d\ude31 Even Zlatan Ibrahimovic would be proud \ud83e\udd1d \ud83d\udcf9: IG @pro_transfer_agency #fyp #football #basketball #footballtiktok #goal #soccer #zlatan #nba #sesko\nIt is something you could well imagine Ibrahimovic doing. Or, quietly, Haaland.\nHis transfer from Salzburg to Leipzig was arranged in 2022 and completed in 2023. In the two years since, he has grown more steadily in what, at times, has been a Leipzig team in transition. Sesko has scored goals in bursts and with memorable force and artistry, but not yet at a steady rhythm. He leaves the Bundesliga having become one of its better players, rather than one of its leading lights.\nBut he has been everything Leipzig have wanted him to be. Across conversations over the past two years, people who have worked in the footballing department and beyond have described him as a perfect, pliable pupil. His dedication and drive have been impressive and, through those French windows in the first team gym, have been clear for most to see.\nBut they like how he has challenged team-mates in the dressing room, and how he has treated people he has come into contact with, from coaches to the catering staff. He has been willing to listen. In meetings with coaches and on the training pitches, of course, but also to anyone from whom he can learn \u2014 about lifestyle, about media, about anything that can take him closer to the top of the game.\nAdvertisement\nAnd he\u2019s still learning now. There are mechanics to hone, more efficiency to find and greater consistency to discover. Manchester United will understand that. \u20ac85m has bought them a forward who must still develop, but who has so far always grown towards the sun.\n(Illustration: Kelsea Petersen / The Athletic; NurPhoto / Getty, Maja Hitji / Getty)"

      "text": "The excitement at the Emirates Stadium was palpable as Arsenal returned from their pre-season tour in East Asia. They lost 3-2 to Villarreal in Wednesday\u2019s friendly but after years of waiting for a true centre-forward, supporters were ready to welcome their newest addition to the front line at his new home ground.\nAdvertisement\nViktor Gyokeres was in town, and making his first start in Arsenal colours. Having been greeted with applause when his name was announced just before kick-off, less than a minute after it there was a glimpse of why that excitement was genuine and not just charity for a newcomer.\nWith the game barely settled, the Sweden international made a quick burst into the La Liga side\u2019s penalty area. He was found with the ball, and despite having his cutback cleared, it seemed like a precursor of what could be expected later in the game and throughout this season and on into the years beyond.\nExpectations are just that, though. The reality was that while those moments presented themselves on the odd occasion last night, others that showed this marriage may need time to click.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been with us only a week or so,\u201d manager Mikel Arteta said post-match, \u201cbut I already saw a lot of things and a lot of purpose, especially the way he was attacking in certain spaces.\u201d\nThe dilemma now facing Arsenal as to whether to stick or twist in attack was evident multiple times during the first half. There was one chance to break as goalkeeper David Raya threw the ball out to Myles Lewis-Skelly. Gyokeres was on the move, but the youngster then played it backwards instead.\nLewis-Skelly received a similar throw from Raya later in the half and was patient in his play once again. This time, however, Arsenal progressed up the pitch well and the left-back threaded a ball in behind for Gyokeres from a more advanced position. The audible anticipation around what the \u20ac63million striker would do turned into pleasant surprise as he weaved past two challenges before trying another cutback that needed a runner arriving from midfield.\nLast month, Coventry City captain and former Arsenal academy player Ben Sheaf spoke to The Athletic about what it was like adapting to Gyokeres as a team-mate during their two seasons together at the Championship club from 2021-23.\nHe spoke about how Coventry liked having the ball but would also play to Gyokeres\u2019 strengths, before adding: \u201cThe way the season progressed, it swayed more towards, \u2018This is what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s doing it well, let\u2019s keep doing it and get better at it\u2019.\n\u201cI get what people are saying about how he is going to fit in, but people probably said the same thing about Erling Haaland when he went to (Manchester) City, and that turned out quite well. I think under good managers and (with) better players, Viktor\u2019s only going to get better and add more to his game anyway, so I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s a concern, really.\u201d\nIt was clear from Wednesday\u2019s performance that the 27-year-old\u2019s qualities can be of use to Arsenal, but finding the best way to accentuate them is now the big challenge for the coaching staff.\nHis new team\u2019s collective performances this pre-season have been mixed. They were lax when defending set pieces in their 1-0 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur in Hong Kong in their previous outing a week ago, and Arteta admitted that against Villarreal they were \u201cnaive, especially the way we have defended open spaces\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nIndividually, Martin Zubimendi and Ethan Nwaneri have grown into their midfield roles \u2014 mainly because they have played with personality. Zubimendi\u2019s insistence on passing forward whenever he is on the pitch has been encouraging. Nwaneri has started three of the first four pre-season games, and has impressed by going off-script with nutmegs, quick bursts of pace and reversed passes to move Arsenal up the pitch, while also showing a better understanding of his role out of possession yesterday.\nPart of why individuals have shone while the team overall have stuttered will be down to the nature of Arteta\u2019s line-ups for these warm-up matches. Most have been a mixture of players who would be considered regular starters and squad players.\nFor example, the midfield trio of Zubimendi, Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice have not yet started a game together. They have had minutes alongside one another during these friendlies, going back to the first match against Milan in Singapore two weeks ago, but they have always been after substitutions have been made. It was also not until the final half-hour here that Gabriel, who has played more than 200 games for Arsenal over the past five years, made his return from April\u2019s season-ending hamstring injury.\nEven later in the match, the introduction of Noni Madueke, another summer signing, on the left wing showed there are still elements of this new-look squad for Arteta to work out.\n\u201cNoni is very comfortable playing right and left,\u201d the Arsenal manager added. \u201cWe want to have inverted-footed players (left-footers playing off the right, for example). We can do that, and he\u2019s a real threat. But\u2026 (if) we want to find something else, playing with natural-footed (left-footers on the left, etc), he\u2019s going to give us that solution. Today, you\u2019ve already seen a couple of balls that he put in the box, the pace and the quality he can deliver.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWith such important facets of the squad coming together at different times, the final game of Arsenal\u2019s pre-season, also against La Liga opposition in Athletic Club here on Saturday, should make for interesting viewing.\nArteta is hopeful Kai Havertz, Riccardo Calafiori and Leandro Trossard will return from their respective injuries in that one. But will he finally manage to field an XI that resembles his strongest selection before the season gets under way for real away to Manchester United on Sunday, August 17?\n(Top photo: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)"

      "text": "The latest reboot of Marvel\u2019s Fantastic Four hit the cinemas last month and Liverpool\u2019s recruitment department, headed by Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes, seem to be taking inspiration from it.\nFlorian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike have both arrived from the Bundesliga at a combined cost of around \u00a3200million ($265m) to add new dimensions to Liverpool\u2019s attack, with Mohamed Salah\u2019s extension, signed towards the end of last season, ensuring he will remain as the team\u2019s talisman for another two years.\nAdvertisement\nYet their business does not seem to be done. Newcastle United\u2019s Alexander Isak remains a primary target, with The Athletic revealing that a formal bid has now been tabled and rejected. The Sweden international has made it clear that he wants to leave this summer.\nThe idea of Salah, Wirtz, Ekitike and Isak in the same team is enough to have Liverpool fans drooling and will strike fear into opponents, but it is not a natural front four as it consists of, nominally, a No 10 (Wirtz), a right-winger (Salah) and two No 9s (Isak and Ekitike).\nSo while it may look electric on paper, can those four actually play together?\nHow could they work in the current system?\nThere is no doubt that each player has enough talent to thrive at Anfield. Only Ekitike can be considered a project, rather than a ready-made elite talent, even if Wirtz, 22, is younger than the 23-year-old Frenchman.\nSince arriving in 2017, Salah has shown that he can thrive with whoever lines up next to him in the front three. From Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane to Luis Diaz and Cody Gakpo, the Egypt international has continued to score goals and provide for others.\nComing off his best season in a Liverpool shirt, the 33-year-old is showing no signs of slowing down and he should benefit from Wirtz\u2019s creativity behind him and linking up with a No 9 who has far more to their game than just an eye for goal.\nSalah may not replicate his numbers from last season, particularly because he will miss a portion of Liverpool\u2019s 2025-26 campaign when at the Africa Cup of Nations, but also because goals are likely to be shared more evenly with a prolific central striker next to him.\nWirtz\u2019s quality is undeniable. It appears that no matter where he is positioned on the pitch, he will create.\nHe has already shown a natural ability to drift into pockets of space, pick up possession and deliver precise passes to create goalscoring opportunities for his team-mates.\nAdvertisement\nIn the 5-0 friendly victory against Stoke City, he burst into space between midfield and defence before sliding a ball into Dominik Szoboszlai. A sliding challenge prevented him from shooting, but the ball fell for Darwin Nunez to finish. Either Ekitike or Isak would surely relish the prospect of such service.\nHe also set up 16-year-old winger Rio Ngumoha, this time by slowing the game down and dictating the tempo. He lulled the Stoke defence into backing off after a one-two with Curtis Jones, before he slipped the ball to Ngumoha.\nWirtz maintained his levels against Milan in Hong Kong, even as Liverpool lost 4-2. Here, a similar move as in the first example almost set up Harvey Elliott. The additional mobility of Isak or Ekitike in that scenario would probably have delivered a more positive result.\nWirtz has taken no time to form a relationship with Salah. The pair have been filmed talking and laughing together in pre-season and that bond has already been shown on the pitch. In this example, they enjoyed passing to each other slightly too much.\nA front four involving three of Isak, Ekitike, Salah and Wirtz, plus Cody Gakpo on the left, feels like the correct balance for Arne Slot.\nThe issue is who would play out of Isak and Ekitike. If the Swede does sign, for what would likely be a British record transfer fee of \u00a3120m or more, then surely he will be first choice.\nWhile Isak was used on the left when playing alongside Callum Wilson at Newcastle, his impact there was incomparable to when he led the line. It feels implausible that Liverpool would spend so much money on Isak, only to play him out of position.\nThat is why the most important piece of the jigsaw puzzle could be Ekitike. Liverpool have not spent an initial \u00a369m just so they can boast one of football\u2019s most expensive reserves.\nAdvertisement\nHis versatility to operate as a lone No 9, in a strike partnership or on the left wing was part of the attraction during the scouting process and should Isak be added, he will drop to second in the centre-forward pecking order.\nEkitike\u2019s skill set \u2014 a graceful ball-carrier who likes to drift into the left channel and create for others \u2014 suggests he could operate from the left. It should not be forgotten that Liverpool\u2019s wingers were their primary goalscoring threats last season.\nHowever, there is very little evidence to support the idea Ekitike would be comfortable starting on the left. According to transfermarkt, he has played only four senior games as a left-winger during his career, and none since 2021.\nIsak\u2019s fitness record could be a factor. When Newcastle were last in the Champions League, the 2023-24 campaign, he managed 40 games but missed spells with groin injuries. Of his 78 Premier League starts, he was substituted in 43 of them.\nEkitike would, therefore, be getting frequent minutes \u2014 even if it wouldn\u2019t be as many as hoped \u2014 while he adapts to the Premier League.\nSlot showed in the first half of last season with his treatment of Gakpo and Diaz (left wing), Andy Robertson and Kostas Tsimikas (left-back), and Szoboszlai and Jones (central midfield) that when he has two players in a position he feels he can rely on, he will rotate between them.\nCould Slot change formation?\nThe more radical option to get all four in the same team would be playing Isak and Ekitike together up front, which was seemingly Newcastle\u2019s original plan two weeks ago.\nSuch a shift would probably require Wirtz to move into a left-sided role, with Salah remaining on the right in a 4-2-2-2 system. When speaking about options on the left, Slot mentioned Wirtz and Ngumoha as alternatives to Gakpo \u2014 but did not mention Ekitike.\nAdvertisement\nThe former Eintracht Frankfurt forward is familiar with a two-striker system, having flourished alongside Omar Marmoush in the first six months of last season. They provided and profited from each other\u2019s movement and creativity.\n\u201cI do what the coach asks me to do, but I like to do everything,\u201d Ekitike told Liverpoolfc.com. \u201cI can\u2019t define myself only as a striker (who likes) to finish: I like to play, I like to be in the game (and) create also. I can play alone and I like to play also with another striker. You need to adapt.\u201d\nPartnerships are often formed because players complement each other. That won\u2019t be the case for Isak and Ekitike, as stylistically they are very similar. That\u2019s not to say it wouldn\u2019t work, but they might end up occupying each other\u2019s space in the early stages.\nSlot craves fluidity, so you could imagine Wirtz moving into the central spaces in that 4-2-2-2 while Ekitike makes runs into the channel, or Ekitike dropping deeper to link play centrally, which is another of his strengths.\nGakpo will have plenty to say about all this. He finished as Liverpool\u2019s second top scorer last season, with 19 goals in all competitions, and the 26-year-old has made a very sharp start to pre-season, scoring against Preston North End and Milan.\nHow would it work defensively?\nWirtz in the No 10 role has already raised questions about who assumes the responsibility of doing some of Salah\u2019s running, never mind what happens in a two-forward system. It could place huge pressure on the double pivot axis of Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister, leaving them with even more space to cover.\nSzoboszlai was tasked with plenty of off-ball work last season and operated on the right of the two deeper midfielders against Yokohama, with Gravenberch moving over to the left. And all that is before we figure out where the integral Mac Allister fits in.\nAdvertisement\nIn his first year at Liverpool, Slot demonstrated his tactical acumen, and he will need it again to settle a much-changed squad as quickly as possible and make sure it does not look like he is fitting square pegs into round holes.\n(Top photos: Jan Kruger, Etsuo Hara, Alex Livesey, Kenta Harada/Getty Images; design: Will Tullos)"

      "text": "\u201cI\u2019m a dreamer,\u201d said Jhon Arias, the softly spoken Colombian winger who has emerged as one of the standout performers at this Club World Cup.\nIn Charlotte on Monday evening, some of his team-mates \u2014 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio, 40-year-old captain Thiago Silva \u2014 fell to their knees in jubilation as the final whistle confirmed Fluminense\u2019s place in the quarter-final. Arias was more reserved, quietly accepting his colleagues\u2019 congratulations but still finding the time to thank the match officials.\nAdvertisement\nWhen he calls himself a dreamer, he means it. On the pitch, he plays with a sense of fantasy. Off it, when his team-mates are playing video games, he prefers to lose himself in a book. As a Colombian, he is drawn to the magical realism of the late Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who sought to blend the fantastical with mundane or joyless situations.\nThis summer\u2019s Club World Cup could be seen as one such backdrop, a largely unloved tournament expanded beyond all reason and squeezed into a barely perceptible gap in the sport\u2019s calendar, matches played in sweltering heat in vast but often sparsely populated stadiums across the United States. As entertaining as some of the match-ups have been \u2014 Monday\u2019s knockout games in particular \u2014 it has not been easy to overcome a sense of disconnect.\nBut Arias and his team-mates have brought a liberal sprinkling of fantasy. In an era when the financial might of European football sees the South American clubs cast as underdogs \u2014 which would once have been unthinkable \u2014 Fluminense have now reached the quarter-final, defeating UEFA Champions League finalists Inter 2-0. For the third time in four appearances at this tournament, Arias, an unusual bundle of skill, speed, power and creativity, won FIFA\u2019s award for the game\u2019s outstanding player.\nIt would be wrong to call him an unknown quantity when he has been one of the outstanding players in Brazilian football over recent seasons and was an integral part of the Colombia team that reached last year\u2019s Copa America final, but his career path, underlined by his impact on this Club World Cup at the age of 27, is something of a throwback.\nThe economic imbalance of 21st-century football means that European clubs snap up most of the biggest talents in South America in their late teens or early twenties. Others are signed a little later, heading to a smaller European league in the hope of making it to one of the biggest clubs. These days, many end up in Saudi Arabia, earning sums that would have been beyond their hopes in South America.\nAdvertisement\nBy contrast, Arias was still playing in Colombia, having moved from Patriotas to America de Cali to Santa Fe, as his 24th birthday approached. He had won the Colombian league title in Cali and played in the Copa Libertadores, South America\u2019s equivalent to the Champions League, but he had not represented his country at any level. It calls to mind a line Jack Lang wrote in this wonderful article about another Colombian late developer, Liverpool winger Luis Diaz, who \u201clooked like being one of football\u2019s \u2018if only\u2019 men \u2014 a winning lottery ticket lost down the back of a sofa\u201d.\nFrom a vantage point in Europe, where clubs are so fixated on signing the next big thing from South America, it can be easy to imagine that those winning lottery tickets do not exist in 2025. Football is not like it was in 1987, when the great Colombian midfielder Carlos Valderrama, hitherto unknown to European audiences, lit up the Copa America and earned a transfer to French club Montpellier at the age of 27.\nBut Diaz was a winning lottery ticket for Porto, who sold him on to Liverpool for a huge profit. And Arias has proved a wonderful acquisition for Fluminense, an integral part of the team that won the club\u2019s first Copa Libertadores title in 2023 and one of the most influential players in Brazil over the recent seasons. He is firmly established in the Colombia team, helping them reach last year\u2019s Copa America final.\nThis summer, Arias has excelled at the Club World Cup. After his superb performance against Inter, Fluminense\u2019s social media channels lauded him as \u201cone of the best players in the history of this club\u201d.\nHe told reporters how much beating Inter meant \u2014 not just to Fluminense but to all of Brazil, all of South America, not least the Colombian town of Quibdo where he grew up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to reach the top when you come from an area with very few opportunities,\u201d Arias told reporters after the victory over Inter. \u201cI\u2019m aware of this every time I step on the pitch, the opportunities to build a better life. It\u2019s a dream I have had since I was a child.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe are living in a wonderful and amazing moment in Fluminense. My family don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on, but these are memories that my daughter is going to be very happy and very proud of in the future. I know I have a lot of responsibility because a lot of children come from difficult lives, difficult contexts, and they look at me and see me as a role model, as a reference.\u201d\nAgain, he talked about dreaming, about \u201cthe desire to make history\u201d with Fluminense but also about remaining \u201chumble\u201d and respecting every opponent they play.\n\u201cWe did everything right,\u201d he said of the victory over Inter. \u201cOne of our strengths is that we play in a heartfelt manner. We were playing one of the finalists of the Champions League, but we knew how to face the challenge, how to run when it was necessary, how to keep the ball when it was necessary and how to seize the opportunities when they came.\u201d\nArias didn\u2019t score, but he was prominently involved in Fluminense\u2019s third-minute opener, which German Cano headed home after some poor Inter defending, and the winger was at the heart of everything they did. In the first half, he brought the crowd to its feet with an outrageous piece of skill on the touchline, bamboozling Alessandro Bastoni, one of the most coveted central defenders in Europe, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan. He also extended Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer to full stretch with a couple of dangerous efforts from outside the penalty area.\nThe scenes at the end, after substitute Hercules clinched the victory with a goal in stoppage time, were among the most uplifting at the tournament: Fluminense\u2019s players cavorting joyously with each other and with their raucous supporters \u2014 many of them Brazilian expats in the U.S. but plenty of others having travelled from Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThe fans love the club,\u201d Arias said, \u201cand it\u2019s reciprocal.\u201d\nHe called it a \u201cmagical moment\u201d for the club, for Brazil, for South America, something wonderful. You could see the emotion on the faces of Silva and Fabio, the two elder statesmen of the team, and among their fans, young and old.\nArias looked more reflective, smiling, soaking it in, living the dream and, in front of a sparse crowd in Charlotte, happy to keep making the magic and weaving the storylines that this tournament needs.\n(Top photo: Steph Chambers \u2013 FIFA/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Liverpool\u2019s search for their new No 9 is close to ending after they agreed a deal worth up to \u00a379million with Eintracht Frankfurt for striker Hugo Ekitike.\nWith the Premier League champions\u2019 ideal option for the role, Alexander Isak, set to stay at Newcastle as their \u2018not for sale\u2019 stance has remained unwavering, they have pivoted to someone who stylistically profiles as close to the one-of-a-kind Swede as you can get.\nAdvertisement\nEkitike is a tall, quick, technically-gifted striker who is a progressive ball carrier and has an eye for goal. Sound familiar? The difference between them is the Frenchman is younger (23) and unproven in English football, so won\u2019t come with the same guarantees that signing Isak would have.\nHowever, he does fit the type of profile that Liverpool often target in the transfer market these days \u2014 a player not yet into their prime years with plenty of first-team experience already but the room to develop further.\nEkitike\u2019s senior journey has taken him from the academy at hometown club Reims to Paris Saint-Germain and then Frankfurt, joining the German side, initially on loan, in last year\u2019s winter window. His potential has been obvious for some time but 2024-25 was his breakout season as he scored 22 goals and provided 12 assists across 48 appearances in all competitions.\nThe expectation will be for that level of output and performance to continue in a Liverpool shirt as he becomes a big-money signing and approaches the peak years of his career.\nSo what makes him a suitable fit for Arne Slot\u2019s Anfield side?\nThe eye-test and the data both tell you that Ekitike is a dual-threat.\nHe is an elegant dribbler who thrives in open space, creates for his team-mates and picks his moments to attack the box. Only four players in Europe\u2019s top five domestic leagues \u2013 Mohamed Salah of Liverpool (32.4), Barcelona duo Raphinha (30.3) and Robert Lewandowski and Real Madrid\u2019s Kylian Mbappe (both 26.3) \u2013 generated a better combined non-penalty expected goals and expected assists figure last season than his 26.0.\nA France youth international who won his fifth under-21 cap in March but missed this summer\u2019s European Championship with a back problem, Ekitike uses his pace and clever movement to get into goalscoring positions.\nAs he scores here against Czech side Viktoria Plzen in a Europa League game last September, he initially wriggles away from two defenders, then plays a one-two with Rasmus Kristensen before bursting into the box to finish the move off.\nHis goal contribution map for the season shows he sniffs out opportunities, with eight of his finishes coming from inside the opposition six-yard box.\nHe is not a consistently clean ball-striker and in a Liverpool team who often face opponents set up in low blocks, his technique and instinctive shooting will be put to the test. Ekitike underperformed his Bundesliga-only non-penalty xG (19.3) \u2014 a number which ranked second among the German top flight\u2019s players behind only Serhou Guirassy (19.6) of Borussia Dortmund \u2014 by 5.3, the most of any player in the division.\nAdvertisement\nGetting into shooting positions is not the problem \u2014 according to fbref.com data, his 4.0 goal attempts per 90 minutes in the Bundesliga was only bettered by former team-mate Omar Marmoush (4.7), who moved to Manchester City in January, among players who completed at least half their club\u2019s 34 league games \u2014 it\u2019s his accuracy, with only 1.5 efforts per 90 on-target.\nFollowing Liverpool\u2019s Champions League round-of-16 elimination by PSG in March, Slot was full of praise for the competition\u2019s eventual winners and spoke of his admiration for the front three opposite number Luis Enrique has built. Interestingly, again according to fbref, the closest comparison to Ekitike over the past year is Ousmane Dembele, who nominally operates as the central player in that three-man PSG attack but offers the team much more than just goals.\nWhile Slot\u2019s more controlled, possession-based approach was a trait as Liverpool won the title in his debut season, they retained a dangerous counter-attacking threat. Only Ekitike\u2019s Frankfurt created a higher expected goals figure from fast breaks across Europe\u2019s top four leagues (Premier League, the Bundesliga, La Liga in Spain and Italy\u2019s Serie A), but Liverpool outscored them in those situations.\nEkitike was central to many of those moves, either finishing them off himself or creating the chance for a team-mate. Only Salah (10) racked up more goal contributions than his six from fast breaks across the season.\nThis one came in the Europa League not the Bundesliga but his goal away to Tottenham in April\u2019s quarter-finals offered an insight into the problems Ekitike may cause English opponents. Receiving possession following a turnover, he drives at defence, before firing a shot into the net from the edge of the box.\nIn this next example, away against Borussia Monchengladbach in the Bundesliga a couple of months earlier, Ekitike picks the ball up in his own half and turns a defender inside out before scoring.\nHe is in control when he\u2019s dribbling, which allows him to outwit defenders with body feints or neat tricks \u2014 as with this nutmeg, against Ajax in the Europa League\u2019s round of 16 in March, before an emphatic finish.\nWhat stands out in both instances is his carrying ability. He moves at speed and elegance with the ball at his feet.\nToo often during a three-season Liverpool career that is expected to end during this transfer window, Darwin Nunez has offered the same threat \u2014 progressing his side to the opposition\u2019s final third of the pitch, but when the final pass or finish is required, he\u2019s found wanting. Ekitike thrives in exploiting space on transition and drifts across the front three to pick up possession, bringing a fluidity to a forward line \u2014 as his Bundesliga carries map for last season shows:\nOnly three players across Europe\u2019s top five leagues had more shots following ball carries in 2024-25 than his 44 \u2013 Barcelona\u2019s Lamine Yamal (56), Mbappe (50) and Mason Greenwood of France\u2019s Marseille (45).\nEkitike\u2019s powerful running opens up space for his team-mates; as it does here, when he feeds Ansgar Knauff in transition against visitors RB Leipzig in April.\nWhile goals will be expected, Slot needs more from his No 9 than just that. Luis Diaz became his preferred option in that role last season, and the Colombian\u2019s ability to facilitate and contribute to chance creation for the two wide attackers, Salah and Cody Gakpo, was invaluable.\nEkitike\u2019s 6ft 3in (190cm) size, despite his slender frame, makes him a solid aerial presence, and he will offer Liverpool the ability to aim passes directly at him to bring others \u2014 such as their new playmaking addition Florian Wirtz \u2014 into the action.\nHere against Heidenheim in April, he cushions a header down to Mario Gotze to begin an attacking move, which he finishes off with a simple tap-in.\nHis pace is crucial, because it allows him to contribute to and then finish off attacks \u2014 as was the case both above and in this goal against Dortmund in January. He drops into space to play a one-two with Kristensen, then crashes the penalty area to finish off his team-mate\u2019s low cross.\nYou can also play balls to his feet and he\u2019ll then produce quality like this pass for Eric Junior Dina Ebimbe to score in that match against Plzen.\nLast season, which he played at age 22, Ekitike was the only centre-forward in Europe\u2019s top five leagues to both carry the ball into the opposition penalty area 50 times and record more than 200 touches inside it.\nHis technical ability stands out in his clever link-up play in and around the box. Ekitike\u2019s expected assist value of 6.8 last season was ninth-best among Bundesliga players \u2013 and only 0.2 lower than that of Wirtz \u2013 and his vision and weight of pass are impressive.\nThere are multiple examples of this aspect of his game from that campaign, including this perfectly-timed pass to Jean-Matteo Bahoya after patient hold-up play against Ajax\u2026\n\u2026and this touch into the path of Hugo Larsson against Hoffenheim last August was equally impressive.\nThe idea of Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo and Diaz profiting from that sort of clever link-up should whet the appetite of supporters.\nThere is flair, too. Liverpool fans are used to seeing Salah assist his team-mates with an outside-of-the-boot cross, and Ekitike also uses that technique. It led to a tap-in for Fares Chaibi against second-division Eintracht Braunschweig in the DFB-Pokal (Germany\u2019s equivalent of the FA Cup) early last season:\nThe No 9 role in Slot\u2019s system requires a relentless work rate just as much as goal contributions.\nFrankfurt were not a consistently high-pressing team last season, but when they did harry their opponents, Ekitike was given the responsibility to lead the press \u2014 and he was effective in doing so.\nBased on Opta Vision data, he ranked in the top seven players in the Bundesliga for both pressures applied in the opposition\u2019s half and final-third pressures. His 15.3 high-intensity final-third pressures per 90 were the most by a Frankfurt player, well clear of Gotze (12.6) in second.\nAdvertisement\nThere is, clearly, risk attached to this deal.\nIn summer 2022, Liverpool invested heavily in an even younger, talented front man (Nunez was 21 at the time) following a breakout season elsewhere in Europe; in his case, 26 goals in 28 league matches in Portugal with Benfica.\nThat signing has not gone to plan.\nThe hope at the club is that this one very much will.\n(Top photo: Alex Grimm/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Jeremie Frimpong\u2019s first taste of life in England was not easy.\nHe was six years old when he came to live in a council house in Moston, a suburb north-east of Manchester. He came with his brothers and sisters \u2014 he is the fifth of seven children \u2014 and mother Bernice, who had recently separated from Jeremie\u2019s father, Jeffrey.\nAdvertisement\nIt must have felt a long way from Amsterdam, the Dutch capital where he had grown up. He borrowed boots and hitched lifts to play for local club Clayton, all the while motivated by incentives from his big brother, also called Jeffrey.\nLiverpool were interested in offering him a trial back then, but the distance from his home was an obstacle so it was Manchester City \u2014 who had scouted him as a prolific nine-year-old striker \u2014 who won the race to sign him, almost by default.\nNow 15 years later, Liverpool have finally got their man, having triggered a \u20ac35million (\u00a329.6m;$39.3m) release clause \u2014 a modest sum that made the deal even more appealing to Anfield executives \u2014 to bring the attacking right-back to Anfield from Bayer Leverkusen on a five-year deal.\nFrimpong always envisaged another crack at football in England and returns as an elite talent: a league title winner in two countries, a senior Dutch international and the man carrying the family name with pride.\nWhen the 24-year-old made history as part of Bayern Leverkusen\u2019s Bundesliga-winning side last year after joining in 2021 from Celtic, he told those in his inner circle his success was only made possible by their input. The same message follows his move to Anfield and his infectious personality will soon be felt in a new dressing room.\nThe Athletic has spoken to multiple sources, some of whom wish to remain anonymous to protect their positions, to understand how Frimpong became one of Europe\u2019s most coveted talents and who, exactly, Liverpool are signing.\nIt is a footballer origin story that veers dangerously close to cliche \u2014 the kid so besotted with the sport that he once sent an errant shot into the front room and smashed the television.\nIn Frimpong\u2019s case, however, the anecdote is true and not surprising to anyone who knew him as a child growing up kicking \u201canything that resembled a football\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nEvery Saturday he would turn out for Clayton in the morning and nearby Clayton Villa in the afternoon, scoring regularly for both teams and showing off his explosive pace.\n\u201cHe drifted past players like they weren\u2019t even there,\u201d coach Paul Sneddon told The Athletic in 2020, adding that a running joke between parents and other observers was that he was too fast for his own body so he would often collapse onto the turf simply by losing his balance.\n\u201cI think he scored 50 goals in his second season with us but he would have scored 100 if he didn\u2019t fall over,\u201d Sneddon said. \u201cBut it was clear from the start that he had the natural ability to go on to greater things.\u201d\nMoving to City was the big breakthrough. Geography ruled out Liverpool, Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers. Instead, Bernice would jump on three buses in between working two jobs as a cleaner, to make sure Jeremie got to City training at their old Carrington headquarters \u2014 located on the other side of Manchester \u2014 on time.\nInitially there was some scepticism over whether Frimpong would make it at the top level. Some wondered whether he was too small, even as a right midfielder, but when he needed to impress as he stepped up from the \u201cshadow team\u201d into the academy, the player nicknamed \u201cSpeedy Gonzales\u201d by some of City\u2019s senior players put in performances that could not be ignored.\nHis brother, Aaron, was a significant figure at the time, helping him get where he needed to be as Jeffrey and Bernice were called away on work commitments. Jeremie was promoted rapidly through the City youth teams, winning a trophy with the under-18s and making the squad for FA Youth Cup finals in 2017 and 2019.\n\u201cHe was excellent and probably the fastest player I\u2019ve ever coached,\u201d Paul Harsley, who was the Under-23 team coach at City between 2018-2020, tells The Athletic.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe was so versatile and if ever he was caught out of position, his speed would help him recover and then flying forward he was also a massive asset.\u201d\nLate in 2018, the Netherlands sent representatives to watch a number of City\u2019s Dutch players in the under-23s. The country\u2019s under-19 coach and former goalkeeper, Maarten Stekelenburg, visited to watch two other City youngsters, Rodney Kongolo and Javairo Dilrosun, but the club\u2019s academy director, Jason Wilcox \u2014 now the technical director of Manchester United \u2014 said Frimpong was also eligible and should be considered.\n\u201cIt was just before the scouting data systems were fully up and running so we didn\u2019t know that he had both a Ghanaian and Dutch passport,\u201d Stekelenburg tells The Athletic. \u201cStraight away I found him interesting. I loved his character and his energy. He was a guy who was very friendly and open-minded, which is fantastic for a coach. He was also very fast. Not very composed, initially, but a great player to have in the team.\u201d\nFrimpong had clear talent but at right-back he was behind Lutsharel Geertruida and his future Leverkusen team-mate Timothy Fosu-Mensah, who later joined Manchester United, in the Dutch under-19 set up.\nThe right-winger, Mohamed Ihattaren, carried the most hope for that particular age group and further restricted his pathway. Frimpong was also hampered by his inability to speak Dutch, so coaches had to spend a little extra time relaying tactical instructions even though most of his team-mates helped translate into English.\n\u201cMany of the players had started with the national team at a younger age and even though we had a good group, you have to be a strong character to survive,\u201d Stekelenburg adds. \u201cJeremie was never lost in the group, though. He\u2019s not shy and he easily adapts to a new environment.\u201d\nFrimpong\u2019s strong Christian faith quickly helped him connect with other like-minded players in the team. In times of struggle in his earlier years the church was a big support to the player and his family. It was often an escape from the struggles of everyday life and in the good times that have since followed, those tougher times have never been forgotten.\nBlessed to be handed the opportunity to feature in City\u2019s academy teams, Frimpong was still one of many players who never played a minute in the first team. The closest he came was a handful of appearances in the EFL Trophy, where he played for City\u2019s under-21s.\nInstead, his first taste of senior football came in Scotland. Celtic became aware of his availability when the former Reading and West Bromwich Albion technical director, Nick Hammond, joined the Glasgow club in a recruitment consultancy role and eventually became head of football operations, overseeing all transfers. Hammond spoke at length with Andy Thorn, the former Wimbledon, Newcastle United and Crystal Palace centre-back who was scouting for Celtic at the time and passionately endorsed the move. Celtic played City in a pre-season friendly game and the manager Neil Lennon, who had been pre-warned about the interest, was immediately impressed.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI remember Lennon coming over to me and asking about Jezza,\u201d Harsley recalls. \u201cHe was doing his thing, playing well, and had been training, like many of the others, with the first team from time to time. Moving to Celtic when he did was perfect and helped him really take off.\u201d\nFrimpong duly signed a four-year contract in September 2019. Club officials can remember the way that he looked up at the stadium with wide-eyed excitement when he joined.\nCeltic\u2019s strategy of signing young players from reputable English academies was a risk, but Frimpong became the stand-out success story. He was supposed to supplement the squad as back-up in his first season but instead became a leading force, helping Celtic win a domestic treble.\nHis numbers were not astronomical \u2014 in the space of 18 months he set up eight goals and scored three himself \u2014 but arguably more significant was how he won the respect of senior players such as the captain, Scott Brown, through his performances and intensity in training.\nIn his first taste of senior football it became clear that pace and recovery speed would set him up well for a career as a versatile right-back. He learned how to become efficient in attacking areas by not over-playing and listened carefully to instructions on how to improve.\nSome people who worked at Celtic felt he was a little immature for his age, but his kind and genuine nature won many admirers off the pitch and again he had no trouble settling into a new group.\nMidway through his second season, it was already clear that Frimpong was unlikely to be extending his stay in Scotland. Bayer Leverkusen made their interest known and secured him for \u00a311.5m in the January 2021 transfer window. It represented a healthy profit on the modest \u00a3350,000 fee Celtic had paid to Manchester City, which on the face of it represented fantastic business. However some figures connected to the club still felt it was too low given his potential to improve.\nAdvertisement\nIt is easy to say they were right now, given Frimpong\u2019s subsequent achievements, yet Celtic cashed in when they recognised he was already focusing on the next stage of his career at a club in one of Europe\u2019s top five leagues.\nFull backs rarely move from the Scottish Premiership for such transfer fees and Celtic will also receive a significant windfall of up to \u00a36million from his switch from Leverkusen to Liverpool, having inserted a clause to receive a percentage of the profit on his next move.\nLeverkusen mapped out a pathway for his future, explaining how he could become a regular international through his performances in the Bundesliga. There was a focus on building a young and hungry team capable of returning to the Champions League after a season out of it and, although Frimpong only played 10 league games in his first half-season, the team qualified for Europe\u2019s elite competition by finishing third.\nTwo years later, and under the guidance of manager Xabi Alonso, who Frimpong says \u201calways knew how to use my abilities\u201d, he was a key member of the title-winning team and became one of the most in-demand right-backs in Europe, with 14 goals and 12 assists in 47 appearances across all competitions.\nNo longer a newbie but now an established fixture and the heartbeat of all off-field activities \u2014 he regularly welcomed team-mates to his home and organised other social events \u2014 it felt like all the hard work had paid off.\nEnding Bayern Munich\u2019s 11-year title reign and completing the mission with a series of vital stoppage-time strikes only added to the emotion. To become a record-breaker at such a young age and rid the club of their \u201cNeverkusen\u201d tag with a first league title in their 120-year history was overwhelming and stirred memories from his younger years.\nWhen Frimpong was new to City, Bernice used to perk him up with takeaway meals of chicken and chips to make the three-bus ride home from training more enjoyable. Those doubts bubbled up again after he joined Celtic, and he questioned whether leaving his home in Manchester was the right move. Then, when he was settled in Scotland, he once again jumped out of his comfort zone to move to a new country and push himself further.\nLike on so many other occasions that had spoken to his bravery and willingness to take risks and after working through different systems, understanding that a rise to the top is a staggered process, here he was enjoying the fruits of that labour.\nThere is still a sense the best is yet to come both for club and country. Frimpong was part of the Netherlands\u2019 2022 World Cup squad in Qatar but did not feature in the tournament. He was used sparingly in the Euros last summer but starred in the unfortunate penalty shootout defeat by Spain in the Nations League quarter-final in March where he played every minute of both legs in a sign of his growing importance to the team.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI learned very early not to put a sticker on a player when they are young because an important quality is to be a good character and have a hard-working mentality,\u201d says Stekelenburg, who became assistant manager of the Netherlands between 2019-2021.\n\u201cJeremie has both and now he has a really big advantage in that he will play for a coach at his club who really suits his style. Arne (Slot) will know that he has a right-winger (Mohamed Salah) in front of him who likes to cut in, so that will suit Jeremie when he goes on the outside. It\u2019s going to be a real benefit for him.\u201d\nFrimpong is passionate and consistent in his message that he\u2019s a right-back who can defend and attack. He works with personal coaches off the pitch to get tailored feedback across areas such as positioning, defending and tactical analysis. He also leans on the assistance of an attacking coach to maximise his output and will soon be working alongside one of the brightest thinkers in Slot as Liverpool look to build on this season\u2019s title win.\nHe will bring a spark off the field, too, given his enthusiasm for music, fashion, anime and charitable causes that should appeal to Liverpool fans and commercial partners.\nFilling the boots of Trent Alexander-Arnold will not be easy, but there is a belief from those who know him best that Anfield\u2019s stage is where he will shine.\n(Top image: Ina Fassbender/AFP via Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)"

      "text": "As recently as a few weeks ago, some influential figures at Manchester United still felt signing Benjamin Sesko this summer was not especially plausible. RB Leipzig\u2019s asking price was high, potentially too high for a player with a modest scoring record in the Bundesliga.\nYou might say the feeling was mutual. While in talks with Arsenal, some familiar with the matter \u2014 who, like others who spoke to The Athletic, remain anonymous to protect relationships \u2014 say Sesko at that point considered himself beyond joining a club without European football, who had finished 15th in the Premier League, 32 points adrift of their counterparts at the Emirates.\nAdvertisement\nArsenal\u2019s years of groundwork on a deal to sign Sesko ultimately proved for nought, however, as Andrea Berta\u2019s appointment as sporting director gradually turned their attentions towards Viktor Gyokeres.\nIn north London, they too were eventually deterred by the financial obligations of any deal, as well as the challenges of negotiating with Sesko\u2019s representatives. And once Arsenal were out, they noted they had been the only club actively pursuing a deal.\nManchester United had concentrated their efforts elsewhere, initially on Liam Delap. After Chelsea were given the green light to trigger Delap\u2019s \u00a330million release clause, calls were placed for Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike rather than a player who scored 13 goals in 33 Bundesliga appearances last season.\nAnd at that time, even Newcastle United were looking elsewhere in the belief that they would not be able to compete financially for a player that they nevertheless admired.\nSesko had told team-mates on Leipzig\u2019s post-season tour in Brazil he would be leaving this summer. An agreement was in place with officials at the Red Bull Arena which allowed him to go if what they agreed was a \u201cspecial\u201d club offered between \u20ac80-90m.\nLeipzig\u2019s strategy during the summer transfer window demanded that they raised \u20ac100m through player sales, but did not necessitate Sesko\u2019s departure. When Arsenal withdrew, it left them prioritising other sales and planning for the season ahead with the forward.\nYet once Alexander Isak made clear his desire to leave St James\u2019 Park and asked not to travel on Newcastle\u2019s pre-season tour to Asia, Sesko was quickly thrown back into the centre of a short, sharp tug of war that was still one of this summer\u2019s more complex transfer sagas.\nAfter losing out on Delap, Manchester United\u2019s priorities at the end of last season were more focused on the two No 10 positions in Ruben Amorim\u2019s 3-4-2-1 system than a centre-forward. The signing of Matheus Cunha was, eventually, followed by that of Bryan Mbeumo.\nAs the protracted negotiations with Brentford for Mbeumo reached their conclusion, chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox attended a fishing trip in Iceland called at Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s behest, which people familiar with the matter was key to crystallising their approach to remaining weeks of the window.\nFurther meetings between Amorim, Berrada and Wilcox during the United States leg of the pre-season tour, held at Manchester United\u2019s training base and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Chicago, resulted in Sesko emerging as their priority in the position.\nJoel and Avram Glazer were also staying at the same hotel at the same time for a period in the second week of the trip, and, as is customary on major transfers, they agreed to the plan, although they were not key parts of the decision-making process. The decision to go for Sesko had been made before their arrival.\nAdvertisement\nSesko had always been considered among Manchester United\u2019s highest-rated candidates for a new centre-forward. Had they missed out on him, as they did with Gyokeres and Ekitike, attentions would have turned to Aston Villa\u2019s Ollie Watkins and Chelsea\u2019s Nicolas Jackson. Villa had long since told United their forward was not for sale, though some still believed he was gettable at the right price.\nSesko was their priority, though. The influence of Christopher Vivell, director of recruitment, is clear in the pursuit of a player who he first plucked out from the youth ranks of a club in the Slovenian top flight.\nVivell was Red Bull Salzburg\u2019s head of recruitment when Sesko joined from Domzale in 2018, and he successfully saw off competition for the 16-year-old from his future employers at Old Trafford. Manchester United revived their interest four years later only for Sesko to reunite with Vivell, then technical director at Leipzig.\nVivell advocated strongly for the transfer but he did not need to persuade Berrada, Wilcox or Amorim of the Slovenia international\u2019s ability. Sesko was Manchester United\u2019s primary striker target during the early days of INEOS\u2019s first summer window in charge, only for focus to shift to Joshua Zirkzee.\nA move was also explored before Rasmus Hojlund joined in the summer of 2023, although it did not progress far. In any case, Manchester United\u2019s extensive scouting of Sesko dated back seven years, meaning they had a wealth of data and reports on the 22-year-old as supporting evidence for a renewed pursuit.\nThey were far from the only long-standing admirers of Sesko, though. Newcastle came close to an agreement during the summer of 2022 \u2014 the year Isak joined \u2014 and interest on Tyneside never waned.\nContact was maintained with Sesko\u2019s camp, with him earmarked as a potential replacement in the event of Isak\u2019s departure. Once Isak asked not to travel on tour and the likelihood of that exit coming this summer greatly increased, St James\u2019 Park officials began exploring a move.\nAdvertisement\nArsenal\u2019s pursuit had an influence, with key Newcastle figures believing that if the Emirates club had considered Sesko a key target then, as a fellow Champions League club, they should be in the race too. Newcastle had already competed with European rivals Chelsea for Delap and Joao Pedro this summer.\nNewcastle\u2019s involvement hastened Manchester United into action, leading to the Chicago meetings between Amorim, Berrada and Wilcox, and left both clubs to make their pitches to the Sesko camp.\nAmorim held a Zoom meeting with Sesko last week, while director of football negotiations Matt Hargreaves met his agent Elvis Basanovic on multiple occasions for initial talks on personal terms and commission fees.\nOn Newcastle\u2019s side, there were complications beyond Isak. With no sporting director or chief executive in post, it meant head of recruitment Steve Nickson was responsible for dealing with Sesko\u2019s camp, leaving Andy Howe, assistant head of recruitment, and Jamie Reuben, a minority owner, to handle club-to-club talks with Leipzig.\nThere was optimism that initial conversations between Newcastle and Sesko\u2019s camp had gone well, albeit without ending in a firm commitment to choosing St James\u2019 Park. Sesko\u2019s representatives informed both parties that they were undecided and would need time to consider their options.\nMore meetings were held on Friday and, over the course of the following 24 hours, Newcastle submitted their opening offer to Leipzig of \u20ac75m plus a further \u20ac5m in add-ons.\nSesko\u2019s camp were taken aback by the timing of Newcastle\u2019s offer, as it did not follow their plan for how the process should evolve.\nThat was perhaps because of suspicions at Newcastle that the Sesko camp were holding out for Manchester United, biding their time until their counterparts at Old Trafford were ready to table a formal bid.\nAdvertisement\nBasanovic flew into Leipzig from Oxford on Saturday afternoon, having completed another client\u2019s loan move to Oxford United. Meetings were held that evening after the Bundesliga club\u2019s pre-season friendly against Atalanta. Sesko is described by one person in the industry as Basanovic\u2019s \u201clife\u2019s work\u201d given his importance as a client.\nNewcastle\u2019s offer was deemed insufficient by the Bundesliga club, although not rejected out of hand, and talks continued.\nSome people familiar with the matter believe that by offering a package worth a total of \u20ac85m, Newcastle met Leipzig\u2019s valuation and a club-to-club agreement could have been reached quickly, but an intervention by Manchester United followed and shifted the negotiating parameters.\nOld Trafford\u2019s decision-makers still stopped short of submitting an opening offer, however, as they awaited a clear indication from Sesko\u2019s representatives that they were his preferred destination.\nThose with knowledge of Manchester United\u2019s strategy to the talks say they hoped for Sesko to act as Mbeumo had with Brentford, by making it clear to his club that he only wished to move to Old Trafford, paving the way to negotiate on price without pressure from competitors.\nThat clarity would eventually arrive, but not before Newcastle received encouragement from the Sesko camp that he would be willing to join. Positive talks on Monday \u2014 a day where Reuben was working flat out on the deal \u2014 ended with an improved offer from Tyneside of at least \u20ac80m. They had, in their words, put their best foot forward.\nConfidence remained at Old Trafford, however. Executives reasoned that a deal with Newcastle would already have been done if they were Sesko\u2019s preference. Manchester United\u2019s opening offer of \u20ac75m plus \u20ac10m in add-ons was finally submitted on Tuesday morning.\nNewcastle agreed an initial \u20ac82.5m fee plus \u20ac2.5m in add-ons with Leipzig later that day. Yet as the hours ticked by, all parties became clear of Sesko\u2019s preference \u2014 he wanted to join Manchester United.\nHargreaves and Vivell spent the subsequent days in Leipzig finalising a deal. Talks between the two clubs were described as professional, completed in only a few days, in sharp contrast to negotiations with Brentford for Mbeumo.\nAn agreement of \u20ac76.5m plus a further \u20ac8.5m in add-ons was reached on Thursday afternoon \u2014 the initial fee \u20ac6m lower than that agreed by Newcastle, albeit still amounting to a total \u20ac85m package.\nAdvertisement\nInternally, Manchester United valued Sesko around \u00a375m. Some people familiar with the matter believe they would have been willing to match the \u00a379m package Liverpool committed towards the signing of Ekitike. A potential \u00a373.7m outlay is still significant, but south of both those numbers.\nMeanwhile, Newcastle officials were crestfallen. Despite \u201cfighting tooth and nail\u201d and receiving indications that Sesko could be persuaded, there were always misgivings that he would ultimately prefer to move to Manchester, leaving a sense that their interest had only served to drive up Sesko\u2019s salary demands. With Isak\u2019s future still opaque, it returned them to square one.\nAt which club Sesko stood to earn more is a point of contention. The Slovenia international\u2019s wages are said to sit within Manchester United\u2019s existing structure. Sources at Old Trafford claim he is not earning more than he was offered by Newcastle.\nThis is contested at St James\u2019 Park, with people familiar with the matter either claiming that their offer was equal to or significantly lower than that on offer in Manchester. Others contend that Newcastle\u2019s wage structure did not allow them to offer much more than \u00a3200,000-per-week, inclusive of bonuses.\nIt is, in any case, worth noting that the majority of Manchester United players\u2019 contracts are subject to a 25 per cent reduction during seasons spent outside the Champions League.\nOther factors, like the uncertainty over Isak\u2019s future, did not help Newcastle\u2019s cause. Not for the first time this summer, officials were unable to definitively tell a transfer target whether they would be playing alongside the 25-year-old or not.\nBy contrast, Sesko can be confident of arriving at Old Trafford as first choice. Manchester United remain willing to sell Hojlund, who is available for just over \u00a330m and has attracted interest from Milan, although he is not part of the so-called \u2018bomb squad\u2019 currently exiled under Amorim. United are also open to a loan arrangement if they cannot strike an acceptable sale figure.\nAdvertisement\nProgress has been made on Alejandro Garnacho\u2019s exit, with Chelsea talks opening, and Marcus Rashford\u2019s loan to Barcelona relieved the burden of his pay packet, but the attempts to raise more than \u00a3150m by selling through those out-of-favour has so far failed to bring in any fees.\nSales were thought to likely be critical before further signings, although internal deliberations took place earlier in the summer to investigate whether another new arrival beyond Cunha and Mbeumo was possible first. The attempt to sign Ekitike also showed money could be found if required.\nThird quarter results for the 2023-24 financial year revealed that, as of the end of April, the Old Trafford hierarchy could borrow a further \u00a3140m under their existing revolving credit facilities. Ratcliffe is said to have been reticent to use the facilities in the past, viewing them as akin to taking on credit card debt, but a \u00a3100m drawdown was sanctioned during last summer\u2019s window.\nA recent filing at Companies House also suggested that the revolving facilities had been the subject of a time extension, or adjustment to their borrowing capacity, potentially allowing the club to draw down more than \u00a3140m available in April.\nAnd after the embarrassment of a lowest-ever Premier League finish and the failure to qualify for European competition, several people familiar with the matter believe immediate-term performances have come into sharper focus. Amorim\u2019s status is on the line this season, allied also to that of Berrada and Wilcox. Ratcliffe, for his part, does not want to waste time seeing success on the pitch. \u201cIt is now or never,\u201d in the words of one staff member.\nExploring the conditions of a potential deal for Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s Carlos Baleba can be viewed in a similar light. A midfielder was always going to be the next priority.\nBut already committing to a potential spend of more than \u00a3200m is a clear endorsement of Amorim, Berrada and Wilcox, but also a sign Old Trafford hierarchy know they simply must avoid a repeat of last season. In Sesko, they finally have their striker, and Manchester United may not be done yet.\nOther contributors: Sebastian Stafford-Bloor, George Caulkin and Adam Crafton\n(Top photo: Ulrik Pedersen/NurPhoto via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Good things come in threes \u2014 or at least Ruben Amorim will be hoping so.\nThe Manchester United head coach is set to completely refresh his forward line with the addition of three exciting new attacking options this summer. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo joined earlier in the window, and now the club have agreed a deal with RB Leipzig for centre-forward Benjamin Sesko that will take their spending on a new attack for the 2025-26 season past \u00a3200million ($268m).\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s a tantalising prospect for United fans. While their defence was found sorely wanting last season, shipping 54 goals, United have still managed to finish sixth in the Premier League on three occasions in the past decade when conceding this number or more. Instead, it was their stuttering attack that proved more damaging: United scored just 44 times in the domestic top flight, their lowest-ever return in the 33-year Premier League era.\nSo it\u2019s an area that clearly demanded a reboot. But can this new trio gel, and flourish, within Amorim\u2019s system?\nProjecting how an individual will perform after changing club is always fraught with uncertainty. The crystal ball becomes murkier still when trying to anticipate the chemistry of an entirely-rebuilt forward line. Still, the roles and performances of these three in recent seasons offer encouraging signs that they can complement and even elevate each other\u2019s strengths as United team-mates.\nThe most basic test of this fluidity is positional: will they get in each other\u2019s way? We don\u2019t know what exact configuration Amorim will settle on \u2014 Sesko has yet to actually sign, while Mbeumo and Cunha have played just 45 minutes together in last weekend\u2019s pre-season friendly against Everton \u2014 but on paper, they appear well-balanced as a unit.\nLooking at their touch maps from last season, Mbeumo shows a strong preference for the right flank, Cunha drifts inside from the left rather than hugging the touchline, and Sesko typically operates through the middle, making it entirely feasible for United to start all three in their favoured positions.\nBut simply slotting three talented players into the roles where they are happiest is no guarantee of chemistry. What matters most is how they interact. Does the centre-forward make the kind of runs the wide players like to pick out? Do they play the passes the guy up front thrives on? Will they be able to press as a coherent unit?\nAdvertisement\nCunha and Mbeumo profile as near mirror images of one another, which should allow them to dovetail naturally and play off each other. Both excel at driving their teams up the pitch with surging ball carries and progressive passes \u2014 the kind of attacking profiles United sorely lacked last season, as shown in the graphic below. Cunha also brings the added benefit of having played as a left-sided No 10 for Wolves in a 3-4-2-1 system, the same setup Amorim is steadfastly committed to at United.\nWhat\u2019s less clear is how these wide attackers will link up with Sesko.\nPart of that uncertainty stems from the 22-year-old Slovenian\u2019s relative inexperience, coupled with his two contrasting campaigns at Leipzig that muddy the waters when it comes to identifying his natural playing style.\nWhen Sesko first signed for the Germans in summer 2023, he was deployed as a classic penalty-box striker \u2014 playing on the shoulder of the last defender, with most of his touches concentrated in advanced areas. But then last season, as Leipzig\u2019s form cratered and their attacking issues began to resemble United\u2019s, the creative supply line faltered. Sesko was often forced to drop deeper to get involved in the play.\nFor a better sense of how he might fit into the United jigsaw, we can look at the kind of centre-forwards Cunha and Mbeumo have thrived alongside in the past, what Amorim typically demands from his strikers, and how well Sesko matches that profile.\nWhile they share stylistic traits, Mbeumo and Cunha tend to look for slightly different things from their front man.\nFor starters, Mbeumo enjoyed a much stronger partnership with Yoane Wissa at Brentford last season than Cunha did with Wolves team-mate Jorgen Strand Larsen.\nMbeumo combined with Wissa 166 times, compared to just 80 passes between Cunha and Strand Larsen, albeit that was their fourth year playing together compared wth the first for the Wolves duo. But for the Cameroon international, it wasn\u2019t just about this link-up play. Mbeumo thrived just as much on Wissa\u2019s tireless off-ball movement, which intelligently created space for him to exploit. The sight of Wissa dragging a defender away with an overlapping or underlapping run, allowing Mbeumo to cut inside and curl one in with his left foot, became a regular feature at the Gtech Community Stadium last season.\nAdvertisement\nBy contrast, Cunha typically looked for Strand Larsen to drop deep, using the Norwegian\u2019s imposing physical frame to play quick wall passes that allowed him to burst towards the edge of the box as he cut inside from the left. One such sequence is shown below, taken from the 3-0 home win against Leicester in April.\nAcross both his seasons at Leipzig, Sesko showed this willingness to drop deep and link up with his midfield.\nAccording to tracking data from SkillCorner, he ranked highly among European strikers for both runs coming short and runs that support the ball carrier in each of his Bundesliga campaigns. This suggests he can offer Cunha and Mbeumo a platform for quick, fluid, short-passing combinations.\nBut it\u2019s long, direct runs into the channels that Amorim truly prizes in his centre-forwards \u2014 movements that stretch defences and open up space for the team\u2019s two No 10s to attack.\nSesko made more of these runs during his debut campaign, but they became less frequent as Leipzig\u2019s overall form declined. By contrast, existing United forward Rasmus Hojlund has consistently shown a willingness to make such runs, even if he often remains peripheral in build-up play.\nUnited\u2019s style under their Portuguese coach is based on slow, patient build-up \u2014 only Manchester City recorded a lower direct speed in the league last season \u2014 but long passes into the channels for the striker remain a key tactical outlet. While Hojlund may be more eager to make these kinds of movements, the issue lies in what happens when the ball is actually played to him.\nDespite standing at 6ft 3in (191cm), Hojlund struggles in the air, winning just 25 per cent of his aerial duels last season \u2014 a figure that ranks him near the bottom among strikers across Europe. What the 6ft 5in Sesko may lack in movement, he makes up for with his ability to make the ball stick. The scatter plot below highlights just how much more aerially dominant he is than Hojlund (or his fellow 6ft 3in United striker Joshua Zirkzee).\nHe also far outstrips the Dane for successful take-ons per 90 minutes \u2014 an important trait for when long balls are lumped forward and a striker must fend off defenders while waiting for the attacking cavalry to come over the hill.\nUnited don\u2019t yet have the structure behind their attack to support an Erling Haaland-type forward \u2014 one who loiters around the box, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. Their No 9 will need to roll up his sleeves, get his shorts muddy, and be very much involved. And there\u2019s plenty of evidence that Sesko is more than willing to do just that.\nAdvertisement\nBut perhaps most encouraging is his Haaland-like knack for finding and finishing chances, regardless of what\u2019s going on behind him. Leipzig have endured two topsy-turvy campaigns, yet Sesko hit double figures for goals in both.\nIn fact, all three of United\u2019s new forwards scored more than 10 times last season.\nThe easiest and quickest way for them to build chemistry and confidence is to carry that trait over to their new team.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"

      "text": "More than a few Chelsea-supporting eyes were drawn to Palmeiras\u2019 goalless draw with Porto at Metlife Stadium on Sunday, eager to watch the bright new hope of Brazilian football test himself against European opposition for the first time.\nThe fact that Estevao was named FIFA\u2019s Superior Player of the Match \u2014 an award decided by viewer votes \u2014 underlined the bubbling excitement that has followed him to this Club World Cup, and will accompany him to Stamford Bridge when a transfer worth \u20ac34million (\u00a329m, $39m) up front and another \u20ac23m tied to performance-based incentives is formally completed after the tournament.\nAdvertisement\nEstevao has had many more decisive matches for Palmeiras in the dazzling first 18 months of his professional career, but the Porto defence still bore witness to the qualities that compelled Chelsea to move so quickly to secure his signature last year: the silky dribble, the probing eye for a pass, the sharp movement into scoring positions, the keen awareness of space.\nIn his numerous flicks and stepovers, there were also flashes of the joy that emanates from Estevao on the pitch, and a courage to keep trying to create that distinguishes him beyond his substantive talent as a natural showman in the grand Brazilian footballing tradition.\n\u201cThe main objective is to help my team to win, but football is also a spectacle,\u201d Estevao tells The Athletic after a Palmeiras training session at their Club World Cup base at UNC Greensboro, North Carolina on Tuesday. \u201cPeople go to the stadium hoping to see a win but also to have fun.\n\u201cI think one thing goes hand-in-hand with the other: when I am able to entertain the fans with my dribbles, goals and good play, I am also helping my team to go after a result.\u201d\nIt is this attitude as much as his ability that has led many in his homeland to conclude that Estevao is the biggest talent Brazil has produced since Neymar.\nCruzeiro were the first to bet on his elite potential, scouting and bringing him from Sao Paolo to Belo Horizonte at the age of eight and even creating a new youth category in their academy to aid his development. Then it was Nike, who sponsored him at 10. Palmeiras recruited him aged 14 and elevated him to their first team at 16.\nAt that point, Chelsea were among a host of major European clubs tracking his progress. In May 2024, a verbal agreement was reached on a deal to bring him to west London in the summer of 2025, less than two months after his 18th birthday.\nThe looming transfer has increased the pressure on Estevao\u2019s performances over the past 12 months, but arguably no more so than the dizzyingly high standard he set for himself in a breakthrough 2024 season for Palmeiras, racking up 13 goals and nine assists in 31 league appearances, 26 of which were starts. He rarely lets it show.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPressure is part of football,\u201d he adds. \u201cEvery player has to deal with it. When I\u2019m on the pitch, I try to just think about having fun and helping my team in the best way I can: by scoring goals and setting them up. I like to say that the football pitch is my amusement park because it\u2019s where I feel happiest.\u201d\nHis debut campaign was punctuated by memorable moments: playfully mimicking Cole Palmer\u2019s cold celebration after scoring against Juventude soon after the Chelsea move was announced, turning Bahia manager Rogerio Ceni into a meme when the former Brazil goalkeeper reacted to seeing the teenager whip a left-footed shot into his team\u2019s net by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible, there\u2019s no way to stop him\u201d, and best of all, curling a sublime free kick into the top corner in the 90th minute away to Cruzeiro to snatch a 2-1 win that kept Palmeiras\u2019 league title hopes alive.\nAlong the way, he quickly earned the respect as well as the affection of his older team-mates. \u201cI sort of adopted him,\u201d Palmeiras attacking midfielder Raphael Veiga told SporTV in October 2024. \u201cWe have a great affinity. We live near each other and he\u2019s often at my house. I\u2019m happy for him, for his ascent.\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s experiencing now will be nothing compared to what he will achieve in the game. He\u2019s one of the best players I\u2019ve ever played with. He has a good head on his shoulders. What impresses me is his mental strength in decisive moments, under pressure.\u201d\nEstevao had demonstrated that mental strength by stepping up to convert a penalty against Cuiaba in April when Veiga, the first-choice taker, was not on the pitch. That instinct to assume responsibility for his team worked against him in February when he won a spot kick, then saw his effort saved to condemn Palmeiras to a 1-1 draw against 10-man Corinthians.\nAdvertisement\nAs he later detailed in a Players\u2019 Tribune article published to mark his 18th birthday, Estevao was searching for something on Instagram to lift his post-match gloom when he saw a private message of encouragement from Neymar, the countryman whose outrageous skills he spent his childhood studying on YouTube and then trying to emulate.\n\u201cNeymar is an idol, a reference point in Brazilian football,\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up watching him shine in a Brazil shirt, so I was really happy when he sent me that message. I was sad to have missed the penalty and it was incredible to get support from a superstar I have always admired. We spent some time together at the Sao Paulo state championship awards ceremony and, more recently, when he visited the national team camp.\n\u201cI dream of playing with him for Brazil one day. I hope I can make it come true.\u201d\nNeymar has a better idea than most of what lies ahead for Estevao, having also left Brazilian football to join a European side with all the hype and expectations that accompany a prodigy. He was 21 when he swapped Santos for Barcelona in 2013, readier than many others who have made the same voyage across the Atlantic to impact matches at the highest level.\nYet while Neymar clearly recognises a kindred spirit in Estevao, their personalities are very different. The unassuming son of a church pastor who will be accompanied by his parents and younger sister in his move to a new home near Chelsea\u2019s training ground in Cobham, no one expects Estevao to be distracted by the trappings of fame and wealth, nor the temptations that a city like London can present to young footballers. Such a strong support network should insulate him from many of the problems that have derailed other Brazilian wonderkids far from home.\nOn the pitch, there are differences too. Many in Brazil believe Estevao is best as a No 10, and he spent long stretches of the Porto game drifting into central pockets of space between the opposition lines. Earlier this year, his agent Andre Cury revealed Chelsea became the teenager\u2019s preferred suitor in part because they see him as a central attacking midfielder rather than a right winger \u2014 an evaluation that raises immediate questions about his fit with Palmer.\nEstevao himself, however, does not regard his position in such binary terms. \u201cFor me, the most important thing is playing,\u201d he insists. \u201cThe position doesn\u2019t matter. I can play inside, as a No 10, or on the wing. The collective is the most important thing. I\u2019m always available to the coach, ready to help in whatever way I can.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHe is primarily referring there to Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira, not Enzo Maresca. Estevao\u2019s focus is fully on ensuring that he finishes on a high with the club that gave him the platform to alert the world to his talent. His final appearance at Allianz Parque against Sporting Cristal in May was marked with the emotional presentation of a poster and a plaque, a goal and an assist, and a standing ovation from his adoring fans.\nPreparations for the move to Chelsea have been in progress for the past year. Estevao is learning English, but the initial priority has understandably been football terminology; other linguistic flourishes like knowing how to ask where the nearest cinema is can wait.\nEstevao told ESPN Brasil this week that his life plays in his head like a film, and some of the events unfolding around him would not look out of place in a sports movie.\nHis first Brazil start earlier this month against Ecuador ended in warm conversation and warmer embraces with Moises Caicedo, Andrey Santos and Kendry Paez, his soon-to-be Chelsea team-mates. Then there is this Club World Cup, which offers a unique chance to crown his Palmeiras career in its final chapter \u2014 not least because of who he will face in his last group game against Inter Miami.\nLionel Messi is another idol, the greatest of all the left-footed dribblers. Estevao shed the \u201cMessinho\u201d nickname he earned in Cruzeiro\u2019s academy long ago, but not his admiration for the man who inspired it. \u201cHe\u2019s a player I have always looked up to,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I would watch videos of him, then go out to the pitch and try to copy what I had seen.\n\u201cAs soon as the final whistle blows, I\u2019m going to run to him so we can swap shirts. But before that, I\u2019ll be giving my everything so Palmeiras walk off the field with three points.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have chosen a better way to end this stage of my career. Palmeiras is my home and being able to say goodbye while competing for a Club World Cup\u2026 it\u2019s indescribable.\u201d\n(Top photo: Ernesto Benavides/AFP)"
