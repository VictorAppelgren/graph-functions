  "title": "Who is eligible for AT&T data breach settlement? Kroll paying $177M. See PA eligibility",
  "description": "Hey Pennsylvania, check your eligibility for AT&T's settlement, which could pay upwards of $7,500 per person. See details here.",
  "content": "Claims are open for millions of customers including Pennsylvania residents affected by two massive AT&T data breaches in recent years, with the telecommunications company agreeing to pay out a settlement worth $177 million.\n\nThe preliminary settlement agreement, handled by Kroll Settlement Administration, stems from a class action lawsuit against AT&T. The suit came following two large-scale data breaches announced in March and July 2024 that exposed customers' private information, such as Social Security numbers, addresses, birthdates, passcodes, billing numbers, phone numbers, and more to the dark web, according to a release from Kroll.\n\nThe conditionally approved agreement from both data breaches divides claimants into two classes, although people affected by both breaches can file claims for both. The first breach exposed data of 7.6 million current and 65.4 million former account owners, according to an AT&T release from 2024. The second exposed information from 110 million people, and led to the arrest of several hackers.\n\nAT&T has denied any wrongdoing as part of the agreement, and has not been found liable for anything by a court.\n\nHere's all you need to know about the settlement in Pennsylvania, if you are eligible and how to submit a claim.\n\nNo. The email notices you received from the Kroll Settlement Administration is not a scam. Kroll is the settlement administrator handling the AT&T settlement, and sent notices about your options via the email attsettlement@e.emailksa.com. If you have questions, you can call 833-890-4930.\n\nWhat did the AT&T data breach class action settlement allege?\n\nAT&T was accused of two data breach incidents, one on March 30, 2024 and a second on July 12, 2024, according to Kroll Settlement Administration. The data breaches had allegedly occurred in 2019 and 2024, although the earlier breach was not acknowledged by the telecommunications company until March 2024, weeks after customer data had allegedly already spread to the dark web. A total of 73 million customers had their private information revealed, including passwords and Social Security numbers. At the time, AT&T took measures to reset passwords for millions of customers.\n\nThe second data breach reported in July 2024 covered by the legal settlement happened shortly after AT&T announced the first breach. In April 2024, hackers stole phone records of \"nearly all\" of its cellular and landline customers, as well as call history and text message contacts (although not the content of the messages). AT&T notified around 110 million customers, alerting them that hackers had stolen records from their Snowflake system, a provider of cloud services. In November 2024, two men were arrested and indicted by federal authorities, according to TechCrunch.\n\nAm I eligible for the AT&T data breach settlement claim?\n\nCustomers affected by the first data incident who can prove \"documented loss\" can receive up to $5,000. This does not include self-prepared documents, such as handwritten receipts, accountings, statements and declarations, according to a website set up by Kroll to assist the public. If you cannot prove that loss, there are cash tier payments, based on whether your Social Security number was included in the breach.\n\nFor the second breach, customers who were affected and can prove the same demonstrated loss with documentation can receive up to $2,500. If you are unable to prove the loss, there are cash tier payments that are pro rata, meaning it will be divided up evenly between those who submit claims.\n\nThose affected by both data breaches, or an overlap settlement class member, can file claims for both classes. It's not entirely clear yet if someone who can demonstrate losses in both breaches will receive the full $7,500, as the settlement website does not make note of that.\n\nHow to submit claim for AT&T settlement\n\nTo submit a claim for the AT&T settlement, Kroll Settlement Administration has created a website where eligible class members can submit claims for compensation. Your completed claim form can also be submitted by traditional mail via the address located on the website.\n\nWhen is the deadline to submit a claim?\n\nThe deadline to file a claim for the AT&T class action data settlement is Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025.\n\nWhat if I do nothing?\n\nIf you received notice of the AT&T settlement and believe you are eligible, but do nothing about it, you will not get paid. If you want to exclude yourself from the settlement and keep your right to sue over the claims of the lawsuit, you must opt out by mailing a written request to the settlement administration via the address found here no later than Oct. 17, 2025.\n\nHow much money will I get from AT&T settlement?\n\nAT&T has agreed to make available two settlement funds: $149 million to settle the claims from the first data incident in March 2024, and $28 million for the second data incident in July 2024.\n\nWhen will payments be sent?\n\nIt is unclear when payments will be sent, but a final approval hearing of the settlement agreement will be held before a judge in the District of Montana on Dec. 3, 2025. At that time, the settlement may be approved and dispersements can go out to affected customers.\n\nLori Comstock is a New Jersey-based journalist with the Mid-Atlantic Connect Team.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Delaware News Journal: Got AT&T?

      "text": "The U.S. government has accused Connor Moucka and John Binns of being the hackers who broke into the systems of AT&T, stealing around 50 billion customer call and text records.\nIn July, AT&T said hackers stole the phone records of \u201cnearly all\u201d of its cellular and landline customers, as well as calls and text message records \u2014 such as who contacted whom by phone or text \u2014 but not the content of the messages. At the time, AT&T said it would notify around 110 million AT&T customers of the breach and that the records were stolen from its systems hosted on Snowflake, a provider of cloud services for data analysis.\nUntil the Department of Justice\u2019s indictment against the two hackers, which was filed on Sunday, the total number of stolen AT&T customer records was unknown.\nThe document does not mention AT&T. Instead, it mentions \u201cVictim-2,\u201d describing it as \u201ca major telecommunications company located in the United States,\u201d which was breached around April 14. When AT&T previously confirmed it was breached, it said the company learned of the hack on April 19. This means that both the description of what kind of company Victim-2 is, and the dates of its breach, align with what AT&T had publicly disclosed, making it almost certain that Victim-2 is indeed AT&T.\nAT&T did not respond to a request for comment.\nDOJ spokesperson Emily Langlie declined to comment.\nContact Us\nDo you have more information about the AT&T breach?

You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.Overall, according to the indictment, Moucka and Binns accessed \u201cbillions of sensitive customer records\u201d and were successful in extorting at least three victims of at least 36 bitcoin (around $2.5 million when the victims paid) over the span of almost a year, from around November 2023 to October 10 of this year.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Binns was previously arrested in Turkey, according to 404 Media.\nIn August, Binns took credit for the AT&T breach with The Wall Street Journal. Moucka, through his moniker \u201cJudische,\u201d told 404 Media that he thought he\u2019d be arrested soon.\nAT&T is just one of several victims who had sensitive data stolen from their Snowflake instances. Over the last months, hackers also broke into Santander Bank, Ticketmaster, and around 165 other corporate customers. All these companies use Snowflake.\nProsecutors alleged that by breaking into the victim companies\u2019 Snowflake instances, the hackers stole troves of sensitive personal and corporate data, including social security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, passport numbers, and banking information, which makes these Snowflake-related breaches some of the worst cyberattacks of the year. In some cases, the hackers also asked victims for a ransom by threatening them with leaking the stolen information, threats that they followed up on at times.\nWired previously reported that AT&T paid a hacker $370,000 in an attempt to get them to delete the stolen records. Prosecutors said in the indictment that Victim-2 paid a ransom to the hackers.\nThis story has been updated to include DOJ\u2019s no comment."
