      "summary": "Niutech has secured a £22 million UK order for a 60,000‑tonne‑per‑year continuous waste‑plastic pyrolysis line, bolstering its position in the high‑end European circular‑economy market. The deal comes amid the UK’s intensified plastic‑packaging tax and broader circular‑economy policies that drive demand for efficient chemical recycling, with Niutech’s technology promising 30 % higher production efficiency and significant CO₂ reductions. The contract signals growing confidence in industrial‑scale pyrolysis and supports the UK’s carbon‑reduction and waste‑management targets.",
