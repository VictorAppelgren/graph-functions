      "summary": "Iran's Foreign Minister is set to hold a conference call with European counterparts to discuss the potential reimposition of UN sanctions over its nuclear program, which has escalated following the recent Iran-Israel conflict. The European nations have warned Iran of a 'snapback' mechanism that could restore sanctions if no satisfactory agreement is reached by the end of August. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Kim Davis is appealing to the Supreme Court to overturn the landmark same-sex marriage ruling, claiming it infringes on her religious freedoms, amidst a broader conservative push to challenge marriage rights.",
