  "description": "Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (OTCQB: EMMA), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company and leader in the treatment of sickle cell disease, today reported on its financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025.",
  "content": "TORRANCE, Calif., Aug. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (OTCQB: EMMA), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company and leader in the treatment of sickle cell disease, today reported on its financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. \"We experienced a 48% decline in net revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024 due to ongoing competition from generic L-Glutamine, partially offset by a 33% reduction in operating expenses,\" commented Willis Lee, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. \"We realized loss from operations of $0.4 million compared to income from operations of $0.6 million in the prior year,\" he added. Net Revenues. Net revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2025 were $2.8 million, compared to $5.4 million in the same period in 2024. The decrease was due to a decrease in U.S. sales which management attributes to competition from the generic version of L-Glutamine introduced in the market in mid-2024. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the three months were $3.0 million compared to $4.6 million in the comparable period in 2024. The decrease was due primarily to decreases in selling expenses and general and administrative expenses attributable to a reduction in force in Q4 2024. Income (Loss) From Operations. Total loss from operations for the three months was $0.4 million compared to income from operation of $0.6 million in the same period in 2024. This was due to the decrease in net revenues. Other Expense. The company realized other expense of $1.4 million for the three months compared to $2.7 million in the same period in 2024. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease of $1.4 million in change in fair value of conversion feature derivative liabilities and an increase in decreases in $0.9 million nonrecurring gain recognized on lease modification of the Torrance headquarter office lease partially offset by $0.7 million increase in interest expenses. Net Loss. For the three months, the company realized net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.02 per share based on approximately 63.9 million weighted-average basic common shares, compared to net loss of $2.2 million, or $0.03 per share based on approximately 63.4 million weighted-average basic common shares in the comparable period in 2024. The decreased net loss was attributable to the decrease in other expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources. At June 30, 2025, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $0.9 million, compared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2024.\n\nAbout Emmaus Life Sciences\n\nEmmaus Life Sciences, Inc. is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company and leader in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Endari\u00ae (L-glutamine oral powder), indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adults and children 5 years and older, is approved for marketing in the United States, Israel, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman and is available on a named patient or early access basis in France, the Netherlands, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where Emmaus' application for marketing authorization is awaiting final action by the Saudi Food & Drug Authority. For more information, please visit www.emmausmedical.com. About Endari\u00ae (prescription grade L-glutamine oral powder)\n\nEndari\u00ae, Emmaus' prescription grade L-glutamine oral powder, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2017 for treating sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older. Indication\n\nEndari\u00ae is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older. Important Safety Information\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence >10 percent) in clinical studies were constipation, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, cough, pain in extremities, back pain, and chest pain. Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation included one case each of hypersplenism, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, burning sensation, and hot flash. The safety and efficacy of Endari\u00ae in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease younger than five years of age has not been established. For more information, please see full Prescribing Information of Endari\u00ae at: www.ENDARIrx.com/PI. About Sickle Cell Disease\n\nThere are approximately 100,000 people living with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States and millions more globally. The sickle gene is found in every ethnic group, not just among those of African descent; and in the United States an estimated 1-in-365 African Americans and 1-in-16,300 Hispanic Americans are born with SCD.1 The genetic mutation responsible for SCD causes an individual's red blood cells to distort into a \"C\" or a sickle shape, reducing their ability to transport oxygen throughout the body. These sickled red blood cells break down rapidly, become very sticky, and develop a propensity to clump together, which causes them to become stuck and cause damage within blood vessels. The result is reduced blood flow to distal organs, which leads to physical symptoms of incapacitating pain, tissue and organ damage, and early death.2 1Source: Data & Statistics on Sickle Cell Disease \u2013 National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, December 2020.\n\n2Source: Committee on Addressing Sickle Cell Disease \u2013 A Strategic Plan and Blueprint for Action -- National Academy of Sciences Press, 2020. Forward-looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including statements regarding the recent trend in net revenues . These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties which change over time, including doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern and other factors disclosed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on April 14, 2025 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on August 14, 2025, and actual results may differ materially.
