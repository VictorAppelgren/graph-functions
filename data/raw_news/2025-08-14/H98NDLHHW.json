  "description": "A Texas woman said in a lawsuit that a U.S. Marine got her pregnant and then, after she chose to keep the pregnancy, dissolved abortion pills in her hot chocolate.",
  "content": "Medical abortion pills. A wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Liana Davis claims that Christopher Cooprider dosed her with 10 abortion pills after she rebuffed his requests to end her pregnancy.\n\nA Texas woman said in a lawsuit that a U.S. Marine got her pregnant and then, after she chose to keep the pregnancy, dissolved abortion pills in her hot chocolate.\n\nA Texas woman accused a U.S. Marine in a lawsuit on Monday of lacing her drink with abortion pills, terminating her pregnancy against her wishes. The woman, Liana Davis, 37, claims that Christopher Cooprider, 34, a U.S. Marine Corps Captain from Arizona who she says impregnated her, secretly dissolved 10 pills of misoprostol, a drug used in medical abortions, in a hot chocolate he made for her on April 5. She made the accusation in a civil complaint filed in a federal court in Texas.. Shortly after drinking the beverage, the complaint says, Ms. Davis began bleeding and went to the hospital, where she lost her pregnancy. The lawsuit also names Aid Access, a major seller of abortion pills online, as a defendant. Ms. Davis said in the lawsuit that Mr. Cooprider used Aid Access to obtain the pills. The suit named the founder of Aid Access, the Dutch physician Rebecca Gomperts, as a third defendant.\n\nMr. Cooprider, a flight student with the U.S. Marines in Corpus Christi, Texas, declined to comment on the lawsuit or say if he had a lawyer. The U.S. Marine Corps said in a statement that it was aware of a civil lawsuit involving one of its aviation students but that no additional information was available. In a statement, Dr. Gomperts pointed to Aid Access\u2019s role in providing \u201cessential, lifesaving health care\u201d for vulnerable women.\n\nThe lawsuit says that Ms. Davis has three children with her husband, with whom she was in divorce proceedings. According to the messages, Mr. Cooprider told Ms. Davis that he wanted her to have an abortion, even before she had confirmed her pregnancy with a test. Ms. Davis texted Mr. Cooprider on Jan. 31, 2025, for his thoughts on her possible pregnancy, and he responded, \u201cGet rid of it,\u201d the lawsuit said. Mr. Cooprider added that the two were not in love or a couple, and that bringing a child into the world would be \u201cmessed up,\u201d according to the lawsuit. On Feb. 3, Mr. Cooprider sent a text message saying that if the pregnancy test was \u201cpositive then we need to schedule a clinic visit and get an abortion pill asap,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nOn Feb. 5, Mr. Cooprider texted Ms. Davis and said he was going to order abortion pills for her, according to the complaint, a step it said Ms. Davis opposed. On Feb. 6, Mr. Cooprider purchased pills from Aid Access, according to the lawsuit. \u201cI\u2019m not OK with you buying something like that w/o my permission,\u201d Ms. Davis wrote him, according to the complaint. Mr. Cooprider brought the pills to Ms. Davis\u2019s home and repeatedly asked her to take them, according to the lawsuit. Pictures included in the lawsuit show two containers of abortion drugs labeled \u201cChris Cooprider.\u201d The text exchanges grew more heated over several weeks, then took an abrupt turn. In early April, the lawsuit says, Mr. Cooprider texted Ms. Davis to propose a \u201ctrust building night\u201d where he would make them \u201cwarm relaxing tea.\u201d Mr. Cooprider went to Ms. Davis\u2019s home on April 5, where he made her a hot chocolate, according to the lawsuit. Ms. Davis was eight weeks pregnant at the time, the lawsuit said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, she began hemorrhaging and cramping within 30 minutes of drinking the beverage. Mr. Cooprider said he would drive to get Ms. Davis\u2019s mother, who lived nearby, the lawsuit said. The plan was that she would mind Ms. Davis\u2019s three children, and Mr. Cooprider could then drive Ms. Davis to the emergency room. But after leaving to get Ms. Davis\u2019s mother around 12:10 a.m., Mr. Cooprider stopped responding to calls and texts, and did not pick her up, according to the lawsuit. Screenshots of text messages included in the lawsuit show Ms. Davis repeatedly texting Mr. Cooprider, including one sent at 12:34 a.m. saying: \u201cI\u2019m gushing blood. Please hurry.\u201d Ms. Davis sent her mother money for an Uber just before 1 a.m., around the same time Mr. Cooprider responded to the text messages, the lawsuit said. He apologized and told her he had a flight in the morning, according to the complaint, and then stopped answering. Before leaving the house, Ms. Davis found the opened packets of pills, the lawsuit said. A neighbor drove Ms. Davis to a Bay Area hospital\u2019s emergency room, where she lost the pregnancy, according to the complaint.",
