  "title": "The $58,000 tree that Hamptons residents are fighting to install",
  "description": "Forget mega yachts and mansions, if you can't afford a $95,000 tree, you are no longer up to Hamptons standards.",
  "content": "Forget mega yachts and mansions, the latest Hamptons status symbol is found in the garden.\n\nA $58,000 shrub has become the latest must-have for wealthy residents in the elite corner of New York's East End.\n\nThe Hindu-Pan topiary sparked a furious bidding war earlier this Spring, according to Marders, the go-to garden center in Bridgehampton.\n\nIt is densely held and slow-growing, making it perfect for homeowners looking to make a statement without excessive upkeep.\n\nCharlie Marder, who opened Marders with his wife Kathleen in 1975, told the Daily Mail that, while the price sounds extravagant, it reflects the cost and complexity of moving a 60 to 80-year-old specimen.\n\n'It's not just a tree, it's a time capsule. It represents decades of growth,' Marders said.\n\nMarders gathers the and other specialist trees from across the country, some costing an eye-watering $95,000.\n\nHe won\u2019t sell them to customers without a property inspection, to ensure the garden has enough space and sunlight for the precious tree to thrive.\n\nIf the garden doesn\u2019t make the cut, Marders said he has been known to reject clients.\n\nHe revealed that five eager shoppers fought over a $58,000 Hindu-Pan topiary earlier this year.\n\nFor anyone tempted to cash in on the trend, one tree is still on offer offer: A 65-foot crepe myrtle for $95,000.\n\nMarders explained that the generic manicured lawns and neatly trimmed hedges once synonymous with the wealthy enclave are on their way out.\n\nHis store currently sells a large selection of rocks - glacial, architectural, archaeological and some unusual mined stones that are displayed in the garden yard and often incorporated into their projects.\n\nMarders explained that people 'want gardens that make sense,' not just generic landscaping.\n\n'Residents of the Hamptons want outdoor spaces that are aligned with their home's architecture, their geographic location, their environmental beliefs and the kind of lifestyle they are seeking outdoors,' he said.\n\nHe explained people began really prioritizing garden spaces in the 1970s, when gourmet food became a norm and when entertaining moved into the outdoor space.\n\nThe fascination has been accelerated following the pandemic because people were home all the time and started to see their property differently, Marders explained.\n\nAnother hot commodity in Hamptons gardens this summer is Nassella grass, per The Cut.\n\nResidents have reportedly been requesting Nassella - a hair-thin grass with golden hay-like tips, from their landscapers in their droves.\n\nIt has now upstaged the once-popular Japanese forest grass, Hakonechloa.\n\nPinewood Ferennial Gardens in the North Folk anticipates 9,000 plants to be sold by the end of summer.\n\nOne customer asked for 600 pots of the precious grass in June. She was told she would have to settle for 80.\n\n\u2018Trendy designers use something and everybody copies it,\u2019 assistant manager Ken Johnson told The Cut.\n\nAside from expensive greenery, another landscaping trend in the Hamptons is the \u2018longevity garden\u2019.\n\nAccording to Modern Luxury, longevity gardens go beyond aesthetic - these gardens are tied up in the wellness sphere.\n\nCelebrated landscape architect and LaGuardia Design Group founder Christopher LaGuardia pioneered the concept with his certified nutritionist daughter Charlotte.\n\nTogether they are planting gardens designed to \u2018support health, vitality and intentional living\u2019.\n\nThe gardens feature a combination of antioxidant-packed herbs and layouts that invite mindfulness and movement.\n\nNothing screams 'The Hamptons' more than a crossover between luxury landscaping and \u2018wellness\u2019.",

      "text": ".\nThe Grass\nNassella is the hair-thin grass with golden haylike tips that upstaged the once-hip Japanese forest grass Hakonechloa. The North Fork\u2019s Pinewood Perennial Gardens expects to sell out 9,000 plants by the end of summer. In June, a customer asking for 600 pots had to settle for 80. \u201cTrendy designers use something and everybody copies it,\u201d says assistant manager Ken Johnson.\n.\nThe Fruit\nThe Japanese muskmelon is imported in limited quantities, and the Ryoma, the highest grade of melon, is especially rare in the U.S. Last summer, only a couple of dozen families out East were able to get their hands on one. Jonathan Bernard of Farm & Forage Market in Southampton expects he\u2019ll have 50 to 100 for sale this year for $300 each.\n.\nThe Tree\nA one-of-a-kind specimen tree. Bridgehampton\u2019s Marders sources them from all over the country and requires customers to undergo a home inspection to make sure they have enough space and sunlight. It has been known to turn clients down. This spring, five fought over a $58,000 Hindu-Pan topiary. Available still is a 65-foot crape myrtle for $95,000.\n.\nThe Poultry\nDo not show up with white eggs. Anywhere. Pigment is required. The most-coveted eggs produced by Indian Runner ducks can be described as Farrow & Ball Skylight. At Shelter Island\u2019s Sylvester Manor, the farm manager, Arielle Gardner, says there are 40 female ducks. All are named Gary, and their eggs are $6 per half-dozen.\n.\nThe Fishing Pole\nThe custom-built rods at White Water Outfitters in Hampton Bays convey serious connoisseurship. They are made by Rich Parisen, a 65-year \u201cmaster rod builder\u201d who learned his trade at the Bergdorf Goodman of bait-and-tackle shops, Altenkirch Precision Outfitters, which, in its heyday, served everyone from Babe Ruth to Billy Joel.\n.\nThe Cutlery\nDereyk Patterson\u2019s custom knives have a two-year waiting list. The work of the East Hampton artisan is prized by chefs such as Jacques P\u00e9pin. Each cleaver, slicer, and chef\u2019s knife is made to order, starting at $1,800, and forged in small batches over the course of a month. \u201cI can only do one thing at a time,\u201d he says. That\u2019s roughly ten-to-15 knives a month.\n.\nThe Grill\nAn Argentine-style wood-burning Parrilla Grill from Northfork Ironworks. In-the-know pitmasters such as Tom Colicchio and Roberta\u2019s Brandon Hoy are fans. In May, seven were delivered to Long Island grillers by ownerBrendan McCarthy, who takes a month to weld the 300-pound pieces himself in the Catskills; 15 more are on a waiting list.\n.\nThe Sauna\nTyl\u00f6, a make of Swedish saunas, is the brand to have. Bud Handel of East End Spa and Sauna and Wine Cellars has built 11 this year. Orders start at $30,000 for indoor saunas, and an outdoor lodge can cost up to $110,000. Custom designs take three months to complete, at minimum: \u201cRight now, I would not promise a good sauna outdoors built by Labor Day,\u201d Handel says.\n.\nThe Dress\nTiina the Store closed two years ago, but in its place Amagansett gained The Row. The brand\u2019s cotton midi-dress the Anitas is a real flex because it has sold out almost everywhere. \u201cI\u2019m wearing it to my bridal shower in Sag, actually, but it was a bitch to get my hands on,\u201d says Jess Graves, author of the shopping newsletter The Love List.\n.\nThe Outerwear\nMarfa Stance\u2019s plain quilted jackets can be personalized with custom collars, hoods, and liners. It\u2019s the Build-a-Bear of Montauk-mom outerwear. \u201cThe point is not that they\u2019re cute,\u201d says a personal shopper in town, where they\u2019re sold at Lingua Franca, \u201cbut that they\u2019re so distinct other moms can clock you and know you are one of them.\u201d\n.\nThe Car\nThe original Land Cruiser from Toyota\u2019s FJ series. Icon makes bespoke editions starting at $229,000. \u201cWe have about 50 units in the Hamptons area, and interest continues to grow as people resist showing up in a G-Wagon or Cybertruck,\u201d says CEO Jonathan Ward. There\u2019s a waiting list until 2026.\n.\nThe Boat\nMegayacht owners telegraph rank by cruising into Duryea\u2019s on a Vanquish, a multi-million-dollar, high-speed day yacht with an aluminum hull that\u2019s the Cybertruck of the water. There are just 35 on Long Island, mostly in Sag Harbor. The motto of the Netherlands-based shipyard is \u201cNot for Everyone.\u201d\nMore From the Hamptons Issue\n- New York x Bulgari Toasted the Artists of the Hamptons\n- The Pony Kids of the Hamptons\n- How Rebecca Hessel Cohen Entertains in the Hamptons"

  "argos_summary": "In the Hamptons, the latest luxury trend is investing in rare, high\u2011cost plants that serve as status symbols and low\u2011maintenance statements, such as a $58,000 Hindu\u2011Pan topiary and a $95,000 crepe myrtle. Garden designers are moving away from generic lawns toward bespoke, longevity gardens that blend wellness and aesthetics, with popular grasses like Nassella replacing older favorites. Marders, a Bridgehampton nursery, emphasizes careful site assessment before selling these trees, while other local boutiques offer complementary luxury goods\u2014from custom knives and saunas to high\u2011end grills and yachts\u2014reflecting a broader shift toward curated, experiential outdoor spaces.",
