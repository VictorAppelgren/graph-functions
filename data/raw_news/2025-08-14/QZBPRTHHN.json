  "content": "While nearly 5,000 orphan oil and gas wells pose environmental risks throughout the state, Louisiana is suing the entity it hired \u2013 then fired \u2013 to remedy the problem.\n\nIt\u2019s more evidence that relying on the fossil fuel industry to address a problem after the fact \u2013 rather than preventing it in the first place \u2013 continues to prove pointless. In this latest instance, a framework set up with the direct input of oil and gas interests appears to have collapsed under the weight of self-dealing and shoddy bookkeeping.\n\nA lawsuit filed Friday in a state court in Baton Rouge asks a judge to issue a temporary restraining order to prevent the Louisiana Oilfield Restoration Association from tossing any business records, The Advocate reported. Louisiana parted ways with LORA after an audit last year showed it was failing to keep pace with abandoned and neglected wells. A separate review raised questions about the association\u2019s financial practices.\n\nAmong the allegations state officials have lobbed at LORA is that it helped arrange a $780,000 home loan for Johnny Adams, the former assistant commissioner for the state Office of Conservation. Adams helped establish LORA in 2019 and fashioned its cooperative endeavor agreement with the state, according to the lawsuit. It set up a fee schedule for oil and gas exploration companies that LORA collected to pay for orphan well remediation.\n\nAdams\u2019 attorney told The Advocate his client\u2019s home loan was arranged with Chromos Wealth Services \u2013 and not LORA. The state included Chromos as one of the defendants in its lawsuit, claiming it\u2019s among the companies that received investment fees from the association and benefited from its tight-knit relationships.\n\nIt\u2019s arguable that close-kin business ties were inevitable from the start when LORA was established as a for-profit entity with minimal oversight from the state. Last year\u2019s audit noted that while the Office of Conservation allowed the association to increase the fee it collected for administrative costs, there was no way to review LORA\u2019s spending to see if it was justifiable.\n\nLORA stands by its work. In a statement to The Advocate, spokesman David LaPlante said \u201cthe current administration has different plans for addressing orphan wells,\u201d and that LORA will address the state\u2019s allegations in court.\n\nThe audit counted 976 plugged orphaned wells during fiscal years 2020-23 based on numbers from LORA and the state\u2019s Oilfield Site Restoration Program. But during that same period, nearly 1,700 new orphaned wells were reported.\n\nThe Office of Conservation gave the association its official kiss of death in May, saying it no longer recognized LORA as an \u201cacceptable financial institution\u201d to help drillers meet financial security requirements in Louisiana. Six years ago, it was created to provide what amounts to insurance for exploration projects, then given authority to collect fees for abandoned and spent well cleanup.\n\nThe writing on the wall for LORA came in spring 2024 when the Louisiana Legislature approved the creation of the Natural Resources Trust Authority, a subdivision of the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources. It was pitched as an opportunity to bring oversight of orphan well remediation in house and find a more reliable funding source for the work.\n\nThere\u2019s skepticism over whether the state will make appreciable progress in addressing its orphan well issues. Last year\u2019s audit estimated it would cost more than $500 million to cap and clean the number of wells needing attention at the time, which was nearly 4,800. Furthermore, the number of inactive wells \u2014 ones with a high risk of becoming orphaned \u2014 exceeded 21,600.\n\nGov. Jeff Landry has reconfigured his Department of Energy and Natural Resources (he added \u201cEnergy\u201d to its name) with a decided lean toward fossil fuel interests. Its secretary, Tyler Gray, was hired away from one of the state\u2019s leading oil and gas lobbying groups with a $60,000 salary increase compared with the person who previously held the department\u2019s top job.\n\nCertainly, LORA\u2019s inadequacies leave lots of room for improvement for a state-led effort to plug orphan wells. But it remains to be seen whether Landry and legislators \u2014 and their eventual successors, given the scope of the problem \u2013 can fund a long-term solution.\n\nUntil they are willing to require the oil and gas industry to take financial responsibility for the mess it\u2019s left behind in Louisiana, there\u2019s little hope conditions will improve \u2013 leaving Louisianians to face the risk and cost.\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",

      "text": "Louisiana is suing a company it had tasked with plugging orphan oil and gas wells, alleging its leaders engaged in \u201cself-dealing\u201d with the help of a former state official who oversaw them.\nThe lawsuit, filed Friday in the 19th Judicial District Court, asks a judge to issue a temporary restraining order preventing the Louisiana Oilfield Restoration Association and its directors from getting rid of business records or spending funds as the state seeks to recover money from the company.\nLouisiana terminated its deal with LORA after an audit and a financial review of the company raised questions about its spending \u2014 including facilitating a $700,000 \u201cbridge loan\u201d to help the state official buy a house.\nThe lawsuit says LORA misrepresented its finances; it failed to plug most of the wells for which it was responsible or pay the state to do so; and it collected unauthorized late fines from operators who failed to pay their fees when it should have reported those operators to the state.\nIt also lacked financial controls, breached its fiduciary duties and collected more money in administrative expenses than was allowed, misusing funds that should have gone to plugging orphan wells, the state has argued.\nLORA has gone ten weeks without fulfilling the state\u2019s request to provide a full accounting of its funds and spending, according to the lawsuit.\n\u201cAs a direct result of the Defendants' activities, the State of Louisiana and its citizens have been and continue to be harmed in a manner that money damages cannot adequately compensate,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cEvery day of delay is another day that Louisiana orphaned wells are left unplugged, putting Louisiana's environment and the lives, property, and \u2018health, safety, and welfare\u2019 of the citizens of Louisiana further at risk.\u201d\nLORA has made a $5 million partial payment to the state, the lawsuit says, but Louisiana has been unable to determine the full extent of damages.\n\"LORA is proud of the work it did to plug orphan wells in Louisiana,\u201d David LaPlante, a spokesperson for LORA, said in a statement. \u201cLORA understands that the current administration has different plans for addressing orphan wells. LORA is winding down its operations and will respond to the State\u2019s allegations through the legal process.\"\nQuestionable arrangements\nLORA was set up in 2019 to deal with the longstanding problem of \u201corphan\u201d oil and gas wells. A well can become orphaned either when its operator abandons it without plugging it, or when the operator stops maintaining the well in accordance with state regulations. Louisiana currently has some 4,971 orphan wells, which pose public health and environmental hazards.\nLORA collected fees from well operators in exchange for \u201cfinancial security,\u201d meaning it would take responsibility for wells if their operators went out of business \u2014 either by plugging the well itself or by paying the well\u2019s promised financial security amount to the state.\nBut the lawsuit says the arrangement had red flags from the start.\nIt alleges that Johnny Adams, a former senior attorney and assistant commissioner for the Office of Conservation, had a pre-existing relationship with Van Mayhall III, LORA\u2019s president. Yet Adams \u201cwas extensively involved in and greatly influenced\u201d the creation of LORA\u2019s cooperative endeavor agreement, which \u201cgreatly favored LORA, while prejudicing the state,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nIt is unclear just how much control Adams had over LORA's arrangement with the state. An advisory opinion issued by the state ethics board last year said it was the conservation commissioner who controlled the contract. Adams sought that opinion to see if Arkus could employ his daughter.\nIn addition to Mayhall, Adams also had preexisting personal relationships with LORA\u2019s four other directors, dating back to at least 2012, according to the lawsuit. It lists those directors as Jacob Dickinson, Andrew Berthelot, Phillip Marchiafava and Lance Chad Lott, Sr.\nAll four men, along with Mayhall and Adams, are named as defendants in the lawsuit, along with a host of companies linked to LORA\u2019s directors. They include Arkus Management Services, Chromos Wealth Solutions, the LORA Foundation and Willow Lake Well Services.\nState business records and federal tax filings show that at least one of LORA\u2019s directors manages each one of those entities, except for Willow Lake Well Services, which is managed by Arkus.\nLORA paid management fees to Arkus, and it paid investment fees to both Arkus and Chromos, the lawsuit says.\nLORA first fell into the spotlight in October, when news broke that East Baton Rouge sheriff\u2019s deputies were investigating Adams for possible malfeasance in office. A subsequent state review of LORA found the company had, through Chromos, loaned Adams $780,000 to buy a house.\nDefendants respond\nJohn McLindon, Adams\u2019 attorney, has repeatedly emphasized that Adams dealt with Chromos, not LORA.\n\u201cAll I can tell you is John borrowed money from a company called Chromos. What happened between Chromos and LORA, we have nothing to do with that,\u201d McLindon said.\nThe money was a bridge loan that Adams paid off in full, with interest, early, McLindon said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why they left that part out of the lawsuit,\u201d McLindon said.\nHe contended the lawsuit has little to do with his client.\n\u201c99% of the lawsuit doesn\u2019t apply to Johnny. The documents that they ask that he not dispose of, he already turned them over,\u201d he said.\nLORA, meanwhile, issued a filing opposing the state\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order. The filing disputes the state\u2019s allegation that LORA breached its cooperative endeavor agreement, arguing instead that the state itself violated the agreement.\nIt says LORA distributed its funds appropriately.\nThe filing notes that in 2023, Van Mayhall III, LORA\u2019s president, sent a letter to the state with suggestions for how to improve the agreement to \u201cbetter serve the State\u2019s interests and LORA\u2019s dual mandate to provide low-cost financial security for operators and to plug and abandon orphan wells.\u201d\nLORA plugged many orphan wells for which it was not responsible, the filing says, adding that the state requested that LORA plug such wells.\nMarchiafava, one of the individual defendants in the lawsuit, declined to comment. Mayhall, Dickinson, Berthelot and Lott either did not respond to requests for comment or could not be reached.\nNo criminal charges have been filed in connection with the case, according to officials."
