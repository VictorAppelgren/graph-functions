  "title": "Samsung's latest money saving program slashes the price off an entire Galaxy of foldables",
  "description": "The tech giant is offering over $600 in savings on foldable Galaxy smartphones through its Certified Re-Newwed program.",
  "content": "If you've always wanted to buy a Galaxy Fold or Flip smartphone, but felt the foldables cost too much, this is the news you've been waiting for. Samsung has confirmed that foldable smartphones are now part of its Certified Re-Newed program, slashing a considerable amount off some of the tech giant's most expensive and coolest devices.\n\nAccording to a recent press release, Re-Newed Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5 foldables are now available on Samsung's website for $1,169 (256GB), regularly priced $1,799, and $649 (256GB), typically $999, respectively.\n\nIf you're worried these Certified Re-newed devices will be covered in scratches with dent-filled screens, Samsung says that won't be an issue and emphasizes the devices are \"like-new\" and serviced by Samsung specialists with \"100% genuine parts.\" Each smartphone even features a new battery, which hopefully avoids the potential for any Galaxy Note 7-like disasters, alongside a one-year manufacturer's warranty for additional peace of mind.\n\nIf Samsung's refurbished program is as reliable as Apple's in terms of quality, I'd definitely consider picking up an older Re-Newed foldable. Refurbished Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 devices aren't available yet, but they'll likely arrive next year.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5 are still great smartphones\n\nIf you don't need the latest device out there, this is a great option\n\nThough the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5 are a few years old at this point, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is still more than powerful enough for most people. Adding to this, while the overall design of both the Fold 5 and Flip 5 has improved over the years to be slightly thinner, both devices aren't that different from the recently released Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7.\n\nWith this in mind, if you don't need the latest and greatest when it comes to smartphones, these new additions to Samsung's Certified Re-Newed program could be exactly what you've been waiting for. Samsung also sells pre-owned devices in the Galaxy S22, S23, and S24 lineup.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7 features a larger cover screen that wraps around the rear cameras, a thinner design, and a bigger battery.\n- The Flip 7 has larger displays and a bigger battery compared to the Fold 6.\n- Priced at $1,100, the Flip 7 offers a solid upgrade, maintaining the same price point as the Flip 6 and becoming a compelling choice for new foldable users.\nAt its Galaxy Unpacked event in New York City, Samsung revealed a range of new devices, including the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE. I had the chance to try out both the Fold 7 and Flip 7 in New York, and so far, I\u2019ve been impressed by Samsung's refreshed foldables. This story will focus mainly on the Flip 7, but if you're interested in the Fold 7, I've also written a hands-on impressions article about that device.\nI've always been interested in Samsung's Z Flip foldable phones, mainly because of my nostalgia for the Game Boy Advance SP's clam-shell design. Samsung released its first Galaxy Z Flip in 2020, and over the past five years, it has been refining and improving the device each year, with the Z Flip 7 being no exception. Notably, it features a larger display, a bigger battery, and a thinner design.\nAt Galaxy Unpacked, I had the opportunity to go hands-on with the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and explore the device in person. Though my time with it was limited, I did get a feel for Samsung's new clam-shell foldable this year, and an idea of how the experience will be when it launches July 25. Here is what you need to know about the Flip 7, and my initial impressions of the device.\nGalaxy Z Flip 7\n- Display\n- 4.1-inch 120Hz 948 x 1048 Super AMOLED cover display, 6.9-inch 120Hz 2520 x 1080 Dynamic AMOLED 2X main display\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB\n- Battery\n- 4,300mAh\nSamsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a solid upgrade from last year's Flip 6, offering a refined cover screen, a thinner design, and a larger battery.\n- Ports\n- USB-C\n- Operating System\n- One UI 8\n- Front camera\n- 10-megapixel f/2.2\n- Rear camera\n- 12-megapixel f/2.2 (Ultra Wide), 50-megapixel f/1.8 (Wide)\n- Dimensions\n- 75.2 x 85.5 x 13.7mm (folded), 75.2 x 166.7 x 6.5mm (unfolded)\n- Colors\n- Blue shadow, jet black, coral red\nSamsung nailed the Flip 7's cover screen\nIt's larger and wraps around the rear cameras\nThe first thing I immediately noticed about the Flip 7 when I picked it up for the first time was its new and improved cover screen, which Samsung refers to as its \"Flex Window.\" My biggest disappointment with the Flip 6 last year was that the cover display didn't wrap around the phone's rear cameras, like the Motorola Razr. The oddly shaped design of the cover screen on past Z Flip phones has always thrown me off, and this year, Samsung has finally fixed that issue.\nThe Flip 7's cover screen now wraps around its two rear cameras, and during my hands-on experience with the phone, I was captivated by this feature. The display looks stunning, and it feels much more natural. It features a larger 4.1-inch cover screen with a 948 x 1048 pixel resolution -- an upgrade from the Flip 6's 3.4-inch cover display -- making it much easier to use and interact with features like the selfie camera and widgets on it. What I also loved about the Flip 7's cover screen is its ultra-thin bezels, which measure just 1.25mm. You can even use Gemini Live on it, which is handy if you want to find out something quickly.\nLooking at the Flip 7's unfolded main display, it is a 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 2520 x 1080 pixel resolution and an adaptive refresh rate of 1-120Hz. While I was playing around with it, it reminded me a lot of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which also has a 6.9-inch display. The crease line is also much less visible than last year, which helps sell the illusion that you're not using a foldable phone even though you are.\nAnother new design feature of this year's Flip 7 is its slim profile. Like the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the Flip 7 has seen a noticeable reduction in thickness this year. The Flip 7 measures 13.7mm in thickness when unfolded and 6.5mm when folded, weighing 188 grams. That's a noticeable improvement over the Flip 6, which measures 14.9mm thick when folded and 6.9mm thick when unfolded, and weighs 187 grams. While the Flip 7 is 1 gram heavier than the Flip 6, its slim profile makes it more comfortable to hold, and at times, it didn't even feel like I was holding a Flip phone.\nThe Flip 7 has the largest battery in a Samsung Flip yet\nThe cameras are the same as last year\nWhat also impressed me about the Flip 7 is what Samsung has done with the battery. Although it is slimmer than the Flip 6, Samsung has managed to fit a larger 4,300mAh battery, the biggest in its Flip lineup yet. Samsung claims the Flip 7 can last up to 31 hours of video playback on a single charge. For comparison, the Flip 6 features a 4,000mAh battery, so the Flip 7 is a notable upgrade.\nUnlike the Fold 7, which features Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, the Flip 7 is powered by Samsung's Exynos 2500 chipset with 12GB of RAM. The Flip 7 is available in two storage options: 256GB and 512GB. It comes in three colors: blue shadow, jet black, and coral red. Samsung is also offering a fourth exclusive color, called mint, on its website. You can check out the full specifications for the Flip 7 below.\nGalaxy Z Flip 7\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Samsung Exynos 2500\n- Display\n- 4.1-inch 120Hz 948 x 1048 Super AMOLED cover display, 6.9-inch 120Hz 2520 x 1080 Dynamic AMOLED 2X main display\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB\n- Battery\n- 4,300mAh\n- Ports\n- USB-C\n- Operating System\n- One UI 8\n- Front camera\n- 10-megapixel f/2.2\n- Rear camera\n- 12-megapixel f/2.2 (Ultra Wide), 50-megapixel f/1.8 (Wide)\n- Dimensions\n- 75.2 x 85.5 x 13.7mm (folded), 75.2 x 166.7 x 6.5mm (unfolded)\n- Colors\n- Blue shadow, jet black, coral red\n- Weight\n- 188g\n- IP Rating\n- IP48\n- Price\n- $1,100\n- Year of release\n- 2,025\nI only had a brief chance to try out a few apps on the Flip 7, but the experience felt smooth, and One UI 8 looks stunning. The phone will launch with Samsung's Android 16-based One UI 8 update right out of the box. Due to the limited time I had with the device, I can't comment on how well the Exynos 2500 performs in multitasking and gaming. It will be interesting to see how it compares to the Snapdragon 8 Elite, with initial leaks suggesting it will not be far behind in performance.\nRegarding the cameras on the Flip 7, it features two rear shooters on the cover screen: a 50-megapixel f/1.8 ultra-wide lens and a 12-megapixel f/2.2 wide lens. Its front camera is a 10-megapixel lens. The cameras remain unchanged from those on the Fold 6.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a solid upgrade\nUnlike the Fold 7, its price has not gone up\nOverall, I was impressed with what Samsung has achieved with the Flip 7 this year, and I don't have anything negative to say about it yet. Its new cover screen design truly stands out and looks much better than the Flip 6's. Samsung even managed to address my concerns about battery life with the thinner chassis by fitting a 4,300mAh battery into it.\nWhile the Flip 7 is a solid upgrade from the Flip 6, I don't think it's as significant as the jump from the Fold 6 to the Fold 7.\nHowever, like all new tech, it ultimately comes down to value. The Flip 7 starts at $1,100 for the 256GB model, the same price as the Fold 6 last year. Unlike with the Fold 7, Samsung did not increase the price of the Flip 7 this year, which is a positive move and might encourage more people to try it out as their first foldable.\nWhile the Flip 7 is a solid upgrade from the Flip 6, I don't think it's as significant as the jump from the Fold 6 to the Fold 7. If you own a Flip 6, there\u2019s no compelling reason to upgrade unless you're excited about the new cover screen design. If you have a Flip 4 or a Flip 5, switching to the Flip 7 is definitely worth it for the extra screen space and the lighter, slimmer build.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is now available for pre-order on Samsung's website, with the phone shipping July 25.

      "text": "Summary\n- The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is Samsung's best foldable yet, offering a thinner, lighter design and improved performance.\n- It has a larger inner and outer display, and is equipped with the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, enhancing the user experience.\n- Despite its steep price of $2,000, the Fold 7's versatility and regular phone-like feel make it a compelling choice for foldable enthusiasts.\nWhen I first held the Galaxy Z Fold 7 at Samsung Unpacked, I was instantly captivated. I've always found foldable phones fascinating, but I have never been genuinely impressed enough by one to make it my daily driver. After three weeks of using the Fold 7, Samsung's newest book-style foldable, I've never been more sold on switching to a foldable phone permanently.\nCompared to the Fold 6, which was an incremental upgrade from the Fold 5, the Fold 7 represents the most significant leap forward Samsung has made yet with its Fold series. It's thinner, lighter, and more powerful than any previous Z Fold model.\nBut overall, what makes the Fold 7 so compelling -- and why I'm struggling to put it down -- is that it genuinely feels like you're using a regular phone when you hold it, something I have not experienced with any other foldable phone before. If you've always wanted to try a foldable phone, the Fold 7 is as compelling as it gets.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 6.5-inch 120Hz 2520 x 1080 Dynamic AMOLED 2X Cover Display, 8-inch 120Hz 2184 x 1968 Dynamic OLED 2X Main Display\n- RAM\n- 12GB\nSamsung's next-generation Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest and lightest foldable yet.\n- Thin and lightweight design\n- Powerful performance\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Larger displays, less visible crease\n- Hefty $2,000 price tag\n- Same 4,400mAh battery at last year\n- No S Pen support\nGalaxy Z Fold 7 price, specs, and availability\nThe main difference between the Fold 7 and the Fold 6 is their size. The Fold 7 measures 2.87 x 6.24 x 0.35-inches (158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9mm) when folded, and 5.63 x 6.24 x 0.17-inches (158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2mm) when unfolded, weighing 7.58oz (215g). In comparison, last year's Fold 6 is bulkier, measuring 5.6mm when unfolded (versus the Fold 7's 4.2mm) and 12.1mm when folded (versus 8.9mm), and it weighs 8.43oz (239g). So the difference in size between the Fold 7 and Fold 6 is very noticeable. When I held both devices at Unpacked, the difference was night and day.\nMoving on to the displays, the Fold 7 features larger screens this year. Its Cover Display is a 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X with a resolution of 2520 x 1080 pixels, up from the Fold 6's 6.3-inch Cover Display. The main inner display measures 8-inches and has a Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen with a resolution of 2184 x 1968 pixels, up from the Fold 6's 7.6-inch main display. Both the Cover Display and main display have adaptive refresh rates of 1-120Hz.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, the same chipset found in the entire Galaxy S25 lineup. The phone comes in three storage variants: 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. The 256GB and 512GB models come with 12GB of RAM, while the 1TB variant is equipped with 16GB of RAM.\nLooking at the back of the Fold 7, the camera array is similar but still improved from the Fold 6. It features a 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide lens, a 200-megapixel f/1.8 wide lens, and a 10-megapixel f/2.4 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The key upgrade is the 200-megapixel wide lens, a notable increase from the Fold 6's 50-megapixel wide lens. The Cover Display features a 10-megapixel selfie camera, and the main display also has a 10-megapixel selfie camera.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is available now and starts at $2,000 for the 256GB model. This is a $100 increase from the Fold 6, which launched at $1,900 for the same amount of storage. The 512GB Fold 7 costs $2,120, while the 1TB version is priced at $2,270. The phone is available in three colorways: jet black, blue shadow, and silver shadow. A fourth color, mint, is available exclusively on Samsung's web store.\nGalaxy Z Fold 7\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 6.5-inch 120Hz 2520 x 1080 Dynamic AMOLED 2X Cover Display, 8-inch 120Hz 2184 x 1968 Dynamic OLED 2X Main Display\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\n- Battery\n- 4,400mAh\n- Ports\n- USB-C\n- Operating System\n- One UI 8\n- Front camera\n- 10-megapixel f/2.2 (Main Screen), 10-megapixel f/2.2 (Cover Camera)\n- Rear camera\n- 12-megapixel f/2.2 (Ultra Wide), 200-megapixel f/1.7 (Wide), 10-megapixel f/2.4 3x/30x (Tele)\n- Dimensions\n- 158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9mm (Folded), 158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2mm (Unfolded)\n- Weight\n- 215g\n- IP Rating\n- IP48\n- Price\n- $2,000\n- Release\n- 2025\nGalaxy Z Fold 7 build and design\nIt's thin, but tough\nThe Fold 7 gets many things right, and I can't underscore enough just how amazing its thin design is. It feels great to hold in your hand, slip into your pocket, and unfold to reveal its large screen. Weeks into using the phone, I'm still mesmerized by its size every day. When unfolded, it measures 4.2mm thick, which is about as thin as it can get, as the thickness is equal to that of the USB-C port itself.\nDespite its slim design, I found the Fold 7 to be quite durable and lightweight, and I never once felt that the device was flimsy or prone to bending during use. Since bendgate with the iPhone 6, there has been a perception that thin phones aren't tough, but Samsung has now dismissed that idea with both the Galaxy S25 Edge and the Fold 7.\nLooking at the overall design of the Fold 7, it bears a resemblance to the Fold 6, with its boxier appearance. This is evident when it's side by side with the Galaxy S25+. The corners of the phone are rounded where you open it to unfold, but towards the hinge, they're almost at a 90-degree angle. I had no issues holding the phone for an extended period, either folded or unfolded, and found it quite comfortable. On the weight scale, it weighs 215g, slightly lighter than Samsung's S25 Ultra flagship at 218 grams -- a remarkable feat.\nMy biggest gripe about the design is that when you place it on a table, it essentially becomes a teeter-totter due to the phone's protruding camera bump.\nSamsung states that the phone is \"wrapped in advanced armored aluminum,\" which is 10 percent stronger than the Fold 6. Additionally, it features Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the Cover Display and Victus 2 on the rear, which has made me less worried about accidentally dropping it.\nOpening and closing the phone remains just as smooth on the Fold 7 as it was on the Fold 6. Samsung has enhanced its hinge, known as the Armor FlexHinge, making it thinner and more durable to handle repeated opening and closing. I never got tired of unfolding the Fold 7, and any time I showed it off to someone, they were mystified by it. Turning to the phone's colors, I had a chance to see all of them at Unpacked, and while they all looked great, the blue shadow colorway I was lucky enough to test stole the show for me. I think it's my favorite shade of blue I've ever seen on a smartphone.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 may be slim, but it's durable and has a very premium look and feel, which you would expect from a $2,000 smartphone. My biggest gripe about the design is that when you place it on a table, it essentially becomes a teeter-totter due to the phone's protruding camera bump.\nGalaxy Z Fold 7 displays\nThe Cover Display is more usable this year\nLooking at the displays, Samsung has made them wider this year, and I found myself using the Cover Display more often than I expected. Its 6.5-inch front screen resembles a typical smartphone display, and while it may not be as wide as the 6.7-inch display on my Galaxy S25+, it's still quite impressive and helps sell the illusion that you're not using a foldable device when it's folded. For reference, the Fold 6 features a 6.3-inch cover screen, so the Fold 7 represents a noticeable increase in size.\nThe 8-inch main display is where the Fold 7 truly excels, and I enjoyed being able to unfold the device whenever I wanted a tablet-like screen. I primarily use it for watching videos, playing games, and doomscrolling social media. I found multitasking on the foldable screen to be relatively smooth, and Samsung's Multi Window feature is easy to learn for displaying multiple apps simultaneously.\nFor the most part, while using the phone, I forgot the crease was even there.\nThe crease line on the Fold 7 is less noticeable than on the Fold 6, and I only noticed it from odd angles and under bright lighting conditions, not when looking directly at it. For the most part, while using the phone, I forgot the crease was even there. You can still feel it when you touch the center of the screen, but I didn't find it distracting.\nThe biggest flaw of the Fold 7's display is that it no longer supports the S Pen. So if you're used to using Samsung's stylus on other Galaxy devices and hoped to do the same with the Fold 7, you won't be able to. At Unpacked, Samsung explained that to make the phone as thin as it is, they had to remove the \"digitizer layer\" that makes it compatible with the S Pen. Admittedly, I don't use Samsung's S Pen. Still, I understand the frustration of some users who have used it on previous generations of Samsung's foldable devices and can no longer do so.\nGalaxy Z Fold 7 cameras\nThe 200-megapixel wide lens is the star of the show\nThe Fold 7 retains the same rear triple camera setup as the Fold 6, but with one key upgrade. The primary wide camera now features a 200-megapixel lens, identical to the one on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. I found myself using the 200-megapixel shooter most often for wide landscape shots, and I was impressed by the amount of detail it captured. Last year, the Fold 6's wide lens was 50-megapixels, so this is a significant jump, and what you'd expect from a $2,000 phone.\nThe other two rear cameras are a 12-megapixel ultra-wide and a 10-megapixel telephoto, the same as on the Fold 6, so there's little change there. Additionally, Samsung has removed the black camera rings from the Fold 7, which were present on the Fold 6. I like this change, and I think it makes the cameras look cleaner.\nLooking at the selfie cameras, the Cover Display features the same 10-megapixel lens as last year. What's different is the selfie camera on the inner display, which has been upgraded to a 10-megapixel lens with a camera cutout. This is an improvement over the Fold 6's lackluster 4-megapixel under-display camera it has on its main display.\nOverall, I'm pleased with the photos I took on the Fold 7. I went around my garden and the beach and took some shots, and all of them looked very vibrant. I like the colors in my photos to pop, so the Z Fold 7 didn't disappoint me. My only complaint is that it would've been nice if Samsung upgraded the ultra-wide lens to a 50-megapixel, like the S25 Ultra has, rather than the 12-megapixel one we got.\nGalaxy Z Fold 7 performance\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite proves its worth again\nI was impressed by the Fold 7's performance, which wasn't a surprise given that it uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. I never experienced any lag while using the device, whether gaming or multitasking, and I was never worried about pushing it too hard. Overall, the experience has been very smooth. If numbers are your thing, when I tested the Fold 7's CPU with Geekbench 6, it scored 2,650 for single-core and 8,633 for multi-core performance.\nLooking at the battery, the Fold 7 features the same 4,400mAh battery as the Fold 6. I'm glad Samsung didn't lower the battery capacity due to the slimmer design. However, it would've been nice to see a bigger cell. Compared to other foldables on the market, such as those from Oppo and Huawei, Samsung still has some catching up to do. I got all-day battery life out of it just fine, but its charging speed is noticeably slower than that of other smartphones, with only 25W wired charging and 15W wireless charging. To put it into perspective, the S25 Ultra supports up to 45W of wired charging, but has the same 15W of wireless charging.\nGalaxy Z Fold 7 software\nOne UI 8 is a smooth experience with lots of AI\nOut of the box, the Fold 7 ships with One UI 8 based on Android 16. Compared to One UI 7, which was Samsung's major user interface update for the Galaxy S25 series, there aren't many significant changes here. That said, one of the small new features added with One UI 8 is dynamic wallpapers, where the color of your wallpaper changes over time, which I thought was pretty neat. On the Android 16 side of things, one of the new features is the 90:10 split-screen function for multitasking, which is quite handy, especially with the Fold 7's large 8-inch main display.\n...the Fold 7 features lots of AI capabilities as Samsung continues its AI push with Galaxy AI and Google Gemini.\nOf course, it's 2025, so the Fold 7 features lots of AI capabilities as Samsung continues its AI push with Galaxy AI and Google Gemini. All the Galaxy AI features you'd expect are here, such as Now Brief, Interpret, Drawing Assist, AI select, and more. My favorite Galaxy AI feature is the Magic Eraser, which allows you to edit out small details in photos.\nGoogle Gemini has an even larger presence on the Fold 7, thanks to Gemini Live. You can long-press the home button to share your screen with Gemini and ask it questions about what you're seeing, and you can switch between different apps while doing so. I tested this while researching a future trip to Scotland, and it was honestly quite informative, helping to summarize very detailed web pages and answer questions about local places to visit. I'm not the biggest user of AI, but I can appreciate its implementation here, and it's incredible how far ahead Samsung and Google are of Apple.\nShould you buy the Galaxy Z Fold 7?\nMy main critique of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its price. The phone starts at $2,000 for the 256GB model, making it one of the most expensive phones currently available in the US. When I told my friend this, he summed it up perfectly by comparing the cost to buying an iPhone 16 Pro and an iPad, and I couldn't argue with that logic.\nHowever, if you want a foldable phone right now, the Fold 7 is the best choice because of its improved versatility, as long as you're comfortable with its $2,000 price tag. In my opinion, it's the first foldable that truly makes sense as a replacement for your regular smartphone, and I think that's clear from the response it has received since its unveiling. That said, if you own a Fold 4 or Fold 5 and are considering an upgrade, the Fold 7 is a solid option. But if you have a Fold 6, it's better to wait.\nOverall, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a powerful, slim, lightweight, and durable device. If you want a foldable phone and don't want to wait any longer for Apple to release its own foldable iPhone, you won't be disappointed with the Fold 7. It's not flawless, but it's as refined as foldables have ever been.\nThis device was provided to Pocket-lint by Samsung.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 6.5-inch 120Hz 2520 x 1080 Dynamic AMOLED 2X Cover Display, 8-inch 120Hz 2184 x 1968 Dynamic OLED 2X Main Display\n- RAM\n- 12GB"

      "text": "Summary\n- Clamshell foldables are almost always cheaper.\n- Sliding a clamshell foldable into your pocket is far easier than a traditional slab phone or a book-style foldable.\n- Quickly checking notifications on the cover screen is more useful than I expected.\nThis wasn't always the case, but I'll now take a clamshell foldable smartphone over a bulky book-style foldable smartphone in almost all situations.\nSure, there's not an obvious practical purpose for clamshell foldables like there is for book-style foldables (carrying a pint-sized tablet around with you at all times can be useful), but over the past few years, I've come to prefer top-down design for several reasons, including the fact that it makes the phone easier to slide into my pocket, that I can prop up its display in several ways, its subtle but still useful cover screen, and finally, simply how cool it feels to snap this type of foldable shut.\nI haven't gone hands-on with the Galaxy Z Flip 7yet, but I've used every clamshell foldable Samsung has offered, including the Galaxy Z Flip 6alongside the Razr+ (2024) and Razr Ultra (2025). I'll have my thoughts on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 on Pocket-lint soon.\n1 Clamshell foldables are always cheaper\nThe Razr Ultra (2025) and Galaxy Z Fold 7 definitely aren't what I'd call affordable, but their price tags aren't crazy\nIf we're looking strictly at their cost, clamshell foldables are always cheaper when it comes to the latest smartphone releases. For example, this year, Motorola's top-tier Razr Ultra (512GB) costs $1,300, while Samsung's well-reviewed Galaxy Z Flip 7 (256GB) is priced at just $1,100. These prices obviously aren't cheap, but they're also not in the same space as the expensive as the $2,000 Galaxy Z Fold 7 or $1,700 OnePlus Open, the two most notable book-style foldables that are easily available in the US market.\nThis alone makes clamshell foldable far easier to recommend, especially when you consider that high-end standard smartphones often already push into this price range. If you're bored with your slab-style phone, why not try something totally different, like a clamshell foldable?\nRazr Ultra (2025)\n- Brand\n- Motorola\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 7-inch foldable OLED (165Hz, 2992 x 1224 pixel resolution), 4-inch external (165Hz, 1272 x 1080 pixel resolution)\n- RAM\n- 16GB\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) is a solid all-around clamshell foldable thanks to its durable design, Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, and expansive cover display.\n- Storage\n- 512GB / 1TB\n- Battery\n- 4,700 mAh, 68W wired charging, 15W wireless charging\n- Operating System\n- Android\n- Camera (Rear, Front)\n- f/1.8 50-megapixel OIS primary, 50-megapixel ultrawide + macro, f/2.0, 50-megapixel selfie\n- Connectivity\n- Wi-Fi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4, sub-6 GHz 5G, USB-C 2.0\n- Dimensions\n- Unfolded - 2.91 x 6.75 x 0.28-inches (73.99 x 171.48 x 7.19mm) / Folded - 2.91 x 3.46 x 0.61-inches (73.99 x 88.12 x 15.69mm)\n- Colors\n- Rio red, scarab, cabaret, and mountain trail\n- Weight\n- 7oz (199g)\n- Price\n- $1,300\n2 Sliding a clamshell foldable into my pocket is so much easier\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 fits perfectly compared to the bulky iPhone 16 Pro or Pixel 9 Pro\nIt might sound a bit silly, but I appreciate how small clamshell foldables become when folded. It makes it so much easier to slide the smartphone into my pants or shorts pocket. Book-style foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (which I've been using for the past few weeks) also get smaller when folded, but they're still a little taller than the average smartphone. That said, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is impressively thin at 0.4-inches (8.9mm) when folded, so it does feel far smaller in my pocket than past book-style foldables I've used.\n...it's subtle things like this that really pulls together the experience a handset offers.\nEven if I'm just sliding the Razr Ultra (2025) in my satchel when I'm going out, I appreciate that it takes up less space compared to a standard smartphone or a book-style foldable. Sometimes, especially when it comes to smartphones, it's subtle things like this that really pull together the experience a handset offers.\nGalaxy Z Flip 7\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Samsung Exynos 2500\n- Display\n- 4.1-inch 120Hz 948 x 1048 Super AMOLED cover display, 6.9-inch 120Hz 2520 x 1080 Dynamic AMOLED 2X main display\n- RAM\n- 12GB\nSamsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a solid upgrade from last year's Flip 6, offering a refined cover screen, a thinner design, and a larger battery.\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB\n- Battery\n- 4,300mAh\n- Ports\n- USB-C\n- Operating System\n- One UI 8\n- Front camera\n- 10-megapixel f/2.2\n- Rear camera\n- 12-megapixel f/2.2 (Ultra Wide), 50-megapixel f/1.8 (Wide)\n- Dimensions\n- 75.2 x 85.5 x 13.7mm (folded), 75.2 x 166.7 x 6.5mm (unfolded)\n- Colors\n- Blue shadow, jet black, coral red\n- Weight\n- 188g\n- IP Rating\n- IP48\n- Price\n- $1,100\n- Year of release\n- 2,025\n3 Quickly checking notifications on the cover screen is super useful\nI set the Razr Ultra (2025) in tent mode on my desk for at-a-glance access\nWhen I got my hands on the original Galaxy Z Flip (can you believe that was five years ago?), the tiny cover screen was so small it felt absolutely useless, but over the years it's slowly become larger and I've grown to really appreciate the extra display because it helps me stay unplugged. I can quickly slide the foldable out of my pocket to check for an important notification, and then easily drop it back in, all without opening the phone and getting pulled to the siren call of social media.\nYou can do this with a book-style foldable, but it's far easier to get drawn into the phone since the cover screen is larger and able to display more information. When it comes to the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the cover screen feels pretty much exactly like a standard smartphone, making it that much easier to dive back into doomscrolling mind-melting TikTok videos.\nI've started placing the Razr Ultra (2025) open on my desk in tent mode and either leaving the phone stationary or picking it up while closed to briefly to swipe through important notifications. It's a simple but very useful feature I've come to enjoy that helps me stay on task throughout the work day.\n4 Snapping clamshell foldables shut feels cool\nI'm old enough to remember the flip phone's glory days\nThere was just something so satisfying about snapping a classic flip phone shut that was entirely lost when slab-style smartphones became a thing. Now that clamshell foldables are here, that all-important snap is back. Of course, you can make the same closing motion with a horizontal foldable, but it just isn't as satisfying as closing a smartphone like the Razr Ultra (2025) with one hand.\nI often find myself absentmindedly opening and closing the Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Razr Ultra (2025) because it just feels so good. Seriously, it might sound like I'm making a joke, but when I switch to using the Pixel 9 Proor iPhone 16 Pro, I really miss the satisfying snap of closing a clamshell foldable. It's the type of thing you need to try to truly appreciate, but then, it's difficult to go back."

      "text": "Summary\n- Samsung's Note 7 was praised at launch but was discontinued following widespread battery issues.\n- The blame was placed on the large battery's compact design and issues with electrodes.\n- Despite the fiasco's financial impact, Galaxy Note fandom remained.\nBack in 2016, I gave Samsung's ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 a glowing review and called it the \"best large-sized phablet smartphone\" I had ever used.\nIt was a monumental leap over the Galaxy Note 5 (there wasn't a Galaxy Note 6) in terms of its overall design, power, and, at least at the time, water resistance. I'm sure there were likely other IP68 water-resistant handsets, but the Note 7 was the first I encountered, and it was truly game-changing. I have fond memories of covering the 5.7-inch \"phablet\" -- which seems small by today's smartphone standards -- in water droplets at a local beach to snap a few wet-looking photos for my review.\nOverall, the Note 7 was a stellar phone that, looking back, was way ahead of its time. It felt like Android's answer to the iPhone and combined the best elements of Samsung's Galaxy S7 with the stylus-equipped Note 5. Sure, using the iris scanner to log into the device was far from a perfect experience, but it felt like something out of Mission Impossible at the time. Even its camera performance was well ahead of other Android devices thanks to its 12-megapixel rear-facing shooter with optical image stabilization.\nUnfortunately, the Galaxy Note 7's life was cut short following widespread, potentially dangerous battery issues. With the Galaxy S25's launch looming on the horizon, now is a great time to look back at one of the biggest blunders in Samsung's smartphone history.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 7\n- SoC\n- Exynos 8890 Octa\n- Display\n- 5.7in, 2560 x 1440 pixels, Super AMOLED\n- Storage\n- 64GB\n- Battery\n- 3500mAh\n- Operating System\n- Android 6.0.1 (Marshmellow)\n- Camera (Rear, Front)\n- 12MP rear; 5MP front\nAn explosive smartphone\nThe calamity of missteps surrounding the Galaxy Note 7's recall was something to behold\nI vaguely remember reports surrounding Note 7 issues trickling in very slowly. The phone was officially released in late August 2016, and just a few days later, reports started appearing on Reddit, with users posting images and videos of the smartphone overheating, smoking, and, in some cases, catching fire. Once the tech blogging world started covering the problem, a constant stream of stories about the issue, including an incident involving a six-year-old boy that was burned by the phone, were published. At one point ahead of Samsung's official recall of the Note 7, several airlines worldwide went so far as to outright ban the Galaxy Note 7 from planes.\nOn October 11th 2016, Samsung stopped selling the Note 7 worldwide, emphasizing that all owners should power down the device and stop using it.\nBy September 2nd, Samsung launched a voluntary global recall of the 2.5 million Note 7 devices sold so far, and offered to either refund or replace the devices. Then, on September 9th, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission got involved and urged owners to stop using the smartphone entirely. On September 15th, the commission issued a formal recall.\nIt sounds silly now, but I was reluctant to give my Note 7 review unit back and kept delaying returning my device (I really liked it that much, and I didn't experience any issues with it -- at least not yet). Samsung Canada eventually sent a representative to retrieve the smartphone from me (I still have the phone's box in my garage somewhere, though -- maybe it'll be a collector's item someday?)\nUnfortunately for Samsung, replacement Note 7 devices still suffered from the same issue, leading to a phone on a Southwest Airline flight smoking and the plane being evacuated. This resulted in US carriers no longer issuing Note 7 replacements, which was a big blow to Samsung. Finally, on October 11th, the company officially stopped selling the Note 7 worldwide, emphasizing that all owners should power down the device and stop using it. In some regions, Samsung even deactivated service on Note 7 devices to encourage owners to return the device.\nIn total, the Note 7 fiasco cost Samsung $5.3 billion over the course of 2017.\nI always assumed the Galaxy Note 7 would make a triumphant return at some point, but that never really happened. The closest thing we got was the Galaxy Note FE Fan Edition, which released in 2017 in specific regions, including South Korea. In total, the Note 7 fiasco cost Samsung $5.3 billion throughout 2017.\nWhat caused the battery issue?\nSamsung was initially reluctant to point to the source definitively\nMost assumed that the Galaxy Note 7's woes were somehow tied to a fault in its large 3,500 mAh battery, which was massive by 2016 smartphone standards. Several months after the mandatory recall, Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's then-mobile division president, placed the blame on its battery supplier (which was likely Samsung SDI), citing the cell's compact design, thin separators, and overall high energy density. Following the company's very lengthy investigation into the problem, Samsung determined there wasn't enough space in the Galaxy Note 7's battery area to accommodate its electrodes, leading to the overheating issues that plagued the device.\nNote 7 features and design cues can still be found in devices like the Galaxy S24 Ultra, including the S Pen.\nWhile the tech giant blamed its battery division, Samsung also admitted that it \"provided the target for the battery specifications for the innovative Note 7, and we are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing.\"\nSamsung recovered shockingly quickly from the controversy surrounding the Note 7's battery issues, with Galaxy Note 8 sales rebounding the next year in 2017. On a personal note, everyone I know who said they'd never purchase a Samsung device again after being frustrated with the Note 7 situation bought the next Galaxy S series device or Note smartphone. Samsung has a lot of hardcore fans who stand by the company, even through something as controversial as this.\nThe Galaxy Note line received several more releases, culminating in 2021's Galaxy Note 20, the final device in the stylus-focused line. However, Note features can still be found in devices like the Galaxy S24 Ultra, including the now iconic S Pen."
