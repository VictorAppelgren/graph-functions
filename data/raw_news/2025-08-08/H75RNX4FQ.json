      "text": "DreamCloud\u2019s early access Labor Day sale is live and already showcasing a few all-time low prices on top-rated beds. While the official holiday weekend isn\u2019t until the end of the month, early offers from the DreamCloud mattress sale look promising, including up to 62% off editor-tested beds, like our pick for the best value mattress: the DreamCloud Classic Hybrid.\nBelow, we\u2019ve detailed several popular DreamCloud mattresses on sale, including models that we recommend based on first-hand testing and research. You\u2019ll also find discounted bundles\u2014like this DreamCloud Bamboo Platform Bundle\u2014to help with a full bedroom refresh. If you\u2019re looking for a specific bed to address your sleep needs, check out our guide to the best mattress sales overall for offers from more top bed brands.\nSave 43% On Our Pick For The Best Soft Hybrid Mattress\nDreamCloud Luxe Hybrid (Queen)\nFormerly known as the DreamCloud Premier Rest, the DreamCloud Luxe Hybrid used to be our pick for the best mattress for pressure relief and is still our pick for the best soft hybrid mattress. Its combination of pocketed coils, gel-infused memory foam and a pillow-top layer provides just the right balance of support and plushness for back, side and combination sleepers. The bed is also offers excellent motion isolation to help you stay asleep if your partner moves during the night.\nMore Deal Information: This mattress dropped an additional $100 over Memorial Day weekend, but this is the best price we\u2019ve seen since then. The total price of the mattress also increased slightly in August.\nSave 62% On Our Favorite Value Mattress\nDreamCloud Classic Hybrid Mattress (Queen)\nThe DreamCloud Hybrid is a medium-firm mattress that combines coils with memory foam to provide ample support and pressure relief. After testing dozens of mattresses, our sleep team named it the best mattress in a box for back and stomach sleepers and the best value mattress in our main shopping guide. The only downside? It comes in just a medium-firm option, so if you want something plusher (or more supportive), you may want to consider a different model.\nMore Deal Information: Although this is the best price we\u2019ve ever seen for this model, DreamCloud raised the bed\u2019s original price from $1,531 to $1,698 in August. This artificially inflates the total percentage off and may impact future discounts.\nIf You're A Restless Sleeper, Consider This Bed For 57% Off\nDreamCloud Premier Hybrid Mattress (Queen)\nIf you want a cozy and plush bed without sacrificing support, the DreamCloud Premier Hybrid is one to consider. It has individually wrapped coils that give it a little bounce while encouraging spinal alignment. There are also plenty of foam layers to offer pressure relief, and a cushy Euro pillow top for comfort. \u201cThe support of the DreamCloud Premier Hybrid is one of its most impressive features,\u201d reports a Forbes Vetted staffer who tried out the mattress for 60 days. That\u2019s part of why we named it the best hybrid mattress for sleepers who switch between their back and side.\nMore Deal Information: This mattress hit a low of $949 in May.\nTake 52% Off This Popular Design\nDreamCloud Premier Memory Foam Mattress (Queen)\nAn elevated version of the DreamCloud Classic, this all-foam model is plusher and cooler than its baseline design. It offers a slightly loftier 13-inch height and a cushy Euro top. Overall, the mattress is well-rated by reviewers for its balance of support, comfort and cooling features.\nMore Deal Information: This discount matches the best price we\u2019ve seen for this model since DreamCloud updated its designs earlier this year. However, it also increased the original price from $1,598, so the total percentage off appears significantly larger than before.\nThe All-Foam Version Of One Of Our Favorite Mattresses For 55% Off\nDreamCloud Luxe Memory Foam Mattress (Queen)\nThis design is the all-foam version of our favorite mattress for pressure relief. It\u2019s composed of six layers of foam, including DreamCloud\u2019s popular cooling Euro top, which contours the body and offers support throughout the night while keeping sleepers cool.\nMore Deal Information: This deal matches the low we saw over Memorial Day weekend, but the brand has also increased the original price of this model from $2,249.\nTake 29% Off This Ultra-Plush Design\nDreamCloud Ultra Hybrid Mattress (Queen)\nThis hybrid design uses a combination of foam and springs to deliver a plush yet supportive sleep. Its six layers include cooling materials, individually wrapped coils and a 4-inch Euro top that all work together to deliver medium-soft firmness.\nMore Deal Information: This is a newer model with a limited price history, but this is the best price we\u2019ve seen so far for the Ultra Hybrid design.\nThis Classic Memory Foam Design Is 46% Off\nDreamCloud Classic Memory Foam Mattress (Queen)\nOffering a firm sleeping experience and contoured pressure-relief, this is DreamCloud\u2019s take on a classic memory foam bed. It\u2019s one of the brand\u2019s most affordable beds and still incorporates its proprietary CloudQuilt material that helps keep sleepers cool through the night.\nMore Deal Information: This design hit a low of $679 around the 4th of July and has dropped to $765 periodically since 2024, so it may be worth waiting for an additional discount. DreamCloud also dropped the original price of this mattress by just over $100, which could signal steeper discounts on the horizon.\nDreamCloud Sale: Best Bed Frame Deals\nSave 52% On This Adjustable, Remote-Controlled Frame\nDreamCloud Adjustable Comfort Premier Bed Frame (Queen)\nIf you\u2019ve ever considered an adjustable bed frame, now\u2019s your chance to pick up DreamCloud\u2019s version for over half-off. It can be controlled using a wireless remote or app and has a massage feature with three intensity levels.\nMore Deal Information: This discount matches the best price we\u2019ve seen for the adjustable frame this year.\nThis Simple Foundation Is 21% Off In The Twin Size\nDreamCloud Mattress Upholstered Foundation Bed Frame (Twin)\nIf your child needs a bed frame upgrade to go with a new kids mattress, this basic foundation is neutral and easy to set up. Right now, both the twin and twin XL sizes of this foundation are on sale for 22% off. Or consider purchasing it as part of a bundled deal with a mattress for 60% off.\nMore Deal Information: The twin size of this bed frame was available for over 50% off during DreamCloud\u2019s Memorial Day sale.\nA Chic And Minimalist Bed Frame For Under $500\nDreamCloud Bamboo Platform Bed Frame (Queen)\nDuring the brand\u2019s summer sale, the DreamCloud bamboo bed frame is discounted by an impressive 53%. It\u2019s available in two finishes: the natural color shown here as well as a darker walnut finish. All sizes of this bed frame currently have hefty discounts. Add on a bamboo headboard for $300 more or an upholstered one for $199.\nMore Deal Information: This frame dropped to $399 over Memorial Day, so it may be worth waiting for a steeper discount during another holiday weekend. The brand also increased the price of the frame from $1,270 to $1,414 this month.\nTake $240 Off This Wood Design With Built-In Storage\nZadilyn Midcentury Storage Bed Frame (Queen)\nThis mid-century-inspired design features a rich walnut grain finish and built-in drawers on either side of the base. It\u2019s a great way to add extra storage to your room or to replace a dresser entirely if you\u2019re working with a smaller space.\nMore Deal Information: This is the same price we saw for this bed frame last month, but DreamCloud has increased the frame\u2019s original price by $100.\nPick Up This Streamlined Platform Frame For Under $200\nSocalle Bed Modern Platform Bed Frame (Queen)\nIf you\u2019re looking for a minimalist frame, this simple design is on sale for 60% off right now. The sleek frame comes together in under 30 minutes and is also compatible with adjustable bases.\nMore Deal Information: This current discount matches the best price we\u2019ve seen for this bed frame, but DreamCloud increased the frame\u2019s original price since our last update so the discount looks steeper.\nSave 43% On This Simple Upholstered Frame In Two Colors\nDreamCloud The Frame + Headboard (Queen)\nIt doesn\u2019t get much more classic than this linen upholstered frame. It\u2019s a simple design with elegant touches, like button tufting on the headboard and tapered legs. The model is available in both gray and the pictured linen above. DreamCloud includes everything you need to assemble the frame in the box, which can take as little as 20 minutes.\nMore Deal Information: The original price of this bed frame has increased slightly from $760, but this discount matches the lowest it has ever dropped to.\nDreamCloud Sale: Best Bundle Deals\nTake 65% Off This Bundle With The DreamCloud Classic Hybrid Mattress\nDreamCloud Premier Adjustable Bundle (Queen)\nThis bundle includes the DreamCloud Classic Hybrid mattress\u2014our recent top pick for the best value mattress\u2014alongside the Premier Adjustable Base. The steel frame is fully customizable to your preferences and can nest within most regular bed frames if you want to change up the aesthetic. You\u2019ll also receive the Serenity Bedding Bundle with your purchase, which includes everything you need for a complete bed refresh.\nGet The Popular DreamCloud Premier Mattress And A Sleek Frame For 58% Less\nDreamCloud Foundation Bundle\nThis best-selling foundation has a simple, streamlined aesthetic and comes with the popular DreamCloud Premier mattress. The bed is a step up from the Classic, offering a plusher and cooler sleeping experience. You\u2019ll also get a bedding bundle with all of the basics: sheets, pillows and a mattress protector.\nSave 59% On A Contemporary Frame And An Essential Mattress\nDreamCloud Bamboo Platform Bundle (Queen)\nPair DreamCloud\u2019s Classic memory foam mattress with a contemporary bamboo frame for a serene bedroom overhaul. This bundled deal also includes a special bedding set with extra soft sheets, two cooling pillows and a breathable mattress protector\u2014nice additions for hot sleepers.\nThis Luxurious Bundle Includes Our Favorite Soft Hybrid Mattress\nDreamCloud Bed Frame With Headboard Bundle (Queen)\nLay back and relax on a delightfully soft yet supportive mattress\u2014we named it the best soft hybrid mattress in one of our shopping guides for a reason. This set also includes an upholstered bed frame, headboard and a classic bedding bundle.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThe Forbes Vetted editorial team has extensive experience testing, researching and reviewing the best products on the market. Our mattress and sleep buying guides are based on expert medical advice, hundreds of hours of research and rigorous firsthand testing.\nJordan Thomas, the author of this story, is Forbes Vetted\u2019s assistant deals editor. She has over six years of experience writing in the e-commerce space and was previously a deals writer at Wirecutter. She routinely researches deals and savings events\u2014including mattress sales\u2014to find the best offers available.\nOur mattress and sleep content is overseen by senior mattress and sleep editor Bridget Chapman, who has a decade of experience as a journalist and holds a sleep science coach certification, which she leans on to weed out false advertising claims and uncover real benefits in the online mattress industry. Mattress and sleep editor McKenzie Dillon is also a certified sleep science coach and prolific mattress tester with five years of experience.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nAccording to the DreamCloud website, a premium hybrid mattress from the company can last anywhere from seven to ten years. That said, the average lifespan of a mattress depends on a number of factors, including care, support and usage.\nYou can extend the lifespan of your mattress by rotating it every three months, changing your bedding once per week, vacuuming it once per month and installing a mattress pad or protector to help against spills or other accidents.\nNectar and DreamCloud are owned by the same parent company, Resident Home. Resident Home also owns mattress brands Awara and Cloverlane.\nThe DreamCloud Hybrid Mattress offers a medium-firm firmness rating. Based on a scale of 1 through 10, the brand rates it at a 6.5\u2014meaning it has a middle-of-the-road firmness that\u2019s suitable for most sleepers.\nDreamCloud\u2019s mattresses earned some of the highest marks during testing and hold top spots in several of our mattress shopping guides. The DreamCloud Luxe Hybrid is one of the brands most popular beds and a former top pick in our guide of the best mattresses overall. The hybrid model often drops to $1,299 during holiday weekends, so you may want to wait to get a better discount than its current offer.\nIf affordability is your top concern, consider the DreamCloud Classic Hybrid. A new addition to our shopping guide, the mattress is our pick for the best value mattress, and right now it\u2019s on sale for under $650. During testing, we found the mattress has a medium-firm feel that\u2019s ideal for back and stomach sleepers, and may also accommodate some part-time side sleepers.\nCoupons\nOwala\nGet 20% Off Sitewide During The Back-To-School Sale"

      "text": "Believe it or not, sleeping on the job is encouraged in our line of work. Senior editor Bridget Chapman and I lead the Forbes Vetted mattress and sleep vertical; we\u2019ve collectively tested over 120 mattresses during our tenure, and each of us have a sleep science coach certification. Together, we created the methodology and processes behind how we test and score mattresses.\nThere are so many beds to choose from nowadays that our goal is to simplify the selection process and guide you to the right mattress using insights from our team\u2019s personal testing experience. Below, learn more about how we choose the winners we highlight in our roundups.\nHow We Test Mattresses: Group Testing\nWe use a diverse group of testers made up of different sleeping positions (side, back and stomach) and body types (under 150 pounds, 150 to 250 pounds and above 250 pounds) to test dozens of mattresses at a time. This allows us to compare the mattresses side by side, gain a good understanding of their differences and more clearly see why one may be better suited for certain sleepers than another. Here are the different features our team looks for and how we test for them.\nSleeping Positions\nBack: Testers lie on their back until they get a sense for the bed\u2019s support and whether or not it kept their spine from sagging into the bed or whether it kept their hips too high.\nSide: Testers lie on their sides and feel for comfort, spinal support and pressure buildup, particularly along the shoulder and hips.\nStomach: Testers lie on their stomach and check for spine support to ensure their back isn\u2019t sagging too far into the mattress.\nPressure Relief\nWhen we discuss pressure relief, we primarily mean how well a mattress gives and contours to the curves of your body. These mattresses ease pressure around joints and provide a sense of relief\u2014similar to when you kick your feet up at the end of the day. However, some firm beds offer good pressure relief between the shoulders and along the spine. Our testers are asked to rate how well different mattresses relieved pressure after lying in each sleeping position.\nHere are a few beds that test best for pressure relief:\n- DreamCloud Premier Rest Hybrid (9 out of 10 score)\n- Bear Elite (9 out of 10 score)\n- Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe (8.5 out of 10 score)\nEase Of Movement\nTesters are encouraged to settle into a position and then roll, toss and turn in order to gauge how easy a mattress is to move around on. They are also able to sense how responsive a mattress is as they switch from one position to another and get in and out of the bed.\nBelow, find a list of beds that score well for ease of movement:\n- WinkBed (9 out of 10 score)\n- Helix Plus (9 out of 10 score)\n- Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid (8.5 out of 10 score)\nFirmness\nAfter giving testers an idea of what a soft mattress feels like in comparison to a medium-firm and firm mattress, they are then tasked with rating the firmness levels of the beds they test on a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being as soft as a marshmallow and 10 being as firm as concrete. They are able to return to beds they rated earlier in our testing period to see if they changed their mind after trying different mattresses.\nKeep in mind that firmness level is highly subjective and heavily influenced by a person\u2019s body type. The less you weigh the firmer a mattress feels, and the heavier you weigh the softer a mattress feels. We gather firmness ratings on the mattresses we test from each body type including petite, average and plus-size.\nEdge Support\nEdge support refers to the sturdiness of the bed\u2019s perimeter, which is important for those who share a small mattress, sit or sleep on the edge of their bed often or people with pain or mobility issues. To test a bed\u2019s edge support, our testers lie along the edge and switch positions to see if it buckles under their weight. They then sit along the bed\u2019s edge, moving around and standing up and sitting back down. (It\u2019s typical for a mattress to have better edge support while lying along the side since your body weight is more evenly distributed.)\nHere are a handful of beds that test best for edge support:\n- Saatva Classic in firm (10 out of 10 score)\n- WinkBed Plus (9 out of 10 score)\n- Plank Firm (9 out of 10 score)\nMotion Isolation\nThis is the fun part\u2014like that classic Tempur-Pedic commercial, we place a glass filled with water at the edge of the mattress and analyze the impact as we make various movements across the bed. We roll around, stand up and sit down and even jump into the bed to learn how well a bed absorbed motion. However, this metric is tested a little differently when a bed is sent home for a long-term trial, as two people are usually sharing the bed in real life and reporting any disturbances they feel from the other side of the mattress.\nHere are a few beds that test well for motion isolation:\n- WinkBeds Gravity Lux (9 out of 10 score)\n- Tuft & Needle Mint Hybrid (9 out of 10 score)\n- Nectar Premier (8.5 out of 10 score)\nHow We Test Mattresses: Long-Term Testing\nWe always prefer to test a mattress the best way possible: by sleeping on it for a series of consecutive nights. Along with sending select mattresses directly to individual testers, the ones we test as a group are given a second life with a long-term tester who tries the mattress in their own home for at least 30 nights. That way, we can gather data from a real-life setting and provide valuable insight for shoppers looking to invest in these beds. The metrics our long-term testers analyze are the same as our group testers, with the addition of a few more features that can only be tested over time, such as cooling and durability. And as mentioned, the water glass test for motion isolation is replaced with an actual human or pet.\nLong-term insights are used to update our roundups and individual reviews to keep them accurate and aligned with our testing data. Here are a few individual mattress reviews from our editors and writers who tested in their homes for a month or longer.\n- Helix Midnight Luxe Mattress Review\n- Leesa Sapira Chill Hybrid Mattress Review\n- Purple RestorePremiere Hybrid Mattress Review\n- Brooklyn Bedding Signature Mattress Review\nHow We Score Mattresses\nWe score mattresses by finding the average among five different metrics:\n- How well a mattress accommodates specific sleeping positions: Since most mattresses aren\u2019t designed to work for every sleeping position, we don\u2019t penalize a mattress for being exceptional for side sleepers yet terrible for stomach sleepers. Instead, we use the highest score and make note of who it\u2019s best for (and not so good for) in our recommendations.\n- Side sleeping: Beds score high when they have enough give around the shoulder and hips to contour and provide relief, and they score low when they push back against the joints and cause pressure or discomfort.\n- Back sleeping: Beds score high when they promote a straight spinal alignment, which prevents the spine from sagging into the bed. Beds score low when testers feel their spine or trunk is dipping too low or sitting too high.\n- Stomach sleeping: Beds score high when they prevent the hips from sagging into the mattress, and they score low when they lack a \"lifted\" feel and push your spine out of alignment.\n- Pressure relief: Beds score high when they provide relief and comfort for the joints (especially the hips and shoulders), and they score low when they cause discomfort or pain.\n- Ease of movement: Beds that are bouncy, responsive and easy to move around on score the highest, while beds that have slow-moving materials that take more time to bounce back\u2014leaving you with a stuck feeling\u2014score low.\n- Edge support: Beds score high when there is very little to no buckling under a tester\u2019s weight while both sitting and lying along the side of the bed, and they score low when the side of the bed sinks down and feels unsupportive while both sitting and lying along it.\n- Motion isolation: Beds score high when there is little to no movement in our water glass when testers place it on the edge of a mattress and make movements of all sizes nearby. Beds score low when there is a lot of movement or the glass falls over.\nEach metric is given a score between 1 and 10, with 1 being poor and 10 being great.\nOther Metrics We Test For\nWe also take into account additional performance factors that we don\u2019t include in the overall numerical score, but we often use when recommending mattresses to certain sleepers.\n- Cooling: We can get a good idea of whether or not a mattress is cooling by evaluating its materials and lying in one spot for several minutes to gauge heat retention, but the best way to truly test for cooling is by consistently sleeping on the bed at home. We take note of how warm or cool we feel when we go to bed and wake up, along with any fluctuations in temperature we experience throughout the night.\n- Durability: Similar to cooling, we first inspect the materials in a mattress and the advertised weight capacity to understand how durable and overall supportive it should be. We then document how much support a mattress provides over time and whether or not we experience any sagging or sinkage on any areas of the bed. (For example, some mattresses start to lack support in the center after a few months.)\nEditor Bonus\nIn some cases, mattresses are given a small bump by our sleep editors. This occurs when:\n- There is one outlying score from a tester that isn\u2019t in line with the majority and it lowers the bed\u2019s average.\n- A mattress offers three firmness profiles, which makes it more accommodating and versatile than beds with only one firmness level. As a result, it earns a slightly higher score.\n- A mattress is a great value for its price or features high-quality materials that others do not (such as luxury or third-party certified organic materials).\n- One of our sleep editors has long-term experience with a mattress and wants to override a metric\u2019s rating if they feel it\u2019s too low.\nMeet Our Forbes Vetted Mattress Testers\nThough we recruit testers from other teams, these are our testers who frequently write, update and edit our sleep content.\nBridget Chapman\nBridget Chapman, senior mattress and sleep editor for Forbes Vetted, oversees the sleep category and our testing. She has a decade of experience as a journalist and holds a sleep science coach certification, which she leans on to weed out false advertising claims and uncover real benefits in the online mattress industry.

      "text": "As a longtime hot sleeper, I\u2019ve spent countless nights kicking off my covers because I was too hot. After several nights of poor sleep, I\u2019m now keenly aware of the role temperature plays in determining your quality of sleep. Alongside a panel of 23 testers, I worked closely with our sleep editors to test the industry\u2019s best cooling mattresses in the studio and at home to discover which ones actually do what they promise. In the end, we crowned the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe the best cooling mattress overall due to its advanced cooling technology present in each layer and ability to accommodate a wide range of sleep positions. For a more affordable cooling bed, we endorse the Nectar Luxe Hybrid, which earned high marks during testing for its cool-to-the-touch cover and breathable hybrid construction.\nAll of the winners on this list deliver cooling comfort, but some come with other specialties like certified organic materials and smart features that respond to your body temperature. Every mattress in this guide has also been tested by one of our sleep experts, so we can personally vouch for their cooling abilities and overall performance. Ahead, my top nine cooling mattress recommendations for hot sleepers. For more cool-sleeping essentials, check out our guides to the best cooling sheets and comforters for hot sleepers.\nEditor\u2019s Note: The DreamCloud Premier Rest, our pick for the best cooling mattress for couples, has been upgraded and renamed the DreamCloud Luxe.\nOut of all of the cooling mattresses on the market we\u2019ve tested, there are none quite as impressive as the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe. While most cooling mattresses contain at least one\u2014and in some cases two to three\u2014active cooling features, the Aurora Luxe contains five\u2014one in nearly every layer. It is a hybrid mattress, so it already has the breathability of the coil construction going for it, but the top cover contains cooling fibers that help draw heat away from the body while leaving you with a cool-to-the-touch sensation. Senior mattress and sleep editor Bridget Chapman slept on the medium model for over a month and says she was impressed by its ability to prevent her from overheating.\nFive different members of our team tested the firm model of the Aurora Luxe and concluded that it\u2019s a good choice for a variety of sleeping positions. Our team scored the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe an 8 out of 10 for side sleepers, a 9.5 for back sleepers and an 8.5 for stomach sleepers. However, strict side sleepers or anyone in need of a little extra cushioning should consider the softer model, which helps cradle your pressure points in contouring comfort. Back or stomach sleepers who are after extra support can choose the medium or firm model. Read more in our detailed Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe Mattress review.\nExpert tip: Consider the pillow-top upgrade (an additional $300) for a plusher, more cushioned feel; it\u2019s especially good for side sleepers or people with joint pain.\nThe 2025 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing.\nThe Helix Midnight Luxe is a favorite among our team, and not just side sleepers. Its plush pillow top and three dense memory foam layers earned it a spot in our roundup of the best mattresses for side sleepers. During testing, we found that these layers excelled at cradling the shoulders and the hips, and the individually wrapped coils sandwiched below help maintained a neutral spine position. \u201cI love that this bed has some cushion, yet it\u2019s still supportive,\u201d says one tester. \u201cMy spine feels aligned and there\u2019s no discomfort.\u201d While you can\u2019t choose from three firmness levels like other hybrids on this list, we don\u2019t think you need to: Its balanced, medium-firm feel can accommodate side sleepers and other sleep postures.\nAs for the Midnight Luxe\u2019s cooling abilities, one of the foam layers contains a cooling copper infusion; the coils promote plenty of airflow and the pillow top is made from a breathable Tencel material. If you really want to up the cooling ante, you can spend $200 more to upgrade the pillow top to the cool-to-the-touch GlacioTex cover, which tester and updates writer Alexandra Garrett opted for. In her Helix Midnight Luxe review, she calls this mattress \u201ccomfortable, supportive and so cool.\u201d We also found this mattress is an excellent choice for couples, as our team rated its edge support and motion-isolating abilities an 8.5 out of 10.\nExpert tip: From our experience, the upgraded cover is worth the splurge. Our only complaint with this mattress is that you have to spend more on this cover in the first place. By comparison, the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe already comes built with this cooling cover, no upgrade required.\nIf you deal with a double-whammy of back pain and overheating, we might have your solution: the Leesa Legend Chill Hybrid. Its dual-coil construction makes it one of the more unique cooling mattresses on the market and also one of the most supportive, a crucial feature for people with back pain. \u201cThe Leesa Legend Chill Hybrid is one of my favorites from 3Z, the parent company of Leesa. Combined with its comfortable foam layers and fluffy pillow top, it\u2019s an ultra-supportive and plush bed that makes you look forward to lying down,\u201d says mattress and sleep editor McKenzie Dillon.\nWe also like that the Chill falls somewhere between a 5 and a 7 on the firmness scale, giving it a slightly firmer feel than a true medium mattress. During testing, we found the sturdier base combined with the firmer overall construction helped it excel at maintaining spinal alignment and preventing pressure from accumulating on the lower back. Outside of its exceptional support, the Leesa Legend Chill Hybrid also wowed us in the cooling department: Its cooling cover, gel-infused foam and plenty of airflow from the coil base work together to ward off night sweats. See more about this mattress in our Leesa Legend Chill Mattress review.\nExpert tip: The Leesa Sapira Chill is a viable option for those who need a supportive cooling mattress at a more affordable price.\nFor those looking for a cooling mattress that is as eco-friendly as it is temperature regulating, let us point you to the Avocado Green. The Avocado Green\u2019s breathable design lets air pass through freely and prevents it from retaining heat. After testing the firm model, Chapman says, \u201cThe organic materials promote airflow that helps with cooling.\u201d Our long-term tester agrees, saying that heat dissipated quickly after she switched positions and that she slept temperature-neutral through the whole night.\nRecycled steel coils make up the bed\u2019s base, the core is composed of naturally sourced and GOLS-certified Dunlop and Talalay latex, and organic wool and cotton cover the bed\u2019s outer shell. Not only is this combination as natural as a mattress comes, but it also proved to be incredibly supportive during testing: Back and stomach sleepers found the firm version of the Avocado one of the most comfortable because of its lifted and responsive feel. \u201cI feel like I am in a healthy alignment, and as someone who has lower back pain concerns, I don\u2019t feel any pinching or sinkage that could trigger that discomfort,\u201d notes one tester. We also found that this organic mattress is easy to move around on (which makes it easier to change sleep positions), scoring a high 8.5 out of 10 in this category. This is a plus for combination sleepers who change positions frequently and want a bed that moves seamlessly with them.\nExpert tip: While you get to choose from three firmness levels, our biggest gripe is the price of the pillow-top upgrades. They start at $595 for the medium option and over $1,000 for the plusher box-top. The firm model is best for back and stomach sleepers, but side and combination sleepers should consider a softer choice.\nIf you want the most customizable mattress experience possible\u2014and you don\u2019t mind forking over a pretty penny for it\u2014the Sleep Number Climate360 is one of the most decked-out mattresses we\u2019ve tested. It comes with just about every feature there is to offer: dual climate controls, adjustable firmness, built-in sleep tracking and a smart adjustable base. If you like to sleep cool but your partner prefers sleeping warm, you can turn the temperature down or up by 15 degrees on each side for individualized temperature control. There\u2019s also a setting to gently warm your feet, ant it automatically shuts off once it senses you\u2019re asleep.\nQuite frankly, we\u2019ve never seen a bed this advanced or intuitive. \u201cHot and cold sleepers should really enjoy this bed, especially if your needs are different from your partner\u2019s. The cooling function is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen on another mattress, and I found it to be very effective in my testing,\u201d says Dillon in her Sleep Number Climate360 review.\nAs for the mattress itself, the Climate 360 is a hybrid construction with individually wrapped coils at the base and layers of foam sandwiched together up top. This construction alone helps it sleep cool; throw in all of the extras and you can sleep as chilly as you want. Plus, you may find yourself adjusting the thermostat less and less since you can have total control of the mattress\u2019 temperature. As for its adjustable firmness, the left and right side of the bed function independently of one another, giving you and your partner the ability to customize each side with the firmness levels you prefer.\nExpert tip: For a less expensive smart bed, stay tuned for our review of the ClimateCool, which we\u2019re currently testing. It offers similar cooling customizations as the Climate 360 but without the warming features.\nTrue cooling mattresses are often pricier than other options available, due to the different materials that get added to the construction. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t find a quality cooling bed at a more reasonable price\u2014like the Nectar Luxe Hybrid, our recommendation for those looking to make the most of their dollar. It\u2019s your standard hybrid mattress\u2014a coil base combined with layers of memory foam\u2014but contains cooling fibers in the cover that several testers called out for feeling cool to the touch.\nWhile most hybrid mattresses excel at cooling, they tend to underperform when it comes to motion isolation (memory foam beds are better in this regard). That wasn\u2019t the case with the Luxe Hybrid: Our testers scored its motion isolation an 8 out of 10. For couples who sleep hot but are also looking for a mattress that dampens movement from one side of the bed to the other, this is a great option. Another note: We wouldn\u2019t classify the Luxe Hybrid as a luxury mattress, but we do think it offers accommodating comfort for multiple sleeping positions, and its cooling cover is a nice finish that we usually only see with pricier beds.\nExpert tip: We find the Nectar Luxe softer than advertised and most ideal for back and side sleepers. If you\u2019re a stomach sleeper, opt for the Nectar Classic for a true medium-firm budget mattress. We also find that the Nectar Ultra offers a stronger cooling sensation if you\u2019re willing to splurge more for temperature relief.\nPeople who share their bed with a partner are at risk of sleeping more warmly, so we often recommend couples invest in a cooling mattress, whether they identify as hot sleepers or not. Formerly known as the DreamCloud Premier Rest, the DreamCloud Luxe Hybrid is a happy medium that excels in a number of areas, namely cooling, support, motion isolation and pressure relief.\n\u201cThe mattress is surprisingly cooling,\u201d says a tester who has been sleeping on the Luxe Hybrid for years. \u201cI rarely wake up sweaty or too warm at night, and we use a very high-feather-count down comforter year-round. Second, the pillow top of the mattress has a covering that is made out of a breathable cashmere blend, which I think helps keep the bed ventilated.\u201d\nDuring testing, we enjoyed sinking into the plush Euro pillow top, which is blended with a breathable cashmere cover. The Luxe Hybrid has seven layers total, which we found resulted in deep pressure relief and comfort. Several of these foam layers also contain cooling gel. After talking to my parents, who have slept on this mattress for over six years, I found those initial testing results held up: Both of them have found relief from back and hip pain after sleeping on it. Learn more in our full DreamCloud Luxe Hybrid Mattress review.\nExpert tip: Although the mattress has a medium-firm profile, we found it was a plush option that\u2019s most supportive and relieving for back and side sleepers. Stomach sleepers, especially those over 250 pounds, should consider a firmer mattress. (Check out our firm mattress recommendations for more specific guidance.)\nIn our experience, memory foam beds and cooling usually don\u2019t belong in the same sentence. But after testing the Ghostbed Luxe, we\u2019re OK with making an exception. The outer layers of the bed consist of a cooling cover made with temperature-regulating fibers and a layer of gel memory foam, which helps to pull heat away from your body. \u201cThe cover of the mattress is cool to the touch, and I also didn\u2019t notice any change in my temperature while lying on it,\u201d agrees one tester. Beneath this cover is a \u201cGhost Ice\u201d layer, which is made of phase-change material that can absorb heat and dissipate it away from your body and the base of the mattress.\nAnd because the GhostBed Luxe has a classic, sink-in memory foam feel, we found it offers a just-right level of comfort for most sleeping positions. \u201cAlong with being a stellar cooling pick, I found the GhostBed Luxe to offer exceptional pressure relief for back and side sleeping,\u201d says Chapman. It\u2019s pressure relieving, but still supportive thanks to its dense seven-layer construction. (Most all-foam beds have three to four layers of foam.) Another pro: GhostBed offers a 25-year limited warranty on this mattress, which isn\u2019t as common for an all-foam bed.\nExpert tip: Stomach sleepers, especially those looking for sturdier support, should look for a firmer mattress like the Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Breeze LuxeBreeze, below.\nWe often recommend firm mattresses for their remarkable support and durability, but also because they\u2019re less likely to sleep hot since there\u2019s zero sink-in sensation. Instead, you sleep more \u201con top\u201d of the mattress. The Tempur-Breeze LuxeBreeze technically comes in three firmness levels, but we like the firm model the best for those looking for the coolest feel. It contains a layer of the brand\u2019s signature Tempur-Material, which is essentially a denser, more pressure-relieving version of memory foam.\nThe rest of the mattress is dominated by a plethora of cooling materials. The top layer is a cool-to-the-touch cover, and all eight of our testers called attention to its ultra-cooling feel. \u201cThe top feels a lot cooler than the other mattresses I\u2019ve tried,\u201d says one tester, who adds, \u201cAs a hot sleeper, I can see myself being extremely happy sleeping on this all night.\u201d Every layer that follows the top cover is specifically engineered to draw heat away from the body. It also excels at motion isolation, which our testers scored an 8.5 out of 10; the mattress completely deadened movement during our water glass trial. It is on the pricier end of the spectrum, but if you love the slow-moving feel of memory foam and sleep hot, we think it\u2019s worth the investment.\nExpert tip: Side sleepers should consider the soft model, while back sleepers may prefer the medium or firm. Stomach sleepers should go with firm.\nOther Cooling Mattresses We\u2019ve Tested\nWhen compiling this guide of our top cooling beds for hot sleepers, three mattresses came close to making the list. While they didn\u2019t make the final cut, they do offer other features that may make them a good fit for you:\n- Saatva Classic: Named our best mattress for back pain overall, this bed is supportive and comfortable. It provided excellent pressure relief for the upper and lower back while keeping the spine in a healthy alignment. However, it doesn\u2019t contain as many materials specifically designed for cooling as the Leesa Legend Chill Hybrid did.\n- Purple Restore Hybrid: While this mattress excelled in the cooling department, its uniquely spongy feel isn\u2019t for everyone. If you don\u2019t mind that texture, though, this cooling bed is otherwise highly reviewed.\n- Casper Snow: A close contender for the best cooling mattress for side sleepers, the Casper Snow provided a generous amount of contouring and pressure relief during testing. That said, it\u2019s priced similarly to the Helix Midnight Luxe but lacks add-ons like a pillow top. At that price, it should come with an additional comfort layer.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nOur editorial team has tested and reviewed dozens of mattresses, which is shown in our large library of sleep guides. Our mattress reviews span a variety of types and constructions, and we also offer guides for hot sleepers such as the best cooling blankets and cooling sheets.\n- Coauthor of this guide and Forbes Vetted senior strategy editor Katie Simpson has tested over 100 mattresses, including several of the beds on this list. A hot sleeper herself, she\u2019s always on the hunt for the latest cooling mattress or bedding accessory.\n- Forbes Vetted senior mattress and sleep editor Bridget Chapman and mattress and sleep editor McKenzie Dillon, co-author of this article, are both certified sleep science coaches who have tested over 120 beds. Collectively, they\u2019ve tested every mattress on this list. They oversee this story and its updates, relying on their testing experience to inform our mattress recommendations and buying advice. We also considered the experiences of other editors and writers on our team who have slept on and tested these beds.\n- We used two different testing methods: Cooling mattresses were either group-tested from the perspective of 10-plus people who ranged in weight, sleep posture, gender and pain issues; or they were tested by one person for a month in their own home.\n- We took different needs, sleep positions and comfort preferences into account to make sure our list is well-rounded and addresses the needs of a wide range of hot sleepers.\n- To make sure our recommendations stay up to date, we regularly revisit this guide and reevaluate our top picks. It was last updated in July 2025 by Fran Sales, who also participated in the latest round of mattress panel testing.\nHow We Tested The Best Cooling Mattresses\nBefore selecting which beds to test for the best cooling mattresses, we took the following steps:\n- Identified best-selling models from reputable brands that already contain a breathable mattress construction;\n- Determined which cooling mattresses and sleep needs are most popular among Forbes Vetted readers by analyzing which models are most frequently clicked on;\n- Considered the types of cooling beds that address common sleep needs, such as different sleeping positions, back pain and firmness preferences;\n- Consulted hot sleepers on our team to identify which models they had previously slept on and tested.\nWhen it came time to test the cooling mattresses that made the cut, panel testers in a lab setting took note of immediate cooling relief, while long-term testers took the mattresses home and analyzed each bed\u2019s temperature regulation overnight and over time. They vetted each mattress using rigorous testing criteria; read about each performance factor that informed our short-term and long-term testing below.\nMattress Construction\nA mattress\u2019 basic construction is the biggest determining factor in how warm or cool it sleeps. We paid special attention to the presence of innerspring coils and the thickness and number of memory foam layers. Coils leave room for air to flow, while memory foam tends to trap more heat. Most of our testing contenders were either hybrid or innerspring mattresses, although we made exceptions if an all-foam mattress contained specific cooling features designed to break up heat retention and promote breathability.\nCooling Features\nThe next thing we looked for was the presence of active cooling features, such as a cooling cover, phase-change material and gel- or copper-infused foam. A mattress didn\u2019t need to have all of these cooling additions to make our list, but it did need to contain at least one specific cooling feature. We also considered how effective these features were at keeping us cool: For example, if a mattress contained a cooling cover, we evaluated whether this top layer felt cool to the touch, and if that sensation lasted over several nights of rest or multiple rounds of testing.\nSupport\nWhile cooling was top of mind during testing, we wanted to make sure each mattress performed well in other key areas, too. To test for support, we evaluated how well each mattress maintained spine alignment. We also considered how we felt when lying on each bed and how much we sank into the mattress in every sleep position.\nPressure Relief\nTo test for pressure relief, we considered whether we felt pressure buildup in different sleep positions. We lay on our side, back and stomach and took note of how the mattress cushioned our shoulders, hips and lower back.\nFirmness\nWe also considered where each mattress fell on the firmness scale. Typically, the firmer a mattress is, the more breathable it feels, since firmer beds keep you more on top of the mattress rather than in it.\nWhat To Consider When Buying A Cooling Mattress\nSince waking up hot is a common issue, many mattress brands have worked to redesign their beds for increased breathability and temperature regulation. Here\u2019s what you should look for when buying a cooling mattress.\nMattress Type\nMattresses come in many different constructions, the four most common being hybrid, innerspring, latex and memory foam. Each of these mattress types offers a different combination of support, comfort and cooling abilities.\n- Innerspring mattresses promote the most airflow out of any other type due to the empty spaces between the coils. These beds also tend to be more supportive, bouncy and firm than other mattress types.\n- Hybrid mattresses typically have a breathable coil base with comfort layers on top. This results in a best-of-both-worlds mattress construction where you can enjoy the added comfort of memory foam without the heat-trapping effects. Some hybrid beds use gel- or copper-infused foams, which enhance the bed\u2019s cooling abilities.\n- Latex mattresses retain less heat than memory foam beds due to the naturally breathable structure. Natural latex, such as Dunlop and Talalay, is also usually aerated, which promotes a ton of airflow and breathability.\n- Memory foam mattresses provide a marshmallowy feel that hugs your body. While this level of contouring is great for pressure relief, it often leaves sleepers feeling hot since the material retains heat. If you sleep hot but love the feel of an all-foam bed, some elements to look for are ventilated foam, foam infused with gel or copper (which can help break up heat retention), and covers woven with breathable fibers or phase-change materials. That said, a cooling memory foam mattress can still sleep warmer than some hybrid, latex or innerspring mattresses.\nCooling Materials\nSome mattresses come with additional cooling features, such as a cool-to-the-touch cover, a cooling pillow top or layers of gel- or copper-infused foams. These materials can either enhance a bed\u2019s already-breathable construction or help a mattress that usually sleeps more warm (like a memory foam bed) sleep cooler instead. Here are a few added cooling features you may expect to see in these mattresses:\n- \u201cCool-to-the-touch\u201d textiles: Phase-change materials (PCM) can be used to create fabric that feels cool against the skin. These are often used in the covers and layers of cooling mattresses or offered as optional upgrades.\n- Gel-infused foam: Gel-infused foams are a common feature in cooling mattresses, as the gel can help absorb and dissipate body heat. However, one drawback is that gel infusions can lose their cooling properties over time.\n- Air channels: Mattresses that include air channels, like hybrid or innerspring mattresses and mattresses made with perforated latex, are naturally more breathable than memory or poly foam beds.\n- Copper or graphite: You may also see other additions, like copper or graphite, in cooling mattresses. Copper and graphite are conductors of heat and can draw heat away from your body for a more comfortable rest.\nFirmness\nFirmness is important whether you\u2019re looking for a cooling mattress or not, but it also can play a role in how warm or cool a bed feels. The softer a bed is, the more you sink into it, which means your body retains more heat. Firmer beds, by contrast, tend to feel cooler since you\u2019re on top of the mattress, not in it. Medium-firm picks can hit the sweet spot of both for a comfortable, supportive feel.\nBody Type\nLarger people may sink into softer mattresses\u2014which can lead to excess heat. In general, the more you weigh, the softer a bed feels. If you have a larger body, you may want to consider a mattress that\u2019s on the firmer side to help prevent this. Many of the best mattresses for heavy people, which are made to accommodate more weight, have built-in cooling features. They also last longer than mattresses designed for petite to average-sized people."

      "text": "Memory foam is one of the most popular mattress materials, and for good reason: It\u2019s pressure-relieving, comforting and isolates motion if you share the bed with a partner (or pet) who tosses and turns. To find the best memory foam mattresses worth your money, our team rounded up dozens of models from top-rated brands and tested them firsthand. We also incorporated insights from testers with varied sleeping position preferences, body types and pain points. After reviewing all of their feedback, we determined that the Nectar Premier Mattress is the best memory foam mattress overall, thanks to its comfortable and contouring feel; it\u2019s comparable to our pick for the best luxury memory foam mattress, the Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Adapt, but with a more appealing price tag.\nMemory foam comes in different densities, designs and feels, so there are several other mattresses on this list worthy of consideration (several of which are also featured in our guide to the best mattresses of 2025). Whether you enjoy a slow-sinking mattress or a responsive, buoyant bed, we\u2019ve tracked down the best options that strike the right balance of quality and comfort. For even more contouring support, consider picking up a memory foam pillow while you\u2019re at it.\nNectar recently released a lineup of updated mattress models, and the new Nectar Premier has some characteristics that make it even better than its predecessor. Even those who are not traditionally fans of memory foam\u2014perhaps, like me, they feel like it pushes back against their body when they try to switch positions\u2014the Nectar Premier offers a different feel. During testing, we found that the new model is soft and marshmallowy, and a bit more responsive to pressure than the previous Nectar Premier model. One tester described it as \u201cdense, doughy and slow-moving.\u201d Because of its memory foam profile, it offers top-notch motion isolation to help deaden movement across the mattress: Our team rated this quality an 8.5 out of 10.\nAlthough memory foam is great at absorbing motion, it\u2019s also known to absorb heat (and retain it). The Nectar Premier helps fight this stereotype with a cover that\u2019s woven with cooling fibers\u2014over 60% more fibers than in the Nectar Classic (the brand\u2019s entry-level model). Underneath that is the NectarTech System, which consists of a contouring memory foam layer and responsive transition layer for a signature memory foam feel that doesn\u2019t make you feel like you\u2019re being engulfed in the foam\u2019s layers. Instead, it\u2019s more responsive and provides more lift than the old model.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that our testers found the Tempur-Pedic Mattress, our choice as the best luxury memory foam mattress, a close runner-up, but we think the Nectar Premier offers a better value.\nExpert tip: If you weigh over 250 pounds, we recommend you consider the more supportive Nectar Premier Hybrid Mattress, which has a pocketed steel coil base that is sturdier and more durable than an all-foam support layer. The Nectar Premier Hybrid can hold up to 1,000 pounds (500 pounds on each side), according to the brand.\nThe 2025 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing.\nTempur-Pedic is a well-established brand in the sleep industry, having honed its comfort layer technology through years of experience. The the entry-level Tempur-Adapt is the most affordable in its Adapt collection, and it\u2019s my favorite from the brand because of the bed\u2019s value compared to Tempur-Pedic\u2019s pricier options. According updates writer Alex Garrett, who tested this model, \u201cThis mattress has everything memory foam fans could need. It's cool to the touch, squishy and responsive. Overall, it's very luxurious feeling.\u201d And during long-term testing testing, one hot-sleeping tester notes it slept cooler than her prior mattress, and she was no longer waking up in a sweat.\nWe found it offers great pressure relief for most sleeping positions, and we scored it an 8.5 out of 10 in this category. \u201cLying on my side on the Tempur-Adapt is just as comfortable as sleeping on my back,\u201d says Garrett. \u201cIt provides a nice touch of pressure relief for my shoulders and hips.\u201d Underneath the first comfort layer of this 11-inch mattress, the second slab provides support and adapts to your pressure points for what the brand describes as \u201cpersonalized comfort.\u201d We also found it tested well for motion isolation. This is a great perk for couples who don\u2019t want to be bothered by each other\u2019s movements. See more details about this mattress in our Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Adapt Mattress review.\nExpert tip: A hybrid version with springs is also available if you\u2019d like more bounce.\nThe Amerisleep AS5 Mattress is one of the softest beds that our editors and team members have ever tested. With its more eco-friendly and breathable memory foam design, it was a top choice for the best soft memory foam mattress and dethroned the WinkBeds Gravity Luxe because of its ultra-plush profile. It\u2019s made with a foam that the brand calls \u201cBioPur,\u201d a plant-based, fiberglass-free and non-toxic material that our testers say provides excellent pressure relief for a side sleeper\u2019s shoulder and hips.\n\u201cI could gladly sleep an entire night on my side on the Amerisleep AS5,\u201d says Garrett. \u201cMy hips and shoulders feel hugged by the bed, which releases any pressure buildup. Overall, I feel very relaxed and comfortable. Another tester adds, \u201cIt's very contouring to the shape of your body and feels rather plush.\u201d And like many other memory foam mattresses, this has great motion isolation; our testers scored it an 8 out of 10 for its ability to absorb movement. Many also called out its noticeably cool-to-the-touch feel, with one person saying they could feel its chill through their jeans and another comparing it to the GlacioTex cover on the editor-favorite Helix Midnight Luxe. This is one of the bed\u2019s best standout features, as memory foam can retain heat if it isn\u2019t designed with some kind of temperature-regulating component.\nExpert tip: For a soft feel that offers more support than the AS5, opt for the AS3 Mattress, which the brand rated around a 5 on the firmness scale and is a better choice for back sleepers.\nThe Tuft & Needle Original Mattress is a testament to how less can be more, as its simple two-layer construction has appealed to thousands of customers who can vouch for the comfort it offers at an affordable price. It beat out our prior choice for the best budget memory foam mattress because of its more accommodating firmness profile and a responsive feel that our testers appreciated.\nOne tester calls it extremely comfortable and compares it to the feel of a hybrid mattress. \u201cPure memory foam mattresses typically feel slightly uncomfortable for me, but this has a light bounce to it without providing sinkage from the foam.\u201d It has an open-cell foam design that makes the foam lighter and airer than a dense memory foam bed like a Nectar or Tempur-Pedic model. And thanks to this construction, our testers found it offers superb ease of movement and rated it an 8 out of 10 in this category.\nThe mattress is soft and cushy underneath the hips and shoulders for side sleepers and supportive enough to promote spinal alignment in back sleepers. \u201cThere is no pressure buildup around my shoulder or hip,\u201d says one tester. \u201cIt\u2019s rated a medium but it feels like my joints are cradled without being too soft (I prefer a medium-soft firmness).\u201d For those who want more of a cooling feel, consider the Cocoon Chill, which our editors considered a close second for the best affordable memory foam mattress.\nExpert tip: Some testers found it was a touch firmer than its \u201cmedium\u201d profile rating.\nSeveral of the mattresses on this list feature cooling tech, but the GhostBed Luxe takes it up another notch with multiple layers of cooling materials that actively work to cool you down while you sleep. There\u2019s \u201cGhost Ice\u201d fabric in the cover for a cool-to-the-touch feel, and also woven into the cover is a 1-inch layer of gel memory foam and 0.5 inch of cooling fiber. \u201cThe mattress cover feels cool to the touch and I don\u2019t notice any heat buildup, which is a plus considering memory foam beds can sleep hot,\u201d says Garrett. \u201cI really enjoy this mattress, especially the cooling aspect of the cover,\u201d says another tester.\nAn additional Ghost Ice layer sits underneath the cover, which is followed by a gel memory foam layer for comfort and even more temperature regulation, then a proprietary transition layer that mimics latex foam. If heat has you lying awake at night, the GhostBed Luxe may be an ideal mattress for your needs. We found it offers a medium feel that works well for back and side sleepers: \u201cThis feels great while side sleeping, there's a good mix of cushioning and sinkage that keeps my hip and shoulder comfortable,\u201d says senior mattress and sleep editor Bridget Chapman. We also scored it a 9 out of 10 for back sleeping. It\u2019s a bit more responsive than a typical memory foam mattress as well, so you shouldn\u2019t feel stuck in the foam layers.\nExpert tip: Although the cooling fibers can be felt through bedding, we recommend you use breathable sheets to fully reap the bed\u2019s benefits.\nBrooklyn Bedding is behind the Plank Firm mattress, which is a flippable bed designed to be firm and supportive. It\u2019s one of the firmest mattresses we\u2019ve ever tested, and despite being an all-foam bed, it offers ample support from edge to edge for stomach sleepers and many back sleepers who prefer a firm feel. We scored it an 8 out of 10 for both sleep postures, and one tester says, \u201cSleeping on my back feels great. There is a sense of weightlessness when you\u2019re sleeping on this mattress, and a lot of pressure alleviation in the lower back.\u201d And while stomach sleeping, one tester says their hips stayed aligned and they didn\u2019t experience any lower back discomfort.\nThe Plank Firm is 9 inches thick, with four memory foam layers and a flippable design. One side of the bed is considered firm, and the other is extra-firm; this allows sleepers to choose the support and firmness level that works best for them. The Plank Firm also features a quilted top and bottom, and if you sleep hot, you can add a cooling cover for about $100 extra. For couples, this bed has the strongest edge support on our list (9.5 out of 10, based on our testing) and it also offers top-notch motion isolation (8 out of 10).\nExpert tip: While either side excels at providing spine alignment for stomach sleepers, heavyweight sleepers should opt for the extra-firm side, since they tend to sink into a mattress more. Also consider the Bear Original, our runner-up choice in this category, for an extra-firm feel with a touch more contouring.\nSaatva is known for its ultra-supportive, strong and high-quality mattresses, and the Contour 5 is the brand\u2019s newest memory foam addition to its lineup that boasts these characteristics. With extra lumbar supports and multiple firmness options to choose from, our editors think it\u2019s an optimal choice for the best memory foam mattress for back pain.\nOur testers tried the medium model and found it accommodates multiple sleeping positions: One noted that when lying on their back, they were very comfortable, didn\u2019t experience any misalignment, and felt well-supported from their mid to lower body. As for side sleeping, one tester says, \u201cAs someone who frequently wakes up with hip and lower back pain, I can see this one supporting me all night.\u201d\nIn the center third of the mattress under the lumbar region sits the brand\u2019s \u201cCoolVent System\u201d with a \u201cLumbar Zone PCM Matrix\u201d\u2014which are essentially comfortable slits that reinforce the spine and contain phase-change material to help dissipate heat. A number of testers noticed its cool-to-the-touch feel. During testing, we also found that it offers solid motion isolation and good ease of movement; we scored both categories an 8 out of 10. Read more about our firsthand insights in our Saatva Contour5 review.\nExpert tip: If you live with back pain and sleep on your back or stomach, the firm model is the most accommodating choice. Side sleepers with back pain should consider the medium model.\nThe 10.5-inch Layla Memory Foam Mattress, like the Plank, has a flippable design that offers two firmness levels in one. However, the Layla mattress is much more plush and pressure relieving, ideal for side sleepers who need a soft, contouring bed to cradle their hips and shoulders. \u201cI almost fell asleep during testing when I was laying on my side on the Layla Memory Foam,\u201d says Garrett. \u201cIt provides a nice amount of pressure relief for my hips and shoulders, and my back stays in a comfortable, neutral alignment the entire time.\u201d An optimal option for back sleepers, we rated this a 9 out of 10 in that category.\nThis bed has a unique feel that\u2019s light and airy, while still maintaining a \u201ccushiony, cloud-like profile without too much of a quicksand feel,\u201d says one tester\u2014a distinct feel that fans of the mattress have come to love about the material. \u201cI found it\u2019s easy to roll around in,\u201d they add. The memory foam is copper-infused, which is a conductive material that\u2019s designed to draw body heat away from you for a cooler, more comfortable sleep. Based on our testing, we found it did a decent job regulating temperature, but we wouldn\u2019t consider it actively cooling.\nExpert tip: Most side sleepers should consider sleeping on the soft side, but the firm side is softer than advertised and better for combination sleepers. Note that the Layla Hybrid Mattress model has similar characteristics and is more accommodating for sleepers over 250 pounds.\nIf you co-sleep with a partner, you want an accommodating mattress that suits both your sleeping styles and delivers enhanced motion isolation so your movements don\u2019t disturb each other\u2019s sleep. The Leesa Original Mattress is a no-frills option that delivers on couples\u2019 needs at a fair price, which is why it\u2019s named the best option for couples. Most all-foam mattresses have decent edge support, but we found during testing that it was stronger than competitors, rating it an 8.5 out of 10. \u201cThis mattress has the best edge support out of all the mattresses I tested,\u201d says one of our testers. \u201cThe edge feels no different from the center of the mattress.\u201d It also has great motion isolation, which we rated a solid 9 out of 10.\nThe Leesa Original Mattress is three layers thick, with a responsive comfort layer that doesn\u2019t make you feel like you\u2019re stuck in the mud. It offers a balanced feel that one person calls \u201crelatively neutral.\u201d \u201cIt doesn't sink down too much and it's not too soft nor too firm,\u201d she says. With high scores across the board for different sleeping positions, our testers agree that it\u2019s one of those \u201cjust right\u201d beds. It also took the spot of our prior pick, the Bear Original, because it features a softer feel that appeals to more sleep postures and profile preferences.\nExpert tip: The Leesa Original Hybrid is only $125 more expensive (for a queen size) for those who want additional support, like heavyweight sleepers over 250 pounds.\nThe Best Memory Foam Mattresses Compared\nBecause every memory foam mattress is unique, we dove into key features and sought out the best models for each sleep style. To see how the best memory foam mattresses compare, we broke down some of the most important features to consider below.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nAt Forbes Vetted, we\u2019ve published a large library of sleep and mattress articles, including guides that include a number of memory foam picks, like the best soft mattresses and the best Tempur-Pedic mattresses.\n- All of our memory foam recommendations were approved by mattress and sleep editors Bridget Chapman and McKenzie Dillon, who are certified sleep science coaches and professional mattress testers. Collectively, they\u2019ve tested hundreds of mattresses.\n- We relied on feedback from other Forbes Vetted editors and staff and included some of their favorite memory foam beds in this guide.\n- We consulted Dr. William Kemp, neurosurgeon at Virginia Spine Institute, and Dr. Samantha Parker Lane at Memorial Hermann Health System, on what to look for when choosing the best memory foam mattress.\n- We regularly revisit this article to ensure we are up-to-date on the latest in sleep technology. Its most recent update was in June 2025 by Dillon who added tested insights to each mattress listed and updated product choices.\nHow We Tested And Chose The Best Memory Foam Mattresses\nTo find the best memory foam mattresses, we looked to reputable mattress brands that excel at producing all-foam beds, including newly released models. We then considered which models are most sought after and clicked on by Forbes Vetted readers. We pored through hundreds of customer reviews to make sure they were overwhelmingly positive\u2014and that there wasn\u2019t any concerning or disqualifying negative feedback.\nOur team of over a dozen people retested more than 50 mattresses to find out how the performed and compared; our testers included those with different preferred sleeping positions, body types and pain points. We gave each mattress a rating in various categories such as pressure relief, motion isolation, appeal to different sleeping positions, edge support and more, and selected the highest-scoring beds to feature in our best memory foam mattress list.\nBelow is an outline of how we tested memory foam mattresses and how we evaluate them. For further details, read our in-depth breakdown of how we test and score mattresses.\nPressure Relief\nPressure relief refers to how well a mattress minimizes stress on pressure points along the body, whether it be the shoulders, hips or back. Memory foam typically excels at pressure relief, making it a good choice for people with pain concerns. To test the level of pressure relief of each memory foam mattress, we lie in each sleeping position (side, back and stomach) and note how well the bed contours to sensitive pressure points.\nSupport\nA mattress\u2019s support refers to a number of things: its weight capacity, durability and edge support, and how you feel while sleeping on it. We take all these factors into account during testing. To determine whether or not a memory foam mattress provides ample support, we lie in the middle and on the edge of the bed to see how much the bed sinks and falters under our weight. We also test how the mattress supports the three primary sleeping positions: back, side and stomach. While side- and stomach-sleeping, we check that the hips and shoulders are in a healthy alignment with the spine. For back-sleeping, we make sure the back isn\u2019t curving or arching too far out of a neutral alignment.\nMotion Isolation\nMotion isolation refers to how well the mattress can prevent movement from traveling across the bed. Most memory foam beds perform especially well in this category, due to the dense nature of foam material. To test for motion isolation, we place a glass of water near the edge of the mattress and make rolling or jumping movements to see how sturdy the glass and liquid are.\nTemperature Regulation\nMemory foam mattresses often sleep warm since the material traps more heat. That said, some all-foam beds are made with cooling materials that help to wick away heat and keep you cool. To determine how well a memory foam mattress regulates temperature, we evaluated the layers of each bed to see whether they\u2019re infused with cooling materials. We also sleep on the mattress ourselves and document how well the bed regulates temperature each night.\nWhat To Consider When Shopping For A Memory Foam Mattress\nMemory foam beds are excellent for some, but truth be told, they\u2019re not for everyone. First, consider whether the material is the best option for you, then choose a model that caters to your sleep style, body type and comfort preferences.\nWho Memory Foam Is Best For\nMemory foam mattresses have a distinct, contouring feel and excel at providing pressure relief and preventing aches and pains. These beds tend to be best for:\n- Side sleepers, since memory foam cradles joints.\n- Those who experience joint pain along the shoulders, hips and back.\n- Couples, since memory foam tends to limit motion transfer. This means you can\u2019t feel your partner toss and turn or get in and out of bed.\nWho Should Avoid Memory Foam\nConversely, some people find they dislike the feel of memory foam. The following types of sleepers may want to consider another option, like a hybrid mattress:\n- Very hot sleepers may sweat in a memory foam mattress, since they tend to retain heat. However, if you\u2019re sold on the body-molding feel of foam, many top beds offer cooling features like gel-infused and perforated foams, as well as breathable covers.\n- Stomach sleepers may want to consider more supportive mattress types. That said, firm or extra-firm foam models, like the Plank Firm, can provide the necessary amount of support.\n- Anyone who feels claustrophobic or \u201cswallowed up\u201d by the sink-in feel of memory foam should look for a mattress type with a more buoyant feel.\nSleeping Position\nThe firmness and support level you need from a memory foam mattress greatly depends on your sleeping position(s).\n- Side sleepers typically need a soft to medium-firm mattress in order to get the necessary pressure relief around their hips and shoulders. Mattresses that are too hard can create pressure points also causing pain,\u201d says Dr. Lane.\n- Back sleepers should look for a medium-firm to firm memory foam mattress in order to keep their spine in alignment. These sleepers don\u2019t want their hips sinking too far into the bed\u2014or, on the contrary, not sinking enough for pressure-point relief.\n- Stomach sleepers require a firmer memory foam bed that minimizes sinkage around the midsection to keep the spine in proper alignment. If their hips dip too far into a mattress, it can lead to back pain.\n- Combo sleepers usually find their sweet spot with a medium-firm mattress since it can accommodate the most sleep positions. However, it\u2019s good to think of the position you sleep in the most throughout the night and let that guide the firmness level you choose.\nBody Type And Weight\nDespite the general recommendations listed above, keep in mind that a mattress\u2019 feel depends on body weight, too. Dr. Kemp notes that body weight can affect how firm, supportive and comfortable a mattress feels.\nFor example, a medium-firm mattress may feel softer than advertised for someone who weighs over 250 pounds. Most memory foam beds tend to feel softer than an innerspring or hybrid mattress since they don\u2019t contain coils and often support up to 250 pounds per side (or 500 pounds total). If you\u2019re looking for ample support\u2014especially if you\u2019re switching from a traditional innerspring\u2014a firmer option or a mattress specifically designed for heavyweight sleepers may be best.\nCooling Technology\nMemory foam is known for trapping heat, so many brands offer infused or perforated foams to enhance cooling and breathability. The three most popular types of memory foam are synthetic, gel-infused and copper-infused. Synthetic foams provide the sink-in, pressure-relieving feel the material is known for, while gel-infused and copper-infused foams help promote more airflow and regulate temperature. If you\u2019re a hot sleeper in need of a cooling mattress, we recommend opting for these infused foams and also taking a look at our list of the best cooling memory foam mattresses.\nTrial And Warranty\nEach memory foam mattress in our roundup comes with a risk-free trial and warranty policy. The average trial lasts around 100 days, while some go above and beyond with a yearlong trial offer. During your trial period, you can use the mattress at home to make sure it\u2019s a good fit. Just keep in mind some brands require you to sleep on it for at least 30 nights before initiating a return.\nMost memory foam mattresses come with at least a 10-year warranty, but some have policies that last a lifetime. While we don\u2019t recommend that you sleep on the same mattress your whole life, a long warranty speaks to a bed\u2019s craftsmanship and a brand\u2019s confidence. And keep in mind, warranties cover only manufacturer defects and not regular wear and tear.\nOther Memory Foam Mattresses We\u2019ve Tested\nWe\u2019ve tested over 100 memory foam. While these options didn\u2019t make the cut for our final list, they have features that some sleepers can appreciate.\n- Casper One Mattress review: Casper\u2019s newest all-foam mattress is excellent at limiting motion transfer while still being easy to move around on. Because of these qualities, it\u2019s a good pick for couples and combination sleepers. However, it\u2019s not the most pressure-relieving memory foam mattress.\n- Bear Original Mattress review: The Bear Original is a truly firm memory foam mattress with a dense, lifted feel that slightly contours under your curves once your body warms up the foams. You can also upgrade to a special Celliant cover, which the brand says is designed to help with temperature regulation and sleep quality. But with just one firmness option (best suited for back or stomach sleepers) and minimal extra features, it wasn't as strong as our top choices above.\n- Puffy Mattress review: This mattress is plush with a medium-firm feel that can suit a wide variety of sleepers. While the bed performed well overall, it was short on edge support when compared to other mattresses we tested."

      "text": "While the average price of a queen-size mattress hovers around the $1,500 mark, it is possible to find a high-quality mattress for less. After testing dozens of beds over a five-year period, we found the seven best mattresses under $1,000 that provide a similar caliber of support, comfort and durability as pricier beds. The DreamCloud Hybrid Mattress impressed us the most: its cashmere cover and premium seven-layer construction compete with some of the most luxurious mattresses we\u2019ve tried.\nThe DreamCloud isn\u2019t the only mattress under $1,000 that wowed us during testing; we found six other beds worthy of praise, including an option for side sleepers and a cooling pick for those who sleep hot. The beds on our list include materials designed to provide lasting support, plus they each come with generous trial periods, so you can take the time to find the perfect fit. Read on for the best mattresses under $1,000 that meet a variety of sleep needs.\nContains more layers than an average hybrid mattress\nLuxurious cashmere cover\nExcellent support and pressure relief\nCons:\nNot ideal for sleepers who want a sink-in feel\nWhile the DreamCloud Hybrid is conveniently priced under $1,000 when on sale, we recommend this mattress to a variety of sleepers, regardless of your budget. It\u2019s featured on several of our best lists, including the best hybrid mattresses and the best medium-firm mattresses, mainly for its balanced, medium-firm feel and high-quality construction. Typically, the more affordable a mattress is, the more basic of a construction it has. That\u2019s not the case with the DreamCloud Hybrid: it contains seven dynamic layers, including four layers of memory foam and a sturdy base of individually wrapped coils. The result? A mattress that provides a lifted, hotel-style feel while also cradling your joints and contouring to your curves.\nDuring testing, it performed especially well in key areas like spinal alignment, pressure relief and motion isolation, making it a good choice for couples, too. We also love its tufted cashmere cover\u2014a feature typically only found in pricier beds. However, we don\u2019t recommend this mattress to people looking for a sink-in memory foam feel; you\u2019re better off looking for an all-foam mattress, like the Nectar Classic.\nWhat our sleep experts say: \u201cThe DreamCloud Hybrid has a supportive feel that I associate with quality materials,\u201d says senior mattress and sleep editor Bridget Chapman. \u201cIt also has a touch of plushness that makes it really comfortable for back and stomach sleeping in particular, and it tested well for isolating motion.\u201d\nBest Memory Foam Mattress Under $1,000\nClassic Sink-In Feel For Excellent Pressure Relief\nMedium-firm feel is a great compromise for couples\nGreat motion isolation and pressure relief\nExcellent warranty and sleep trial\nCons:\nOnly available in one firmness option\nNectar offers some of the best mattresses you can get for an affordable price, and the Nectar Classic is our top recommendation for fans of memory foam. It contains three foam layers total: an 8-inch base layer that provides stability and support, a 3-inch middle layer that helps with responsiveness (preventing any sort of excessive body-hugging feel) and a 1-inch top layer that contours to your body. Its cover also features cooling fibers to help decrease heat retention\u2014a common issue with older memory foam beds.\nNectar rates it a 6.5 out of 10 on the firmness scale, which puts it at a medium-firm. This makes it a great option for side and back sleepers, plus it\u2019s a nice middle ground for couples with different preferences. Read more in our full Nectar Mattress review.\nWhat our sleep experts say: \u201cAlong with doing a great job isolating motion, the Nectar Classic tested surprisingly well for edge support for an all-foam bed\u2014making it a nice pick for a lot of couples,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cIt features a memory foam feel without too much doughy sinkage. I think it\u2019s a great value for a lot of sleepers.\u201d\nSide sleepers have a specific set of criteria when it comes to a mattress, namely ample pressure relief for the shoulder and hip and overall spinal alignment. The Nolah Original is a 10-inch foam mattress that fulfills this criteria, plus you can frequently find it on sale for less than $1,000. It\u2019s made with the brand\u2019s proprietary AirFoam, a memory foam alternative. According to Nolah, the material dissipates heat 20% faster, is up to 300 times more durable and has four times the pressure relief of traditional memory foam. Although we can\u2019t prove those claims, our tester found it to sleep cool and offer stellar pressure relief, as detailed in our full Nolah Mattress review. In the Nolah Original, the AirFoam is zoned for more flexibility around the shoulders and greater support in the lumbar and hips, making the mattress particularly well-suited to side sleepers.\nThe four-layer mattress has a middle-of-the-road firmness that balances cushioning comfort with proper support. It also has Greenguard Gold and CertiPUR-US certifications, indicating a high level of safety\u2014plus it\u2019s fiberglass-free.\nWhat our sleep experts say: \u201cI found the Nolah Original to have a dense memory foam feel that slowly contours to your body to relieve pressure points,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cKeep in mind it may feel firmer at first, and it doesn\u2019t have the best edge support compared to hybrid mattresses.\"\nAs supportive and durable as higher-caliber hybrids\nChoice of firmness and a pillow top\nSleeps cool\nCons:\nSome customers complain the middle begins to cave in\nIt can be difficult to find a queen-size hybrid for under $1,000 because the overall cost of materials is higher. The Brooklyn Bedding Signature actually retails for $1,332, but the company regularly offers sales that bring it down to under $1,000. It combines an 8-inch layer of individually wrapped coils with two foam comfort layers: a 1-inch layer of transition foam that alleviates pressure in deeper compression areas like the shoulders and hips and a 1.5-inch layer of hyper-elastic memory foam that quickly responds to movement. If you like the pressure-relieving abilities of memory foam but prefer to feel like you\u2019re lying on top of your bed rather than sinking into it, this bed is a great choice for you. It\u2019s more responsive than all-foam mattresses, but the coils still minimize motion transfer\u2014so it\u2019s not as bouncy as innerspring mattresses, making it a good fit for couples.\nThe Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid comes in three firmness levels: soft, medium and firm. We recommend the soft model for side sleepers who prefer a plusher feel. The medium works well for back, side and combo sleepers, while the firm is best suited for stomach sleepers, some back sleepers and people with back pain. If you\u2019re looking for extra plushness and cooling, you can also add a cooling pillow top for about $300. You can learn more in our in-depth Brooklyn Bedding Signature Mattress review.\nWhat our sleep experts say: \u201cThis is a really high-quality option compared to other budget buys online,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cI found it to be responsive and to have solid edge support. The medium model felt medium-firm to me and was especially comfortable for back and stomach sleeping.\u201d\nBrooklyn Bedding is one of our favorite mattress brands for a variety of reasons, mainly because of its commitment to designing high-quality, durable mattresses. For hot sleepers in need of an affordable cooling option, it doesn\u2019t get much better than the CopperFlex Pro Hybrid. Outfitted with a cool-to-the-touch cover, the CopperFlex Pro contains three dense layers of foam followed by an individually wrapped coil base. One of the foam layers is also infused with copper, which can help break up heat retention. All of these elements work together to promote maximum airflow, resulting in cooler, more comfortable rest.\nBeyond its cooling abilities, the CopperFlex Pro is also very supportive. Our testers found it falls in the medium to medium-firm ballpark, making it a great choice for back, side and lightweight stomach sleepers. However, we did find its edge support to be lacking. If that\u2019s important to you, the DreamCloud Hybrid or Brooklyn Bedding Signature would be a better choice, both of which also sleep fairly cool.\nWhat our sleep experts say: \"Out of the CopperFlex line of mattresses, we found the CopperFlex Pro Hybrid to have an airier and more responsive feel than the all-foam models,\" says Chapman. \u201cThis makes it a good pick for combination sleepers and anyone who doesn\u2019t want to sink too deeply into their mattress.\u201d\nCooling cover available for added temperature regulation\nCons:\nNot as durable as hybrid options\nToo firm for most side sleepers\nFor those who prefer a truly firm mattress, finding one that consistently delivers on support without feeling overly rigid can be a challenge. Many mattresses marketed as firm end up being closer to medium-firm, but this flippable option offers two firmness levels: firm and extra-firm. Both sides are designed to provide the type of support necessary for maintaining a neutral spine position.\nDuring our testing, we found this mattress keeps you well-supported with a lifted feel, avoiding the sinking sensation that some foam beds tend to have. The firm side offers solid support, while the extra-firm side is one of the firmest we\u2019ve come across, making it ideal for sleepers who need even more durability. The Plank also tested well for motion isolation, ease of movement and edge support\u2014impressive for an all-foam mattress. While it\u2019s not the coolest mattress on its own, you can upgrade to a cooling cover\u2014a feature that\u2019s worth it in our experience if you sleep hot.\nWhat our sleep experts say: Chapman says, \u201cThis is one of the firmest mattresses I\u2019ve ever tested. I didn\u2019t feel any sinkage while lying on the extra-firm side, and it was very minimal on the less-firm side. The thick cover does provide a little cushion so you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re sleeping on a rock, though. It tested really well for edge support, which is great for those who like to sit or snooze near the edge of the bed.\u201d\nPriced under $500 for a queen-size, the Siena Memory Foam is the most affordable bed on our list. Made of three layers of CertiPur-US-certified foam, the base is dense and firm, while the upper gel memory foam layer relives pressure along sensitive joints. Due to the combination of support and comfort layers, we found it works well for most back, stomach and combination sleepers, as well as couples with different sleep styles. During testing, we also noticed that it has less sinkage than other memory foam mattresses, such as the Nectar Premier\u2014a softer, doughier version of the Nectar Classic.\nAnother pro couples, the Siena Memory Foam Mattress tested well for motion isolation, meaning you can move around on one side of the bed without disturbing your partner on the other side. However, we don\u2019t recommend this mattress to hot sleepers; due to its dense foam construction, it isn\u2019t as cooling as hybrid mattresses. Instead, we recommend hot sleepers consider two hybrids on this list, the Brooklyn Bedding Signature or CopperFlex Pro.\nWhat our sleep experts say: \u201cFor a medium-firm mattress I\u2019m surprised at how well it conformed under my hips and shoulders. There is a good amount of give where it contours around my curves and doesn\u2019t push back against my joints,\u201d says sleep and mattress editor McKenzie Dillon.\nSenior strategy editor Katie Simpson, who is the author of this piece, has five years of experience testing mattresses, including several of the beds on this list.\nSenior mattress and sleep editor Bridget Chapman and mattress and sleep editor McKenzie Dillon are certified sleep science coaches who have collectively tested over 120 mattresses, including every mattress on this list.\nThis list is regularly reviewed to ensure freshness and accuracy. It was last updated in April 2025 by mattress and sleep updates writer Alex Garrett to add the Siena Memory Foam mattress to this list. Garrett has tested more than three dozen mattresses, including several of our winners in this guide.\nHow We Chose The Best Mattresses Under $1,000\nWhen selecting the best mattresses under $1,000, we relied on our testing background and thorough research.\nWe relied on our own expertise to find the best mattresses in general, then narrowed our list by price to identify potential contenders. All of the mattresses on this list are priced under $1,000 when on sale.\nBecause sleep is individual and inherently personal, we recommended mattresses for all sleep styles and included options in a variety of firmnesses, thicknesses and materials. We also considered return policies, warranties and firsthand experiences, so you can feel confident about your investment.\nWe read through hundreds of customer ratings to make sure each of our recommendations earned at least a 4 out of 5-star rating.\nWhat To Consider When Shopping For The Best Mattresses Under $1,000\nRegardless of the price range, the best mattress is one that accommodates your personal sleep style and preferences. Beyond budget, here\u2019s what to keep in mind as you shop.\nMattress Type\nMattresses come in various constructions, all with their own pros and cons. Dr. Eva Lassey, P.T. says, \u201cA steel coil and foam construction can offer a good balance of support and pressure relief. Memory foam and latex are popular choices as they form to the body\u2019s shape and help maintain spinal alignment.\u201d Here is a breakdown of the best and most common mattress types, including materials recommended by Lassey.\nMemory foam: All-foam mattresses made with poly foams tend to be among the least expensive options because the materials are easier to produce. These mattresses are generally best suited to light- and average-weight sleepers, who should find enough support to sleep comfortably. The best memory foam mattresses contour to your body, relieve pressure and isolate motion well so you don\u2019t awake to your partner\u2019s movements or your dog jumping on your bed in the middle of the night. They also give you a feeling of sinking into the mattress, rather than lying on top.\nHybrid:Hybrid mattresses tend to offer more support thanks to their innerspring coil layer. The combination of coils and comfort materials, such as latex and foam, means a higher price tag, but often improves performance life.\nLatex:Latex mattresses are generally among the most expensive type of mattress you can buy. This material adds an increased level of durability and pressure relief, but it\u2019s also heavy and has a bouncy feel that may not appeal to all sleepers. Latex is considered a more environmentally-friendly material than synthetic products such as memory foam.\nInnerspring:Innerspring mattresses have the most traditional construction, combining coils with very thin comfort layers, and are often priced on the lower end of the spectrum. Innerspring mattresses tend to be breathable, responsive and extra supportive.\nSleeping Position\nYour dominant sleep position is a key consideration when looking for a new mattress. \u201cA good sleeping position maintains your spine's natural curvature, which helps protect your spinal cord and distribute weight across your body,\u201d says Dr. Samantha Parker Lane, M.D. at Memorial Hermann Health System. Back, side and stomach sleepers all benefit from specific feels and firmnesses to ensure proper support and comfort. Back sleepers typically do best with a medium-firm mattress and gentle contouring that keeps the spine supported. Side sleepers should consider a softer mattress that doesn\u2019t create pressure buildup in the hips and shoulders while still maintaining a neutral spine. Stomach sleepers need firmer support to keep their hips elevated. Otherwise, they run the risk of lower back pain in the morning.\nSupport And Durability\nDelivering support is the primary purpose of your mattress, not just in the first few weeks, but ideally for the next seven to ten years. Material choice and mattress construction can give you a good idea of how much support you can expect\u2014and for how long.\nTrial Period, Returns And Warranty Policies\nThe best test of a new mattress is sleeping on it for about a month, which gives your body sufficient time to adjust. Most mattress companies offer reasonable sleep trials precisely for this purpose, but it\u2019s a good idea to scan the fine print in the event a mattress doesn\u2019t work out and you need to return it. Take a look at the warranty, too. Lifetime warranties may sound ironclad, but most of them have qualifiers that limit coverage.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nThe lifespan of a mattress, whether it\u2019s priced under $1,000 or not, is primarily determined by the quality of the materials used. Most mattresses that cost $1,000 or less are either made entirely from foam or a combination of foam and coils. A hybrid mattress that costs $1,000 should last you at least seven to 10 years, while an all-foam mattress at the same price point may only last five to seven years. This is because memory foam tends to deteriorate quicker over time, unless it\u2019s made with high-density foam which tends to be higher quality and longer lasting.\nMost quality mattresses start at $1,000 for a queen size. While you can certainly spend more if you\u2019re looking for a bed with higher-end features, most mattresses in the $1,000 price range are made of quality materials. Anything significantly under $1,000\u2014think $500 or less\u2014is likely lower quality and therefore not expected to last you as long or able to provide adequate support.\nWe recommend spending at least $600 to $1,000 on a queen-size bed if you want a quality mattress; any bed above this price point typically only gets better in terms of overall quality and features.\nWe added the Siena Memory Foam Mattress to our list of winners. We also expanded our buyer\u2019s guide to include information on how to discern quality materials in mattresses under $1,000."
