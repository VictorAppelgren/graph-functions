      "feedback": "Strong macro-grounding and explicit regime framing are the draft’s core strengths, but to reach world-class quality you should tighten the Movers to a clean, first-principles, scenario-driven quartet and shore up the numeric anchoring and citations. Actionable edits: (1) Make the Movers & Scenarios exactly 4 lines, 2 Up and 2 Down, each line with a single dominant driver and a one‑to‑two‑item “What to watch” bundle; map each line to a regime transition (Up lines should reflect Regime A→B easing risk-on dynamics; Down lines should reflect Regime B→C risk-on fading or Regime C risk-off) and keep time windows strictly formatted (0–3 weeks, 4–8 weeks, 0–3 weeks, 3–6 months). (2) Anchor probabilities to explicit evidence only; for the first Up line, use 87% (CME odds for a September cut) with (WC68LCU9R); for other lines either derive anchored, cited numbers (e.g., cited liquidity/credit-flow signals from OGK8WLL69, OBQMETU6O, V9HASRVZA) or replace with clearly labeled “Moderate”/“Low” without numeric gaps, but avoid unanchored 60%, 25%, or 40% without sources. (3) Sharpen first-principles causal chain: each mover should start with regime state, specify the policy/financial conditions channel, and end with a concrete asset-price or sector implication; avoid mixing multiple catalysts (e.g., policy, crypto, AI infra) in a single line unless you explicitly tie them to a single mechanism. (4) Tighten the “What to watch” items to 1–2 bullets tied to observable triggers and provide exact in-text IDs after each factual claim; ensure all numeric claims (private-credit ~$50B/quarter, CMBS exposure ~$15.6B, Bitmine ETH $45M, yields 4.26%/3.68%, etc.) are followed by their source IDs and that no conflicts remain unresolved across OGK8WLL69, OBQMETU6O, V9HASRVZA, WC68LCU9R, Y6SQOEK69, and related items. (5) Reconcile the base-case vs alt-path framing by adding a concise, one-line Alt-path note per mover if a plausible conflict exists, and move broader 3–regime analysis to a dedicated background section to preserve the required four-line Movers. (6) For the Swing Trade/Outlook plan, keep it strictly tradable; ensure the line follows the required field order, uses an anchored Trigger (e.g., Powell signal or a concrete level/ratio with a cited source), and ties Probability and Confidence to explicit evidence rather than ad hoc judgments; remove any non‑anchored probabilities from the plan or accompany them with a cited basis. (7) Finally, prune the prose so the full piece adheres to the horizon/style constraints, keeps the focus on 4 crisp lines plus a short Outlook, and avoids extraneous macro-narratives in the Movers block; this will yield a coherent, testable, source-aligned Swing Trade/Outlook.",
