  "description": "Homescreen Heroes: RoadTrippers takes all the stress and complication out of planning holiday trips",
  "content": "It\u2019s been nine years since I visited New Zealand for a once-in-a-lifetime holiday with my wife and son. We planned the adventure with input from family members, friends who had visited the country, and a few natives dotted around the country itself. Despite all this wealth of knowledge and lived experience, the three-week trip still took the best part of a year to plan.\n\nThe trip ended up being absolutely incredible, thanks for asking, but the complication of planning everything could easily have derailed the whole experience. We may have even decided not to travel on account of the logistical challenges.\n\nSince returning, I\u2019ve discovered an app that I wish I\u2019d known about during the planning stage of our trip. It\u2019s called , and it functions as a planner that creates a detailed breakdown and itinerary that you can use to keep things on track as you navigate around a new place.\n\nThese types of planners are not for everyone, and I appreciate that you could argue that it takes some of the fun out of the potentially enjoyable part of investigating options and making plans. But, if you\u2019re happy putting your trip into the hands of an app, then there\u2019s nothing better than RoadTrippers. Let\u2019s dive in and see whether this app will revolutionize your next holiday.\n\nThe very first step after launching the RoadTrippers app is to enter your start location, followed by an end destination. Nothing novel so far. From there, you have the choice to either plan the trip yourself or let RoadTrippers plan it for you, thanks to, you guessed it, AI.\n\nTo begin with, I wanted to try out the standard functionality, so I decided to plan a trip myself. RoadTrippers quickly presents the itinerary as a list of waypoints, each of which is editable, meaning you can add specific information, including arrival dates, spending budget while at each place, and even hotel reservation numbers. This functionality does away with any need for carrying lots of documents while you\u2019re traveling. Happy times.\n\nAfter setting the from and to locations, as well as adding any other specific waypoints, you\u2019re now ready to add in other stops, including restaurants, bars, activities, fuel stops, and more. You might want to add places you already know about or that friends have recommended, but it\u2019s also possible to search along your route within a set deviation distance. For those like me, who love to explore places and make stops along routes, this is a fantastic feature.\n\nWhile planning stops, it\u2019s possible to delve deeper into each stop location with details including websites, opening times, and addresses, and you can even see the location\u2019s Yelp star rating. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not possible to read these reviews within the app, which is probably my biggest bugbear from my overall RoadTrippers experience.\n\nFinally, you can add trip collaborators, which is a fantastic feature if you\u2019re traveling with family members or friends. Each person can be given different privileges, so if you\u2019d like someone else to join you on your \u2018planning committee,\u2019 then that\u2019s possible too.\n\nManual trip planning is all well and good, but if you don\u2019t have the time or inclination, then the new Autopilot feature built right into the heart of the app is going to be your new best friend. All you have to do is enter your from and to locations, answer a few simple questions, and Autopilot will generate a personalized itinerary.\n\nRoadTrippers will take your answers, make cross-references with over 38 million trips that real travelers have made, and present you with options that you can then further customize to your heart\u2019s content. I was doubtful at first, but it is really quite good. I found it perfect for those parts of my trip where I was done with making decisions and just wanted someone (or something) else to take control.\n\nWith the trip all set up and personalized, you\u2019ll want to turn on notifications for the app. That way, you\u2019ll receive trip information and essential updates and get directions.\n\nTake control of your next road trip\n\nRoadTrippers is one of the best trip planning apps around, but if you want the full benefits, it\u2019ll cost you $59.99 a year. The Premium subscription gives you access to Autopilot and other features, which I\u2019d argue you really need to make having the app worthwhile.\n\nThe app is only available for planning trips in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, so if that applies to you, why not download RoadTrippers on or and try the 7-day free trial?",

Happy road trip planning!\nRatings and Reviews\nGame Changer\nGet the PRO version! You will travel more because it\u2019s so dang easy and enjoyable to plan trips. I think my favorite part about this app is that I can zoom in along my route and little icons pop up of everything in that area. It quickly loads so I can make the outline of my trip and then add in stopping points along the way. If I click on a point, it pops up 1 screen that has everything I need to know: ratings, photos, website, and details. Once my trip is planned, I can click on that same point and see the navigation, phone number, website, details, reservation number, arrival date, and budget all on one screen. SO DANG SIMPLE & EASY. I will say, the PRO version is well worth the money. I do wish it was available to Family Sharing, however if a PRO member starts a trip and adds you as a collaborator, you are able to add unlimited stops even if you don\u2019t have PRO yourself. The only other thing I wish this app had is the addition of a small notes section in each stop :) But really, minor things and I would still recommend this app to anyone who wants to travel more but struggles or stresses about the trip planning. Best app I\u2019ve used in a long time.\nDeveloper Response ,\nThank you for this awesome review! We love to hear that you find Roadtrippers so dang useful! We noticed you asked for waypoint notes... we have that ability! Open any waypoint to reach details and scroll down - you'll see a section where you can add notes, reservation number, etc! We love hearing that you find collaboration useful too! Thank for sharing this review - and happy travels!\nGood app, not great\nThis is a really good app. Definitely recommend it. Mostly an easy way to put a trip together, plan stops, construct a map. I would give it 5 stars except for a few very frustrating things that drag this app down. And could easily be fixed. I do understand that maybe it\u2019s user error, but \u2026 When you are on a trip, you open the trip and it goes to your current location in Map View. However, when you open the List View for that trip, why doesn\u2019t it go to your current location instead of starting from day one and you have to scroll all the way down until you find what you\u2019re looking for. The way dates are managed is a complete nightmare. Changing the dates of an entire trip is such a hassle. And you cannot plan a trip without dates as once you add your first date, the app puts every single waypoint on a separate date!! Who thought that was a good idea?! You can add things that are not on the map already, but you can only add an address, you cannot label the address as to what it is. There are a lot of things that are not included on the map that I would like to add to my trips. And label with a name. This app is not a standalone app. You need other sources to complete the picture. Especially because there is a blue line indicating your route that completely covers up the highway numbers. Highway numbers are essential to trip planning. Also, can you update the gas pricing? It\u2019s no where near accurate. And organize the trips into past and upcoming/future?\nDeveloper Response ,\nWe appreciate your detailed feedback, and appreciate that you think it's a really good app - even if you only gave us 3 stars. We understand the frustration with current location display and the challenges with managing trip dates and have documented that feedback. The route line issue you are reporting has been fixed - so please do make sure you are using the most recent version of Roadtrippers if you're still experiencing this! We're constantly working to enhance user experiences and will share your insights with our team.\nLove RoadTrippers App!\nLove Roadtrippers; was introduced to RoadTrippers at the start of our FullTime RV life and toured the US, driving 13,000 miles from east coast all the way to Pacific NW! I used RT with every stop, read all reviews and looked at all photos, used Waze mapping THROUGH ROADTRIPPERS and loved how organized it kept me! I still look at it almost daily even though we have slowed down with our travels. I like that it routes us, gives accurate drive times, kept us from low bridges, shares links for reservations! I love the RoadTrippers app! You'll see distance and approximate time of arrival, features of our stops and an overall map view, which I love! RoadTrippers made a software change about a year ago that altered the way I used the app. They now allow you to put in a date, but it reroutes you. I do NOT WANT MY ROUTE altered so adding the date messed up my map. I am creating a coffee table book of our adventures and like to have the date included in this app for reference, but I have to put it in the notes section because I do not want my map rerouted for shortest distances. Sometimes we had to go places to meet up with family and therefore our map may not have been the shortest route.\nDeveloper Response ,\nHi there, thank you for leaving a review! We're so happy to hear that our app was a part of your international tour! :) We hope you have some more adventures planned for the year.

      "text": "'We created a new Airbnb' \u2013 here's what the app's big redesign means for how you travel and where you stay\nAirbnb wants to be part of your daily life, not just your vacations\nAirbnb\u2019s redesign, and its push into enabling users to Airbnb more than just a vacation spot or getaway, has been out for a few weeks now. The idea is that you\u2019ll Airbnb more than just a lovely cottage on a beach \u2013 also turning to the service, for example, when you want to experience a city that\u2019s close to home or add some adventure to your trip abroad.\nWe\u2019ve already broken down the additions, including the launch of Experiences and Services, as well as the new look for the app. It all feels a lot sleeker, with visuals that adjust on the fly, a mini social network, and a passport of sorts that saves all the information from your trip. So, if you have a favorite spot, you can easily share it with a friend. It all feels very material.\nHere we're taking a look under the hood and finding out how Airbnb is making the app work better for you. The company has rebuilt its entire tech stack for the app and the service as a whole, meaning you'll find easier navigation with three choices at the top: Homes, Experiences, and Services.\nFurthermore, there's a redesigned profile that makes it easier for you to take a look back and even reconnect with people you've had experiences with. The rebuilding effort enables what's already launched, while also setting Airbnb up for the future, a note that Jud Coplan, VP of Product Marketing at Airbnb, shared with TechRadar.\n\u201cOne of the huge benefits of rebuilding the architecture and rethinking, really, the infrastructure of the app was that we created something that can expand beyond the 10 categories of services.\u201d Coplan told me.\nHe was referencing the 10 that currently exist \u2013 chefs, photographers, massages, spa treatments, personal training, hair treatments, makeup, nails, prepared meals, and catering \u2013 but hinted that expansion is very possible, adding, \u201cWe've created a new Airbnb that can go even beyond what we've been talking about today.\u201d\nThat could mean we see grocery deliveries integrated, so you can be well stocked when you arrive at your Airbnb to make dinner, or maybe that even means you can order directly to your home.\nIt\u2019s really an expansion of the platform to book these services, whether you\u2019re in your home city or on a trip. Coplan told me how his family had booked an experience in their home city of San Francisco, a kind of a staycation excursion.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe 10 aforementioned options are further themed by activity, such as cooking, city walks, learning a new skill, and even more exclusive ones featuring celebrities.\nDuring the keynote, Airbnb\u2019s CEO, Brian Chesky, highlighted the importance of people, noting that it\u2019s real folks who are experts offering these experiences and services, and it\u2019s real people offering up their homes, lofts, or apartments for Airbnb.\nThere is an element of AI being used here, one example being an AI-powered photo tour, as Coplan explained. \u201cFor homes, if you upload all your photos, we recognize them, we organize them, we present them really nicely,\u201d all with the aim of making the listing easier and theoretically helping to encourage more bookings. There are also quick replies powered by AI, in which, for a host, the app will automatically suggest a response that could be sent.\nFor services and experiences, the two new offerings from Airbnb utilize AI to recommend what you might find most appealing. It bases this off of \u201cwhere they are in their journey, their past bookings, their current trip, what they've told us about in their profile,\u201d explained Coplan.\nLastly on AI, Coplan also shared that Airbnb began rolling out an AI assistant for customer service in the US in English, \u201cthat allows people to do is have a natural language conversation with customer service and get answers to questions really easily.\u201d It\u2019ll be interesting to see how this performs, and what feedback users provide.\nOn the app\u2019s new look and flow, it was clear that Coplan and the team at Airbnb focused on the human element, emphasizing that what one can book is all tied back to a real person. He noted that the color palette, animations, and dimensionality all tie back to the real world, giving a sense of what you might experience.\nEven more interesting, and maybe hinting at Airbnb\u2019s future, is the community aspect. \u201cWe didn't want this to be a place where you have followers, where you meet people online,\u201d explained Coplan. \u201cThe people you see are people that you know from the real world, and so that connections page within your profile, those are people you've traveled with and those are people you've met on your experiences.\u201d\nIt\u2019s certainly a unique approach and a more intentional one, rooted in a shared experience. Now, it\u2019s entirely opt-in, and there are privacy controls that allow you to turn off this community aspect.\nSeparate from the community, but also housed within the profile, is a sort of passport-like experience, allowing you to look back at where you\u2019ve been and easily share details. Much like a card in Apple Wallet, it has a shimmer and shine effect when you move your phone around.\nWhile Airbnb\u2019s main event is its annual summer release, and that\u2019s done with for 2025, I suspect we\u2019ll hear more from it sooner than a year from now, and I\u2019m intrigued to see just how far the tech stack can go. For now, I\u2019m on the hunt for an experience to try.\nYou might also like\nJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

      "text": "This is the one travel app I can't afford to forget\nHomescreen Heroes: Google Translate is the best in the business at translating text, images, and documents\nOver the years, I\u2019ve traveled to numerous countries, including France, Spain, Serbia, Poland, and China. I\u2019ve always been diligent in filling my suitcase with the necessary clothes, toiletries, and snacks, but I\u2019ve been equally thoughtful about which apps are installed on my phone.\nOne of the apps that I forget at my peril is Google Translate. I can speak a little bit of French, Spanish, and Mandarin, but beyond that, my grasp of foreign languages is pretty much nonexistent. I\u2019ll try my best in shops and restaurants, but it takes me an inordinate amount of time to read menus, check labels, and communicate with locals on a level they\u2019ll understand.\nIt is for these reasons that I\u2019m absolutely indebted to Google Translate. Not only has the app gotten me out of and through some tricky situations, but it\u2019s also made traveling through foreign countries so much more enjoyable.\nThis is part of a regular series of articles exploring the apps that we couldn't live without. Read them all here.\nNow, I\u2019m sure the app needs no introduction, but I wonder if you\u2019re using it to its full potential. You might know that it can translate text you type into the engine, but did you know that it can also translate images, websites, and even whole documents? This is one of the best translation apps around, and if you\u2019re holidaying in a foreign country this summer, then I highly recommend downloading it.\nTranslating text with ease\nAt the heart of the app is a text translation service. With support for over 130 different languages, you\u2019re bound to find the translation help you need in whatever country you find yourself in. All you have to do is type your text into the box, and Google will effortlessly translate it for you. It\u2019ll even do the hard work of detecting the language that you\u2019ve typed.\nThe app will translate as you type, which means you\u2019ll benefit from real-time updates rather than having to wait till you\u2019ve finished typing a whole section. This is ideal if time is of the essence and you need to make yourself understood sooner rather than later.\nIn reality, I don\u2019t make much use of manually typing my requests in because Google Translate has an unbelievably good voice dictation feature that can accurately translate spoken words and phrases. I find this to be so much quicker than relying on my fingers!\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThis feature can also be used to translate spoken words from a foreign language into words you\u2019ll understand. So, if you\u2019re getting a tour guide in a native language, interacting with a waiter, or trying to check into your hotel, just make sure your phone can hear their voice, and the app will do the rest.\nTranslating images like a pro\nAside from text translation, I have found the app\u2019s ability to translate text in images the most useful feature. I\u2019ve used this to bring meaning to menus, road signs, books, labels, accessibility instructions, and more. This feature has been invaluable at those times when I\u2019ve either been physically lost or unable to properly access or travel through a space.\nThe feature can be used in two different ways. The first is to instantly translate whatever you point your phone camera at. The second is to translate the text that is contained within a previously captured photo.\nThe camera option is useful for on-the-go translation. If you turn up at a venue or park and you\u2019re presented with a map or set of instructions, then being able to simply point your camera at the sign and see the foreign words change to English (in my case) is an absolute lifesaver. The fact that these are overlaid on top of the image your camera is capturing makes you feel like you\u2019re accessing the space in a very similar way to all the natives.\nTranslating text in an image is helpful at those times when a friend sends you a photo or when you don\u2019t need to take in the translated information at that specific point in time. The functionality works very similarly to the camera option in that it overlays the translated text on top of the original.\nFree translation at your fingertips\nGoogle Translate is 100% free, which is incredible given the features and quality that it delivers. If you\u2019d like to explore other alternatives, then you could take a look at either DeepL, Reverso, or Yandex. These offer very similar functionality, but in my experience, Google Translate provides the best user experience for everyday users.\nGoogle Translate also has the largest language database, supporting over 130 languages. This is significantly more than any of their competitors. If you\u2019re traveling to countries or regions with less common languages, then Google\u2019s offering should serve you best.\nSo, if you\u2019re traveling somewhere soon, why not give it a try?

      "text": "Can an AI travel agent remove the stress of vacation booking? I tried three to find out\nI hate booking vacations. For some, I'm sure it's an exciting process that's all part of the fun; for me, it's anything but. Endless hours of research, figuring out transit between activities and parsing through countless customer reviews sounds a bit too close than the day-to-day logistics of my job, so I'll take any opportunity to lighten the load.\nTypically, that involves me going on a lot of guided tours and package holidays. But for my most recent vacation, I wanted to try something a little different \u2013 enter AI.\nAs part of our latest video series 'AI planned it', as you might guess, we allowed AI to decide everything from our destination to our itinerary; we even took AI on vacation with us in the form of three flagship phones; the iPhone 16 Pro, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Google Pixel 9 Pro.\nWatch the full episode below.\nAs part of our testing, we used three very different AI travel agents to help us book our activities.\nFirst up was TripAdvisor, a known name in online travel booking with a sprawling database of customer travel reviews. Said data comes in pretty handy when it comes to TripAdvisor's AI assistant, providing the backbone of the service that uses OpenAI's generative AI technology to deliver customized itineraries for travelers.\nNext up was Vacay, which also uses OpenAI's GPT models to deliver personalized itineraries; it doesn't seem as though they have trained the AI much with their own acquired data, but it's a fun free option that offers a broader range of formats and interfaces for planning your vacation compared to TripAdvisor.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nLastly, we used Layla.AI, the only paid option in our experiment. It's challenging to find what models underpin Layla, with data fed in from Skyscanner and Booking.com.\nWhen it actually came to testing, the differences between these platforms became even more stark; and not just because Layla.AI ended up disappointing despite requiring a subscription to even try the platform. Of course, you'll have to watch the full video to find out why...\nYou might also like...\nJosephine Watson (@JosieWatson) is TechRadar's Managing Editor - Lifestyle.
