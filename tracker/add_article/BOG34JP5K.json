      "title": "Normal Computing tapes out the world's first thermodynamic chip for AI and scientific computing",
      "summary": "Normal Computing has taped out CN101, the world’s first thermodynamic computing chip that uses natural noise and stochastic dynamics to solve AI and scientific workloads up to 1,000× more efficiently than conventional silicon. The chip, built on a Carnot architecture, encodes problems in the interactions of silicon‑based resonators, letting the system settle into equilibrium to produce solutions for tasks such as matrix inversion and Gaussian sampling. Normal plans to scale this approach with CN201 in 2026 for high‑resolution diffusion models and CN301 by 2028 for large‑scale video diffusion, aiming to complement CPUs, GPUs, and quantum processors in data centers. The technology promises significant energy‑efficiency gains, potentially transforming how large‑scale AI inference and scientific simulations are performed. The company’s founders, veterans of Google Brain, X, and Palantir, emphasize a future where specialized physics‑based ASICs match each computation to the most appropriate hardware paradigm.",
