  "description": "The mayor disputed Trump\u2019s justification for declaring a crime emergency, noting that crime has been trending down in the city after spiking in 2023.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s move to assert control over Washington D.C.\u2019s police force is \"unsettling and unprecedented\" the city\u2019s mayor said, while also indicating she will cooperate with federal authorities.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser disputed Trump\u2019s justification for declaring a crime emergency in her city calling it a subjective \u201cso-called emergency\u201d and noting that the capital's crime rate has been trending down after a post-pandemic increase that peaked in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not experiencing a spike in crime but a decrease in crime,\u201d Bowser said during an Aug. 11 press conference following Trump\u2019s announcement earlier in the day, where he initiated a dramatic federal takeover of the city\u2019s police force and also deployed the D.C. National Guard.\n\nYet the mayor acknowledged Trump\u2019s authority under the Home Rule Act, which gives the federal government certain powers over DC governance. Trump cited the law in an executive order declaring he was using emergency powers to seize control of the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\n\u201cThe Home Rule charter requires the mayor to provide the services of MPD during special conditions of an emergency, and we will follow the law,\u201d Bowser said.\n\nPotential legal issues surrounding the federal takeover are \u201cunder review,\u201d Bowser added, but she added that the \u201cplain language\u201d of the Home Rule charter authorizes the president to take certain actions and says \u201cthe mayor shall comply.\u201d\n\nTrump has long criticized Democrat-run D.C. as dangerous and threated to take control of the city, a federal enclave under jurisdiction of the U.S. government. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gave the city local governance, including an elected mayor and city council, but allows for federal intervention.\n\nTrump\u2019s move marks a dramatic escalation from rhetoric to federal control of a major municipal police force. He also is deploying 800 National Guard members.\n\nWhile many Democrats are uneasy about the executive action and call it unjustified, Bowser said there could be benefits.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have more law enforcement presence in neighborhoods, that could be positive,\u201d she said.\n\nThe mayor has taken a less combative approach to Trump during his second term after clashing with him in his first term. Asked if her tenor toward Trump would change with his recent move, Bowser said \u201cmy tenor will be appropriate for what I think is important for the District, and what\u2019s important for the district is that we can take care of our citizens.\u201d\n\nBowser said concerns about Trump\u2019s actions they should be channeled into achieving statehood for DC and obtaining local control over the DC National Guard.",

DOJ also said the District was reporting \u201cthe fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\u201d\nIn 2024, Washington, DC,had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says on police response to protesters: \u2018You spit and we hit\u2019\nPresident Trump issued a stern warning to protesters in Washington, DC, and beyond during his Aug. 11 press briefing where he announced plans to federalize the city's police force and deploy National Guard troops: \u201cYou spit and we hit.\u201d\nIn making the remark, Trump said that he was aware of a recent incident in Navy Yard, a neighborhood located in southeast DC. Police arrested a minor on Aug. 9 who discharged a firearm at a group of teens, according to ABC 7 News.\nNavy Yard has seen other incidents of violence in the past, including fights breaking out among teens and a 25-year-old arrested and charged with assault on a police officer.\n\u201cThey're not going to be fighting back long,\u201d Trump said,\nApparently recalling previous street protests were officers showed restraint against demonstrators, Trump called on officers to use force.\n\u201cThey love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform, they're standing and they're screaming at them an inch away from their face, and then they start spitting in their face. And I said you tell them, \u2018You spit and we hit,'\" Trump said. \u201cAnd they can hit real hard. It's a disgusting thing.\"\n\u2212Sudiksha Kochi\n\u2018Political theater,\u2019 says top Democrat\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sharply criticized President Trump\u2019s takeover of the Washington D.C. police department as \u201cpolitical theater,\u201d and said the nation\u2019s capital doesn\u2019t need it because it\u2019s already reducing violent crime.\n\"What the president did this morning was political theater,\u201d said Durbin, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\u201cHis idea of federalizing the police force of D.C. ignores the reality,\u201d Durbin said at a news conference to discuss the Texas state House Democrats who are boycotting a Trump-backed push to redraw congressional districts.\n\u201cThey are making dramatic progress in reducing violent crime in D.C., so it's a typical move by this president to create chaos and uncertainty, and to draw the attention from other issues like Jeffrey Epstein,\" added Durbin, a longtime Democratic leader who that he will retire and not seek reelection in 2026.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says he's looking at downgrading marijuana\nPresident Donald Trump said his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\"We're looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks,\" Trump said during his Aug. 11 press conference.\nThough 45 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug.\n-Sarah Wire\nTrump longs for completed White House ballroom\nPresident Trump brought up his plans to build a 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the White House to the overflowing room of journalists packed into his Aug. 11 media briefing.\n\u201cI would've certainly loved to have had it today,\" the president said of the construction project that isn't slated to be completed until 2029. \"We would've filled it up.\"\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\nHegseth to 'work with state governors' to use more National Guard troops\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is authorized to \"work with state governors\" to use their states' National Guard troops \"if necessary\" to deploy Washington, D.C., according to Will Scharf, an aide to President Donald Trump.\nHegseth got the green light in the presidential memo that Trump signed directing National Guard troops into Washington, Scharf said. For National Guard troops from states other than the District of Columbia to carry out law enforcement actions, they must be deployed with the consent of their states' governor. - Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nTrump signs executive orders driving DC crackdown\nTrump signed two executive orders earlier in the day as part of his federal crackdown on Washington crime, White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf said.\nOne order invoked Section 40 of the Home Rule Act to allow the Trump administration to take control of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department\nSeparately, Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy National Guard troops in Washington. He said the memorandum also authorized Hegseth to work with governors of other states to utilize their National Guards as well.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nTrump: 800 D.C. National Guard troops will be mobilized\nPresident Donald Trump said 800 troops from the Washington, D.C., National Guard will be mobilized. He said more could be tapped to join them.\n\"If necessary we're going to move servicemembers directly to joining the guardsmen,\" he said.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nTroops will be 'flowing into the streets of Washington'\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Washington, D.C., National Guard was mobilized the morning of August 11 at President Trump's direction.\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming weeks,\" Hegseth said. Hegseth said other National Guard units and \"specialized units\" stood ready.\n\"They will be strong. They will be tough,\" he said.\n\"We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement to ensure this city is safe, this city is beautiful.\"\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n'It\u2019s embarrassing,' Trump says of DC crime before Putin summit\nAs he announced the federal takeover of Washington, D.C., police, Trump said he didn\u2019t want to be talking the subject days before his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\u201cThis is a tragic emergency. And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm gonna see Putin. I'm going to Russia on Friday. I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capitol was with graffiti all over the walls.\u201d\nThe leaders are scheduled to meet on Aug. 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the three-year Russian war on Ukraine, in the first in-person meeting since Trump took office for his second term.\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\nTrump puts new DEA chief in charge of DC police\nTrump announced that Drug Enforcement Administrator Terrance Cole will take over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be designated as the interim federal commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department, okay?\u201d Trump told Cole, standing on the stage with him. \u201cAnd you run them tough, they're good. You have a lot of good people.\u201d\nCole was sworn in as DEA administrator on July 23, following his Senate confirmation.\n-Josh Meyer\nTrump declares public safety emergency, says Bondi will take command of DC police\nTrump said he is declaring a public safety emergency in Washington D.C. and announced Attorney General Pam Bondi will take command of the local Metropolitan Police Department.\nTrump said his new DEA administrator Terry Cole will serve as interim federal commissioner of the police department.\nTrump said he will notify Congress and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser about the moves.\n\u201cThis is an emergency. This is a tragic emergency,\u201d Trump said.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump suggests crime crackdown could extend to other US cities\nTrump seemed to suggest he could later pursue federal intervention to combat crime in places like Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose our cities over this,\u201d Trump said as he railed against what he called rising crime rates. \u201cAnd this will go further. We\u2019re starting very strongly with D.C., and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly.\u201d\nTrump was flanked by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as he gave his remarks.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nTrump says he\u2019s deploying National Guard, taking control of police department\nTrump said he is sending National Guard troops to Washington D.C. and placing Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control to crack down on crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\nTrump cited authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington\u2019s police department.\n\u201cThis is liberation day in D.C.,\" Trump said, touting his moves as \u201chistoric action to rescue our nation from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\u201d\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nSen. Mike Lee: Time to take over DC\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said now is the time for Congress to take control of the city.\n\u201cWe should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,\u201d Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\nThe legislation, dubbed \u201cBringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident\u201d was introduced earlier this year, and was named after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption.\nLee cited an ongoing scandal, for example, involving a D.C. police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats in his district. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime for fear of reprisal.\n\u2212Phillip M. Bailey, Deborah Berry\nWhite House says DC\u2019s murder rate leads other national capitals\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, White House officials handed a chart to reporters in the press briefing room detailing how Washington D.C.\u2019s homicide rate is greater than those of several foreign capitals.\nWith about 27 murders per every 100,000 residents, Washington, D.C., has a higher homicide rate than Bogota, Colombia; Mexico City; Islamabad, Pakistan; Lima, Peru; and Ottawa, Canada, among others, according to the chart.\nEven so, violent crime in Washington D.C. is down 26% in 2025 compared to this time last year. In 2024, Washington, D.C., had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit, at 27.3 per 100,000 residents, a decline of 30.7% from 2023.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump's expected troop deployment recalls 2020 protest crackdown\nPresident Trump's expected announcement that he will send the military onto the streets of the nation's capital recalls his deployment of National Guard troops during his first term to suppress protests sparked by the police murder of George Floyd.\nTrump has threatened a massive crackdown on crime in Washington.\nNational Guard troops mobilized by the president in a \"federalized\" capacity are typically barred from carrying out the functions of law enforcement, but not if they're under state control. In the summer of 2020, Trump brought troops into Washington from other states under the permission of 11 governors \u2212 an unprecedented mobilization of state troops.\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nDemocrats ask: What about Jan. 6?\nAhead of Trump's press conference, Democrats criticized Trump for failing to call in the National Guard during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, while preparing to call in the military now to suppress street crime.\nMore than 1,575 people were charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection. At least 600 were charged with the felony of assaulting or impeding law enforcement, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\u201cRemember January 6, 2021: Why did Trump fail to call out to DC National Guard? Don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s lies,\u201d Donna Brazile, former acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, wrote on X.\nWashington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department.\n-Sudiksha Kochi, Josh Meyer and Zac Anderson\nNo DC crime surge, mayor says\nA spokesman for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to comment ahead of Trump\u2019s news conference.\nBut during an Aug. 10 appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d Bowser pushed back at Trump\u2019s claims of rising crime in Washington. \u201cWe are not experiencing a crime spike,\u201d the mayor said.\nBowser expressed concern about sending the National Guard into the capital, noting that Guard troops are not meant to enforce local laws.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about them not being used efficiently. And I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our guard,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the president\u2019s call about how to deploy the guard.\u201d\nBowser, who is in her third mayoral term, has refrained from responding with hostility to Trump\u2019s threats about taking over Washington.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n450 federal officers deployed on DC streets\nTrump's announcement comes as 450 officers from multiple federal agencies were deployed in high-traffic D.C. areas and other hotspots over the weekend on Aug. 9 and 10.\nThe officers are from 18 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Secret Service.\nTrump ordered an increased law enforcement presence in D.C. on Aug. 8 after complaining about crime in the city, even as violent crime trended down.\nViolent crime is down 26% in DC in 2025\nThe White House pointed to several examples of violent crime in Washington this year including the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum (The suspect is from Chicago.) as well as the recent assault on Coristine.\nYet Washington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Violent crime declined by 35% in Washington from 2023 ro 2024, including homicides from 274 to 187.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump threatens to take over DC\nTrump has long denigrated Washington, D.C, which leans heavily Democratic. Last week, Trump threatened to take over governance of the district if the crime situation isn't improved \u2012 something he floated previously in February.\n\"If D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore,\" Trump said in an Aug. 5 post on Truth Social.\nSuch action would require approval by Congress.\nThe District of Columbia is a federal enclave under jurisdiction of the U.S. government. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gave the city local governance, including an elected mayor and city council. Two congressional Republicans, Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, this month introduced legislation to repeal the Home Rule Act.\n-Joey Garrison\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

Although Trump has long denigrated Washington, these were the most direct comments of his four-week-old second term describing his desire to strip local control from the District of Columbia.\n\"I think that we should govern the District of Columbia. It's so important, the D.C. situation,\" Trump said. \"I think that we should run it strong, run it with law and order, make it absolutely flawless. And I think we should take over Washington, D.C.\"\nTrump commended the Washington Metropolitan Police Department but said \"they're not utilized properly.\" He also said he likes Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat.\n\"I get along great with the mayor, but they\u2019re not doing the job \u2212 too much crime, too much graffiti, too many tents on the lawns. There\u2019s magnificent lawns and there\u2019s tents. It\u2019s a sad thing, homeless people all over the place,\" Trump said.\nThe District of Columbia, which leans overwhelmingly Democratic, is a federal enclave under jurisdiction of the U.S. government. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gave the city local governance including an elected mayor and city council. Two congressional Republicans, Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, this month introduced legislation to repeal the Home Rule Act.\nIt wasn't clear how aggressively Trump intends to move on an endeavor he also discussed on the campaign trail.\nIn response to Trump's remarks, Bowser said, \"Washington, DC is a world-class city\" in a post on X. She included an image touting Washington's parks system, museums, tourism and transit system.\nCrime in Washington, which has a population of about 680,000, dropped significantly in 2024, with homicides falling from 274 in 2023 to 187. Carjacking dropped about 50% but were still above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Washington Post.\nTrump said the city's homeless encampments produce a poor image when world leaders from countries like France, the United Kingdom and China visit the United States.\n\"You can\u2019t have that in Washington, D.C.\" Trump said. \"You can\u2019t let that happen. You can\u2019t have tents all over your beautiful, your once magnificent houses and lawns, you just can\u2019t do it.\"\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 740 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Public Law 93-198), as amended (section 740 of the Home Rule Act), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Crime is out of control in the District of Columbia. Washington, District of Columbia, is our Nation\u2019s capital and home to the central institutions of American governance. Yet rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government, and forces the diversion of critical public resources toward emergency response and security measures. The city government\u2019s failure to maintain public order and safety has had a dire impact on the Federal Government\u2019s ability to operate efficiently to address the Nation\u2019s broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.\nThe increase in violent crime in the heart of our Republic has consequences beyond the individual tragedies that have dominated media coverage. Such lawlessness also poses intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia. Violence and crime hamper the recruitment and retention of essential Federal employees, undermine critical functions of Government and thus the well-being of the entire Nation, and erode confidence in the strength of the United States. These conditions are disgraceful anywhere, but particularly in the capital of our Nation and the seat of the Federal Government. Citizens, tourists, and Federal workers deserve peace and security, not fear and violence. The smooth functioning of executive departments and agencies, courts, diplomatic missions, and the Federal Government demands an effective law-enforcement mechanism capable of halting the precipitous rise in violent crime, not one that permits Government workers to be violently attacked by mobs or fatally shot close to the Federal buildings where they work.\nThe magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States. In 2024, the District of Columbia averaged one of the highest robbery and murder rates of large cities nationwide. Indeed, the District of Columbia now has a higher violent crime, murder, and robbery rate than all 50 States, recording a homicide rate in 2024 of 27.54 per 100,000 residents. It also experienced the Nation\u2019s highest vehicle theft rate with 842.4 thefts per 100,000 residents \u2014 over three times the national average of 250.2 thefts per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia is, by some measures, among the top 20 percent of the most dangerous cities in the world.\nAs President, I have a solemn duty to take care that our laws are faithfully executed, and a sacred responsibility to protect the safety and security of United States citizens who live in and visit our Nation\u2019s capital, including Federal workers who live or commute into the District of Columbia. These conditions cannot persist. We will make the District of Columbia one of the safest cities in the world, not the most dangerous.\nSec. 2. Services of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. I determine that special conditions of an emergency nature exist that require the use of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (Metropolitan Police force) for Federal purposes, including maintaining law and order in the Nation\u2019s seat of Government; protecting Federal buildings, national monuments, and other Federal property; and ensuring conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government. Effective immediately, the Mayor of the District of Columbia (Mayor) shall provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.\nSec. 3. Operational Control of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. (a) The authority of the President conferred by section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act to direct the Mayor with respect to the current special conditions of an emergency nature is delegated to the Attorney General.\n(b) In accordance with section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act, the Mayor shall provide such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the Attorney General may deem necessary and appropriate.\nSec. 4. Monitoring and Recommendations. (a) The Attorney General shall monitor and regularly consult with any senior official the Attorney General deems appropriate on the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes.\n(b) The Attorney General shall regularly update me on the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes.\n(c) The Attorney General shall inform me of any circumstances that, in the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President or that the action in this order is no longer necessary.\nSec. 5. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Justice.\nDONALD J. TRUMP\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nAugust 11, 2025."

      "text": "'This is an emergency': 5 takeaways after Trump deploys troops in DC, takes over police\nPresident Donald Trump laid out an aggressive plan for the federal government to take over law enforcement in Washington and teased that the same force might be coming to other cities across the country.\nJoined by top administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the president announced the National Guard will be deployed in the nation's capital and that the local police will be placed under federal control.\n\"This is an emergency,\" Trump said. \"This is a tragic emergency.\"\nThe president painted a dark portrait of the city throughout an Aug. 11 press conference, describing it as overrun by homeless people, drug addicts and other \"bloodthirsty criminals\" that his administration will no longer tolerate.\nMany residents and activists have long resisted those characterizations as false and racially motivated attacks against the city, which has lobbied for statehood in recent years.\nMayor Muriel Bowser pushed back at the president's claims of rising crime over the weekend, saying residents \"are not experiencing a crime spike.\" She underscored the need for D.C. statehood during a separate press conference on Aug. 11 hours after Trump's comments.\n\"We are American citizens. Our families go to war, we pay taxes and we uphold the responsibilities of citizenship,\" Bowser said. \"And while this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised.\"\nBut Trump and his allies have been keen on spotlighting individual violent crimes against reporters, White House aides and congressional staffers that often seize headlines and startle tourists.\nDemocrats and other critics pointed out that Washington's homicide rate is down 32% year-to-date, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. They called Trump's move another abuse of his executive authority.\nHere are key takeaways from Trump's press conference.\nTrump administration taking over DC police\nTrump signed two executive orders, the first invoking the 1973 Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume control of Washington police for 48 hours if they determine \"that special conditions of an emergency nature exist...\"\nSuch a takeover can be extended with congressional approval but any request of more than 30 days must be passed into law.\nIn a separate order, Trump ordered Hegseth to deploy National Guard troops in Washington, which also authorized him to work with governors of other states to utilize their guard as well.\nKey officials within the administration are now being tasked with overseeing DC's law enforcement agencies, including Bondi, who will take command of the local Metropolitan Police Department. Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Terry Cole, who was sworn in last month, will serve as interim federal commissioner of the police department.\nWhite House spotlights DOGE staffer and other crime victims\nDuring the press conference, Trump sprinkled in many individual cases of violent crime that he argued justified his takeover, such as the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum.\nOne at the top of mind was the assault of Edward Coristine, who worked as a staffer with the Department of Government Efficiency. An Aug. 3 police report, obtained by USA TODAY, said officers observed a group of about 10 juveniles surrounding Coristine's car and assaulting him around 3 a.m.\n\"He was left dripping in blood,\" Trump said. \"He thought he was dead, with a broken nose and concussion. Can't believe that he's alive. He can't believe it.\"\nThe president also evoked Phillip Todd, a former aide to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who was stabbed in 2023. Trump described the attacker, identified by police as Glynn Neal, as a \"demented lunatic.\"\nIn an August profile by The Washington Post, Todd, a son of Christian missionaries, said that he had forgiven Neal and was rethinking his views on crime and punishment.\nChicago, other cities could see federal oversight, Trump warns\nWhile ticking off individual cases, Trump noted that his Washington takeover might be brought to cities including Chicago; Baltimore; Los Angeles and Oakland, California.\nThose Democratic-controlled cities and states, Trump said, have adopted left-leaning policies, such \"no cash bail\" rules, that he blamed for violent crime.\n\"This issue directly impacts the functioning of the federal government, and is a threat to America, really,\" he said. \"It's a threat to our country. We have other cities also that are bad, very bad.\"\nChicago was in the news earlier this summer for a historic drop in crime that Mayor Brandon Johnson, who Trump called out during the press conference, has touted.\n\"This reduction in hate crimes and of violence generally is a testament to what\u2019s possible when we invest in people and community safety in a holistic way,\" Johnson said in a July 18 statement that credited \"strategic, constitutional policing\" and \"jobs for young people, access to mental health care, and housing people can afford.\"\nSimilar trends have occurred in Baltimore, which has seen a 24% decrease in homicides and an 18% decline in nonfatal shootings, according to Mayor Brandon Scott.\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, the Democratic Mayor's Association said federal intervention isn't needed and argued the president is looking to create a \"political charade\" to distract voters.\n\"Let's be clear: Crime is down in most major cities \u2212 including Washington, DC \u2212 in spite of Donald Trump, not because of him,\" the group said. \"If Trump actually cared about reducing crime, he wouldn't have made unprecedented cuts to public safety programs that actually work.\"\nCongress' takeover of Washington could come next\nTrump's crackdown in Washington could be followed by further changes, specifically to its home rule status, which is often a favorite punching bag for congressional Republicans.\nAhead of the president's press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, declared that now is the time for lawmakers to take control of the city.\n\"We should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,\u201d Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\nThe bill, dubbed \u201cBringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident\u201d was introduced earlier this year, and was named after Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption in the city.\nLee co-sponsored the measure with Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tennessee, and cited an ongoing scandal involving a Washington police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime.\nTrump appeared to allude to the Ogles-Lee proposal to rescind home rule. \"We're going to change the statue, and I'm going to have to get the Republicans to vote, because the Democrats are weak on crime,\" he said.\nDemocrats point fingers on DC statehood while others focus on Trump\nNational Democrats took a few swings at Trump's declaration, casting it as a political ploy more than a fight to improve public safety.\n\"The most violent cities are in Republican states \u2212 and there's no takeover happening there,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, a rumored 2028 presidential contender, said in a post on X. \"This is just another attempt to distract from Trump's corruption and suppress dissent.\"\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former Democratic vice presidential nominee, described Trump's announcement in stark terms, saying on X: \"The road to authoritarianism is littered with people telling you you\u2019re overreacting.\"\nBut some Democrats said the party failed to protect Washington when it had the chance four years ago when Joe Biden was still president and they ran Congress.\n\"Trump is going to federalize D.C.,\" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-California, said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\n\"Senate Dems could have stopped this when we had power,\" he added \"In 2021, the House voted to make D.C. a state, but a few Senate Dems flinched and genuflected to the filibuster. Now, DC will be under an aspiring dictator\u2019s control.\""

      "text": "Trump says Washington is unsafe, but the data tells a more nuanced story\nIn Washington, crime is relatively high, but far from the highest in the country, and it has been on a downward trend.\nPresident Donald Trump is deploying the National Guard to Washington to combat what he called \u201cbloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\u201d But crime data paints a much more nuanced picture of what\u2019s going on in the nation's capital.\nAmong major cities in the United States, Washington does have relatively high rates of violent crime and murder. But it has a much lower violent crime rate than some cities Trump hasn't spotlighted, such as Memphis, Tennessee.\nIn DC, different types of crime tend to be concentrated in different parts of the city, and crime overall has been on a downward trend in recent years. The murder rate is far below its historic peak.\nThaddeus Johnson, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice and a former police officer, said the capital is \u201con par\u201d with other big cities. He explained that \u2013 like many of its counterparts \u2013 DC saw crime increase during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and the years that followed, but it's now seeing a decrease.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work to do.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what to know.\nWashington recently saw murders spike, then drop\nThe Metropolitan Police Department reported a 35% drop in violent crime and a 15% decrease in overall crime from 2023 to 2024. Matthew M. Graves, the former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia who also served as the city\u2019s local prosecutor, cited these stats in January as a testament to his prosecutorial strategy.\nBetween 2023 and 2024, crime categories went down between 2% (theft not related to cars) and 64% (arson). But 2023 also saw 274 homicides reported, higher than any year since 2005, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cWe have to be mindful that we had almost historic peaks in these crimes, and so we\u2019re going to have to get back to par first,\u201d Johnson said, pointing to lower pre-pandemic crime levels in 2018 and 2019. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still working that way, and we\u2019re coming closer.\u201d\nViolent crime is down so far in 2025\nViolent crime in Washington through Aug. 8, 2025 dropped 26% compared to the same time period in 2024, according to data from the Metropolitan Police Department. This includes a 50% decrease in sex abuse. Overall crime is down 7% so far. Motor vehicle theft is level, and burglary is down 20%.\nJohnson said 200 or so people tend to be responsible for much of the crime in a city like DC. The crimes tend to be concentrated in Black and brown communities and happen between people who know each other, he said.\nViolent crime and property crime are concentrated\nViolent crime in Washington is highest in Ward 8, the southeastern corner of the city that includes the low-income area Anacostia, according to an interactive map on the city government\u2019s website, followed by Wards 7 and 5 in the eastern part of the city. Violent crime is lowest in Ward 3 in the affluent northwest part of the city, bordering Maryland and across the Potomac River from Virginia.\nProperty crime is highest in Ward 2, a tourist-heavy area that includes the National Mall, the White House and other landmarks, and Ward 5, an area in the northeast part of the city that borders Maryland.\nWashington has a comparatively high murder rate\nWashington's rate of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter was 25.5 per 100,000 people in 2024, according to a USA TODAY analysis of the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program data. This puts DC at No. 5 among more than 30 cities with more than 500,000 people.\nThe FBI categorizes crimes differently from the Metropolitan Police Department, so the rate will differ slightly from the police department\u2019s data. But the categorization is consistent across the country, and the FBI best source for comparing local crime data nationally.\nHere is the ranking:\n- Memphis, Tennessee: 40.6\n- Baltimore, Maryland: 34.8\n- Detroit, Michigan: 31.2\n- Kansas City, Missouri: 27.6\n- Washington, DC: 25.5\nWashington, D.C. has the 10th highest violent crime rate among major US cities\nWhen other violent crime is factored in, Washington, DC ranks lower among large cities. The city\u2019s violent crime rate is 926 per 100,000 residents, according to USA TODAY\u2019s analysis of the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program data. Violent crime includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.\nHere is the ranking:\n- Memphis, Tennessee: 2,501\n- Detroit, Michigan: 1,781\n- Baltimore, Maryland: 1,606\n- Kansas City, Missouri: 1,547\n- Milwaukee, Wisconsin: 1,431\n- Albuquerque, New Mexico: 1,182\n- Houston, Texas: 1,148\n- Nashville, Tennessee: 1,124\n- Denver, Colorado: 993\n- Washington, DC: 926\nCrime in DC used to be much higher\nA generation ago, crime in DC was so high that the city earned the moniker the \"murder capital.\" The number of homicides increased steadily from 148 in 1985 to a peak 482 in 1991, according to a report by the Criminal Justice Research Center. Violent crime, especially murder, subsequently dropped dramatically between then and the COVID-19 pandemic."
