  "title": "Debilitating illness once dismissed as \u2018yuppie flu\u2019 actually has genetic causes: study",
  "description": "The condition is believed to affect 67 million people worldwide \u2014 including an estimated 3.3 million Americans.",
  "content": "Tired all the time? It might be in your DNA.\n\nA new study has uncovered striking genetic differences in people suffering from a devastating illness that causes extreme exhaustion, chronic pain and brain fog that can last for months, years or even decades.\n\nResearchers are calling the discovery a \u201cwakeup call\u201d that could finally shift public perception of the poorly understood condition, once dismissed as a \u201cfashionable form of hypochondria\u201d and labeled the \u201cyuppie flu\u201d by doctors, despite its often debilitating effects.\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis or ME/CFS, is believed to affect 67 million people worldwide \u2014 including an estimated 3.3 million Americans.\n\nUntil recently, little was known about what causes the crippling illness, which can turn a short walk into a major flare-up that leaves many patients bedbound with symptoms that rest doesn\u2019t relieve.\n\nFor years, doctors categorized ME/CFS as a psychosomatic issue rather than a physical disorder. But a growing body of research, including the latest genetic findings, suggests there is a clear biological basis.\n\n\u201cME/CFS is a serious illness and we now know that someone\u2019s genetics can tip the balance on whether they are diagnosed with it,\u201d Dr. Chris Ponting, lead investigator at the University of Edinburgh, said in a statement.\n\nThe study analyzed DNA samples from more than 15,500 people of European ancestry with ME/CFS as part of DecodeME, the world\u2019s largest dataset on the disease.\n\nResearchers found eight key regions of DNA where differences were far more common in ME/CFS patients than in the general population.\n\nTwo of those DNA signals are linked to the body\u2019s response to infection, aligning with frequent patient reports that symptoms began after recovering from an infectious illness.\n\nAnother genetic marker overlaps with chronic pain \u2014 a common complaint among ME/CFS sufferers.\n\n\u201cAs DNA doesn\u2019t change with ME/CFS onset, these findings reflect causes rather than effects of ME/CFS,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\n\u201cThese results are groundbreaking,\u201d said Sonya Chowdhury, CEO of the charity Action for ME and DecodeME co-investigator. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from knowing almost nothing about ME/CFS causes to pinpointing clear targets for research.\u201d\n\nWhile researchers say the findings are not yet ready to guide diagnosis or treatment, they provide vital clues about the disease\u2019s origins and could pave the way for future breakthroughs.\n\n\u201cWe are shining a laser light on eight precise areas of DNA, so that highly focused research can now be carried out,\u201d Chowdhury said. \u201cWe hope this attracts researchers, drug developers, and proportionate funding to ME/CFS \u2014 and speeds up the discovery of treatments.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there is no diagnostic test, effective treatment, or cure for ME/CFS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nInstead, doctors typically focus on relieving symptoms through interventions such as medication, stretching and movement therapies, acupuncture, or massage.\n\nThey may also recommend lifestyle strategies such as pacing, a method that helps ME/CFS patients manage their activity levels to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses while staying as active as possible.\n\nThe study is currently a preprint from the University of Edinburgh and has not been peer-reviewed yet.\n\nThe DecodeME team is urging researchers worldwide to tap into their dataset and launch new, targeted studies on ME/CFS, especially around these eight newly identified genetic signals.",

  "summary": "A study from the University of Edinburgh has revealed that Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), once dismissed as a form of hypochondria and referred to as the \u201cyuppie flu\u201d has genetic causes. The study compared DNA samples from more than 15,500 people of European ancestry with ME/C FS to the general population. Researchers found eight key regions of DNA where differences were more common in ME-CFS patients than in the general public. Two of these DNA signals are linked to the body\u2019s response to infection, aligning with patient reports that symptoms began after recovering from an infectious illness.

      "text": "These special traits may shield \u2018SuperAgers\u2019 from dementia \u2014 how they could lead to new Alzheimer\u2019s tools\nThese seniors are having a moment.\nLife expectancy in the US hovers around 78.4 years \u2014 there\u2019s a special group of people who surpass this mark with flying colors. The retirees, known as \u201cSuperAgers,\u201d exhibit the memory and cognitive abilities of people in middle age.\nA new report out of Northwestern University reveals unique traits of SuperAger brains that appear to shield them from dementia.\n\u201cOur findings show that exceptional memory in old age is not only possible but is linked to a distinct neurobiological profile,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Weintraub, corresponding author of a new paper summarizing the findings.\n\u201cThis opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life.\u201d\nNorthwestern\u2019s SuperAger program began over 25 years ago. To qualify, individuals must be over 80, cognitively healthy and actively engaged in life.\nSuperAgers are generally very social with meaningful relationships.\nSome 290 enrollees have been studied since 2000. Of this group, 79 allowed Northwestern scientists to autopsy their brains after death.\nResearchers reported that SuperAger brains tend not to have amyloid plaques and tau tangles, two hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, or if they do have them, they\u2019re not at a level that would cause memory problems.\n\u201cWhat we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a SuperAger,\u201d said Weintraub, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and neurology at Northwestern\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\u201cOne is resistance: they don\u2019t make the plaques and tangles,\u201d she added. \u201cTwo is resilience: they make them, but they don\u2019t do anything to their brains.\u201d\nSuperAgers didn\u2019t exhibit significant thinning in their cerebral cortex, the brain\u2019s outermost layer. They even had a thicker anterior cingulate cortex than younger adults.\nThe cortex is responsible for emotional regulation and cognitive functions such as attention, error detection and decision-making.\nSuperAgers also boast more von economo neurons (specialized cells associated with fast, intuitive social judgments), larger entorhinal neurons (crucial for memory) and less activated microglia (immune cells) compared to their peers.\nThese brain features could be the reason why SuperAgers scored at least nine out of 15 on a test that requires recalling a list of words after some time has passed.\nThese conclusions will be published in Alzheimer\u2019s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\nWhile the Northwestern scientists learned a lot about SuperAger brains, a definitive answer on how to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease is still elusive.\n\u201cWish I had the answer, wish I\u2019d be out of work,\u201d research co-author Tamar Gefen, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Feinberg, told The Post.\n\u201cSome possibilities: genetics (both heritable and polygenic \u2014 meaning that genes interact with each other within a single person), personal immunity and, of course, the random events (think: biologic, psychologic, environmental stress) that occur in a lifetime,\u201d added Gefen, director of Feinberg\u2019s Laboratory for Translational Neuropsychology.\nShe pointed to The Lancet Commission\u2019s identification of 14 modifiable risk factors for dementia.\nResearchers suggest addressing these behaviors to reduce the risk of developing dementia \u2014 low levels of education, traumatic brain injury, physical inactivity, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, depression, hearing loss, social isolation, air pollution, high LDL cholesterol and untreated vision loss.\nAlzheimer\u2019s is the most common form of dementia, but it is not the only type."

      "text": "Our sons died taking an \u2018all-natural\u2019 supplement you can buy at gas stations \u2014 people don\u2019t realize it\u2019s so addictive and dangerous\nMonths before Jordan McKibban collapsed in his bathroom and never woke up, the 37-year-old prepared smoked salmon and home-grown canned peppers to entertain his big, blended family in their quiet Washington state community.\nWeeks before, he told his mom, Pam Mauldin, things were getting serious with the woman he was dating \u2014 his \u201cone big desire\u201d to have kids was finally in reach, Mauldin recalled.\nDays before, he helped a friend plant a flower garden for a baby shower. \u201cHe loved life. He loved doing things outdoors,\u201d Mauldin told The Post.\nThen, on the day of his death, McKibban went to his longtime job at an organic food distributor. When he got home, he mixed a tablespoon of a powdered kratom supplement into his lemonade.\nMarketed as an \u201call-natural\u201d way to ease pain, anxiety, depression and more, kratom can appeal to health-conscious people like McKibban, who Mauldin says wouldn\u2019t even take ibuprofen for the arthritis in his hands.\nBut on that Tuesday in April 2022, a compound in the substance called mitragynine took McKibban\u2019s life, an autopsy report later showed.\nWhen Mauldin broke into his bathroom after a call from her grandson that day, she found McKibban lifeless. She performed CPR on her own son and shielded her eyes when medics carried his gray body away.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost my son. I\u2019ve lost my grandchildren that I could have had, I\u2019ve lost watching him walk down that aisle, watching him have a life that I get to watch with my other kids. I\u2019ve lost enjoying these years with him,\u201d Mauldin said.\n\u201cI have to go to the cemetery, and I hate going to the cemetery. He shouldn\u2019t be there,\u201d she added.\nFrom dizziness to nonresponsiveness\nKratom products \u2014 sold in powders, gummies and energy-looking drinks \u2014 come from a plant native to Southeast Asia and can act like a stimulant at lower doses and a sedative at higher ones.\nWhile they\u2019re readily found online, in brick-and-mortar stores and even gas stations as catch-all solutions to everything from fatigue to opioid withdrawal, the Food and Drug Administration says kratom and its key components are \u201cnot lawfully marketed\u201d in the US as a drug product, dietary supplement or food additive.\nThe products, though, are gaining attention on social media, as TikTokers reveal disturbing interactions with teens going great lengths to get their hands on drinks like Feel Free.\nThe shot-like capsules of kratom and other \u201cbotanic\u201d ingredients look innocent enough and line some gas station checkouts.\nNational poison control centers documented 1,807 calls about kratom exposures between 2011 and 2017, and \u201cit\u2019s only been increasing since then,\u201d Dr. Michael Greco, an emergency medicine physician in Florida, said.\nPatients on kratom \u201ccan have a lot of agitation, sometimes even psychosis,\u201d he added. \u201cYou get sweating, you get dizziness, you get very high blood pressure or elevated heart rate.\u201d On the other end of the spectrum, he noted, \u201cpeople might be totally unresponsive or just extremely drowsy and out of it.\u201d\nWhile documented deaths from kratom are rare and typically involve other substances like fentanyl, critics say consumers are unaware of kratom\u2019s potential dangers. Manufacturers aren\u2019t required to verify if what is listed on the label accurately reflects what\u2019s inside the product.\nMcKibban, for one, was told it was impossible to overdose on kratom; that he\u2019d just throw up if he took too much, Mauldin said. The green cellophane bags he left behind had no instructions or warnings.\n\u201cI find it so frustrating when I get a recall from Costco over lettuce or they have a recall over some potato chip \u2026 and they pull it all off the market,\u201d Mauldin, whose lawsuit alleges kratom is 63 times more deadly than other \u201cnatural\u201d products sold to consumers, noted.\n\u201cThere have been hundreds of people killed from this, and they don\u2019t pull it. The government doesn\u2019t step in,\u201d she added.\nAn even more potent danger\nExperts are especially concerned with a highly potent, highly addictive kratom offshoot called 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH, which seems to have infiltrated the market in the past few years, said Dr. Robert Levy, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota who\u2019s board-certified in both addiction and family medicine.\nMany people don\u2019t know the difference.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been concern around kratom because if you take enough of it, kratom does act like an opioid, and people can become addicted to it and have withdrawal from it and overdose on it and ruin their lives on it, like anybody else that has a substance use disorder,\u201d Levy said.\n7-hydroxymitragynine, though, \u201cis much more addicting and much more problematic.\u201d\nIn fact, just last week, the FDA recommended classifying 7-OH as an illicit substance.\n\u201c7-OH is an opioid that can be more potent than morphine,\u201d FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, said in a press release. \u201cWe need regulation and public education to prevent another wave of the opioid epidemic.\u201d\nIn the meantime, according to Levy, parents should be having open conversations with their kids about the appeals, dangers and addictive potential of kratom \u2014 and the fact that \u201call-natural\u201d or \u201cplant-based\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean safe. \u201cArsenic is also from a plant,\u201d he says.\nAs for people who say kratom helps them wean off other substances \u201cand they can control their use and they\u2019re getting their life back together, then who am I to judge?\u201d Levy said.\n\u201cI just worry that because they can\u2019t control the use of something, the part of their brain that controls the use of psychoactive drugs is fundamentally broken, and I worry they\u2019ll continue to take more and more of it until they develop a kratom use disorder.\u201d\n\u201c[If] the part of their brain that controls the use of psychoactive drugs is fundamentally broken, I worry they\u2019ll continue to take more and more of it until they develop a kratom use disorder,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf your child or you or whoever is suffering from a substance disorder, you\u2019re not alone,\u201d Levy added. \u201cLots of people suffer from substance disorder. There is help, treatment works.\u201d\n\u2018No money on my child\u2019s life\u2018\nFor Jennifer Young, that message came too late.\nThe mom in Columbus, Ohio, first googled kratom a few years ago after her son, Johnny Loring, mentioned he was using it for anxiety. What she found didn\u2019t alarm her.\n\u201cI saw it\u2019s this \u2018all-natural, safe alternative,\u2019 and then people are like, \u2018It\u2019s wonderful, it saved my life, helps with my anxiety, helps with my pain, it\u2019s a cure-all,\u2019\u201d Young remembered. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t really think it was that bad.\u201d\nPlus, Loring, a delivery driver for a flooring company who loved fishing and playing guitar, found kratom helped him stay alert and communicate with his customers. He valued those relationships.\n\u201cEverybody loved Johnny,\u201d Young said. \u201cHe was the kind of guy that would give you the shirt off his back, the last dollar in his pocket. He didn\u2019t care if you needed a ride, he\u2019d give it to you. Anything you needed, he would be there for you in a heartbeat.\u201d\nEven when Loring started having seizures, neither Young nor clinicians traced them back to kratom. At the hospital, \u201cthey told me that everything was fine and they referred me to a seizure clinic,\u201d Young added.\nLoring never got the chance to go. Weeks later, at age 27, he collapsed during an annual mushroom hunting trip with the men in his family and his new girlfriend. By the time the ambulance got to him, he was dead.\nA toxicology report revealed deadly levels of mitragynine and gabapentin, a prescription painkiller, in his system.\n\u201cThe level of kratom shocked me. It overwhelmed me. It made my gut sick,\u201d said Young, who later found about 20 packs of kratom, which he drank with orange juice, around Loring\u2019s room. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was so addicting.\u201d\nLike Mauldin, Young is pursuing a wrongful death lawsuit. But, she added, \u201cthere\u2019s no amount of money I could put on my child\u2019s life.\u201d\nAfter Loring\u2019s death last spring, she spent a year in bed and got on antidepressants for the first time. One of her other children has been hospitalized for panic attacks. Christmas was \u201cmiserable,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOur house is silent now. The void of Johnny is just loud,\u201d Young added. \u201cI just hope that someday I can get back to enjoying things, because I know he would want me to. But right now, I don\u2019t enjoy anything.\u201d"

      "text": "Key points\n- There is no cure or approved treatment for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.\n- However, some symptoms can be treated or managed.\n- Taking these actions may provide some relief for people's worst symptoms and improve quality of life.\n- Unfortunately, these strategies may not be effective for everyone who has ME/CFS.\nOverview: treatment and management\nME/CFS is a particularly difficult disease to treat or manage because its cause remains unknown. Treatment is also complicated by the fact that the disease affects people differently. So, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to managing the disease.\nPeople with ME/CFS, their families, and healthcare providers need to work together to decide which symptom causes the most problems. This should be treated first.\nBefore starting a management plan, people with ME/CFS, their families, and healthcare providers should also discuss the treatment. This discussion should include the possible benefits and harms of any treatment plans, including medicines and other therapies.\nHealthcare providers need to support their patients' families as they come to understand how to live with this life-altering illness. Providers and families should also remember that this process might be extremely difficult for people with ME/CFS.\nSymptoms to potentially address\nPost-exertion malaise\nPEM symptoms can be severe. They can begin shortly after the exertion or several days later. Typically, symptoms get worse 12 to 48 hours after the activity or exposure. Symptoms can last for days or even weeks.\nPEM can be addressed by activity management, also called pacing. The goal of pacing is to learn to balance activity and rest to avoid PEM flare-ups.\nTo do this, people with ME/CFS need to find their individual limits for mental and physical activity. Then, they need to plan activity and rest to stay within those limits. Some patients and doctors refer to staying within these limits as staying within the \"energy envelope.\"\nPeople with ME/CFS have different limits for physical or mental activity, compared to others without the disease. Keeping activity and symptom diaries may help them find their personal limits, especially early in their illness.\nBeing mindful of personal limits can help people with ME/CFS cope with their illness. It can help them feel like they are managing the illness, rather than the illness controlling them.\nPeople living with ME/CFS may find that everyday activities may be enough to cause a relapse or \"crash\". Activities such as buying groceries, brushing their teeth, or interacting with others may bring on PEM. It's hard to avoid these situations. But people with ME/CFS can learn to monitor their activities throughout the day. Then, they can place limits on what they do if needed.\nWhen having a good day, people with ME/CFS may be tempted to try and \"push.\" This involves increasing activity beyond what the person would normally attempt, often to make up for lost time. However, this can then lead to a \"crash\", or worsening of ME/CFS symptoms. The cycle can then repeat itself after people start recovering from the crash.\nRehabilitation specialists or exercise physiologists who understand ME/CFS may help people with ME/CFS adjust to living with the disease. Finding ways to make activities easier may be helpful. Some examples may include sitting while doing the laundry or showering, taking frequent breaks, and dividing large tasks into smaller steps.\nSome patients find wearing heart rate monitors helps them track how hard their body is working, preventing PEM. Patients who have learned to listen to their bodies might be able to increase their activity level.\nHowever, ME/CFS is unpredictable. PEM symptoms may not start right after exercise. This makes it important to tailor each treatment plan to the individual, with their input.\nExercise is not a cure for ME/CFS. Vigorous aerobic exercise can benefit people with many chronic illnesses. But people with ME/CFS do not tolerate such exercise routines. Standard exercise recommendations for healthy people can be harmful for patients with ME/CFS. However, it is important that patients with ME/CFS undertake activities that they can tolerate, as described above.\nSleep\nPeople with ME/CFS often feel less refreshed and restored after sleep than they did before they became ill. Common sleep complaints include:\n- difficulty falling or staying asleep\n- extreme sleepiness\n- intense and vivid dreaming\n- restless legs and nighttime muscle spasms\nGood sleep habits are important for all people, including those with ME/CFS. If people are still not sleeping well after using these tips, they might want to try over-the-counter sleep medicines. If those don't help, their healthcare provider may offer a prescription sleep aid. These medicines should be started at the smallest dose and be used for the shortest time possible.\nPeople might continue to feel unrefreshed even after the medications help them get a full night of sleep. If so, they should consider seeing a sleep specialist. Most people with sleep disorders, like sleep apnea (pausing in breathing during sleep) and narcolepsy (excessive daytime sleepiness), respond to therapy. However, for people with ME/CFS, not all symptoms may go away.\nPain\nPeople with ME/CFS often have deep pain in their muscles and joints. They might also have headaches (typically pressure-like) and sore skin when touched.\nPeople with ME/CFS should always talk to their healthcare provider before trying any medication. Doctors may first recommend trying over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. If these do not provide enough pain relief, people with ME/CFS may need to see a pain specialist. People with chronic pain, including those with ME/CFS, can benefit from counseling to learn new ways to deal with pain.\nOther pain management methods include stretching and movement therapies, gentle massage, heat, toning exercises, and water therapy. Acupuncture, when done by a licensed practitioner, might help with pain for some patients.\nDepression, stress, anxiety\nAdjusting to a chronic, debilitating illness sometimes leads to depression, stress, and anxiety. If people with ME/CFS have depression or anxiety, they should be treated.\nSome people with ME/CFS might benefit from antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications. However, healthcare providers should use caution in prescribing these medications. Some drugs used to treat depression might worsen other ME/CFS symptoms and cause side effects. When healthcare providers are concerned about patient's psychological condition, they may recommend seeing a mental health professional.\nSome people with ME/CFS might benefit from trying deep breathing, muscle relaxation and massage. They also may wish to try movement therapies (such as stretching, yoga, and tai chi). These can reduce stress and anxiety and promote a sense of well-being.\nDizziness and lightheadedness (orthostatic intolerance)\nSome people with ME/CFS might also have symptoms of orthostatic intolerance triggered -- or made worse -- when standing or sitting upright. These symptoms can include:\n- Frequent dizziness and lightheadedness\n- Vision changes (blurred vision, seeing white or black spots)\n- Weakness\n- Feeling like heart is fluttering or skipping beats\n- Feeling like heart is beating too fast or hard\nHealthcare providers will often check the person's heart rate and blood pressure to make sure nothing else is wrong. They may recommend the person with ME/CFS see a specialist, like a cardiologist or neurologist.\nIf symptoms continue but the person doesn't have heart or blood vessel disease, healthcare providers may suggest additional measures. These could include increasing daily fluid and salt intake and using support stockings. If symptoms do not improve, prescription medication can be considered.\nMemory and concentration problems\nTools like organizers and calendars can help people manage memory problems. Those with concentration problems may be prescribed stimulant medications, like those typically used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). While stimulants might help improve concentration for some people with ME/CFS, they might lead to the \u2018push-and-crash\u2019 cycle and worsen symptoms.\nResources\nStrategies to Prevent Worsening of Symptoms"

      "text": "Chronic fatigue syndrome is more widespread than thought: CDC finds 3.3M diagnosed \u2014 or more\nIf you have felt a never-ending sense of severe exhaustion that can\u2019t be fixed by sleeping, you\u2019re not alone.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new data on Friday that found that about 3.3 million adults in the US suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome.\nChronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME/CFS, is a condition where overwhelming fatigue is not improved by rest, according to the CDC. Other symptoms can include pain, dizziness and problems with sleep, thinking and concentrating.\nThe survey asked 57,000 American adults between 2021 and 2022 whether or not they\u2019d been diagnosed with CFS or ME by a healthcare professional and if they continue to struggle with the disease.\nThe findings revealed that an estimated 1.3% of adults are living with CFS, indicating that the condition \u201cis not a rare illness,\u201d the CDC\u2019s Elizabeth Unger, one of the report\u2019s co-authors, told the Associated Press.\nHowever, some people affected by CFS often go undiagnosed since there is no blood test or scan for diagnosis, meaning that the prevalence could even be higher than estimated.\nCFS can affect anyone of any age but is most common in people between 40-60 years old and in women, though there was less of a gap between women and men than previous studies have suggested, and there was little difference between white and Black people.\nThe study also found that a higher percentage of economically disadvantaged people said they had CFS when compared to more affluent people, debunking the misperception that it only affects the wealthy and privileged, per AP\u2019s report.\nThose misperceptions may stem from the fact that those who are diagnosed and treated \u201ctraditionally tend to have a little more access to health care, and maybe are a little more believed when they say they\u2019re fatigued and continue to be fatigued and can\u2019t go to work,\u201d Dr. Brayden Yellman, a specialist at the Bateman Horne Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, told AP.\nResearchers have yet to determine what causes CFS. However, previous research has suggested that it could potentially be a prolonged overreaction of the body to an infection or weakened immune system, according to the National Institutes of Health.\nWhile some symptoms can be managed with lifestyle adjustments, there is currently no cure for the condition."

      "text": "Pacing Tutorial\nThis tutorial will teach you a powerful treatment for ME/CFS and fibromyalgia, one which may have a larger effect on your health than any medical treatment. It\u2019s called pacing and it involves changing how you live your life.\nIf you\u2019re wondering how altering your habits and routines can be transformative, the answer lies in the fact that ME/CFS and fibromyalgia are affected by how we respond to them, so how we lead our lives has a big effect on our symptoms and our chances for improvement.\nLiving outside the limits imposed by illness often leads to repeated cycles of push and crash. Pacing offers an alternative, a way to live a more stable and predictable life. With pacing, you can live your life according to a plan, rather than in response to symptoms, so you have a sense of managing your illness, rather than illness controlling you.\nBenefits of Pacing\nTo summarize, the benefits of pacing include:\n- Escape from cycles of push and crash\n- Lower symptoms and fewer symptom spikes\n- More stable and predictable life\n- Sense of control\n- Chance to safely increase activity level\nAvoiding Post-Exertional Malaise\nPacing is also important for what it helps you to avoid: the suffering that results from overdoing. Living outside the limits imposed by ME/CFS and/or FM produces an intensification of symptoms called Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM). The key fact about PEM is that it is out of proportion to the overdoing, exacting a large price in forced rest for even small mistakes.\nThe Three Parts of Pacing\nPacing has three parts:\n1 Define Your Current Limits (Energy Envelope)\nThe foundation for pacing is understanding your current limits. This includes limits on physical activity, and also mental activity, socializing, sense data, and stress. You\u2019ll find tools for defining limits on the Finding Your Limits page.\n2 Adapt Using Pacing Strategies\nThe second part of pacing is adjusting your life so you live within your limits. This is a gradual process, usually involving the use of multiple strategies. For details, see the Adapting to Limits page.\n3 Expand Your Limits\nIf you pace consistently, you may be able to expand your limits, doing more without increasing your symptoms. For strategies and examples, see the Expanding Your Limits page. (And there are more examples on our Success Stories page.)\nThe effects of pacing can be transformative, but progress is gradual. Learning to pace requires discipline, patience, and time, but you can see benefits immediately from even a small change such as those you'll find in the tutorial, starting with Finding Limits.\nClick this link for information on our Pacing Tutorial audio recording."

But doctors still couldn\u2019t pinpoint anything provably wrong with her, and ultimately told her that she had \u201cconversion disorder\u201d: a modern-day version of hysteria.\nIn reality, Brea, now 35 and living in California, has chronic fatigue syndrome, or CFS \u2014 also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis. The condition causes severe exhaustion, brain fog and, often, pain. She suspects her case was triggered by a dayslong fever in 2011, although little is known about what causes chronic fatigue.\nHer documentary, now showing at IFC Center, chronicles her battle with CFS, and the stigma that the little-known disease carries: Because the condition is still so under-the-radar, many believe that those with CFS are simply tired or exaggerating their symptoms.\nBrea\u2019s crusade is gaining steam, thanks in part to a handful of celebrities who\u2019ve opened up about their own struggles with chronic, hard-to-diagnose conditions.\nSinger Lady Gaga made news earlier this month when she announced that she was suffering from fibromyalgia, another chronic pain condition. She canceled a leg of a tour to recuperate \u2014 but even she faced backlash from fans who didn\u2019t believe that her disease was real.\nWith both conditions, there is no blood test to confirm a diagnosis; rather, diagnoses are made based on a patient\u2019s self-reported symptoms, such as elevated pain above and below the hips in the case of fibromyalgia.\nEven though there is research into biomarkers of each condition \u2014 elevated levels of certain proteins in the blood, for example \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to know for certain whether a person has either condition.\nAnother issue: Women are estimated to be six times more likely to have CFS than men and twice as likely to have fibromyalgia.\nHistorically, women who report symptoms such as extreme pain and fatigue are branded \u201chysterical,\u201d and often treated as if their conditions are purely psychological.\nHistorically, women who report symptoms such as extreme pain and fatigue are branded \u201chysterical,\u201d and often treated as if their conditions are purely psychological.\nWhen Brea first got ill, she was told by a neurologist that her symptoms were likely due to forgotten emotional trauma in her past.\nNYU Langone rheumotologist Paula Rackoff, MD, says that these types of reactions by the medical community are changing, partly thanks to an increase in female doctors.\n\u201cI think women respond to women differently [than men do],\u201d says Rackoff.\nBut doubters are still disturbingly common.\nLast week, Gaga posted about her struggles on Instagram \u2014 and defended herself against critics.\n\u201cI use the word \u2018suffer\u2019 not for pity, or attention, and have been disappointed to see people online suggest that I\u2019m being dramatic, making this up, or playing the victim to get out of touring,\u201d she wrote in a photo caption. \u201cI use the word suffer not only because trauma and chronic pain have changed my life, but because they are keeping me from living a normal life.\u201d\nIn her new Netflix documentary \u201cGaga: Five Foot Two,\u201d streaming now, the cameras follow along as she cries, shakes and turns to a doctor for trigger-point injections, in which a doctor injects medication in tight muscles, to numb the pain radiating from her hip to her jaw.\n\u201cDo I look pathetic?\u201d she asks in one scene as she weeps. \u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed.\u201d\nGaga not only worries about her own ability to handle the pain, but also about others with the disease who don\u2019t have the same support system \u2014 or funds for treatment \u2014 that she does.\nBut even Gaga stuggles to find doctors who know how to treat her still-mysterious condition. In another scene, she says she\u2019d rather try painful treatments than sit in an MRI machine for hours, only to be told to take Advil at the end.\nBrea blames the severity of her condition on how long it took her to find a doctor who believed her.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance that if I had \u2026 been diagnosed earlier, I may not have gotten as sick as I became, and I may not have ended up in a wheelchair,\u201d she says, adding that instead of resting initially, she pushed herself to exercise and work. Anti-viral medications and recent lifestyle changes have improved her fatigue, but she doesn\u2019t believe she\u2019ll ever fully \u201cheal.\u201d\nShe worries that misinformation and misdiagnoses can make it hard for patients to get support from their loved ones, too.\n\u201cI think a lot of people end up thinking it\u2019s in their heads, and their families sometimes don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d says Brea. \u201cBecause they want to support the one they love, but when the expert\u2019s saying something different, it\u2019s very hard to know who to believe. And that lack of medical education [on the part of the doctors] contributes to families splitting apart, people getting divorced, family members being estranged.\u201d\nBrea says that while her husband has been by her side from Day 1, she still \u201cgrieve[s] for the way [her illness] has affected his dreams.\u201d\nRackoff says that those who suspect they have either disease are perfectly justified in seeking a second or third opinion. \u201cDon\u2019t dismiss your gut instinct.\u201d"

      "text": "What is chronic fatigue syndrome? Here\u2019s how patients live with \u2014 and fight \u2014 the disease\nChronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, was once considered a rare disease \u2014 if it was even considered a real disease at all.\nPeople who complained to their doctor about feeling sick and exhausted were often accused of hypochondria, and their symptoms were written off as the \u201cyuppie flu.\u201d\nBut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report last week citing research that revealed 3.3 million American adults have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), making the disease more common than was previously thought.\nIt\u2019s \u201ca complicated disorder,\u201d according to the Mayo Clinic, and it causes extreme fatigue that lasts for at least six months.\nThere\u2019s no known cause of ME/CFS, though it might be triggered by a range of different factors, including a bacterial or viral infection, an injury or surgical procedure or severe emotional trauma.\nThe disease can also run in families, suggesting that it might have a genetic cause.\nSymptoms of ME/CFS\nThe symptoms of ME/CFS can vary from one person to the next, and from day to day. In addition to fatigue, symptoms may include:\n- Extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exercise\n- Problems with memory or thinking\n- Dizziness that worsens with moving from lying down or sitting to standing\n- Muscle or joint pain\n- Unrefreshing sleep\n- Tender or swollen lymph nodes\n- Headaches\nThere are many overlapping symptoms between ME/CFS and fibromyalgia \u2014 a disorder characterized by muscle and joint pain \u2014 leading some experts to suggest that the two disorders might be different aspects of the same disease.\nLack of support can be a barrier\nAn added burden to those with ME/CFS is the lack of recognition from friends, family and healthcare professionals. No test or tool can provide a definitive diagnosis, so it can be challenging to get any help.\n\u201cI traveled out of state to see an ME/CFS specialist. When I found this doctor, I felt like I was finally supported,\u201d said \u201cMarlene,\u201d a former high school athlete, on the CDC\u2019s \u201cVoice of the Patient\u201d website.\n\u201cI also found an adult infectious disease doctor locally who was willing to work with the ME/CFS specialist to come up with the best treatment plan for me,\u201d she added.\nOther patients describe similar difficulties with finding support from medical professionals.\n\u201cMy symptoms started quickly with a sinus infection and did not stop. Each month, there was something new. I would start to get tired for no reason and had a cold that turned into walking pneumonia,\u201d said \u201cMax,\u201d a former hard-charging pharmaceutical executive.\n\u201cI was not unlike the many who met with physicians for more than a decade, only to be told it was my imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of my friends don\u2019t believe I am sick (faking that I am OK has become a habit) because I don\u2019t look sick to them.\u201d\nLiving with ME/CFS \u2014 what experts advise\nPeople with ME/CFS sometimes have worsening symptoms after physical or mental exertion, an experience known as post-exertional malaise. It may start within 24 hours after the activity and can last for weeks.\nBecause there\u2019s no known cure for ME/CFS, medical professionals advise that people living with the disease try \u201cpacing\u201d their activity level to avoid post-exertional malaise. Pacing involves moderating their exertion levels to find a balance between activity and rest.\nHow medicine can alleviate some pain and suffering\nSome medications also can help relieve symptoms of ME/CFS, including antidepressants to reduce the suffering that can occur with any chronic illness.\nSome over-the-counter pain relievers might also help with symptoms. And prescription drugs including pregabalin (Lyrica), duloxetine (Cymbalta), amitriptyline or gabapentin (Neurontin) \u2014 which are also prescribed for fibromyalgia \u2014 might also alleviate pain and fatigue.\nMedications are also available to help with orthostatic intolerance, a condition common with ME/CFS that causes people \u2014 especially adolescents \u2014 to feel faint or nauseous when they stand or sit upright.\nAccept a level of \u2018new normal\u2019\nDespite these therapies, many people with ME/CFS still struggle with day-to-day living.\n\u201cI find it takes strength knowing a chronic disease that is not curable is actually controlling you, and that there are physical, as well as mental costs to pay for trying to be \u2018normal,'\u201d said Max.\n\u201cFor this reason, I focus each day on managing the symptoms ME/CFS presents. I still promise myself to be driven and passionate but, mostly, to accept my \u2018new normal.'\u201d"

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nIn 1974, Nancy Kaiser made the mistake of coming down with an illness that didn't fit any of the available diagnoses. The Albuquerque housewife was just 38, an avid golfer and swimmer, and under no particular stress. Yet she felt like she was dying. She was weak, profoundly tired and plagued by constant bladder infections. Her muscles ached. Her mood shifted unpredictably. Her memory seemed to be failing. \"If this is menopause,\" she remembers thinking, \"this is horrible, worse than I ever imagined.\" Her doctors could offer no better guess, so after seven awful years she agreed to a hysterectomy. When her health didn't improve, physicians referred her to psychiatrists, who announced she was mourning her lost uterus. One suggested she have an affair.\nBy 1987, Kaiser had been to 212 different experts. Her eyesight was fading and she was having a dozen minor seizures every day. She often lacked the strength to stand up. Her concentration and memory had so deteriorated that she couldn't get through a TV show. Her IQ was down by 22 points. Still, because she lacked a known disease, no one could quite accept that she was sick. Her weary family started pulling away, and doctors hinted that she might be better off in a mental institution.\nEventually she found an expert who was familiar with the problem she described, and interested in helping. After trying several unsuccessful treatments, Kaiser found relief in an experimental AIDS drug, Ampligen. She now leads a nearly normal life, but her ordeal remains a fresh source of outrage. \"We're desperate for care,\" she says of her fellow sufferers. \"The medical profession simply doesn't want us.\"\nYou wouldn't know it to read the mainstream medical journals, but Nancy Kaiser's strange affliction is today a major public-health concern. Though no one has precise numbers, epidemiologists guess that 2 million to 5 million Americans have been stricken. The illness has spawned four national patients' organizations and some 400 local support groups. Officials at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the federal agency responsible for tracking infectious disease, say they receive 1,000 to 2,000 calls about the condition every month. Dr. Jay Levy, a San Francisco AIDS researcher, calls it \"the disease of the '90s.\"\nThe ailment goes by a range of different names. The British and Canadians know it as myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME. The Japanese call it low natural killer cell syndrome. In this country, patients' groups call it chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), but it is generally known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Some of the common symptoms--fevers and lymph-node swelling, night sweats, persistent diarrhea, joint and muscle pain--have a disturbingly familiar ring. But unlike AIDS, this gray plague doesn't kill people, unless they take their lives in despair. It simply turns them into confused invalids. Many patients suffer mood swings or panic attacks and most develop a low-grade dementia. Sleep disturbances are common, as are vision problems. Some sufferers lose their hair, or their finger-prints, or they develop acne for the first time. And though the illness sometimes lifts after a few hellish months, it can linger for years--or recede only to return.\nStill, no one is quite sure what it is. \"Something is going on,\" says Dr. Walter Gunn, the CDC investigator in charge of a four-city survey of the phenomenon. \"But whether it's one disease or several, one cause or more, is not clear.\" The CDC defines chronic fatigue syndrome as a distinctive array of unexplained symptoms that cause 50 percent reduction in activity for at least six months. Diagnosis is largely a matter of ruling out other diseases--AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis and so on. Treatment proceeds by trial and error.\nBut the outlook is rapidly changing. Mounting evidence suggests that CFS is an immune-system disorder in which the body works frantically but inefficiently to control common viral infections. In a flurry of small studies, immunologists have found clear breaches in the body's defense system. Neurologists have discovered physiological abnormalities in patients' brains. And a couple of dogged small-town doctors, aided by a Philadelphia virologist, have recently glimpsed what may be the agent behind the affliction. The story of their quest is in one sense a fable about the medical establishment's indifference to problems that defy comfortable assumptions. But it's also a good mystery whose most tantalizing chapter is just now unfolding.\nChronic fatigue syndrome is probably not a new disease. The same baffling symptom complex has turned up both sporadically and in local clusters for more than a century (Florence Nightingale and Charles Darwin may both have been stricken). But until recently it has been rare. The current round of concern started in Incline Village, Nev., a prosperous little resort town snuggled against the north shore of Lake Tahoe. A pair of young doctors named Paul Cheney and Daniel Peterson had been enjoying a quiet practice when, in the fall of 1984, teachers at two local high schools started coming down with what seemed an extremely tenacious flu. Cheney recalls telling them it was just a virus and would surely pass. But within a few months, nearly 200 of the town's 20,000 residents had developed the same symptoms, and no one seemed to get better. Most of the sufferers were mass-producing antibodies to Epstein-Barr, the herpes virus that causes infectious mononucleosis. But mononucleosis is rare in adults and epidemics of adult mono are unheard of. So Cheney called the CDC to report the strange outbreak.\nIn September 1985, after much prodding, the agency dispatched two investigators, who concluded in a published report that Epstein-Barr was not necessarily the problem. That virus infects nearly everyone by adulthood, and healthy people sometimes exhibit the high antibody counts that Cheney and Peterson were recording. Moreover, Epstein-Barr was not the only bug these patients seemed to be fighting; blood tests revealed high antibody counts to herpes simplex and the cytomegalovirus as well. Rather than fretting over Epstein-Barr, the men from CDC suggested, doctors with sick patients should focus on \"more definable, and possibly treatable, conditions.\"\nDavid Bell still remembers the day in 1986 when he came across a news article about the Lake Tahoe epidemic. He was sitting in his modest office in Lyndonville, N.Y., a tiny farm town on the southern shore of Lake Ontario. Dr. Bell and his wife, Karen, had moved there in 1979, fresh out of medical school, and he had spent several placid years giving checkups and vaccinating babies. Now his practice was being consumed by the strangest illness he'd ever seen: a persistent flulike condition with no apparent cause. He gathered that the Nevada resort town had been hit by \"Yuppie flu,\" a fashionable form of hypochondria, and that two local doctors were blaming it on the Epstein-Barr virus. \"I knew that whatever we were studying had nothing to do with Yuppies,\" he says. Indeed, Bell's sickest patients were children, and a quarter of them had tested negative for Epstein-Barr. So he turned the page.\nBell's troubles had started in November 1986, when his secretary, Jean Pollard, and her husband rushed their 13-year-old daughter to the hospital for an appendectomy. Their three younger girls stayed with David and Debbie Duncanson, family friends with eight boys of their own. Within two weeks all three Pollard girls and five of the Duncanson boys were sick. \"One or two of them had slightly enlarged spleens, and their lymph nodes were swollen,\" Bell recalls. \"It looked a lot like mono.\" But some classic symptoms were missing. Bell guessed it was flu and would soon pass.\nInstead, it got worse \"At first it was just sore throats and stomachaches and vomiting,\" Debbie Duncanson says ofher sons' condition. \"Then they started walking around crying, holding their arm out straight because their lymph nodes were so sore.\" The three Pollard girls hardly walked at all for three months. \"The! just lay on the couch,\" their mother recalls. \"Their eyes hurt so bad they couldn't watch television.\" They were feeling somewhat better by the following summer, but but by Bell had roughly 30 cases of the same illness on his hands. It was striking children and grown-ups alike, and he was no closer to knowing \" what it was.\nAfter trying in vain to get the state health department involved, Bell and his wife, an infectious-disease specialist, developed a survey to seek out common threads among his patients. The survey covered everything from pets and heating systems to socioeconomic status. When the Bells administered it to 63 local kids, several intriguing patterns emerged: the stricken children were more likely to have a history of allergies to have an afflicted family member and to have been drinking unpasteurized milk (the Pollards and Duncansons had been drinking from the same goat). Unfortunately, the symptoms didn't match those of any common allergy or bacterial infection. \"We went through seven or eight possibilities,\" Bell recalls. \"The upshot was that nothing fit.\"\nBy the spring of 1987, the caseload was still growing. He tried referring his patients to specialists, but the specialists could see nothing wrong with them He and Jean Pollard also tried calling the CDC,. but to no avail. Then Bell came across a most unusual patient. She had a classic case of what he was calling the Lyndonville syndrome, but she wasn't from Lyndonville. She was from California, and she knew her illness as the chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome. Bell realized in an instant that he wasn't alone--that the Lake Tahoe doctors he'd read about were wrestling with the same disease.\nThey weren't the only ones. The illness was by now turning up throughout the United States and several other countries, and it had attracted a small but devoted cadre of medical researchers. Dr. Anthony Komaroff, chief of general medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, had conducted an independent study of the Lake Tahoe out-break and found unequivocal evidence of an organic illness Dr. Seymour Grufferman, a cancer epidemiologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, was studying an outbreak among members of a North Carolina orchestra. The sick musicians were developing cancer at 18 times the expected were other members of their house-holds. Cheney and Peterson had been denounced as quacks within Incline Village--a spooky new contagion was the last thing the tourist-dependent community to hear about--and Cheney had harlotte, N.C. His new practice was being overtaken by patients from around the country, who sought him out when no would take them seriously.\nBell soon learned that a Portland, Ore., was organizing a national conference on the illness. At that meeting, held in the fall of 1987, he, Cheney and the others were able to start comparing notes. Though most researchers were still calling the disease chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome, many had turned their attention to other viruses, such as a newly discovered herpes virus called HHV-6 and--particularly in Canada and Britain--the enteroviruses (polio, coxsackie and echo). Tests showed that many of these bugs were active in the chronically sick patients. The trouble was that none was active in every patient, and none turned up exclusively in people with the illness. Since Epstein-Barr clearly wasn't the whole problem, the CDC proposed in 1988 that the illness be renamed chronic fatigue syndrome. Its existence could not be denied, but its cause was still a mystery.\nThe emerging hypothesis held that CFS was at root an immune disorder. Dr. Jay Goldstein, a southern California physician with a large caseload, had long theorized that the illness begins when \"agent X\"--some unknown chemical or contagion--damages the immune system. According to his model, the initial injury isn't catastrophic, but it enables viruses that are normally held in check to start running amok in the body. Having failed to maintain the peace, the immune system's helper T cells would start churning out chemicals called cytokines to instigate harsher assaults on the resident bugs. And the perpetual flood of cytokines would, in it self, cause many unpleasant symptoms.\nThat cytokines can make you sick is no secret; one of them, interleukin-2, causes a syndrome resembling CFS when used as a cancer treatment. To see if it was implicated in the illness itself, Cheney and Bell decided in 1988 to mount a collaborative study. They sent blood samples from 104 of their patients to a Los Angeles laboratory. The tests showed that the patients' average interleukin-2 level was 40 times that of healthy control subjects.\nOther findings have since filled out the picture of an immune system in disarray. Several studies have shown that CFS patients' natural killer cells, which normally attack anything foreign to the body, are extremely sluggish in a test tube. Dr. Nancy Klimas of the Miami V.A. Medical Center has also found that certain classes of cytotoxic T cells--killers programmed to attack specific intruders--are either under- or overactive. And just as Bell and Cheney found that CFS patients produce a flood of interleukin-2, Klimas found that they often make too little of another cytokine (gamma interferon). None of these imbalances is unique to CFS, but researchers are optimistic about identifying a general blood profile that is. Jay Levy, the San Francisco AIDS researcher, has spent several years developing a CFS blood test and hopes to present the result this month at a CFS conference in Charlotte, N.C.\nThe search for clinical signs hasn't been confined to the immune system; scientists have linked CFS to specific neurological problems as well. People with CFS perform poorly on certain cognitive tests, notes Curt Sandman, a research psychologist at the University of California, Irvine, and their problems are quite different from those associated with depression (box).\nSandman can only guess at how these problems might relate to events inside the brain. Other researchers are using sophisticated imaging devices to find out. Dr. Ismael Mena, head of nuclear medicine at Harbor UCLA Medical Center, uses an instrument known as a SPECT scan to gauge the amount of blood reaching various parts of the brain. CFS patients typically show abnormally low blood flow to one of the two temporal lobes. Dr. Marshall Handle-man, a neurologist at the University of Southern California Medical Center, uses an experimental device, the BEAM scan, to gauge electrical activity in different brain regions. His test reveals a similar dearth of activity in the temporal lobes and the hippocampus. This region of the brain happens to play a central role in the formation of memories.\nThese findings all represent progress, but they only deepen the central mystery: why is all of this happening? What agent, or agents, might so disrupt people's immune systems, wreaking such havoc on their bodies and brains?\nThe AIDS epidemic raised precisely the same question during the early '80s, and the culprit turned out to be a retrovirus, the notorious HIV. Retroviruses are basically self-contained strands of RNA that can translate themselves into DNA and splice themselves permanently into the chromosomes of certain cells. (They're called retroviruses because RNA is normally made from DNA.) These bugs are common in animals, but only three--HIV, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2--have been found in humans. All three attack immune cells called T lymphocytes and are associated with chronic illness. HTLV-1 has been linked to acute T-cell leukemia and a couple of nervous-system diseases: tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) and, tentatively, multiple sclerosis. HTLV-2 has been tied to a rare form of leukemia.\nBy the time Cheney and Bell started their interleukin-2 study, Cheney had long suspected that CFS might involve a retroviral infection. In fact he had been pleading with Elaine DeFreitas, a virologist at Philadelphia's Wistar Institute, to help him find out. DeFreitas wasn't much interested in analyzing blood samples from Cheney's patients, she was busy investigating the role of HTLV-1 in nervous-system diseases. But she perked up when Cheney told her about an Air Force sergeant who had fallen ill after an encounter with a prostitute.\nCheney was treating the sergeant for chronic fatigue syndrome, but some of his symptoms reminded DeFreitas of TSP. Since he would have been only the second American-born Caucasian ever diagnosed with that illness, DeFreitas decided to take a closer look. In March 1988 she agreed to have Cheney send her six blood samples identified only by code numbers. She assumed that one would come from the ailing sergeant, the rest from healthy controls. Instead, Cheney sent her six samples from CFS patients. And when DeFreitas ran her tests, something extraordinary happened: all six showed signs of HTLV infection--an infection that is nearly impossible to find in the general population. The reluctant virologist was suddenly eager to know more.\nTo clarify the tantalizing link, Cheney and DeFreitas designed a larger, more formal study and invited Bell to take part. That summer the two clinicians started sending coded blood samples to DeFreitas in Philadelphia. Some of the samples came from CFS patients, some came from the patients' close friends and family members and some from the general population. DeFreitas's job was to analyze them all, not knowing which ones were which.\nFor two years DeFreitas labored over the blood samples. Using an advanced technique called polymerase chain reaction, she searched each one for particular segments of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. Last summer, results in hand, the three researchers unmasked the blood samples to see whether interesting patterns had emerged. They weren't disappointed. Indeed their results, reported in September at a scientific conference in Kyoto, Japan, could open a whole new research frontier. Of the 30 samples drawn from CFS patients, fully 77 percent contained a distinctive piece of genetic material found in HTLV-2. Not one of the 20 samples drawn from the general population contained the same viral gene.\nIronically, the findings don't suggest that chronic fatigue syndrome is caused by HTLV-2. For while one of the virus's four genes was very much in evidence, DeFreitas could find no trace of a second. HTLV-2 would be an unlikely suspect anyway, given the way it is transmitted. Like the AIDS virus, it survives only in body fluids such as blood and semen. No one is sure how people get CFS, but it clearly isn't transmitted like AIDS. It's as likely to turn up in a pair of siblings as in a pair of sexual partners. The same is apparently true of the suspect DNA segment. Though it wasn't present in any of the blood that Cheney and Bell drew from the general population, more than a third of the the CFS patients' close, nonsexual associates tested positive.\nThe question is: positive for what? If the gene associated with CFS didn't come from HTLV-2, where did it come from? It could simply be \"junk DNA,\" homegrown genetic material that happens to resemble a piece of HTLV-2. Or it could be a working part of some other infectious agent--a virus that is related to HTLV-2, that is transmitted differently and that can infect people without immediately making them sick. If the suspicious DNA were just hereditary detritus, it wouldn't normally initiate chemical reactions within the cell. But if it were part of a disease-causing agent, it would sometimes spring into action, manufacturing pieces of RNA in its own image. Symptoms would follow.\nBefore DeFreitas, Cheney and Bell went to Japan to present their findings, DeFreitas did one last experiment to see if they really meant anything. She gave some of the blood samples to a colleague at Wistar, who used a technique called in situ hybridization to check for newly minted RNA. The suspicious gene was silent in the healthy carriers she tested. But in six out of 12 actual CFS sufferers, it was actively churning out copies of itself. \"I'd gone into this as skeptical as anyone,\" she says. \"But when I had everything spread out on my desk, I decided I had to believe my eyes or not believe my eyes. If I believed my eyes, I had to tell people about this.\"\nStill, the case is far from closed. DeFreitas, Cheney and Bell are the first to admit that their study was small, and that even if other researchers replicate it, the task of isolating a whole virus could take years. If the suspicious gene is eventually linked to a whole virus--no certainty, since some viruses break down inside the body, leaving only scraps like the one already recovered--many questions will remain. Does the agent cause illness by itself--a prospect that Cheney, for one, considers unlikely--or only when helped along by other factors, such as stress, or a second infection, or a genetic susceptibility? Is the ostensible virus specific to CFS, or will it show up in people suffering from other conditions, such as the unusual cancers that Seymour Gruffer-man has seen in North Carolina? If the culprit is a retrovirus, how is it transmitted? Is it an animal virus that people pickup through milk or meat (as Bell's local survey hinted)? Or is there a human retrovirus that, unlike the others, spreads through casual contact? Finally, why has the illness only now become so prevalent?\nFor all the remaining uncertainty on those fronts, a few things seem clear. One is that there's more to this illness than depression. No one denies that depression can be debilitating, but CFS strikes people whose psyches are demonstrably healthy and promptly ruins their lives. \"Depression requires a loss of interest in everything,\" Cheney observes. \"These patients are just the opposite. They're terribly concerned about what their symptoms mean. They can't function. They can't work. Many are petrified. But they do not lack interest in their surroundings.\"\nThe other certainty is that the mainstream medical community has been too slow to take the problem seriously. Though federal agencies started funding a handful of CFS studies last year, most of the research completed to date has been funded--and published--by patients' groups, or by obscure doctors struggling to get by in one of the least lucrative specialties in medicine. At least one leading researcher has financed his work by selling his office furniture and working graveyard in a hospital emergency room. Telling people they aren't sick is an easier way out when an illness so defies expectations. Unfortunately, it's a lie.\nPOLICEMAN'S BLUES: NEW YORK;\nNo one would accuse Gino Olivieri of lacking gumption. At 28, the former Detroit Lion was raising three kids with his wife, Janet, and relishing his job as a cop in Rochester, N.Y. \"I was a canine handler, a SWAT team member, a field training officer. I mean I was go, go, go, \" he says. His illness came on suddenly in February 1988, after he fell into an ice-covered pond during a late-night burglary chase. He managed to pull himself from the chest-deep water and walk back out of the woods in subfreezing temperatures. After being treated for hypothermia at a local hospital, he developed bronchitis. But instead of receding after a few weeks, it turned into a horrible, unending flu.\nNearly three years later, Olivieri hasn't been back to work. Nor has he been out to dinner, attended a family wedding, observed a holiday or tossed a football with his kids. His wife videotapes the children's school functions so that he can at least see what he's missing. \"I'm lightheaded,\" he says, squinting pale and unshaven through glacier-strength sunglasses. \"The fatigue, it's deep in my muscles, deep in my bones. I have five or six different eye problems. I get nausea and Iymph-node swelling throughout my body. I'm confused a lot of the time and I have tremendous insomnia. When you've got the flu, that first day's bad, but by the fourth day you're back to work. I don't see any change at all.\"\nPeople with chronic fatigue syndrome suffer an array of unexplained symptoms. Eight of the following must persist or recur over six months for a person to quality as having CFS.\nChills or low-grade fever\nSore throat\nTender lymph nodes\nMuscle pain\nMuscle weakness\nExtreme fatigue\nHeadaches\nJoint pain (without swelling)\nNeurological problems (confusion, memory loss, visual disturbances)\nSleep disorders\nSudden onset of symptoms\nSOURCE: CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL\nDr. William Harvey, a specialist in a' aerospace medicine and a seasoned pilot, was about to land his small plane at Moffett Field in Sunnyvale, Calif., when he found to his horror that he couldn't make sense of the commands from the control tower. \"It was like I was dyslexic,\" he says of the 1988 incident. When the same thing happened again two weeks later, he knew his flying days were over. Although physicians couldn't find anything wrong with him, Harvey's illness worsened to the point that he soon had to stop working altogether. After a year of sleeping or \"sitting like a vegetable in front of the television,\" he found relief in gamma globulin, an experimental treatment that has shown promise in an Australian study.\nNow 52, Harvey is finally starting to work again. Although he still suffers from muscle pain and persistent bladder infections, he has regained his vision and his clarity of mind. His frightening experience in the cockpit prompted him to write an article that is aimed at flight surgeons who pass judgment on pilots. It warns them about what the disease can do. He has also served as an expert witness in cases where CFS may have contributed to an accident.\n\"We get less sympathy than AIDS patients,\" says Chris Spalding, a 42-year-old single mother who worked as a union carpenter until she and her son developed CFS two years ago. The trouble started when Spalding and her two kids, Hoben (now 13) and Emily (now 6), came down with an intestinal flu. Emily was the only one who got better. \"Hoben would fall asleep 20 times a night doing his homework, or he would fall asleep over an open drawer, looking for a T shirt,\" says Spalding, who now makes ends meet through telephone work and a part-time restaurant job. \"Once he even fell asleep petting our dog.\"\nReducing the child's school hours seemed only sensible to Spalding. But the school system didn't understand. Truant officers dropped by regularly to lecture him on responsibility. His teachers thanked him sarcastically when he made it to class. The other kids taunted him in the hallways, calling out, \"He has AIDS.\" At one point last year, Hoben talked about suicide. But nowadays he feels physically better. \"I never feel energetic and ready to conquer the world,\" he says. \"I just know I can survive.\" This year, as he entered the eighth grade, school officials flatly refused to let him attend half days. They said that unless he learned to handle full days he would never succeed in high school or a job. Eventually they relented. But, says Hoben's mother, \"they still believe it's an attitude, not an illness.\"\nChronic fatigue syndrome is sometimes dismissed as depression, but the two illnesses have very different effects on people's mental abilities.\nMost people, whether healthy or depressed, can improve their performance on a memorization test by using cues. But cues are largely worthless to CFS patients, suggesting a diminished ability to form new memories.\nA depressed person can handle a brief interruption when trying to memorize something. CFS patients' performance suffers six times as much from the interruption.\nWhen asked to predict how they'll do on a cognitive test, depressed people tend to underestimate their abilities, but CFS patients tend to overestimate theirs.\nMany patients in the CFS movement know the story of Murphy. Murphy was a seven-pound white Maltese. At the age of 5 1/2, the dog started to gain weight and turned into a picky eater Over a period of two years, Murphy became terribly lethargic and his Iymph nodes got so tender that he winced when he was touched. Eventually his owners, Reed and Gloria Baker of Riverside, Calif., had him put to sleep.\nGloria Baker suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome. Murphy got sick about two years after she did. And because routine tests showed that she and the dog shared several blood abnormalities, researchers performed a full immunologic analysis once the dog was dead. Oddly enough, Murphy tested positive for the newly identified HHV-6, a herpes virus that Baker was also fighting.\nThere may be nothing to such stories, but so many CFS patients mention having sick pets that one researcher, Dr. Paul Cheney, has conducted a survey to gauge the phenomenon. He will discuss his findings this month at a CFS conference in Charlotte, N.C. In Britain, a wave of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as mad-cow disease, has led patients to wonder whether CFS is somehow related to that phenomenon. Most experts doubt that a single infectious agent is making people and animals sick; viruses tend to be highly adapted to one species or another. But because the illness is still such an enigma, the possibility can't yet be ruled out.\nAfter 11 years, Marc Iverson is used to being sick. No longer able to hold a regular job, even to plan a day in advance, he does what he can to help other sufferers. As president of the 10,000-member CFIDS Association, a national patients' group based in Charlotte, N.C., Iverson often works by phone, from his bed. \"The original script for my life was shredded,\" he says, \"but the new one isn't so bad.\"\nAt 27, Iverson was a Yuppie superachiever. He had sailed through Colgate, Wharton and Harvard and become a vice president at BarclaysAmerican. Suddenly, in the fall of 1979, his energy evaporated. He got vertigo. He couldn't remember things. All that came of four trips to the Mayo Clinic and a month in a psychiatric ward was a mountain of medical bills. The CFIDS Association was born in 1987, when Iverson started meeting with other local sufferers. The association and its sister organization, the San Francisco-based CFIDS Foundation, have since found a global constituency. The association publishes the quarterly CFIDS Chronicle, and members have funded $400,000 in research. Says Iverson, \"They have no other way of fighting back.\""

Don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he wrote in December 2016. Then he added a five-letter coda: \u201cD-Y-I-N-G.\u201d\nWhitney Dafoe was suffering from a mysterious ailment, an affliction with no known cause, cure or treatment. It can suddenly strike healthy people with a wide spectrum of symptoms, rendering an unlucky percentage almost completely incapacitated.\nThe disease is known as chronic fatigue syndrome or more specifically ME/CFS. Once derided as being all in patients\u2019 heads, experts are now coming around to recognizing it as a real biological disease. Whitney is helping with that fight.\n\u201cHis condition was so shocking that it was unbelievable,\u201d author Tracie White told The Post. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason doctors sometimes don\u2019t believe patients. It\u2019s such an odd disease.\u201d\nWhite\u2019s new book \u201cThe Puzzle Solver: A Scientist\u2019s Desperate Hunt to Cure the Illness That Stole His Son\u201d (Hachette Books), out Tuesday, chronicles not only Dafoe\u2019s tragic story but that of his father\u2019s efforts to investigate his illness.\nGrowing up, Dafoe was certain his father, Ron Davis, was the smartest man in the world. (Davis, the co-founder of the Stanford Genome Technology Center, and his wife split their last names between their two children.)\nOn family hikes or long road trips together, Dafoe and his sister used to play a game they made up called \u201cron.com,\u201d in which they\u2019d ask their father random questions \u2014 how high is that mountain, how deep is that lake \u2014 and marvel as he produced the correct answer after quick mental calculations.\nAfter Dafoe grew increasingly sicker and was diagnosed with ME/CFS in 2011, it was his dad that he turned to.\n\u201cWhitney\u2019s faith in Ron was unshakable,\u201d White writes. \u201cWhen Ron came home in the afternoons to help care for Whitney, the two spent hours trying to figure out answers.\u201d\nHis son\u2019s disease was incredibly painful to him, and Davis didn\u2019t like talking about it. He turned to science instead, devoting himself to researching the disease.\n\u201cIt is enormous pressure,\u201d Davis says in the book. \u201cWe have to figure this out very quickly because millions of people are suffering and my son is dying.\u201d\nOne big question is what triggered his son\u2019s illness. Dafoe was a photographer who had traveled the world. At age 23 during a trip to India, he had been hospitalized with a stomach ailment. When Dafoe returned to America he had wasted away to 115 pounds.\nHis father suspected he\u2019d been infected by a parasite. Whatever the cause, he was never the same.\nHe got worse and worse until he was nearly comatose, living alone in his parents\u2019 back bedroom and being fed by a tube. He thought about ending it all. \u201cI\u2019ve lost so much of what makes me human,\u201d he confessed to White.\nDavis grew more and more determined to help his son. But one big stumbling block proved to be money. While other diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, received $100 million in funding in 2011, for example, ME/CFS got just $6 million.\nDavis had to start small. Once a week, he\u2019d draw a vial of his son\u2019s blood and carry it out to a work shed behind their California house. He\u2019d spin the blood in a centrifuge, then drive it to his lab at Stanford for analysis.\nThe first break came in 2011. Davis won the Gruber Prize, a prestigious award for his \u201cpioneering work in genetic engineering.\u201d The recognition was nice, but what really appealed to Davis was the $500,000 that came with it.\nHe used the money to fund his ME/CFS research, hiring other scientists into his lab by 2013.\nDavis lived and breathed the disease. At night, he\u2019d literally dream of science experiments. He\u2019d come home from work at 4 p.m., take care of Whitney before turning over the caregiving to his wife at night. He\u2019d then get back to work, \u201cdisappearing into the library with his laptop, lost in the science and hunting for answers.\u201d\nFinally, in the spring of 2015, a breakthrough. Davis opened his computer to find the results of tests on his son\u2019s blood he\u2019d been waiting two years to get.\n\u201cI thought, Wow,\u201d he says in the book.\nThe results left him and his wife in tears.\nDavis had discovered that the processes in each cell that convert food to energy were not working correctly in his son. The scientists had \u201cfound scientific proof of ME/CFS,\u201d clearing a major hurdle for a disease that many still today deem imaginary.\nWhat\u2019s more, Davis and his team developed a simple blood test to detect the disease that could one day be used in doctor\u2019s offices.\nToday, Dafoe, now 37, remains bedridden and immobile, but with the help of a drug called Ativan used to treat anxiety, he now has short bursts of energy in which he\u2019s able to write e-mails or blog posts, though he still cannot speak.\n\u201cI want to push the ME/CFS community forward,\u201d Dafoe wrote to White recently. \u201cI want to inspire people to keep fighting and not give up because I know a cure is coming soon.\u201d"

      "text": "James Van Der Beek reveals the minor colorectal cancer symptom he dismissed before his diagnosis\nJames Van Der Beek is sharing the subtle colorectal cancer symptom he ignored before his shocking diagnosis.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any red flag or something glaring,\u201d he told Healthline this week.\nThe 48-year-old \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d alum publicly shared the news of his diagnosis last November.\n\u201cBefore my diagnosis, I didn\u2019t know much about colorectal cancer. I didn\u2019t even realize the screening age dropped to 45; I thought it was still 50.\u201d\nRates of colon cancer among young people have been steadily rising over the past three decades, even as diagnoses among older people decline. A staggering 20% of colorectal cancer cases in 2019 were discovered in people younger than 55, up from 11% in 1995.\nPrior to his diagnosis, Van Der Beek noticed a change in his bowel movements, which he attributed to his coffee consumption.\n\u201cI thought maybe I needed to stop coffee,\u201d he told People last year. \u201cOr maybe not put cream in the coffee. But when I cut that out and it didn\u2019t improve, I thought, \u2018All right, I better get this checked out.\u2019\u201d\nA colonoscopy confirmed that the actor had stage 3 colon cancer.\nCommon colorectal cancer symptoms\nChanges in bowel movement are among the six telltale signs of colorectal cancer. Experts maintain that a tumor in the colon or rectum will, similar to \u201ca clog in a pipe,\u201d alter bathroom habits.\nThese changes can include frequent constipation, diarrhea or both. In many cases, patients don\u2019t feel \u201cempty\u201d after going number 2 or notice that their stools look different.\nOne possible symptom among colon cancer patients is pencil-thin poop. This defining defecation tends to present if tumors are present near the end of the colon or line the inside of the organ, as it narrows whatever stool passes through.\nOthers include fatigue, anemia, unexplained weight loss, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.\nExcluding skin cancers, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States. The number of early-onset cases is on the rise, with diagnoses in people under 50 expected to double by 2030.\nJames Van Der Beek\u2019s cancer advice\nFor his part and in the spirit of early detection, Van Der Beek has partnered with Guardant Health to raise awareness about the Shield blood test.\n\u201cWhat I love about the Shield test is it\u2019s convenient, simple, FDA approved \u2014 it\u2019s a simple blood draw and it could be done at your next doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d\nWhile colonoscopy is considered the standard test for colorectal cancer, blood tests like the one offered by shield are providing a different avenue for early detection.\n\u201cPeople are three times more likely to adhere to [screening] advice when it\u2019s just a blood test. It\u2019s convenient for people who either can\u2019t take off work to do a colonoscopy or who [face] other barriers to some of the other testing methods,\u201d said Van Der Beek.\nAccording to the FDA a study showed Guardant\u2019s Shield test detected 83% of colorectal cancers\n\u201cI really want to impress upon people that you don\u2019t need symptoms to get screened. If you are 45 or older or have a family history, talk to your doctor about your screening options,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the Colon Cancer Alliance, 82% of young colon cancer survivors were initially misdiagnosed and 67% consulted at least two doctors before getting the right diagnosis.\nAnd early detection equals increased surival.\nThe colon cancer mortality rate in people under 55 has been rising about 1% annually since the mid-2000s, while deaths among older adults have declined. This is partly due to the fact that cancer in younger people is often detected at more advanced stages, according to the American Cancer Society.\nIn regards to prevention and early detection, Van Der Beek shared, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a big part of my healing process to spread the word and to help anybody I can from having to go through what I have been through.\u201d"
