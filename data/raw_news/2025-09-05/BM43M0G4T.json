  "description": "DuRoBo\u2019s Krono debuts at IFA 2025 as an AI-powered ePaper hub with Android, note capture, and a 6.13-inch e-ink display.",
  "content": "Most e-readers stick to the basics: an E-Ink screen, a bookstore tie-in, and enough battery to survive a long vacation. At IFA 2025, DuRoBo debuted a more ambitious device, the Krono, pitched as an \u201cAI-powered ePaper Focus Hub.\u201d This is either a mouthful of marketing or a peek at where these types of devices are indeed headed.\n\nOn paper (pun intended), the specs look solid. The Krono features a 6.13-inch Carta 1200 HD display at 300ppi with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Under the hood, it runs on an octa-core processor with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a big jump from the 1GB RAM and 16GB storage you\u2019ll find on most e-readers like a Kindle or Kobo. Powering those beefier internals is a 3,950mAh battery, though DuRoBo hasn\u2019t shared an actual usage estimate.\n\nYou\u2019ll also find Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB-C charging, stereo speakers, and dual microphones, the latter powering something a little more unique. On the side of the device, a rotating wheel doubles as a tactile control and a shortcut for \u201cSpark,\u201d the device\u2019s AI-powered note capture tool. Hold it down, and you can dictate voice memos that the Krono will transcribe and summarize. Meanwhile, the built-in speakers (or any connected Bluetooth buds) let the Krono pull double duty as an audio player for podcasts, audiobooks, or music. Together with normal reading and note-taking features, these tools place it somewhere between a Kindle and a pocket-sized media hub.\n\nLike other e-readers, it offers adjustable front lighting for reading in any environment. However, unlike many popular picks, it runs Android 13, meaning users can load up third-party apps and their preferred e-book platforms rather than being shackled to a single store. DuRoBo also layers in a minimalist UI that aims to create a calm, distraction-free experience, though whether that\u2019s accurate or just another app launcher is unclear.\n\nThe Krono is available for pre-sale on Kickstarter starting today. Units are expected to ship in November 2025. DuRoBo says commercial availability will follow later this year, priced at about \u20ac279.99 (~$327)\n\nIf nothing else, it\u2019s refreshing to see a new face in the e-reader crowd. Whether the Krono ends up a productivity powerhouse or just another smart device asking for your voice notes is something we\u2019ll have to see when it ships.",

Learn more.\nDisplay Week 2018: A look at the future of E Ink displays\nMay 25, 2018\nDisplay Week 2018 has been filled with ultra-high-res OLEDs, sound-emitting panels, and more, but the one company that really stuck out this year was E Ink. You might know its technology from products like the Amazon Kindle and the YotaPhone. The company has been using ultra low-power ink technology to create static images on displays, and had a number of new demos to showcase all the new products the technology is being injected into.\nThe first set of displays showcased on the wall showed full-color E Ink which would switch images every minute or so. These images gave the impression they were drafted by something like a colored pencil, and looked much more \u201cauthentic\u201d than a traditional display. I could see this tech being injected into e-readers, allowing users to read things like magazines where most of the content is text but images are present every now and then.\nThe company also showed off a few different monochrome panel arrays. While this wasn\u2019t quite as new as the colored ink, it gave a really cool and professional effect. This panel changed between lions and some horses, and I cold see this being displayed in a gallery somewhere.\nThis tech isn\u2019t only used for art and e-readers though. E Ink showed off a couple of wearables that are using the technology, including a smart band called Tago and a Sony and Epson smartwatch. One of the biggest issues that plague smartwatches today is the the crummy battery life, and E Ink could help solve this problem. The technology only uses battery power when it is switching the state of the ink, and that is quite infrequent in applications like this.\nBeyond this, there were a few other applications, like credit cards that can hold multiple accounts and have a super low-energy screen using E Ink tech. While this isn\u2019t brand new technology, it\u2019s quite cool to see it in person, and the whole booth made it evident that this could be the future of low-energy multi-state screens.\nThank you for being part of our community.
