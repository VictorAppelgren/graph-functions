  "description": "Seven must-have picks, with several other recommendations.",
  "content": "Its motion control support isn\u2019t a novel feature (many third-party controllers offer that), but its Amiibo NFC support is still something that almost no alternatives offer. Another feature that makes this one worth considering despite its high price is its 3.5mm headphone jack, in case you want to plug in a set of wired headphones for private listening. Additionally, it can wake the Switch 2 from standby via Bluetooth (only a select few wireless models possess this ability), so you don\u2019t have to get off your couch to hit the console\u2019s power button. Lastly, this model has two additional buttons that can be mapped to mimic almost any other button. (some cheaper alternatives, including the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 and Pro 3, feature four extra buttons).\n\nThe Switch 2 Pro is very comfortable, and it\u2019s the controller that I always want to use when given the choice between the options below. But it\u2019s not perfect. For one, it\u2019s pricey at $89.99, and you\u2019d think for that price Nintendo might have opted for drift-resistant sticks. Alas, you owe $5 to your buddy who bet that Nintendo would doggedly opt again for potentiometer sticks that are proven to tear down over time. Its sticks haven\u2019t caused issues so far, but it\u2019s possible that they might not fare as well \u2014 and as long \u2014 as models below that feature more durable Hall effect or TMR joysticks.\n\nStarting with the good, the company upgraded its joysticks to the even more durable TMR sensors. The two back paddles are carried over from the first iteration, though there\u2019s a new pair of buttons (L4 and R4) near the triggers that can be customized. Also of note are new toggle switches around its backside (similar to what we saw on the DualSense Edge) that let you alter the travel distance of its two triggers. Toggling a switch makes the corresponding trigger feel more like a mouse click.\n\nWhile the Pro 3\u2019s TMR sticks might make it last longer, there are some trade-offs compared to the pricier Nintendo alternative \u2014 none of which are deal-breakers if saving money is a top priority. For example, its attempts to replicate the subtle blips and buzzing of Nintendo\u2019s impressive HD haptics in the Switch 2 Pro controller are just not good. Its attempts at replicating the smallest, nuanced vibrations of Donkey Kong walking in Bananza makes it go full boar. I\u2019d sooner turn off the vibration entirely than deal with how jarringly intense it feels, and thankfully you can in the app.\n\nOther downsides are more minor, but are still worth knowing about. It lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, and it doesn\u2019t have the C button to launch GameChat. However, you can easily assign the feature to one of the Pro 3\u2019s buttons via the Switch 2\u2019s OS \u2014 but not to its additional buttons (the two R buttons near the triggers, and the two rear paddles). If you\u2019d prefer to use the controller\u2019s built-in button combo to reassign in-game commands to any of its buttons, that\u2019s easy to do, per the instructions in its PDF manual.\n\nThis adapter goes into the Switch 2\u2019s dock (or directly into the console, if you have a USB-A to C adapter). Connecting your controller is as easy as putting it into pairing mode, then ensuring that the \u201cPro Controller Wired Communication\u201d option is turned on within the console\u2019s settings. Click and hold the adapter\u2019s coin-shaped button to initiate pairing, then you should be good to go. The DualSense\u2019s rumble and motion controls work seamlessly, and you can remap buttons as you please within the console\u2019s OS, just like you would an official Switch controller.\n\nThe best, slimmest zip-up case you should buy is made by Tomtoc. Compared to the Belkin hard zip-up case that I got my hands on before the Switch 2\u2019s launch, the Tomtoc FancyCase slim case feels more durable; anecdotally, it holds up much better to being squeezed by hand. It even has more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2 sticks, so it\u2019ll never press them in on accident. Like most zip-up cases, it features a screen cover that doubles as cartridge storage. This one can hold 12 cartridges.\n\nBy using a display-equipped USB-C cable with a wattage reading, I was able to see that the Switch 2 usually pulls a maximum of about 15-17W of power (sometimes less) from a USB-C battery during gameplay. When the system was asleep, the rate went down to between 8-13W, fluctuating at different points during the charging process. From a totally dead state, the console took almost 90 minutes to reach 69 percent with a 20W battery plugged into it. You\u2019ll likely drain your USB-C battery more quickly if you\u2019re playing as you charge.",

      "text": "You might find it kind of sad to put a hard-earned gadget into a protective case. To me, it\u2019s freeing. Using a case relieves me of the worry that it will accumulate tons of little scratches. So, I wasted no time testing cases on the new Nintendo Switch 2, and it didn\u2019t take long for me to find one that I think is the best.\nI tested 13 Switch 2 cases and these are the best\nIncluding cases that protect your Switch 2 as you play, and others that can keep it scratch-free during transit.\nIncluding cases that protect your Switch 2 as you play, and others that can keep it scratch-free during transit.\nI tried several types of cases on the Switch 2. I tested flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I also tried slim cases that have one job: to protect the console when it isn\u2019t in use.\nWhat I look for in a Switch 2 case\nWe use each Switch 2 case as it was designed to be used. We follow the instructions included to get the best fit and protection, noting along the way when a feature works better than expected, or worse. We don\u2019t perform drop tests (I\u2019m using my personal, and thus treasured, Switch 2 unit), but we try our best to find weak points in each case.\nInstalling a case should be easy, not cumbersome. Given the Switch 2\u2019s hybrid design, a multi-step process for attaching a case is expected, but it should be easy to achieve a successful installation every time with little effort.\nSince a lot of tech cases are made before said technology is even publicly available, I\u2019m watching like a hawk to make sure the cases that I try actually fit the Switch 2. Even a millimeter\u2019s difference isn\u2019t good enough for me or you.\nSome cases come with compromises, such as not allowing the Switch 2\u2019s Joy-Con 2 controllers to be detached. Others block the kickstand, and/or prevent the console from fitting into its original dock for playing on a TV. Compromises are fine as long as you know what they are beforehand. I think most people want to access the Switch 2\u2019s unique features, so I\u2019ve focused mostly on picks that retain them, although I may include some picks that limit them.\nI just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it\u2019s in use. However, the bar for slim zip-up/clasp cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables, cartridge storage, or both, ideally.\nAs for my favorite case, I didn\u2019t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that\u2019s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the Dbrand Killswitch is the best model overall. I published a full review of the Killswitch, but the skinny is that while it\u2019s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.\nThe best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play\nThe Good\n- Very secure fit\n- Makes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)\n- Clever dock adapter\nThe Bad\n- Chunky dock adapter\n- Not the most affordable case\n- Front protection only comes in the $80 tier\nThe least expensive Killswitch tier costs $59.95 and includes a rear cover for the console and a small piece to adhere to its kickstand for a matching style, plus Joy-Con 2 grips, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes a skin for your hardware. There\u2019s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it\u2019ll incidentally wiggle off.\nUnfortunately, the Switch 2 console case makes it impossible to fit into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into it, essentially acting as a USB-C extender. It\u2019s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2\u2019s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock\u2019s plastic wall. It\u2019s a little clunky, but I\u2019m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.\nThe tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 \u201cTravel\u201d tier, which includes a semi-transparent travel cover that protects the front of your console during transit, or just for safekeeping when you aren\u2019t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.\nWhen this post originally went live, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn\u2019t allow the Joy-Con 2s\u2019 magnets to break away without pressing their release buttons. Basically, if you held your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion was likely to detach, potentially causing serious damage to the console. Dbrand redesigned the Joy-Con 2 grips to fix the issue, and previous buyers can request a replacement free of charge. Future buyers will receive the Killswitch with the updated, improved grips.\nRunner-up\nGenki\u2019s Attack Vector case is similar in some ways to the Killswitch, as it consists of three pieces: one that goes around the console, and two pieces that wrap around each of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The $49.99 kit improves on the Killswitch with swappable modular grips that come in three sizes to let you customize how the Joy-Con 2 fits in your hand. It follows a small, medium, and large model, with the smallest adding some minor ergonomic benefits, and the largest being what large-handed folks will likely gravitate toward to make the Switch 2 comfier to hold. Its large, palm-filling grip feels as good to use as the Killswitch, but it\u2019s a very close race and I\u2019d be smitten to use either.\nHowever, one notable downside with the Attack Vector is that the Joy-Con 2 sleeves can be pulled off with relative ease, unlike Dbrand\u2019s. Their fit is accurate, technically, and they won\u2019t fall off during normal use. But they\u2019re not as secure as I want them to be.\nAlso, Genki advertises that you can keep the Attack Vector on when you insert your console into the Switch 2 dock, but its launch unit doesn\u2019t work as intended. Genki addressed complaints on forums that the case doesn\u2019t fit the console perfectly, and the fixed model is on its way to me at the time of this update. It will ship a replacement middle piece to all who have already purchased the case, and those who buy the case going forward will receive the fixed product.\nThe best slim, protective Switch 2 cases\nTomtoc\u2019s FancyCase Slim case has recently become my favorite Switch 2 zip-up case. Starting at around $33 and going up to $39 depending on the style that suits you best, it\u2019s not the most affordable option. But it\u2019s worth the cost if you want better protection than either the PowerA or Belkin cases below can provide. It has less give in its middle section by comparison. Another thing that sets it apart are the bulbous sections on the outer cover, which offer more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2\u2019s analog sticks, ensuring they don\u2019t get pressed while your console\u2019s inside. Oh, and it makes color schemes that look like ice cream sandwiches.\nThe FancyCase Slim case is the best option I\u2019ve tried not just for durability but also for a dash of style. That said, it\u2019s short on other perks to justify the price, in case that matters to you. While Belkin\u2019s case features a pocket for storing microSD Express cards, a cable, or any other small trinket like an AirTag to track its location, the only thing inside of this one is what you get in almost any zip-up case: a soft screen-protecting layer that can hold 12 Switch cartridges.\nPower A\u2019s slim zip-up case for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren\u2019t using it. It\u2019s not a hard case, so it won\u2019t survive catastrophic damage, but it\u2019s a fine choice if you don\u2019t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it\u2019s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried.\nAt just $19.99 (half the cost of Nintendo\u2019s official carrying case), baseline protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).\nThis case doesn\u2019t suffer from a negative trait that\u2019s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA\u2019s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the others included in this section.\nFor $10 more ($29.99), Belkin\u2019s slim case is better-looking than PowerA\u2019s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin\u2019s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it\u2019s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2\u2019s triggers, and its outer shell it tough enough to prevent most accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.\nBelkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it\u2019s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that\u2019s included, so you won\u2019t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.\nRunners-up\nJSAUX makes a relatively slim zip-up Switch 2 case that absolutely pops with color. Expressiveness is its main appeal, as this $25.99 case slouches on other features you might want. Once it\u2019s opened, all there is to see is a velcro strap that secures your Switch 2. Underneath it is a fabric tray stitched into the case that can hold 12 game cartridges. Like the Belkin and PowerA cases, this one prevents accidental pressing on the Joy-Con 2 sticks through its shell. It\u2019s a little too light on features to recommend broadly, and it\u2019s thicker than the other models.\nGenki\u2019s $42.99 Sleeper Case is a very tough soft case. Its wool-wrapped shell doesn\u2019t have nearly as much give as other slim cases. Plus, its screen guard can carry up to 18 cartridges. However, I dislike how much the Switch 2 moves around when you shake the case (the fit is snug if you have the company\u2019s Attack Vector case equipped). Notably, Genki\u2019s Neil Trachy, who handles marketing and media relations, shared with The Verge that a production error may impact how well its zipper works in the long run, and that a free fix is coming in late July for all who\u2019ve already purchased one (the updated case is on its way to me at the time of this update for testing). The fix will be implemented for all future purchasers of the case.\n\u201cOur Sleeper Case was upgraded to a waterproof zipper last minute and unbeknownst to our production team, the adhesives used were not binding well to the zipper. [...] While the case is still rock solid, the weak point will be the glue that holds it all in place.\u201d\nThe best form-fitting shells for the Switch 2 in handheld mode\nThe Killswitch is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.\nIf you don\u2019t ever plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it\u2019ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.\nThe $29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor is a suitable option. It fits around every nook and port of the Switch 2, with openings for its speakers and air intake. It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you\u2019ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its original dock.\nWhat\u2019s coming next?\nThis case features many of the qualities that I like about the Dbrand Killswitch for a lot less ($29.99 versus $59.99), even one-upping it by being able to fit into the Switch 2\u2019s original dock without the need for an adapter. I look forward to testing it when it launches.\nUpdate, August 4th: Adjusted pricing details as necessary. Added the Tomtoc FancyCase Slim case to this guide, and mentioned that Genki\u2019s updated Attack Vector and Sleeper Case are on their way to me for testing.\nMost Popular\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- GitHub is no longer independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Ditching my phone for an LTE smartwatch was a humbling experience"

      "text": "The new $84.99 Pro Controller for the Switch 2 may not be your idea of a pro-grade controller \u2014 perhaps not by a long shot. But it\u2019s certainly more of one than Nintendo\u2019s $69.99 last-gen controller. It has two extra buttons embedded into its grips (one on each side), which can be programmed on a per-game basis, a 3.5mm headphone jack for listening to games or GameChat chatter, and a more premium look and feel. It\u2019s no DualSense Edge, but it\u2019s pro enough for me.\nNintendo\u2019s Switch 2 Pro Controller is pro enough for me\nA new controller for the small hands club. Its exclusive features might tempt you into upgrading, minor as they are.\nA new controller for the small hands club. Its exclusive features might tempt you into upgrading, minor as they are.\nI like that Nintendo kept almost everything the same from its predecessor, except the semi-transparent smoke black shell that hid a secret message: the Fisher Price-sized face buttons, the snappy directional pad, and the compact form factor are all here. I don\u2019t want to generalize, but its size might be perfect for the same crowd who yearns for small phones, those who typically experience hand pain from using the controllers that Sony or Microsoft put out. It has the other trappings that made the last-gen Pro controller worth buying, like Amiibo NFC support and motion controls.\nIn terms of what\u2019s new in the Switch 2-edition of the Pro Controller, I hope you weren\u2019t holding your breath for eight years waiting for Hall effect or TMR joysticks because they aren\u2019t here. Instead, we have drift-prone potentiometer joysticks again, albeit some of the smoothest and quietest ones that I\u2019ve ever used. There\u2019s so little resistance required to move them, yet they don\u2019t easily register unintentional inputs. We\u2019ll see how well they fare over time. For what it\u2019s worth, my original Pro Controller from 2017 is still kicking.\nThe Good\n- Small and comfortable to use\n- Great rear button implementation\n- Audio via 3.5mm jack\u2026finally\nThe Bad\n- Expensive\n- No drift-proof joysticks\nThis controller, like the Switch 2\u2019s right Joy-Con, features a dedicated GameChat button. This button launches the namesake feature, which is free for all Switch 2 owners to use through March 31st, 2026, when it will be gated behind the Nintendo Switch Online paywall. The good news for this controller is, whether you want to use GameChat now or ever, you can reprogram the \u201cC\u201d button to do whatever you\u2019d like it to do. You won\u2019t lose out on GameChat functionality, as there\u2019s a dedicated home menu option for the feature.\nThe new controller offers some conveniences not found in the predecessor, which may tempt you into upgrading. As mentioned, the Switch 2 Pro Controller has a 3.5mm headphone jack, from which it can output game and GameChat audio to wired headphones or a headset. The ability to stream audio wirelessly from the console to the controller is a big deal for Nintendo, even though it already figured it out in the Wii U Gamepad. Note: the LED player indicator has been moved to the top of the Switch 2 Pro Controller to make room for the 3.5mm jack.\nAnother, albeit smaller, feature is the ability to wake up the Switch 2 console from sleep with the new Pro Controller. This seems like a sneaky way for Nintendo to bait players into upgrading their last-gen controllers. Wake from sleep is a basic feature, one that shouldn\u2019t be limited to this controller. It\u2019s handy if you typically play your Switch while it\u2019s docked to your TV. Wake from sleep wasn\u2019t utilized in most third-party controllers during the original Switch era, but 8BitDo figured out a way to enable it by shaking some of its controllers. So, it\u2019s always possible that there will soon be cheaper solutions that figure a way around this annoying issue.\nYes, your DualSense can work on a Switch 2\nIf you buy the 8BitDo USB Adapter 2, update it via the company\u2019s app, and plug it into your Switch 2, you can wirelessly connect a DualSense, a new Xbox controller, or a number of older models to it. It\u2019s a cheaper alternative to buying a new controller that gets you 75 percent of the functionality of a Switch Pro controller. There\u2019s rumble, gyroscopic controls in games that support it (on DualSense, not the Xbox controller), and remappable controls. You\u2019ll only be missing out on Amiibo support, 3.5mm audio passthrough, and the wake to sleep feature.\nBoth this controller and the new Joy-Con 2 feature what Nintendo calls HD Rumble 2, an improved version of the tactile rumble introduced with the original Switch. I already thought HD Rumble was nifty in some use cases, and my opinion hasn\u2019t changed as I\u2019ve played Mario Kart World and Switch 2 Edition of Tears of the Kingdom. HD Rumble seemed novel, if not a bit gimmicky, until the introduction of the DualSense and its brilliant haptics in Astro\u2019s Playroom and in several other titles since. The new Switch 2 haptics aren\u2019t on the same level, at least in the launch games.\nThe GL and GR buttons are arguably my favorite implementation of rear paddles in a controller. While most companies put them on the backside of the gamepad, a place where I rarely rest my fingers, these are curved, wrapping around the grips where my middle fingers naturally rest. Pressing them requires essentially no effort \u2014 you don\u2019t even need to arch your fingers to tap the buttons. It\u2019s easy enough to press them in with the meat of my second knuckle by applying some downward pressure. It rules.\nIf any of the aforementioned additions sound appealing to you, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is probably worth its cost. Yes, I wish it had more futureproof joysticks, and perhaps another feature or two to justify its tariff-boosted price (it was originally $79.99). It\u2019s very likely that third-party controller manufacturers like 8BitDo, GameSir, GuliKit, and others will make options with most, if not all, of the same features at a lower price \u2013 so while the Switch 2 Pro Controller is the best option right now, that might not always be the case.\nRelated:\nMost Popular\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- GitHub is no longer independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Ditching my phone for an LTE smartwatch was a humbling experience"

      "text": "I\u2019ve been checking out a lot of new Switch 2 accessories recently, almost all of which were produced before the companies that made them ever touched a real Switch 2. Even a millimeter\u2019s difference in dimensions could completely throw off a design, and some products I\u2019ve tried lack a perfect fit. For example, Genki\u2019s Attack Vector has problems, which the company is now reworking. It\u2019s probably not the only one. However, Dbrand\u2019s Killswitch kit offers the best fit and best protection right out of the gate.\nDbrand\u2019s Killswitch is the best all-around Switch 2 case\nThe $79.85 \u201cTravel\u201d tier offers complete protection, but even the $59.95 version is great.\nThe $79.85 \u201cTravel\u201d tier offers complete protection, but even the $59.95 version is great.\nI adored the kit when I tested it on my Steam Deck, and this one doesn\u2019t mess with the winning formula. Dbrand had to engineer its own USB-C dock adapter since a Killswitch-equipped console doesn\u2019t fit in Nintendo\u2019s dock. Its adapter is included, with no cutbacks to visual fidelity in docked mode. It\u2019s a little clunky, but I\u2019m mainly just happy that it works, so I don\u2019t have to take the Killswitch off every time I want to dock the Switch 2.\nThe most basic \u201cEssentials\u201d kit is $59.95 and includes a grippy, form-fitting shell that latches around the Switch 2\u2019s back, slightly latching around the front. It can be secured to your console with some small adhesive strips. A separate, adhesive-backed strip of protection for the kickstand comes with the kit, too. Dbrand includes two Joy-Con 2 shells that have thick, textured grips that make them significantly more comfortable to use without adding too much weight. Unlike Joy-Con shells from other accessory makers, these were as easy to install as I hoped they would be, sliding securely into place thanks to the Killswitch\u2019s tough, but just-malleable-enough materials.\nThe $79.85 \u201cTravel\u201d option adds a tough latch-on cover that protects the front of your Switch 2, and a tray that fits within it for storing up to 10 game cartridges. Of the cases I\u2019ve tried so far, I have the fewest reservations about putting my Switch 2 in this one. With the front cover on, it provides hard case protection. When detached, it offers solid protection with an understated look for the parts of the Switch 2 that are most vulnerable to damage.\nThe most expensive $99.80 \u201cUltra\u201d kit includes everything mentioned above, plus additional stick grips and two glass screen protectors. The added cost isn\u2019t outrageous if you still need a screen protector.\nThe Killswitch is great. I often forget that it\u2019s installed. I thought I\u2019d miss the console\u2019s slim design, arguably one of its biggest selling points compared to chunkier handhelds like the Steam Deck. But, after mainly using a Deck instead of the aging Switch, I\u2019m spoiled by big grips, and the Killswitch turns the Switch 2 into something that I want to use in handheld mode.\nMost Popular\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- GitHub is no longer independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Ditching my phone for an LTE smartwatch was a humbling experience"

      "text": "The Nintendo Switch may be remembered as much for repopularizing portable gaming as it will for a hardware issue that affected millions of gamers: joystick drift.\nQuantum mechanics might have the solution to joystick drift\nAfter improving hard drives, tunneling magnetoresistance technology could put an end to joystick drift.\nAfter improving hard drives, tunneling magnetoresistance technology could put an end to joystick drift.\nDrifting is the most common term for an issue where joysticks detect false inputs \u2014 even when no one is touching a controller \u2014 causing unwanted movements to happen in a game. The issue also affects controllers from Sony, Microsoft, and third-party accessory makers.\nHall effect sensors emerged a few years ago as a potential solution to the problem, but there\u2019s an even better option out there that\u2019s easier to retrofit into existing controller designs. That solution is tunneling magnetoresistance, or TMR, a technology that revolutionized hard drives two decades ago using quantum mechanics and magnets.\nLike Hall effect sensors, TMR sensors avoid the fundamental problem with more traditional joysticks: their sensors wear down as a matter of their design. The controllers that ship with the last few Xbox consoles, the PS4 and PS5, and the Switch are all built around sensors like this \u2014 potentiometers, a component that can be used to change or measure electrical resistance.\nSolid objects rubbing against each other isn\u2019t an ideal approach to longevity\nAs iFixit explained in 2021, inside the two potentiometers that are used to detect up-and-down and side-to-side movements in each joystick is a semicircular strip of carbon film with terminals at each end that pass an electrical current through it. As the joystick is moved, a component called a wiper slides back and forth along this strip, measuring the voltage where it makes contact. Since the voltage predictably changes across the length of the strip, the wiper\u2019s voltage measurements can be used to accurately measure the movements of a joystick.\nBut solid objects rubbing against each other isn\u2019t an ideal approach to longevity. That strip of carbon film inside a joystick\u2019s potentiometer can wear down over time, affecting the flow of current and the accuracy of voltage measurements. Dirt on the film, either from moving components wearing down or dust and food crumbs finding their way inside a controller, can also contribute to inaccurate measurement and drift.\nThat\u2019s why controller manufacturers are now turning to sensors that don\u2019t rely on components rubbing together: Hall effect and TMR, both of which rely on magnetism instead. As iFixit explains, Hall effect joysticks replace resistive strips and wipers with magnets and sensors that never make contact, using a phenomenon first discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.\nInside a Hall effect sensor is a conductive material called a \u201cHall element\u201d that has an electrical current flowing through it. Normally, electrons flow straight through this conductor, but the presence of a magnetic field can interfere and divert the electrons to either side, like an invisible obstacle diverting the flow of water in a stream. As the magnet attached to the joystick moves closer and farther away, the Hall effect sensor measures the resulting voltage changes in the conductor. Those measurements are translated into movements in a game with more accuracy and reliability than you get with potentiometers, and without any wear and tear.\nHall effect sensors have been in use for over 50 years \u2014 and were even used by Sega in the Saturn 3D and Dreamcast\u2019s controllers that debuted in the mid-\u201990s. GuliKit repopularized the use of Hall effect sensors in gaming hardware after debuting a controller with it at E3 2021. But they\u2019re still not widely used in gaming hardware because potentiometer-based joysticks are cheaper to manufacture. They also have higher power demands, which is something controller manufacturers need to account for.\nWhat makes the TMR effect useful in electronics isn\u2019t the tunneling itself\nThe solution for that may be TMR sensors, which come out of more recent discoveries. In 1988, physicists Albert Fert and Peter Gr\u00fcnberg independently discovered a phenomenon called the giant magnetoresistance effect (GMR), which earned them both the Nobel Prize for physics in 2007. They found that the presence of a magnetic field applied to ultra-thin films made up of a conductor \u2014 such as copper or aluminum just a few nanometers thick \u2014 sandwiched between two magnetic materials would affect the direction of spin of electrons and their ability to easily flow from one side of the film to the other.\n\u201cIf you put two magnets right next to each other\u2026 very close to each other with a spacer material, if the magnets on this one have a spin A and the same spin is on the other one, it\u2019s easy for the electrons to move to the next one. But if the other one has a misaligned spin\u2026 the electrons want to move, but there\u2019s no easy way to move the other electrons as well, and that causes a change of resistance,\u201d Riyan Mendonsa, senior staff engineer at Seagate, explained to The Verge.\nTMR works in a very similar way to GMR. The presence of a magnetic field aligns the spin direction of electrons, making it easier for them to flow from one side to the other. But while GMR uses a conductive material sandwiched between two magnetic layers, TMR, counterintuitively, uses an insulating material that acts as a deliberate barrier.\nTo flow from one side of the film to the other, electrons rely on a quantum mechanical phenomenon called quantum tunneling to pass through that in-between insulator. The idea of particles passing through a barrier they shouldn\u2019t be able to is not easy to wrap your head around, but it can happen when certain materials \u2014 such as aluminum or magnesium oxide \u2014 are just a few atoms thick. And thanks to physicists like Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, the phenomenon isn\u2019t a complete mystery. We have equations that can accurately predict when it will occur.\nWhat makes the TMR effect useful in electronics isn\u2019t the tunneling itself. It\u2019s that adding and removing a magnetic field produces a measurable change in resistance. For years, hard drives relied on read heads with a design similar to the wire coils used in speakers and microphones, according to Mendonsa. In 2005, Seagate adopted TMR technology in read heads, which could not only be made much smaller but also were far more sensitive at detecting the presence of a magnetic field.\n\u201cTMR sensors generally have higher sensitivity and more linear response compared to Hall effect sensors.\u201d\nThis allowed the magnetic bits on hard drives to also be made much smaller, dramatically increasing the density and storage capacities of 2.5-inch drives to 120GB. Various forms of TMR technology are expected to still be used in hard drive manufacturing for years to come.\nAlthough the underlying science is different, Hall effect and TMR sensors can both be used to detect a joystick\u2019s movements through the use of non-contact magnets, but TMR sensors have some key advantages.\n\u201cTMR sensors generally have higher sensitivity and more linear response compared to Hall effect sensors,\u201d says Jack He, GuliKit\u2019s business director. That could allow for the use of smaller magnets, making TMR joysticks easier to manufacture. But leveraging the higher sensitivity for improved joystick accuracy will depend on manufacturers and the hardware they use. \u201cThe resolution mainly depends on the sampling precision of the backend MCU, and is not closely related to the joystick itself,\u201d says He.\nCompared to Hall effect sensors, TMR sensors typically have lower power consumption, but the advantage there isn\u2019t improved battery life. \u201cThe original design of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo game controllers uses traditional resistive film joystick technology with a constant power supply design, with a power capacity limited to about 1 mA,\u201d He says. Hall sensors can consume anywhere from 0.5mA to up to 2mA of power, while TMR sensors only consume between 0.1mA and 0.3mA. This allows joysticks with TMR sensors to be installed on current controller hardware \u201cas a perfect 1:1 replacement without any other circuit modifications.\u201d That could help speed up adoption and bring down the price of the technology by simplifying manufacturing.\nTMR sensors also offer more performance stability over a wider temperature range \u2014 an advantage that\u2019s especially useful for a product often being gripped by warm hands for several hours.\nAlthough the TMR technology hasn\u2019t yet been adopted by companies like Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony, there are several third-party manufacturers already selling gamepads with TMR joysticks, including PB Tails\u2019 Crush controller, GameSir\u2019s Tarantula Pro, and 8BitDo, which uses it in its new Ultimate 2 controller. In 2024, GuliKit was the first company to release upgrade kits bringing the TMR technology to PS5, PS4, Xbox, and Switch controllers.\nBut it will still be a few years for TMR technology to become mainstream in gaming hardware. \u201cTMR sensors are often more expensive than traditional Hall effect sensors, especially in smaller volumes,\u201d He points out. \u201cHowever, as TMR technology matures, the cost difference is expected to decrease.\u201d\nMost Popular\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- GitHub is no longer independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Ditching my phone for an LTE smartwatch was a humbling experience"

      "text": "Sony\u2019s DualSense Edge is like a director\u2019s cut of a movie that improves on the original vision but costs 185 percent more to watch. Enjoyment is always hard to quantify, but this $199.99 controller (almost the cost of three DualSense gamepads) is stuffed with features that might be worth that extra cost to you, or not.\nSony\u2019s DualSense Edge is a pro controller done (mostly) right\nSlightly worse battery life aside, I\u2019m a big fan of almost everything Sony did to improve on the already-great DualSense.\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nThis may help you figure it out: have you ever, during the PS5\u2019s going on three years of existence, wished for a controller with back paddles, swappable analog stick modules that require no tools to switch, and function keys that let you swap controls and adjust volume without popping in and out of annoying menus? If that\u2019s your bar for saying yes, the DualSense Edge will likely satisfy you since it can do even more than that. There currently isn\u2019t a PS5 controller that matches it, though the $219.99 Scuf Reflex Pro comes closest.\nThe Good\nClever function buttons\nThe Bad\nWorse battery life than the standard DualSense\nMany of the DualSense Edge\u2019s additions that I\u2019ll get into below are impressive, but there\u2019s one area where you\u2019ll actually get worse performance for your money: battery life. My colleague Sean broke the story on the DualSense Edge\u2019s battery life taking a hit compared to the standard model, for which Sony even provided a clarifying statement:\n\u201cThe DualSense Edge wireless controller\u2019s operating time is moderately shorter than the original DualSense wireless controller because we\u2019ve included many more features within the same form factor and ergonomic design as the original DualSense controller. We wanted to strike a good balance between wireless operating time and delivering robust, high-performance features.\u201d\nWhat does \u201cmoderately shorter\u201d look like in real-world testing? Not as bad as I feared, but still not great for a $200 controller. It\u2019s not so short that I\u2019ve been able to easily drain it several times during the review period. After switching between a mix of PS4 and PS5 games with vibration and adaptive trigger settings at maximum intensity (and taking advantage of every feature I could), I got about eight hours and change of battery life before it disconnected, which is just a couple hours fewer than I usually get with my DualSense controller from the PS5\u2019s launch. I asked Sony how long the battery should last if you choose not to use any of its new features, and I\u2019ll update this review once I hear back.\nThis controller closely mimics what Microsoft\u2019s $179.99 Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 includes and is capable of, with some variations. Starting with the hardware, the DualSense Edge comes in a hard case that lets you route its 2.8-meter braided USB-C cable through its back so you can keep it charged and protected. Inside, there are a total of four back paddles (two sets of different lengths and designs) and four extra analog stick toppers (two short convex heads and two tall convex heads).\nIf you choose to play wired versus wirelessly, Sony includes a unique locking mechanism for keeping the cable physically latched to the controller, so it can\u2019t be yanked out during a crucial match. The case has room for a spare analog stick module in case you\u2019re concerned that drift may become an issue down the line for the two modules pre-installed on the controller. (A likely possibility.) These are $20 per module to replace.\nThere\u2019s a QR code printed on the inside of the case, which takes you to an online instruction manual. I\u2019ve asked Sony if it plans to sell DualSense Edge accessories through this QR code as well as if other components can be purchased separately but it didn\u2019t respond before publication.\nAs someone who still enjoys using the original DualSense, I was curious (and plenty dubious) how the $200 Edge might improve on it. Like my colleague Sean Hollister said in his hands-on, it looks and feels almost exactly the same. It weighs 46 grams more, actually, but the Edge is so well-balanced I couldn\u2019t feel any weight difference at all until I compared the two on a scale. Sony added some grip to the rear part of the grips and to the rear triggers, which are nice touches that I expect at this price. Compared to the standard DualSense, the Edge has black face buttons (which feel exactly the same to press but are more lovely to look at), and its faceplate is glossy instead of matte-textured. Also, the Edge\u2019s touchpad is covered in Sony\u2019s tiny little face button symbols, not just the grips.\nA pop-up greets you the first time you connect the DualSense Edge to a PS5, and subsequent menus chauffeur you through its myriad features. It\u2019s a little overwhelming at first, but the best way to get comfortable is to just start experimenting with the tools and new buttons. The first buttons that I noticed, which eventually became my favorite addition, are the two function keys located beneath each analog stick.\nYou\u2019ll get a lot of use out of them if you want to make custom control schemes for your games. The controller can access up to four control layers with remapped buttons and analog stick deadzones and sensitivity levels. You can name each preset and assign it to a face button (cross, square, circle, or triangle). Crucially, you can flip between them without having to leave your game. An OS-level notification pops up to let you know what layer you\u2019ve switched to, and the controller gives a jolt of haptic feedback, though you can customize the level of feedback you want. For when you eventually move onto new games, overwriting and renaming schemes is simple, too.\nThe Fn + options button combo is a lifesaver since it launches right into the control scheme customization window, letting you easily remap controls within a scheme if something isn\u2019t to your liking. Pressing that combo again quickly takes you back to your game. What\u2019s even better is that the function keys can control audio without menu surfing. Just hold one and press up or down on the directional pad to adjust volume, or press left to right to tweak game / chat audio balance. However, this only seemed to work with wired 3.5mm headphones, not the wireless options that I tried out. (This includes even Sony\u2019s Pulse 3D headset.) I\u2019ve asked Sony if this feature can operate with any wireless headsets, or if it\u2019s wired-only feature.\nI\u2019ve never gotten accustomed to back paddles on controllers (I typically avoid using them even on my Steam Deck), though I like Sony\u2019s approach here, partly because there\u2019s no right or wrong way to attach them. For instance, you can put the bumpers made for the left side on the right side, or use a combination of the longer lever paddles and half-dome paddles, or use just one of them. That freedom of customization is nice to have. In terms of execution, they\u2019re simple to install, fitting into a slot and fastening via magnets. They\u2019re satisfyingly clicky yet quiet.\nI might actually stick with these back paddles because \u2014 and I\u2019m curious if I\u2019m alone in thinking this \u2014 the controls in Sony\u2019s first-party games (Ghost of Tsushima and God of War Ragnor\u00f6k come to mind) have some of the toughest to learn patterns in recent memory. That\u2019s partly because some buttons have secondary functions when pressed with other inputs, including those that are hard to reach in the heat of battle. Your mileage may vary, but these paddles made a noticeable difference to me in God of War specifically, where, for example, I could parry with the right paddle instead of L1, then use the left paddle to start aiming Kratos\u2019 Leviathan ax instead of holding down a trigger. They come in handy if you prefer driving with manual transmission in Gran Turismo 7, making them feel a bit like clutch paddles in a car\u2026 if you use your imagination a bit.\nThe replaceable analog stick heads were more fun to use than I expected. This is far from the first controller to offer this feature, but I quickly fell in love with these particular domed caps because they look and feel exactly as I remember the DualShock 2 feeling but better since they come in multiple heights here. Those come off with a tug. Within the PS5 operating system, you can tweak their sensitivity and deadzone and save these settings to a custom control scheme.\nThat these analog sticks can be removed entirely is one of the DualSense Edge\u2019s biggest selling points. Accessing them requires you to slide the \u201cRelease\u201d slider on the controller\u2019s back (which is impossible to do on accident and sometimes tricky to do with intention), popping off its glossy black faceplate. To release each stick module, a heavy-duty lever must be lifted. In case you\u2019re curious, it won\u2019t let you play games with just one stick installed \u2014 I tried!\nFrom a repairability standpoint, it\u2019s wonderful that this $200 controller doesn\u2019t need to go back to Sony for a simple analog stick fix. However, its solution isn\u2019t totally bulletproof. We confirmed that these use the same potentiometer sticks as the regular DualSense, though Sony\u2019s $20 price per module isn\u2019t terrible. It\u2019ll start selling those on January 26th at its online store and through other retailers in late February.\nI\u2019m cautiously optimistic about the modular design\u2019s future, however, for one reason. Sony could decide to make analog stick modules with hall effect sensors, which wouldn\u2019t have the same risk of drifting. These are already used in some modern controllers like 8BitDo\u2019s Ultimate Bluetooth model and the GuliKit KingKong 2 as well as older ones like the trusty Dreamcast controller. GuliKit also makes Joy-Con-ready joystick replacements, which I can\u2019t wait to try out. The main reason why they last longer and don\u2019t exhibit the same issues is that they don\u2019t physically rub on a sensor like the potentiometer sticks used in most controllers. Instead, they rely on magnets that can alter electrical current as you move them. (This iFixit video sums up the specifics nicely.) In this way, sticks with hall effect sensors are more accurate, and they don\u2019t inherently get worse over time. The company declined to comment when my colleague Sean asked Sony if it considered using them. But come on. Let\u2019s do this, Sony.\nOf course, the DualSense Edge wouldn\u2019t be a modern pro controller without adjustable stops on its rear triggers to tweak how far they can be pressed, and thankfully, it has those. Each trigger has a switch that offers three steps of travel: full travel, half travel, and very minimal travel. Which one is right for you basically comes down to preference and how quickly you want to be able to execute something in a game. For first-person shooters, the hair trigger setting will give you a faster response time because, well, the trigger doesn\u2019t have to move as far. There are plenty of games where you may still want the full trigger pull based on feel \u2014 and if you want the adaptive trigger functionality to remain. (It switches off when you shorten the pull of the triggers.)\nAfter spending as much time as I could with the DualSense Edge\u2019s main features, there were a few interesting takeaways:\n- Tweaking the trigger stop means that games with alternative functions that activate with a half-press (like Returnal\u2019s weaponry that has two firing functions) won\u2019t work. It\u2019ll skip the half step and activate the fully pressed state. Thankfully, you can just flip the switches to adjust depending on the game, but that can be tough to do quickly.\n- You can disable more buttons than I expected through the DualSense Edge menu, including the touchpad\u2019s surface, its clickable button, the options and share buttons, and the PS button itself. (The standard DualSense doesn\u2019t let you disable these, but Sony should change that.) This way, you won\u2019t accidentally hit a button that\u2019ll take you out of the game in a tense match.\n- The tactile touchpad button and the options button can be remapped to any trigger or face button, though the PS and share buttons cannot be.\n- As mentioned above, once a trigger stop is customized, the adaptive trigger functionality is gone. So keep them in their default place if you enjoy games that take control of the adaptive triggers.\nEarlier, I compared the DualSense Edge to the Xbox Elite Series 2. While both include a similarly comprehensive set of accessories, it\u2019s not a one-to-one showdown when it comes to features (besides that they\u2019re made for two different gaming platforms). The Elite Series 2 wins with its thumbsticks that have adjustable tension, swappable directional pads, and much longer 40-hour battery life, but it\u2019s otherwise a close match. In the realm of PS5 controllers, the Scuf Reflex Pro has the hallmark DualSense features (haptics, adaptive triggers) and features four removable back paddles. However, it costs more and has fewer customization options and a shorter half-year warranty.\nDue to its customizable nature, this controller might appeal to people who are searching for a more accessible option. While the standard DualSense allows for close to a full remapping of controls, the Edge\u2019s swappable stick height, tweakable triggers, and function shortcuts might help some more people who have disabilities. If you need a more accessible controller, you may want to hold off and see if Sony\u2019s Project Leonardo accessibility controller lives up to the hype. It was announced at CES 2023 in January, and it\u2019s built specifically to support more ways to play, including industry standard 3.5mm inputs for physical switches. We still don\u2019t know the price for that one.\nIt\u2019s great that Sony is finally expanding its first-party lineup to help more gamers play their own way. The company has come a long way since its Back Button Attachment launched for the PS4\u2019s DualShock 4 controller, which afforded you two customizable back paddles. Buying a DualSense Edge isn\u2019t a must for people who are satisfied with what the standard controller offers, and I do wish that the Edge had longer battery life.\nTo that end, the DualSense (for now) is the better option if you play games on PC. The Edge is recognized as a PS5 controller on Steam, but you presently can\u2019t switch profiles or take advantage of the back paddles (I\u2019ve asked Sony when it plans to add full PC support for its customization features, if ever). Still, if you want a pro-grade controller for your PS5 and don\u2019t mind taking a slight hit in the battery department, you\u2019ll probably be happy owning the DualSense Edge.\nMost Popular\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- GitHub is no longer independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Ditching my phone for an LTE smartwatch was a humbling experience"

It was a weird mystery, a wild west, and webcam makers had to figure it out on their own.\nMany didn\u2019t even have a Switch 2 to test with, my sources tell me, and had to compete with consumers to buy the fastest-selling game console of all time. Nor did Nintendo provide compatibility guidelines, it seems, as manufacturers like Elgato and Ugreen had to reverse-engineer why their seemingly compatible cameras weren\u2019t showing up when they plugged them in.\nBut that mystery now seems to be solved \u2014 the answers are not what we expected! \u2014 and manufacturers are now seemingly free to update any of their firmware-updatable webcams and make them compatible with the new Switch.\nLogitech doesn\u2019t seem to be promising an update for the Brio 4K. \u201cBrio 4K is built with the security features of Windows Hello that are not supported on the Switch 2 anyway,\u201d Lewis tells The Verge.\nBut again, all its other webcams reportedly work \u2014 which won\u2019t be all that surprising to anyone who\u2019s been following the webcam saga. When Nintendo and webcam makers weren\u2019t originally able to provide lists of working webcams, Redditors crowdsourced their own list, which includes far more working webcams from Logitech than any other manufacturer.\nA few Redditors say you can even get the Brio 4K working if you want, with a firmware downgrade. Do that at your own risk, though.\nSo far, Elgato and Ugreen have committed to upgrading specific cameras to work with the Nintendo Switch 2. Obsbot has generically confirmed it will do some sort of firmware updates, and Insta360 is still looking into it.

      "text": "The first Switch was such a hit that Nintendo decided not to mess with a good thing. Instead of releasing a successor that feels like a generational leap or a pivot in a new direction, it\u2019s following up the hugely successful original with the Switch 2 \u2014 a welcome upgrade that largely sticks to the formula. It looks about the same, works about the same, and plays most of the same games. It\u2019s the Switch, just better.\nNintendo Switch 2 review: exactly good enough\nAfter defining a new category with the original Switch, Nintendo is content sticking with what works.\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nNintendo\u2019s bet is that it doesn\u2019t have to wow people all over again, and so it made a sequel that\u2019s only as good as it needs to be. After spending a week with the new console, I\u2019ve realized that good enough is exactly what the Switch needed.\nA refined (and bigger) Nintendo Switch\nFundamentally, the concept of the Switch hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s still a tablet with a split controller stuck on either side, with a dock that connects to your television.\nBut the idea has been refined. The Switch 2 is much bigger, for one thing. It now has a 7.9-inch LCD panel, up from the original\u2019s 6.2 inches, making it great for playing text-heavy games. It also means the entire device has become larger as a result, now weighing in at a comparatively hefty 1.18 pounds with the controllers attached. The larger size hasn\u2019t bothered me, though your mileage may vary. My 12-year-old keeps stealing it to play Pok\u00e9mon and hasn\u2019t complained. But she\u2019ll do anything for more screentime.\nThe Good\n- Improved hardware and display\n- Faster load times\n- New social features\n- It plays Mario Kart\nThe Bad\n- Disappointing battery life\n- Few first-party Switch 2 games at launch\n- No standout feature\nThere are some other nice upgrades. Like the most recent OLED model of the original Switch, the Switch 2 has a kickstand that can prop the system up at a wide range of angles, and the updated version feels a little sturdier to me, making it great for playing in tabletop mode. It\u2019s a huge improvement over the original Switch\u2019s flimsy kickstand. The Switch 2 also adds a second USB-C port to the top of the console, which enables you to plug in a webcam for online play. It\u2019s handy for attaching a charger or battery pack whichever way is most convenient, too.\nWhat you get with that larger and heavier device is games that look and run better. The handheld\u2019s screen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution, which supports HDR10 and VRR up to 120Hz. It\u2019s bright and crisp, and games look a lot smoother thanks to the higher refresh rate. But I do miss the more vibrant OLED display of the most recent iteration of the original Switch, which featured deeper blacks and more contrast-y images. The new screen is a huge leap from the original, but it isn\u2019t an all-around improvement if you\u2019ve been using the OLED for a while.\nThe story is different when connected to your TV: the Switch 2 can finally output at 4K, with support for HDR10. You\u2019ll need to play supported games to really take advantage of this, but it\u2019s immediately noticeable how much crisper everything from text to gameplay is. HDR promises to make games more vibrant, though there doesn\u2019t seem to be a standout game to show this off just yet.\nGames are bigger this generation, too. Nintendo has increased the internal storage size to 256GB, but you\u2019ll need to be diligent with how you use it; Cyberpunk 2077, for example, takes up 59GB on its own. Expanding that storage means buying a new and relatively expensive microSD Express card; your old microSD cards won\u2019t work.\nMore annoying is that the battery life is worse than the original Switch. Nintendo estimates between two and six and a half hours of gameplay on a single charge, and I found my device dying around the lower end of that spectrum, especially when playing more intensive games like Cyberpunk. That\u2019s not a great sign for the future if the Switch 2 continues to get more demanding games.\nSome of this owes to the fact that this is simply a much more capable console. It\u2019s built around a new Nvidia chip, custom designed for the Switch 2, and offering modern features like DLSS and ray tracing. There\u2019s more RAM. The internal storage is faster. This is why the Switch 2 is able to run a game as demanding as Cyberpunk; it\u2019s also why the Switch 2\u2019s battery might die after a short two-hour stint.\nThe Switch 2 also has slightly redesigned Joy-Con controllers. They\u2019re functionally mostly the same, but bigger and with a few small upgrades, like more subtle vibrations. They connect via magnets now, which are less fiddly than the previous rail design. Nintendo says that the joysticks have been redesigned, too, but they still aren\u2019t using anti-drift Hall effect sensors. That means there\u2019s a chance owners will once again be dealing with the dreaded Joy-Con drift that plagued the original Switch.\nAs similar as they are, the Joy-Con also introduces some of the truly new elements of the Switch 2.\nTo start, the right Joy-Con has an all-new button dedicated entirely to Nintendo\u2019s GameChat social features. Chatting with friends while playing games isn\u2019t a new concept, but Nintendo has finally made it not only a core but a relatively painless part of its user experience. You simply pull up the app, and you can see what friends are online and what they\u2019re playing.\nFor the most part, it works as advertised. It\u2019s easy to connect, voices come in clear through the Switch 2\u2019s built-in mic, and video looks fine over the USB camera from Nintendo, which is sold separately. (The Switch 2 also supports an unclear number of third-party webcams.) This is a huge upgrade over Nintendo\u2019s old way of doing things, where you needed to download a separate Nintendo Switch Online app onto your phone and use that secondary device to chat.\nThe one flaw I\u2019ve noticed with the new system is that screensharing \u2014 in which, for instance, four people can share their gameplay in Mario Kart World while they race against each other \u2014 looks choppy and ugly, to the point that I stopped using it.\nThe redesigned Joy-Con controllers also introduce a new control option. By turning the Joy-Con on its side and placing it down on a flat surface, you\u2019re able to use it like a mouse. Unfortunately, the Switch 2 doesn\u2019t come with a next-gen version of Mario Paint to show all the mouse clicking possibilities, but I spent some time with the Switch 2 update of Civilization VII to test it out. And while it took some getting used to, I found the Switch 2\u2019s mouse controls worked surprisingly well. This may not be as true in a twitchy first-person shooter where every millimeter matters, but for turn-based strategy, the mouse was a big improvement over a standard controller layout.\nIn a nice touch, using the mouse is seamless; you don\u2019t choose the option from a menu, you simply turn the Joy-Con on its side, place it down, and it begins mouse mode. This makes it easy to swap between control options on the fly. You also don\u2019t need to use the mouse on a completely flat surface like a table or desk. I was able to play Civ just fine moving the Joy-Con around on my thigh.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t particularly comfortable to play that way for extended periods. So it\u2019s hard to see it as something I\u2019ll use often.\nSo yes, the Switch 2 is exactly what it sounds like hardware-wise: it takes a winning concept and improves on it in subtle ways, and mostly doesn\u2019t mess with what already worked. None of the changes are a huge leap, nor are any of the issues dealbreakers.\nA launch lineup that mixes old and new\nOf course, the most important aspect of any system is its games. And the launch lineup for the Switch 2 is a combination of new titles that take advantage of the more powerful hardware and older games that have been updated and are noticeably better compared to the original Switch versions.\nThe best showcase for the console at launch is Mario Kart World. It expands upon its predecessor in ways that Nintendo says weren\u2019t possible on the original Switch. The game takes place in a large, connected open world and doubles the number of racers from 12 to 24. It\u2019s bigger, more ambitious, and more chaotic than any Mario Kart before it, and yet it also runs incredibly well on the Switch 2. It loads fast and the frame rate holds up, even when playing four-player split-screen, which introduces a frankly absurd number of explosions and crashes on your TV at any given moment.\nOutside of that, though, the first-party lineup is surprisingly thin. An impressive-looking Donkey Kong game is coming, but it doesn\u2019t launch until July, so the only other Nintendo-made release is Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, an extremely drab collection of minigames and quizzes designed to teach you about the new console. It\u2019s a nice idea, but the $10 collection is missing the Nintendo charm that can even make folding cardboard into a fun experience.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t anything to play right now, though. There are just a few brand-new games. Many of the highlights of the Switch 2\u2019s launch lineup are games that already exist on other platforms, but were likely too technically demanding for the original Switch. These include the likes of Cyberpunk 2077, Street Fighter 6, and Yakuza 0, all of which look good, run smoothly, and load quickly. The new handheld is not as powerful as other current-generation consoles, let alone a high-end PC, but it\u2019s still pretty remarkable being able to take Night City with you wherever you go, and have it feel good to play, instead of just fine.\nTwo of my favorite launch games take advantage of one of the Switch 2\u2019s best features. Called GameShare, it lets you play select multiplayer games with anyone else nearby with a Switch 2 or original Switch, and it requires only one copy of the game. It\u2019s not perfect \u2014 the second player is essentially streaming the game, and so the visual quality can dip at times \u2014 but it is a very fun way to enjoy co-op games that require a lot of coordination. I used it to play through a chunk of Split Fiction with my wife, and a few hours of Survival Kids with my, uh, kids, and it was a great alternative to couch co-op. We simply sat near each other, barking orders on what needed to be done next.\nWhile the core launch lineup may be lacking, there are a lot of games that have been updated in a significant way to support the Switch 2. Some of these are paid upgrades; I dropped $10 to be able to use those mouse controls in Civ, and it\u2019ll cost you the same to get a much smoother and faster-loading version of Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom. These titles don\u2019t look radically different, but they\u2019re obviously sharper and running smoother; the faster loading times in Zelda may be worth the price of the upgrade alone.\nMany of the free upgrades are just as impressive. I\u2019ve been especially struck by games I\u2019ve already played for hundreds of hours \u2014 Fortnite and No Man\u2019s Sky \u2014 both of which struggled mightily on the original Switch. But on the Switch 2 they look like and play like, well, modern games.\nActually, my favorite launch games might be the oldest of all. One of the benefits for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers on the Switch 2 is the addition of GameCube games. To start, there are only three titles, but they\u2019re excellent ones: The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II (with Link as a playable fighter!), and F-Zero GX. It\u2019s not exactly impressive that a sci-fi racer from 2003 plays fast and smooth on a modern console, but it\u2019s still a nice bonus. And the GameCube has plenty of heavy hitters that will surely round out the service in the coming months. (Mario Kart: Double Dash, please.)\nA new generation that feels much like the last\nIn 2017, there was nothing like the Nintendo Switch. At a time when dedicated handheld gaming devices had seemingly given way to smartphones, and the PS4 and Xbox One era was in full swing, here came Nintendo with an underpowered tablet that doubled as a home console in a way that was simple and intuitive. It proved to be such a success that it revitalized the company into a growing entertainment powerhouse.\nBut eight years later, there\u2019s a lot like the Nintendo Switch 2. The original spearheaded a resurgence in portable gaming thanks to the likes of Valve, Sony, and Xbox, and even upstarts like Panic and Analogue. The Switch 2 not only has to compete with its predecessor, but also a maturing market of modern handhelds.\nThe Switch 2 doesn\u2019t feel like the kind of generational leap typically associated with a new platform. When you put all of its features together \u2014 the larger display, more powerful internals, better social and sharing features, and more flexible control options \u2014 you are left with a device that is markedly better than its predecessor, but is still a step behind the latest PC handhelds in terms of pure horsepower and available games.\nBut even with real competition this time around, Nintendo is still operating largely in its own sphere. And it turns out good enough is more than good enough when you also have the biggest Mario Kart to date.\nMost Popular\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- GitHub is no longer independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Ditching my phone for an LTE smartwatch was a humbling experience"

      "text": "As far as I\u2019m concerned, 8BitDo\u2019s Pro 3 is the ultimate controller. You may already know that it makes a model literally called the Ultimate controller, but it plays second fiddle to the new Pro 3 in some key ways. It\u2019s highly customizable, allowing you to change the face buttons, joystick caps, and more.\n8BitDo\u2019s Pro 3 is a super customizable controller that\u2019s too limited on Switch 2\nA familiar design with better specs and more customization. But it doesn\u2019t check all of the boxes it should.\nA familiar design with better specs and more customization. But it doesn\u2019t check all of the boxes it should.\nLet me explain: like most other 8BitDo controllers, it\u2019s made to work on multiple platforms, but the Pro 3\u2019s swappable ABXY face buttons allow it to actually transform as needed, say, if you\u2019re going from Switch to PC, or vice versa. You can just pull off the buttons, which all but requires the included magnetic suction tool. It can\u2019t easily be done by hand, a perk for someone like me who has a baby at home. I feel comfortable knowing that they won\u2019t just pop off when my kid smacks it around.\nAnother fun addition is that you can swap the standard joystick caps in favor of bright, shiny arcade stick-like nubs. That\u2019s the first thing that I did after unboxing the controller. How essential they are to your moment-to-moment gaming will come down to taste and the types of games you want to play. Playing Soulcalibur II via the Switch Online GameCube library felt better (or at least more fun) than with other controllers. The arcade stick caps are best for games that require quick flicks. They\u2019re too slippery for games that require you to hold the sticks in a direction for a long time. I felt the need to swap them out for Switch 2 games like Donkey Kong Bananza and Mario Kart World.\nLike 2021\u2019s Pro 2 before it, the Pro 3 feels great in my medium-sized hands. It\u2019s a safe pick for those who want a reliable D-pad that\u2019s easy to reach, and who prefer the symmetrical PlayStation-style joystick layout. While I\u2019ve grown accustomed to the $84.99 Switch 2 Pro since getting the new console, there\u2019s something about the Pro 3\u2019s design that fits like a glove for me, even though it has been a long time since I last grabbed a DualShock.\nThe Pro 3 costs $69.99, a $20 price increase over the previous generation. However, its added features easily warrant the higher cost, unless you\u2019re a discerning Switch 2 player who\u2019s looking for a 1:1 matching of features with the Switch 2 Pro. I\u2019ll get into where it misses the mark below, but the Pro 3 has better trigger and stick technology. The highlights include the shift to TMR joysticks, which are improved over the already-great Hall effect sticks and are more power efficient. It also includes more accurate Hall effect triggers instead of the linear ones in its predecessor. These specs should ensure a longer lifespan than controllers that fall short by comparison.\nThe Good\n- Includes charging dock and 2.4GHz dongle\n- Highly customizable\n- Particularly comfortable for small-handed gamers\nThe Bad\n- Next-level bad rumble\n- Can\u2019t wake Switch 2\nThe Pro 2 was among the initial wave of acclaimed third-party controllers to adopt customizable back paddles, and the Pro 3 builds on that with new L4 and R4 macro buttons between the triggers and its USB-C charging port, just like on the 8BitDo Ultimate 2. I like having more buttons, and these are unobtrusive in case you\u2019re the type who expects to never touch them.\nNearly everything on the gamepad can be customized in 8BitDo\u2019s Ultimate V2 PC app. You can make up to three profiles, each with its own button assignments, joystick sensitivity, and more, and swap between them with a dedicated button located between the joysticks. Alternatively, if you just want to quickly assign a one-off command or combo to one of its extra inputs, just hold the desired button you wish to assign to, then simultaneously press the original one(s) you\u2019re copying and press the star button. It sounds complicated, but it gets easier with practice.\nIn addition to the two sets of customizable buttons and magnetically-attached face buttons, this new model also features adjustable trigger distances via two switches. Toggling the switch shortens the distance you have to push to actuate it. This feature is also available in the 8BitDo Ultimate 2.\n8BitDo\u2019s latest controller is compatible with a ton of devices via Bluetooth, including the Steam Deck, Windows PC, Mac OS, Android, Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, and other products. You can toggle between three modes as needed with a switch on its back: D input (DirectInput), X input, and S input (Switch). Both the Switch and PC also support a 2.4GHz mode, enabled by a dongle integrated into the sleek charging dock that comes with purchase. Being able to situate the charging dock wherever I liked ensured that I was able to get better wireless range than I typically get with a DualSense connected over Bluetooth to my PC.\nI\u2019ve mainly used the Pro 3 with my Switch 2. The built-in motion controls work great, but there are a couple of things holding it back from being my primary controller. Namely, its rumble effects feel imprecise and hyperactive. I really enjoy rumble, particularly in first-party Nintendo Switch games, so I was disappointed that turning it off was the only way I could enjoy playing Switch games with the Pro 3. It also can\u2019t wake the Switch 2 from standby mode, which seems like an oversight since some of 8BitDo\u2019s competitors claim to have figured it out. However, it can wake the original Switch from standby mode, as well as the Steam Deck OLED (but not the LCD model).\nThe Pro 3 isn\u2019t worth upgrading to if you have one of 8BitDo\u2019s recent controllers. But if you\u2019ve been waiting to replace your Pro 2, this new model is suitably packed with enough features to warrant the higher cost. Even for those who haven\u2019t tried this line before, this is a highly customizable gamepad that\u2019s great for multiple platforms, especially since its face buttons can be switched around. I think it\u2019s a fantastic PC controller. But if you plan to use it mainly on Switch 2, like me, its perks and cheaper price aren\u2019t appealing enough to sway me from the more feature-complete Switch 2 Pro controller.\nPhotography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\nMost Popular\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- GitHub is no longer independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes"

      "text": "If you plug the world\u2019s best-reviewed webcams into the Nintendo Switch 2 today, they won\u2019t work, while many comparatively ancient webcams do. Why? That\u2019s been a mystery for the nearly three weeks since the handheld launched. Now, two companies say they\u2019ve figured it out and are pledging to update the firmware on their cameras.\nHere\u2019s a possibly oversimplified answer: today\u2019s more powerful webcams advertise many different modes that they support to any device you connect via USB \u2014 but that\u2019s a problem because the Nintendo Switch 2 appears to be choosing modes it can\u2019t properly play.\nIn the case of Elgato, which will update its non-working Facecam MK.2 and Facecam Neo, the solve was adding an additional low-resolution 480p mode, with Elgato general manager Julian Fest speculating that the Switch can only reliably support \u201cvery low resolution\u201d cameras in order to put multiple facecams on screen.\nBut low resolution isn\u2019t the entire answer \u2014 as you\u2019d probably expect, given that Nintendo\u2019s own official Switch 2 camera is a 1080p camera that genuinely broadcasts a 1080p mode (we checked), and given it\u2019s far from the only 1080p or higher camera that works with Nintendo\u2019s new Switch.\nAccessory company Ugreen tells The Verge that the technical details of making a camera work with the console are far more nuanced than resolution, or frame rate, or whether you have the enhanced bandwidth of USB 3 or the far slower USB 2.\nNor is it enough for the camera to support a single compatible UVC (USB Video Class) mode. Instead, Ugreen spokesperson Gabrielle Wang explains by email, the camera needs to avoid advertising modes or protocols that the Switch might not recognize, or that it might attempt to use but fail, after you plug it into the console.\nUgreen says three different conditions all simultaneously need to be met for a camera to work with the Switch 2:\n- \u201cThe camera must not use the HID protocol.\u201d\n- \u201cThe camera must be configured for Isochronous transfer mode.\u201d (As opposed to Bulk, which can be more resource intensive.)\n- \u201cThe USB endpoint descriptors must not include unsupported low frame rate settings (below 30 fps).\u201d More on that one in a sec.\nUnfortunately, you\u2019re not likely to find any of those \u201cspecs\u201d on a camera\u2019s box or in its marketing materials, but but they are things you can check with a connected PC and a tool like USBView \u2014 and in so doing, we can see the camera incompatibility situation is more nuanced than a single factor.\nElgato\u2019s Facecam MK.2, for instance, already advertises isochronous modes to connected devices as far as I can tell, and it doesn\u2019t advertise an HID interface. In fact, it appears to already offer a 480p mode as well.\nBut Elgato\u2019s camera may have broken Ugreen\u2019s third theoretical rule \u2014 it tells connected devices like the Switch 2 that it\u2019s capable of running as low as 5 fps at a variety of different resolutions, according to the USB Device Descriptors I\u2019ve viewed. Ugreen says that the Switch 2 may prioritize lower settings, \u201cbut if the camera hardware cannot actually output at such low frame rates, it will cause a failure.\u201d\nElgato thinks Ugreen has that part wrong, though. \u201cUgreen is mostly correct, I think their statement around low frame rates is incorrect,\u201d Elgato\u2019s Fest told The Verge on Thursday, the day after we initially published this story. Here\u2019s Elgato\u2019s own list of Switch 2 webcam compatibility requirements:\n1. video mode 640x480 or 640x360 must be available, frame rate must be p30, codec must be YUY2\n2. USB 2.0\n3. isochronous USB transfer mode\nUgreen says its CM826 / 55512, CM797 / 45644, and CM825 / 75330 cameras will have updates by the end of June, while the CM678 / 15728, CM778 / 35626, CM717 / 25442, CM825 / 55721, and CM831 / 65381 already work.\nElgato tells us that updates for the Facecam MK.2 and Facecam Neo will be available by the end of July.\nI have to wonder if this should solely be the responsibility of camera companies \u2014 PCs, for example, don\u2019t generally have this same trouble picking from a webcam\u2019s list of supported video modes. Perhaps Nintendo will address the webcam compatibility situation, globally, with an update of its own.\nNintendo didn\u2019t have a comment for our story.\nAndrew Liszewski and Andru Marino contributed to this story.\nUpdate, June 26th: Added comments from Elgato\u2019s Julian Fest to The Verge.\nMost Popular\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- GitHub is no longer independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes"
